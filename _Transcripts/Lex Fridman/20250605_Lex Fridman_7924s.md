# Sundar Pichai: CEO of Google and Alphabet | Lex Fridman Podcast #471
**Lex Fridman:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ)
*  There was a five-year waiting list, and we got a rotary telephone, but it dramatically [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  changed our lives. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7.04s)]
*  People would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=8.94s)]
*  I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records, and it would take [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=12.96s)]
*  two hours to go, and they would say, sorry, it's not ready, come back the next day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=16.64s)]
*  Two hours to come back, and that became a five-minute thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=21.0s)]
*  So as a kid, this light bulb went in my head, this power of technology to kind of change [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=24.16s)]
*  people's lives. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=29.98s)]
*  We had no running water. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=31.22s)]
*  It was a massive drought, so they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=33.78s)]
*  per household. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=40.34s)]
*  So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that and bring it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=41.34s)]
*  back home. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=46.74s)]
*  Many years later, we had running water and we had a water heater, and you could get hot [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=49.22s)]
*  water to take a shower. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=55.38s)]
*  For me, everything was discreet like that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=59.26s)]
*  And so I've always had this thing, you know, first-stand feeling of how technology can [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=62.46s)]
*  dramatically change your life and the opportunity it brings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=68.58s)]
*  I think if freedom is actually high, at some point, all of humanity is aligned in making [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=73.66s)]
*  sure that's not the case, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=79.98s)]
*  And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=81.66s)]
*  The irony is, there is a self-modulating aspect there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=85.02s)]
*  I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  I think we can get there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=95.86s)]
*  So because of that, I think I'm optimistic on the P-Doom scenarios, but that doesn't [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=97.46s)]
*  mean I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=104.94s)]
*  But I have a lot of faith in humanity kind of rising up to meet that moment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=110.06s)]
*  Take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying, you're the wrong [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=115.78s)]
*  guy to leak Google through this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Google's lost, it's done, it's over. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=122.98s)]
*  The following is a conversation with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and Alphabet, on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=128.54s)]
*  this, the Lex Friedman podcast. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=135.06s)]
*  Your life story is inspiring to a lot of people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=138.78s)]
*  It's inspiring to me. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=140.94s)]
*  You grew up in India, whole family living in a humble two-room apartment, very little, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=142.34s)]
*  almost no access to technology. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=150.1s)]
*  And from those humble beginnings, you rose to lead a $2 trillion technology company. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=152.58s)]
*  So if you could travel back in time and told that, let's say, 12-year-old Sundar, that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=161.3s)]
*  You're now leading one of the largest companies in human history. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  What do you think that young kid would say? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  I would have probably laughed it off. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=171.5s)]
*  Probably too far-fetched to imagine or believe at that time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  You would have to explain the internet first. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=180.22s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=182.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, computers to me at that time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  I was 12 in 1984. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=186.82s)]
*  So probably, by then, I had started reading about them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=189.82s)]
*  I hadn't seen one. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=195.5s)]
*  What was that place like? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=196.5s)]
*  Take me to your childhood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=198.18s)]
*  I grew up in Chennai. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=199.18s)]
*  It's in south of India. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=201.22s)]
*  It's a beautiful bustling city. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=202.22s)]
*  Lots of people, lots of energy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=205.1s)]
*  Simple life, definitely fond memories of playing cricket outside the home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=207.66s)]
*  We just used to play on the streets. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=213.38s)]
*  All the neighborhood kids would come out and we would play until it got dark and we couldn't [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=215.62s)]
*  play anymore barefoot. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  Traffic would come. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=223.26s)]
*  We would just stop the game. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=224.7s)]
*  Everything would drive through and you would just continue playing, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=226.38s)]
*  Just to kind of get the visual in your head. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=228.94s)]
*  You know, pre-computers, there's a lot of free time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=231.26s)]
*  Now that I think about it, now you have to go and seek that quiet solitude or something. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  Newspapers, books, that's how I gained access to the world's information at the time, you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  will. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=245.94s)]
*  My grandfather was a big influence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  He worked in the post office. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=249.94s)]
*  He was so good with language. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=251.7s)]
*  His English, his handwriting till today is the most beautiful handwriting I've ever seen. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=254.33999999999997s)]
*  He would write so clearly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=260.74s)]
*  He was so articulate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=262.42s)]
*  And so he kind of got me introduced into books. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=264.82s)]
*  He loved politics. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  So we could talk about anything. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  And that was there in my family throughout. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=272.86s)]
*  So lots of books, trashy books, good books, everything from Ayn Rand to books on philosophy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=275.14s)]
*  to stupid crime novels. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=282.9s)]
*  So books was a big part of my life, but that kind of, the soul, it's not surprising I ended [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=285.38s)]
*  up at Google because Google's mission kind of always resonated deeply with me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=290.78s)]
*  This access to knowledge, I was hungry for it, but definitely have fond memories of my [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=295.06s)]
*  childhood. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=300.58s)]
*  Access to knowledge was there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=302.14s)]
*  So that's the wealth we had. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=303.94s)]
*  Every aspect of technology, I had to wait for a while. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  I've obviously spoken before about how long it took for us to get a phone, about five [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=309.9s)]
*  years, but it's not the only thing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=313.78s)]
*  A telephone. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  There was a five-year waiting list and we got a rotary telephone, but it dramatically [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  changed our lives. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=323.7s)]
*  People would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=325.58s)]
*  I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records and it would take [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=329.7s)]
*  two hours to go and they would say, sorry, it's not ready, come back the next day. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=333.3s)]
*  Two hours to come back. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=337.66s)]
*  And that became a five-minute thing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=339.22s)]
*  So as a kid, this light bulb went in my head, this power of technology to kind of change [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=341.38s)]
*  people's lives. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=346.66s)]
*  We had no running water. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=347.66s)]
*  It was a massive drought. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=350.46s)]
*  So they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets per household. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=352.86s)]
*  So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that and bring it [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=358.28s)]
*  back home. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=363.44s)]
*  Many years later, we had running water and we had a water heater and you could get hot [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  water to take a shower. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=372.08s)]
*  So for me, everything was discreet like that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=375.52s)]
*  And so I've always had this first-stand feeling of how technology can dramatically change [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=379.11999999999995s)]
*  your life and the opportunity it brings. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=387.92s)]
*  So that was kind of a subliminal takeaway for me throughout growing up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  And I kind of actually observed it and felt it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=396.56s)]
*  So we had to convince my dad for a long time to get a VCR. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you know what a VCR is? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=405.88s)]
*  I'm trying to date you now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=409.04s)]
*  Before that, you only had like kind of one TV channel, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=412.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  And so you can watch movies or something like that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=420.68s)]
*  But this was by the time I was in 12th grade, we got a VCR. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=423.56s)]
*  You know, it was like a Panasonic, which we had to go to some like shop, which had kind [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=427.44s)]
*  of smuggled it in, I guess. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's where we bought a VCR. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=434.56s)]
*  But then being able to record like a World Cup football game and then or like get bootleg [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=436.68s)]
*  videotapes and watch movies, like all that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=443.88s)]
*  So like, you know, I had these discrete memories growing up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=447.0s)]
*  And so, you know, always left me with the feeling of like how getting access to technology [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=450.12s)]
*  drives that step change in your life. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=456.0s)]
*  I don't think you'll ever be able to equal the first time you get hot water. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=458.4s)]
*  To have that convenience of going and opening a tap and have hot water come out. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=462.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=467.04s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=468.04s)]
*  We take for granted the progress we've made. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=469.04s)]
*  If you look at human history, just those plots that look at GDP across 2000 years, and you [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  see that exponential growth to where most of the progress happened since the Industrial [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=479.0s)]
*  Revolution. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  And we just take for granted, we forget how far we've gone. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  So our ability to understand how great we have it and also how quickly technology can [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=487.92s)]
*  improve is quite poor. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I mean, it's extraordinary. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  I go back to India now, the power of mobile. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=498.88s)]
*  You know, it's mind blowing to see the progress through the arc of time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=501.92s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=506.04s)]
*  What advice would you give to young folks listening to this all over the world who look [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=507.48s)]
*  up to you and find your story inspiring? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=512.9s)]
*  Who want to be maybe the next Sundar Pichai? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=517.64s)]
*  Who want to start, create companies, build something that has a lot of impact in the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=519.64s)]
*  world? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=524.36s)]
*  Look, you have a lot of luck along the way, but you obviously have to make smart choices. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=525.36s)]
*  You're thinking about what you want to do. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  Your brain is telling you something. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=531.12s)]
*  But when you do things, I think it's important to kind of get that, listen to your heart [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=533.52s)]
*  and see whether you actually enjoy doing it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=538.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=540.48s)]
*  If you love what you do, it's so much easier and you're going to see the best version of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=542.48s)]
*  yourself. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=549.6s)]
*  It's easier said than done. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=550.84s)]
*  I think it's tough to find things you love doing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=552.12s)]
*  But I think kind of listening to your heart a bit more than your mind in terms of figuring [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  out what you want to do, I think is one of the best things I would tell people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=560.84s)]
*  The second thing is, I mean, trying to work with people who you feel at various points [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=566.56s)]
*  in my life, I've worked with people who I felt were better than me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=572.12s)]
*  Kind of like, you almost are sitting in a room talking to someone and they're like, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  wow. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=581.16s)]
*  You want that feeling a few times. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=582.16s)]
*  Trying to get yourself in a position where you're working with people who you feel are [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=584.6s)]
*  kind of like stretching your abilities is what helps you grow, I think. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=591.04s)]
*  So putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=596.4s)]
*  And I think often you'll surprise yourself. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=599.72s)]
*  So I think being open-minded enough to kind of put yourself in those positions is maybe [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=601.96s)]
*  another thing I would say. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=608.08s)]
*  Well, lessons can we learn maybe from an outsider perspective, for me, looking at your story [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=609.64s)]
*  and gotten to know you a bit, you're humble, you're kind. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=614.4s)]
*  Usually when I think of somebody who has had a journey like yours and climbs to the very [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  top of leadership, they're in a cutthroat world, they're usually going to be a bit of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=622.04s)]
*  an asshole. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  So what wisdom are we supposed to draw from the fact that your general approach is of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=629.88s)]
*  balance, of humility, of kindness, listening to everybody? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=636.12s)]
*  What's your secret? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  I do get angry. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  I do get frustrated. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  I have the same emotions all of us do, right, in the context of work and everything. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  But a few things, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=650.4s)]
*  I think over time I figured out the best way to get the most out of people. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=651.76s)]
*  You kind of find mission-oriented people who are on the shared journey, who have this inner [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=660.68s)]
*  drive to excellence, to do the best. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=666.4s)]
*  And you kind of motivate people and you can achieve a lot that way, right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=670.28s)]
*  And so it often tends to work out that way. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=676.84s)]
*  But have there been times like, you know, I lose it? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=680.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, maybe less often than others. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=682.92s)]
*  And maybe over the years, less and less so, because, you know, I find it's not needed [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=686.88s)]
*  to achieve what you need to do. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=693.56s)]
*  So losing your shit has not been productive. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=695.64s)]
*  Yeah, less often than not. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=697.6s)]
*  I think people respond to that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=699.16s)]
*  They may do stuff to react to that, like, but you actually want them to do the right [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=701.76s)]
*  thing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=705.16s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe there's a bit of like sports, you know, I'm a sports fan in football, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=706.52s)]
*  coaches in soccer, duck football. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, people often talk about like man management, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=717.04s)]
*  Great coaches too, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=720.24s)]
*  I think there is an element of that in our lives. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=722.04s)]
*  How do you get the best out of the people you work with? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=724.84s)]
*  You know, at times you're working with people who are so committed to achieving. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  If they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=732.44s)]
*  So you treat them differently than, you know, occasionally there are people who you need [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  to clearly let them know, like that wasn't okay or whatever it is. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=741.94s)]
*  But I've often found that not to be the case. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=745.24s)]
*  And sometimes the right words at the right time, spoken firmly, can reverberate through [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=748.32s)]
*  time. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  Also sometimes the unspoken words. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=756.2800000000001s)]
*  People can sometimes see that, like, you know, you're unhappy without you saying it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  And so sometimes the silence can deliver that message even more. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=764.1999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes less is more. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  Who's the greatest soccer player of all time? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=770.2399999999999s)]
*  Messi or Ronaldo or Prele or Maradona? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to make, you know, in this question. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=775.68s)]
*  Is this going to be a political answer? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=777.5999999999999s)]
*  I will tell the truthful answer. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=780.28s)]
*  So it's Messi. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=781.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's been interesting because my son is a big Cristiano Ronaldo fan. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=784.88s)]
*  And so we've had to watch El Clásico together, you know, with that dynamic in there. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  I so admire CR7s. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=797.76s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen an athlete more committed to that kind of excellence. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  And so he's one of the all-time greats. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=805.08s)]
*  But you know, for me, Messi is it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=808.08s)]
*  Yeah, when I see Leon Messi, you just are in awe that humans are able to achieve that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  level of greatness and genius and artistry. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=817.24s)]
*  When we talk, we'll talk about AI, maybe robotics and this kind of stuff. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  That level of genius, I'm not sure you can possibly match by AI in a long time. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just an example of greatness. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  And you have that kind of greatness in other disciplines. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=831.04s)]
*  But in sport, you get to visually see it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=833.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't like anything else. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=837.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, just the timing, the movement. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=839.16s)]
*  This is genius. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=841.8s)]
*  I had the chance to see him a couple of weeks ago. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=843.8s)]
*  He played in San Jose against the Quakes. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=845.92s)]
*  So I went to see it, see the game. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=850.04s)]
*  I was a fan of the... [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=852.4s)]
*  I had good seats, knew where he would play in the second half, hopefully. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  And even at his age, just watching him when he gets the ball, that movement. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, you're right, that special quality. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=862.04s)]
*  It's tough to describe, but you feel it when you see it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=864.68s)]
*  He's still got it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=868.16s)]
*  If we rank all the technological innovations throughout human history, let's go back. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=870.8s)]
*  Maybe the history of human civilizations, 12,000 years ago. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=877.4s)]
*  And you rank them by the... [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=881.52s)]
*  How much of a productivity multiplier they've been. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=884.24s)]
*  So we can go to electricity or the labor mechanization of the industrial revolution, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=887.0s)]
*  or we can go back to the first agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=893.16s)]
*  In that long list of inventions, do you think AI, when history is written [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=897.8s)]
*  a thousand years from now, do you think it has a chance to be the number one productivity multiplier? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=903.12s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  Look, many years ago, I think it might've been 2017 or 2018. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=909.12s)]
*  I said at the time, AI is the most profound technology humanity will ever work on. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=913.28s)]
*  It'll be more profound than fire or electricity. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=918.88s)]
*  So I have to back myself. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  I still think that's the case. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=923.88s)]
*  When you asked this question, I was thinking, well, do we have a recency bias? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=926.92s)]
*  Like in sports, it's very tempting to call the current person you're seeing the greatest player. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=931.36s)]
*  And so is there a recency bias? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  And I do think from first principles, I would argue AI will be bigger than all of those. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=941.04s)]
*  I didn't live through those moments. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=949.52s)]
*  Two years ago, I had to go through a surgery and then I processed that there was a point [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=952.24s)]
*  in time people didn't have anesthesia when they went through these procedures. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=955.84s)]
*  At that moment, I was like, that has got to be the greatest invention humanity has ever done. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  Look, we don't know what it is to have lived through those times. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  But many of what you're talking about were kind of this general [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=971.2s)]
*  things which pretty much affected everything, electricity or internet, et cetera. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=976.4s)]
*  But I don't think we've ever dealt with the technology, both which is progressing so fast, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=981.28s)]
*  becoming so capable. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=987.28s)]
*  It's not clear what the ceiling is. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=989.6s)]
*  And the main unique, it's recursively self-improving, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=993.28s)]
*  It's capable of that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=997.6s)]
*  And so the fact it is going, it's the first technology will kind of dramatically [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=999.68s)]
*  dramatically accelerate creation itself, like creating things, building new things, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1005.52s)]
*  can improve and achieve things on its own, right? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1012.32s)]
*  I think like puts it in a different league, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1015.84s)]
*  And so, different league. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I think the impact it will end up having will far surpass everything we've seen before. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, with that comes a lot of important things to think and wrestle with, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1028.72s)]
*  but I definitely think that'll end up being the case. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  Especially if it gets to the point of where we can achieve superhuman performance on the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1035.36s)]
*  AI research itself. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1039.4399999999998s)]
*  So it's a technology that may, it's an open question, but it may be able to achieve a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  level to where the technology itself can create itself better than it could yesterday. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like the move 37 of alpha research or whatever it is, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1053.04s)]
*  Like, you know, and when, yeah, you're right, when it can do novel, self-directed research, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  obviously for a long time, we'll have hopefully always humans in the loop and all that stuff. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1064.96s)]
*  And these are complex questions to talk about. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1070.4s)]
*  But yes, I think the underlying technology, you know, I've said this, like if you watched [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1073.28s)]
*  seeing alpha go, start from scratch, be clueless and like become better through the course of a day, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1078.64s)]
*  you know, like, you know, kind of like, you know, really it hits you when you see that happen. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1087.92s)]
*  Even our like the VO3 models, if you sample the models when they were like 30% done and 60% done [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1093.68s)]
*  and looked at what they were generating. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1099.84s)]
*  And you kind of see how it all comes together. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1102.96s)]
*  It's kind of like, I would say, kind of inspiring, a little bit unsettling, right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  As a human. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  So all of that is true, I think. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1113.6s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing of the industrial revolution, electricity, like you mentioned, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1115.52s)]
*  you can go back to the, again, the agriculture, the first agricultural revolution, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1120.56s)]
*  there's what's called the Neolithic package or the first agricultural revolution. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1125.6s)]
*  It wasn't just that the nomads settled down and started planting food, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1131.28s)]
*  but all this other kinds of technology was born from that and is included in this package. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1137.52s)]
*  So it wasn't one piece of technology. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  It's there's these ripple effects, second and third order effects that happen, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1145.28s)]
*  everything from something silly, like silly, profound, like pottery, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1149.2s)]
*  that can store liquids and food to something we kind of take for granted, but social hierarchies [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1153.44s)]
*  and political hierarchy. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1161.92s)]
*  So like early government was formed because it turns out if humans stop moving [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  and have some surplus food, they start coming up with, they get bored and they start coming [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1169.2s)]
*  up with interesting systems and then trade emerges, which turns out to be a really profound thing. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1174.56s)]
*  And like I said, government, I mean, there's just a second and third order effects from that, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  including that package is incredible and probably extremely difficult. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1186.1599999999999s)]
*  If you ask one of the people in the nomadic tribes to predict that, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  that would be impossible. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  It's difficult to predict, but all that said, what do you think are some of the early things [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1195.28s)]
*  we might see in the quote unquote AI package? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1202.24s)]
*  I mean, most of it probably we don't know today, but like, you know, the one thing which we can [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1206.08s)]
*  tangibly start seeing now is, you know, obviously with the coding progress, you got a sense of it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1210.96s)]
*  It's going to be so easy to imagine, like thoughts in your head, translating that into things that [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1218.16s)]
*  exist, that'll be part of the package, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1223.92s)]
*  It's going to empower almost all of humanity to kind of express themselves. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1227.04s)]
*  Maybe in the past, you could have expressed with words, but like, you could kind of build things [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  into existence, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1240.4s)]
*  You know, maybe not fully today. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1241.84s)]
*  We are at the early stages of pipe coding. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1243.92s)]
*  You know, I've been amazed at what people have put out online with VO3, but it takes a bit of work, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1246.72s)]
*  right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1251.04s)]
*  You have to stitch together a set of prompts, but all this is going to get better. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1251.2s)]
*  The thing I always think about, this is the worst it'll ever be, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1256.8s)]
*  Like at any given moment in time. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1260.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting you went there as kind of a first thought, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1261.84s)]
*  sort of an exponential increase of access to creativity. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  Software creation. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1271.76s)]
*  Are you creating a program, a piece of content for it to be shared with others? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1274.64s)]
*  Games down the line, all of that, like just becomes infinitely more possible. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1280.48s)]
*  Well, I think the big thing is that it makes it accessible. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1285.6s)]
*  It unlocks the cognitive capabilities of the entire 8 billion. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1289.1999999999998s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1293.04s)]
*  Think about 40 years ago, maybe in the US, there were five people who could do what you were doing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  Like go do an interview, you know? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  But today, think about with YouTube and other products, etc. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1304.6399999999999s)]
*  Like how many more people are doing it? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1308.7199999999998s)]
*  So I think this is what technology does, right? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1311.9199999999998s)]
*  Like when the internet created blogs, you know, you heard from so many more people. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1314.72s)]
*  So I think, but with the AI, I think that number won't be in the few hundreds of thousands. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1320.16s)]
*  It'll be tens of millions of people, maybe even a billion people, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  like putting out things into the world in a deeper way. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1332.88s)]
*  And I think it'll change the landscape of creativity. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1337.2s)]
*  And it makes a lot of people nervous. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1340.24s)]
*  Like, for example, whatever, Fox, MSNBC, CNN are really nervous about this part. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1341.6s)]
*  You mean this dude in a suit could just do this? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1348.24s)]
*  And YouTube and thousands of others, tens of thousands, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1351.76s)]
*  millions of other creators can do the same kind of thing. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1355.36s)]
*  That makes them nervous. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1357.52s)]
*  And now you get a podcast from NoBookLM. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1358.9599999999998s)]
*  That's about five to 10 times better than any podcast I've ever done. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1362.56s)]
*  Not true. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1366.24s)]
*  But I'm joking at this time, but maybe not. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1367.28s)]
*  And that changes. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1369.6s)]
*  You have to evolve because I, on the podcasting front, I'm a fan of podcasts [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1370.32s)]
*  much more than I am a fan of being a host or whatever. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1376.1599999999999s)]
*  If there's great podcasts that are both AIs, I'll just stop doing this podcast. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1379.76s)]
*  I'll listen to that podcast, but you have to evolve and you have to change. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  And that makes people really nervous, I think. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1387.12s)]
*  But it's also a really exciting future. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1389.28s)]
*  The one thing I may say is I do think like in a world in which there are two AI, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1391.36s)]
*  I think people value and choose just like in chess. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1395.76s)]
*  You and I would never watch Stockfish 10 or whatever, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1402.48s)]
*  and AlphaGo play against each other. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1405.6s)]
*  It would be boring for us to watch. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1407.6s)]
*  But Magnus Carlsen and Gukesh, that game would be much more fascinating to watch. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1410.08s)]
*  So it's tough to say. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  One way to say is you'll have a lot more content. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1416.4s)]
*  And so you will be listening to AI-generated content [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1419.68s)]
*  because sometimes it's efficient, et cetera. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1422.24s)]
*  But the premium experiences you value might be a version of like the human essence, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1424.16s)]
*  wherever it comes through. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1430.5600000000002s)]
*  Going back to what we talked earlier about watching Messi dribble the ball. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1431.92s)]
*  I don't know, one day I'm sure a machine will dribble much better than Messi. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1435.44s)]
*  But I don't know whether it would evoke that same emotion in us. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1439.2s)]
*  So I think that'll be fascinating to see. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1442.48s)]
*  I think the element of podcasting or audiobooks that is about information gathering, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1444.48s)]
*  that part might be removed or that might be more efficiently and in a compelling way done by AI. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1453.04s)]
*  But then it'll be just nice to hear humans struggle with the information, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1460.8s)]
*  contend with the information, try to internalize it, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1465.92s)]
*  combine it with the complexity of our own emotions and consciousness and all that kind of stuff. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1468.8s)]
*  But if you actually want to find out about a piece of history, you go to Gemini. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1473.04s)]
*  If you want to see Lex struggle with that history, or other humans, you look at that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1479.36s)]
*  But the point is it's going to change the nature, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1486.56s)]
*  continue to change the nature of how we discover information, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1490.72s)]
*  how we consume the information, how we create the information. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1493.76s)]
*  The same way that YouTube changed everything completely, changed news. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1496.32s)]
*  And that's something our society is struggling with. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1500.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1503.12s)]
*  YouTube enabled, I mean, you know this better than anyone else, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1503.44s)]
*  it's enabled so many creators. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1507.2s)]
*  There is no doubt in me that we will enable more filmmakers than there have ever been. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1510.0800000000002s)]
*  You're going to empower a lot more people. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1516.0800000000002s)]
*  So I think there is an expansionary aspect of this, which is underestimated, I think. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1519.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it'll unleash human creativity in a way that hasn't been seen before. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1525.44s)]
*  It's tough to internalize. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1530.4s)]
*  The only way is if you brought someone from the 50s or 40s and just put them in front of YouTube, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1532.64s)]
*  you know, I think it would blow their mind away. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1538.08s)]
*  Similarly, I think we would get blown away by what's possible in a 10 to 20 year time frame. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1540.56s)]
*  Do you think there's a future, how many years out is it that, let's say, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1545.36s)]
*  let's put a marker on it, 50% of content, good content, 50% of good content is generated by [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1548.9599999999998s)]
*  VO 456? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1557.28s)]
*  You know, I think it depends on what it is for. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1559.52s)]
*  Like, you know, maybe if you look at movies today with CGI, there are great filmmakers. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1562.32s)]
*  You still look at who the directors are and who use it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1569.6799999999998s)]
*  There are filmmakers who don't use it at all. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1572.72s)]
*  You value that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1575.1999999999998s)]
*  There are people who use it incredibly. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1576.56s)]
*  You know, think about somebody like a James Cameron, like what he would do with these [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  tools in his hands. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think there'll be a lot more content created, like just like writers today use Google Docs [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1584.32s)]
*  and not think about the fact that they're using a tool like that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1589.44s)]
*  People will be using the future versions of these things. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1593.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, it won't be a big deal at all to them. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1596.96s)]
*  I've gotten a chance to get to know Darren Aronofsky. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1600.64s)]
*  Well, he's been really leaning in and trying to figure it's fun to watch a genius who came up [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1603.7600000000002s)]
*  before any of this was even remotely possible. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1611.5200000000002s)]
*  He created Pie, one of my favorite movies. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1614.88s)]
*  From there, just continued to create a really interesting variety of movies. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  And now he's trying to see how can AI be used to create compelling films. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1620.88s)]
*  You have people like that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1626.24s)]
*  You have people I've gotten to just know, edgier folks. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  They're AI first, like Doar Brothers. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1632.56s)]
*  Both Aronofsky and Doar Brothers create at the edge of the Overton window of society. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1635.2s)]
*  You know, they push whether it's sexuality or violence. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1641.28s)]
*  It's edgy, like artists are, but it's still classy. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1646.96s)]
*  It doesn't cross that line. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1649.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever that line is. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1652.24s)]
*  You know, Hunter S. Thompson has this line that the only way to find out where the edge, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1653.44s)]
*  where the line is, is by crossing it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1660.64s)]
*  And I think for artists, that's true. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1663.2s)]
*  That's kind of their purpose sometimes. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1664.64s)]
*  Comedians and artists just cross that line. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1666.16s)]
*  I wonder if you can comment on the weird place that puts Google. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1668.96s)]
*  Because Google's line is probably different than some of these artists. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  What's your, how do you think about specifically Vio and Flow about how to allow artists to do crazy shit? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1678.24s)]
*  But also the responsibility of not for it not to be too crazy. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1687.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a great question. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  Look, part of, you mentioned Darren, you know, he's a clear visionary, right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1695.04s)]
*  Part of the reason we started working with him early on Vio is he's one of those people who's able to kind of see that future get inspired by it and kind of showing the way for how creative people can express themselves with it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1699.2s)]
*  Look, I think when it comes to allowing artistic free expression, that's one of the most important values in a society, right? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1718.4s)]
*  I think artists have always been the ones to push boundaries, expand the frontiers of thought. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1725.84s)]
*  And so, look, I think that's going to be an important value we have. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1734.24s)]
*  So I think we will provide tools and put it in the hands of artists for them to use and put out their work. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1739.6s)]
*  Those APIs, I mean, I almost think of that as infrastructure. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1749.84s)]
*  Just like when you provide electricity to people or something, you want them to use it and like you're not thinking about the use cases on top of it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1754.0800000000002s)]
*  It's a paintbrush. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1760.48s)]
*  Yeah. And so I think that's how, obviously, there have to be some things and, you know, society needs to decide at a fundamental level what's okay, what's not, we'll be responsible with it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  But I do think, you know, when it comes to artistic free expression, I think that's one of those values we should work hard to defend. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you can comment on maybe earlier versions of Gemini, where we were a little bit careful on the kind of things you would be willing to answer. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1784.3200000000002s)]
*  I just want to comment on, I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the fact that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a lot less careful in a good sense. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1795.36s)]
*  Don't ask me why, but I've been doing a lot of research on Genghis Khan and the Estax. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1805.12s)]
*  So there's a lot of violence there in that history. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1811.52s)]
*  It's a very violent history. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1814.16s)]
*  I've also been doing a lot of research on World War I and World War II. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1815.44s)]
*  And earlier versions of Gemini were very, basically this kind of sense. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  Are you sure you want to learn about this? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1824.32s)]
*  And now it's actually very factual, objective, talks about very difficult parts of human history and does so with nuance and depth. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1826.8s)]
*  It's been really nice. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1836.24s)]
*  But there's a line there that I guess Google has to kind of walk. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1837.52s)]
*  I wonder if it's also an engineering challenge, how to do that at scale across all the weird queries that people ask. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  Can you just speak to that challenge? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1848.8s)]
*  How do you allow Gemini to say, again, forgive, pardon my French, crazy shit, but not too crazy? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1851.36s)]
*  I think one of the good insights here has been as the models are getting more capable, the models are really good at this stuff. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1859.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. And so I think in some ways, maybe a year ago, the models weren't fully there. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  So they would also do stupid things more often. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1873.76s)]
*  And so you're trying to handle those edge cases, but then you make a mistake in how you handle those edge cases and it compounds. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1877.28s)]
*  But I think with 2.5, what we particularly found is once the models cross a certain level of intelligence and sophistication, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1886.24s)]
*  they are able to reason through these nuanced issues pretty well. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1893.92s)]
*  And I think users really want that. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1897.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, you want as much access to the raw model as possible. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1903.68s)]
*  I think it's a great area to think about. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1904.72s)]
*  Like, over time, we should allow more and more closer access to it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1906.48s)]
*  Maybe, obviously, let people custom prompts if they wanted to and experiment with it, etc. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's an important direction. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1921.44s)]
*  But look, the first principles we want to think about it is, from a scientific standpoint, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1923.84s)]
*  making sure the models, and I'm saying scientific in the sense of how you would approach math or physics or something like that, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1930.56s)]
*  from first principles, having the models reason about the world, be nuanced, etc. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1936.56s)]
*  From the ground up is the right way to build these things. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1944.8s)]
*  Right. Not some subset of humans kind of hard coding things on top of it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1947.44s)]
*  So I think it's the direction we've been taking. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1954.48s)]
*  And I think you'll see us continue to push in that direction. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1957.28s)]
*  Yeah, I actually asked, I gave these notes, I took extensive notes, and I gave them to Gemini and said, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1960.24s)]
*  can you ask a novel question that's not in these notes? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1966.24s)]
*  And it wrote, Gemini continues to really surprise me. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1970.72s)]
*  Really surprise me. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1975.28s)]
*  It's been really beautiful. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1976.32s)]
*  It's an incredible model. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1977.52s)]
*  The question it generated was, you, meaning Sundar, told the world Gemini is churning out 480 trillion tokens a month. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1980.56s)]
*  What's the most life changing five word sentence hiding in that haystack? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1990.32s)]
*  That's a Gemini question. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1994.72s)]
*  But it gave me a sense, I don't think you can answer that, but it gave me, it woke me up to like, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1996.48s)]
*  all of these tokens are providing little aha moments for people across the globe. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2001.76s)]
*  So that's like learning that those tokens are, people are curious, they ask a question, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  and they find something out. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2013.76s)]
*  And it truly could be life changing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2015.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2017.28s)]
*  Look, I had the same feeling about search many, many years ago. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  You definitely, this tokens per month has grown 50 times in the last 12 months. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2022.8000000000002s)]
*  Is that accurate, by the way? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2028.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2029.92s)]
*  It is accurate. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2031.28s)]
*  I'm glad it got it right. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2032.16s)]
*  But that number was 9.7 trillion tokens per month 12 months ago. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2034.88s)]
*  It's gone up to 480. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2040.64s)]
*  It's a 50X increase. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2042.72s)]
*  So there's no limit to human curiosity. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2044.96s)]
*  And I think it's one of those moments. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2048.4s)]
*  Maybe I don't think it is there today, but maybe one day there's a five word phrase [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2051.92s)]
*  which says what the actual universe is or something like that and something very meaningful, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2057.92s)]
*  but I don't think we are quite there yet. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2062.4s)]
*  Do you think the scaling laws are holding strong on? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2064.96s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to describe the scaling laws for AI, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2069.68s)]
*  but on the pre-training, on the post-training fronts. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2072.32s)]
*  So the flip side of that, do you anticipate AI progress will hit a wall? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  Is there a wall? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2080.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a cherished micro kitchen conversation once in a while. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2082.0800000000004s)]
*  Like when Demis is visiting or if Demis, Korai, Jeff, Nome, Sergey, a bunch of our people, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2087.36s)]
*  like we sit and talk about this. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2093.76s)]
*  We see a lot of headroom ahead. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  I think we've been able to optimize and improve on all fronts. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2102.6400000000003s)]
*  Pre-training, post-training, test time compute, tool use over time, making these more agentic. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2108.88s)]
*  So getting these models to be more general world models in that direction like VO3, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2117.92s)]
*  the physics understanding is dramatically better than what VO1 or something like that was. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2124.32s)]
*  So you kind of see on all those dimensions, I feel progress is very obvious to see. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2130.2400000000002s)]
*  And I feel like there is significant headroom. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2137.2000000000003s)]
*  More importantly, I'm fortunate to work with some of the best researchers on the planet. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2143.04s)]
*  They think there is more headroom to be had here. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2149.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I think we have an exciting trajectory ahead. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2153.44s)]
*  It's tougher to say, each year I sit and say, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  okay, we're going to throw 10x more compute over the course of next year at it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2160.7200000000003s)]
*  And like, will we see progress? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2164.08s)]
*  Sitting here today, I feel like the year ahead will have a lot of progress. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2167.44s)]
*  And do you feel any limitations like that, or the bottlenecks, compute limited, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2171.1200000000003s)]
*  data limited, idea limited, do you feel any of those limitations? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2177.76s)]
*  Or is it full steam ahead and off runs? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2181.44s)]
*  I think it's compute limited in this sense, right? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2183.84s)]
*  Like, you know, we can all, part of the reason you've seen us do [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2186.0s)]
*  flash, nano flash and pro models, but not an ultra model. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2189.44s)]
*  It's like for each generation, we feel like we've been able to get the pro model at like, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2194.56s)]
*  I don't know, 80, 90% of ultra capability, but ultra would be a lot more, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2200.16s)]
*  like, slow and a lot more expensive to sell. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2208.4s)]
*  But what we've been able to do is to go to the next generation and make the next generation's pro [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2211.44s)]
*  as good as the previous generation's ultra, but be able to serve it in a way that it's fast and [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2216.96s)]
*  you can use it and so on. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2222.08s)]
*  So I do think scaling laws are working, but it's tough to get at any given time, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2224.08s)]
*  the models we all use the most, is maybe like a few months behind the maximum capability we can deliver. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2230.96s)]
*  Right? Because that won't be the fastest, easiest to use, etc. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2239.76s)]
*  Also, that's in terms of intelligence, it becomes harder and harder to measure [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2244.5600000000004s)]
*  performance in quotes, because, you know, you could argue Gemini flash [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2249.5200000000004s)]
*  is much more impactful than pro, just because of the latency is super intelligent already. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2254.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, sometimes like latency is maybe more important than intelligence, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2261.36s)]
*  especially when the intelligence is just a little bit less and flash not, it's still incredibly smart model. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2266.56s)]
*  Yeah. And so you have to now start measuring impact and then it feels like benchmarks are less and less capable of capturing the intelligence of models, the effectiveness of models, the usefulness, the real world usefulness of models. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2271.36s)]
*  Another kitchen question. So lots of folks are talking about timelines for AGI or ASI, artificial super intelligence. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2284.72s)]
*  So AGI, loosely defined, is basically human expert level at a lot of the main fields of pursuit for humans. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2293.36s)]
*  And ASI is what AGI becomes presumably quickly by being able to self-improve. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2301.36s)]
*  So becoming far superior in intelligence across all these disciplines, the humans. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2309.36s)]
*  When do you think we'll have AGI? Is 2030 a possibility? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2313.36s)]
*  There's one other term we should throw in there. I don't know who used it first. Maybe Karpati did AGI. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2317.52s)]
*  Have you heard AGI, the artificial jagged intelligence? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2323.52s)]
*  Sometimes feels that way, right? Both there are progress and you see what they can do. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2327.52s)]
*  And then like you can trivially find they make numeric letters or like, you know, counting hours and strawberry or something which seems to trip up most models or whatever it is. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2332.56s)]
*  So maybe we should throw that term in there. I feel like we are in the AGI phase where like dramatic progress, some things don't work well, but overall, you know, you're seeing lots of progress. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2343.52s)]
*  But if your question is, will it happen by 2030? Look, we constantly move the line of what it means to be AGI. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2355.52s)]
*  There are moments today, you know, like sitting in a Waymo in a San Francisco street with all the crowds and the people and kind of work its way through. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2366.32s)]
*  I see glimpses of it there. The car is sometimes kind of impatient trying to work its way using Astra, like in Gemini Live or seeing, you know, asking questions about the world. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2374.32s)]
*  What's this skinny building doing in my neighborhood? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2386.32s)]
*  It's a street light, not a building. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2388.32s)]
*  You see glimpses. That's why I use the word AGI, because then you see stuff which obviously, you know, we are far from AGI too. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2391.1200000000003s)]
*  So you have both experiences simultaneously happening to you. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2401.1200000000003s)]
*  I'll answer your question, but I'll also throw this almost feel the term doesn't matter. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2405.1200000000003s)]
*  What I know is by 2030, there'll be such dramatic progress. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2409.1200000000003s)]
*  We'll be dealing with the consequences of that progress, both the positives, both the positive externalities and the negative externalities that come with it in a big way by 2030. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2413.92s)]
*  So that I strongly feel, right? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2425.92s)]
*  Whatever we may be arguing about the term, or maybe Gemini can answer what that moment is in time in 2030. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2427.92s)]
*  But I think the progress will be dramatic, right? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2435.92s)]
*  So that I believe in. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2437.92s)]
*  Will the AI think it has reached AGI by 2030? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2440.7200000000003s)]
*  I would say we will just fall short of that timeline, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2442.7200000000003s)]
*  So I think it will take a bit longer. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  It's amazing in the early days of Google DeepMind in 2010, they talked about a 20 year time frame to achieve AGI. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2448.7200000000003s)]
*  So which is kind of fascinating to see. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2454.7200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, for me, the whole thing, seeing what Google Brain did in 2012 and when we acquired DeepMind, I think it's been a really interesting time frame. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2456.7200000000003s)]
*  Right, so what Google Brain did in 2012 and when we acquired DeepMind in 2014, right close to where we're sitting in 2012, you know, Jeff Dean showed the image of when the neural networks could recognize a picture of a cat, right? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2467.52s)]
*  And identify it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2481.52s)]
*  You know, this is the early versions of Brain, right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2483.52s)]
*  And so, you know, we all talked about a couple of decades. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2485.52s)]
*  I don't think we'll quite get there by 2030. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2489.52s)]
*  So my sense is it's slightly after that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2491.52s)]
*  But I would stress it doesn't matter, like what that definition is. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2494.32s)]
*  Because you will have mind blowing progress on many dimensions. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2496.32s)]
*  Maybe AI can create videos. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2504.32s)]
*  We have to figure out as a society, how do we, we need some system by which we all agree that this is AI generated and we have to disclose it in a certain way because how do you distinguish reality otherwise? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2506.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many interesting things you said. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2518.32s)]
*  First of all, just looking back at this recent, now feels like distant history with Google Brain. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2521.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that was before TensorFlow, before TensorFlow was made public and open sourced. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2527.1200000000003s)]
*  So the tooling matters too. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2529.1200000000003s)]
*  Combined with GitHub ability to share code. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  Then you have the ideas of attention transformers and the diffusion now. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2533.1200000000003s)]
*  And then there might be a new idea that seems simple in retrospect, but will change everything. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2535.1200000000003s)]
*  And that could be the post training, the inference time innovations. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2537.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted this. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2539.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted this. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2541.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted this. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2543.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted this. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2545.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted this. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2547.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think Shad Sien tweeted that Google is just one great UI from completely winning the AI race. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2549.92s)]
*  Meaning like, UI is a huge part of it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2551.92s)]
*  Meaning like, UI is a huge part of it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2553.92s)]
*  Like how that intelligence, I think Logan Cooper, I think, likes to talk about this right now. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2555.92s)]
*  It's an LLM, but it becomes, like when is it going to become a system where you're talking about [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2557.92s)]
*  shipping systems versus shipping a particular model. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2559.92s)]
*  Yeah, that matters too. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2561.92s)]
*  How the system manifests itself and how it's going to be able to be used. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2563.92s)]
*  And then, you know, I think you were talking about the, like the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2565.92s)]
*  Oh, hugely so. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2568.7200000000003s)]

*  There are simple UI innovations which have changed the world, right? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2572.7200000000003s)]
*  And, uh, I absolutely think so. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  And, uh, I absolutely think so. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  And, uh, I absolutely think so. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2578.7200000000003s)]
*  We will see a lot more progress in the next couple of years. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
*  I think AI itself is a great model for AI to be able to do a lot of things, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2582.7200000000003s)]
*  I think. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  And, so, you know, I think a lot of this is going to be more, more, uh, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  more profound, uh, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2588.7200000000003s)]
*  more profound, uh, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2590.7200000000003s)]
*  more profound, uh, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2592.7200000000003s)]
*  more profound, uh, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  itself on a self-improving track for UI itself. Like today, we are [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2596.72s)]
*  constraining the models. The models can't quite express themselves in terms of [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2603.8399999999997s)]
*  the UI to people. But that is, if you think about it, we've kind [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2608.64s)]
*  of boxed them in that way. But given these models can code, they should [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2615.3199999999997s)]
*  be able to write the best interfaces to express their ideas over time. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2622.16s)]
*  That is an incredible idea. So the API is already open. You create a really [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2626.92s)]
*  nice agentic system that continuously improves the way you can be talking to an [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2633.04s)]
*  AI. But a lot of that is the interface and then of course the [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2639.0s)]
*  incredible multimodal aspect of the interface that Google has been pushing. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2644.6s)]
*  These models are natively multimodal. They can easily take content from any [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2648.48s)]
*  format, put it in any format. They can write a good user interface. They [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2652.84s)]
*  probably understand your preferences better over time. So all [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2657.68s)]
*  this is like the evolution ahead. So that goes back to where we started [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2663.4s)]
*  the conversation. I think there'll be dramatic evolutions in the years ahead. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2669.56s)]
*  Maybe one more kitchen question. This even further ridiculous concept of PDoom. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2673.32s)]
*  So the philosophically minded folks in the AI community think about the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2681.1200000000003s)]
*  probability that AGI and then ASI might destroy all of human civilization. I [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2685.7200000000003s)]
*  would say my PDoom is about 10%. Do you ever think about this kind of long-term [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2691.8s)]
*  threat of ASI and what would your PDoom be? Look, I mean for sure. Look, I've both [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2699.68s)]
*  been very excited about AI but I've always felt there's a technology, you [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2706.08s)]
*  know, you have to actively think about the risks and work very very hard to [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2712.96s)]
*  harness it in a way that it all works out well. On the PDoom question, look, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2719.0s)]
*  it's a, you know, won't surprise you to say that's probably another microkitchen [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2724.8399999999997s)]
*  conversation that pops up once in a while, right? And given how powerful the [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2728.16s)]
*  technology is, maybe stepping back, you know, when you're running a large [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2732.24s)]
*  organization, if you can kind of align the incentives of the organization, you [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  can achieve pretty much anything, right? Like, you know, if you can get kind of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2740.08s)]
*  people all marching towards like a goal in a very focused way, in a [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2743.0s)]
*  mission-driven way, you can pretty much achieve anything. But it's very tough to [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2747.8399999999997s)]
*  organize all of humanity that way. But I think if PDoom is actually high, at some [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2751.6s)]
*  point, all of humanity is like aligned in making sure that's not the case, right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2757.94s)]
*  And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think. So the irony is, so [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2762.98s)]
*  there is a self-modulating aspect there. Like, I think if humanity collectively [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2768.62s)]
*  puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, I think we can get there. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2775.2200000000003s)]
*  So because of that, you know, I think I'm optimistic on the PDoom scenarios. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2778.7400000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't mean, I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2786.82s)]
*  But I'm, you know, I have a lot of faith in humanity kind of rising up to the, to [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2792.58s)]
*  meet that moment. That's really, really well put. I mean, as the threat becomes [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2797.26s)]
*  more concrete and real, humans do really come together and get their shit [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2801.62s)]
*  together. Well, the other thing I think people don't often talk about is [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2806.54s)]
*  probability of doom without AI. So there's all these other ways that humans [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2810.1800000000003s)]
*  can destroy themselves. And it's very possible, at least I believe so, that AI [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2816.18s)]
*  will help us become smarter, kinder to each other, more efficient. It'll help [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2820.8199999999997s)]
*  more parts of the world flourish where it would be less resource constrained, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2829.7s)]
*  which is often the source of military conflict and tensions and so on. So we [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2834.02s)]
*  also have to load into that. What's the PDoom without AI? With AI, PDoom with [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2838.62s)]
*  AI, PDoom without AI. Because it's very possible that AI will be the thing that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2845.54s)]
*  saves us, saves human civilizations from all the other threats. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2849.46s)]
*  I agree with you. I think it's insightful. Look, I felt like to make [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2852.38s)]
*  progress on some of the toughest problems would be good to have AI, like [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2857.7000000000003s)]
*  pair, helping you. Right. And like, you know, so that resonates with me for [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2861.42s)]
*  sure. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2867.54s)]
*  Quick pause, bathroom break? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2868.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2869.7799999999997s)]
*  If notebook LM was the same, like what I saw today with Beam, if it was compelling [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2873.22s)]
*  in the same kind of way, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2877.98s)]
*  blew my mind. It was incredible. I didn't think it's possible. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2881.86s)]
*  I didn't think it was possible. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2885.14s)]
*  Can you imagine like the US president and the Chinese president being able to do [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2886.54s)]
*  something like Beam with the live meet translation working well. So they're both [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2890.66s)]
*  sitting and talking, make progress a bit more. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2895.74s)]
*  Yeah, just for people listening, we took a quick bathroom break and now we're [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2900.3399999999997s)]
*  talking about the demo I did. We'll probably post it somewhere, somehow, maybe [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2903.66s)]
*  here. I got a chance to experience Beam and it was, it's hard to describe it in [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2908.22s)]
*  words how real it felt with just, what is it, six cameras. It's incredible. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2915.22s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2921.62s)]
*  It's one of the toughest products of, you can't quite describe it to people. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2922.54s)]
*  Even when we show it in slides, et cetera, like you don't know what it is. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2927.3s)]
*  You have to kind of experience it. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2932.3s)]
*  On the world leaders front on politics, geopolitics, there's something really [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2934.34s)]
*  special, again, with studying World War II and how much could have been saved if [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2939.02s)]
*  Chamberlain met Stalin in person. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2944.7400000000002s)]
*  And I sometimes also struggle explaining to people, articulating why I believe [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2947.34s)]
*  meeting in person for world leaders is powerful. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2952.5s)]
*  It just seems naive to say that, but there is something there in person. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2955.82s)]
*  And with Beam, I felt that same thing. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2960.2599999999998s)]
*  And then I'm unable to explain. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2962.82s)]
*  All I kept doing is what a child does. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2966.34s)]
*  You look real. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2968.66s)]
*  You know, and I mean, I don't know if that makes meetings more productive or [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2970.58s)]
*  so on, but it certainly makes them more, the same reason you want to show up to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2975.98s)]
*  work versus remote sometimes, that human connection. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2982.26s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2985.82s)]
*  It's hard to, it's hard to put into words. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2986.78s)]
*  There's some, there's something beautiful about great teams collaborating on a [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2990.82s)]
*  thing that's, that's not captured by the productivity of that team or by whatever [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2996.66s)]
*  on paper. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3002.86s)]
*  There's some of the most beautiful moments you experience in life is at work. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3003.9s)]
*  Pursuing a difficult thing together for many months. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3007.7799999999997s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3011.98s)]
*  You're in the trenches and yeah, you do form bonds that way for sure. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3013.42s)]
*  And to be able to do that, like somewhat remotely in that same personal touch. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3017.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3021.38s)]
*  That's a deeply fulfilling thing. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3021.66s)]
*  I know a lot of people, I personally hate meetings because a significant [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3023.22s)]
*  percent of meetings when done poorly are, don't serve a clear purpose. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3027.14s)]
*  So, but that's a meeting problem. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3033.06s)]
*  That's not a communication problem. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3034.62s)]
*  If you can improve the communication for the meetings that are useful, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3037.2200000000003s)]
*  that's just incredible. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3040.98s)]
*  So yeah, I was blown away by the great engineering behind it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3041.78s)]
*  And then we get to see what impact that has. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3045.9s)]
*  That's really interesting, but just incredible engineering. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3048.2200000000003s)]
*  Really impressive. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3050.58s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3051.2200000000003s)]
*  And obviously we'll work hard over the years to make it more and more accessible. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3051.86s)]
*  But yeah, even on a personal front, outside of work meetings, you know, a [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3056.58s)]
*  grandmother who's far away from our grandchild and being able to, you know, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3060.9s)]
*  have that kind of an interaction, right? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3065.9s)]
*  All of that, I think will end up being very, nothing substitutes being in person. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3068.5s)]
*  You know, it's not always possible. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3074.02s)]
*  You know, you could be a soldier deployed, right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3075.46s)]
*  Trying to talk to your loved ones. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3078.34s)]
*  So I think, you know, so that's what inspires us. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3080.1800000000003s)]
*  When you and I. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3084.8599999999997s)]
*  Hung out last year and took a walk. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3087.58s)]
*  I remember, I don't think we talked about this, but I remember, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3090.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, outside of that, seeing dozens of articles written by analysts [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3095.18s)]
*  and experts and so on that Sundar Pichai should step down [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3098.3799999999997s)]
*  because the perception was that Google was definitively losing. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3103.14s)]
*  The AI race has lost its magic touch [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3107.8199999999997s)]
*  in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3111.42s)]
*  And now a year later, it's crazy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3116.8999999999996s)]
*  You showed this plot of all the things that were shipped over the past year. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3119.06s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3124.02s)]
*  And Gemini Pro is winning across many benchmarks and products [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3125.22s)]
*  as we sit here today. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3128.98s)]
*  So take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3129.8999999999996s)]
*  you're the wrong guy to leak Google through this. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3134.8999999999996s)]
*  Google is lost, is done. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3137.8199999999997s)]
*  It's over to today where Google is winning again. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3140.1s)]
*  What were some low points during that time? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3144.38s)]
*  Look, I. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3147.46s)]
*  I mean, lots to unpack, you know, obviously. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3150.58s)]
*  Like the main bet I made as a CEO was to really. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3155.58s)]
*  You know, make sure the company was approaching everything in a AI first way, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3161.94s)]
*  really setting ourselves up to develop AGI responsibly, right? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3166.62s)]
*  And make sure we're putting out products [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3171.3s)]
*  which embodies that things that are very, very useful for people. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3175.58s)]
*  So, look, I knew even through moments like that last year. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3180.58s)]
*  You know, I had a good sense of what we were building internally. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3186.54s)]
*  Right. So. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3191.34s)]
*  I had already made, you know, many important decisions, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3193.2200000000003s)]
*  bringing together teams of the caliber of brain and deep mind [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3197.06s)]
*  and setting up Google DeepMind. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3201.38s)]
*  There were things like we made the decision to invest in TPUs 10 years ago. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3203.98s)]
*  So we knew we were scaling up and building big models. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3209.26s)]
*  Anytime you're in a situation like that. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3213.3s)]
*  A few aspects. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3216.46s)]
*  I'm good at tuning out noise, right? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3219.6600000000003s)]
*  Separating signal from noise. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3221.82s)]
*  Do you scuba dive? Like, have you? No. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3223.54s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. Like, I'm not good at it, but I've done it a few times. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3227.3s)]
*  But sometimes you jump in the ocean. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3231.86s)]
*  It's so choppy. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3233.86s)]
*  But you go down one feet under, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3236.9s)]
*  it's the calmest thing in the entire universe. Right. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3239.54s)]
*  So there's a version of that, right? Like, you know, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3243.1800000000003s)]
*  running Google. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3248.5s)]
*  You may as well be coaching Barcelona or Real Madrid. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3250.74s)]
*  You have a bad season. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3254.9799999999996s)]
*  So there are aspects to that. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3256.3799999999997s)]
*  But, you know, like, look, I'm good at tuning out the noise. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3257.8999999999996s)]
*  I do watch out for signals. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3262.22s)]
*  You know, it's important to separate the signal from the noise. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3263.54s)]
*  So there are good people sometimes making good points outside. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3266.06s)]
*  So you want to listen to it. You want to take that feedback in. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3269.54s)]
*  But, you know, internally, like, you know, you're making a set of [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3273.9399999999996s)]
*  consequential decisions. Right. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3276.9399999999996s)]
*  There's leaders. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3279.3s)]
*  You're making a lot of decisions. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3280.82s)]
*  Many of them are, like, inconsequential. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3283.34s)]
*  It feels like, but over time, you learn that. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3286.6200000000003s)]
*  Most of the decisions you're making on a day to day basis doesn't matter. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3289.2200000000003s)]
*  Like, you have to make them and you're making them just to keep things moving. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3293.98s)]
*  But you have to make a few consequential decisions. Right. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3298.9s)]
*  And we had set up the right teams, right leaders. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3301.46s)]
*  We had world class researchers. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3309.9s)]
*  We have a training Gemini. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3312.7400000000002s)]
*  Internally, there are factors which were, for example, outside, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3315.54s)]
*  people may not have appreciated. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3317.98s)]
*  I mean, TPUs are amazing, but we had to ramp up TPUs too. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3319.9s)]
*  That took time. Right. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3324.78s)]
*  And to scale, actually having enough TPUs to get the compute needed. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3326.42s)]
*  But I could see internally the trajectory we were on. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3333.42s)]
*  And I was so excited internally about the possibility. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3337.54s)]
*  To me, this moment felt like one of the biggest opportunities ahead for us as a company. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3343.1s)]
*  That the opportunity space ahead or the next decade, next 20 years, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3348.74s)]
*  is bigger than what has happened in the past. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3352.86s)]
*  And I thought we were set up better than most companies in the world [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3356.9s)]
*  to go realize that vision. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3362.14s)]
*  I mean, you had to make some consequential bold decisions. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3364.86s)]
*  Like you mentioned the merger of deep mind and brain. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3369.98s)]
*  Maybe it's my perspective, just knowing humans. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3375.98s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot of egos involved. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3378.38s)]
*  It's very difficult to merge teams, and I'm sure there are some hard decisions to be made. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3380.82s)]
*  Can you take me through your process of how you think through that? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3385.38s)]
*  Do you go to pull the trigger and make that decision? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3388.54s)]
*  Maybe what were some painful points? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3391.46s)]
*  How do you navigate those turbulent waters? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3393.06s)]
*  Look, we were fortunate to have two world class teams. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3396.34s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3398.94s)]
*  Like it's like somebody coming and telling to you, take Stanford and MIT, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3399.62s)]
*  and then put them together and create a great department. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3404.38s)]
*  Right. And easier said than done. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3406.86s)]
*  But we were fortunate. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3410.74s)]
*  You know, phenomenal teams. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3411.66s)]
*  Both had their strengths, you know, but they were run very differently. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3413.74s)]
*  Right. Like brain was kind of a lot of diverse [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3417.7799999999997s)]
*  projects, bottoms up and out of it came a lot of important research breakthroughs. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3422.7s)]
*  DeepMind at the time had a strong vision of how you want to build AGI. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3427.9399999999996s)]
*  And so they were pursuing their direction. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3433.1s)]
*  But I think through those moments, luckily tapping into, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3436.7s)]
*  you know, Jeff had expressed a desire to be more to go back to more of a scientific [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3440.8199999999997s)]
*  individual contributor roots, you know, he felt like management [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3446.8599999999997s)]
*  was taking up too much of his time. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3450.18s)]
*  And Demis naturally, I think, you know, was running DeepMind [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3452.66s)]
*  and was a natural choice there. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3458.22s)]
*  But I think it was you're right. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3461.14s)]
*  You know, it took us a while to bring the teams together. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3462.62s)]
*  Credit to Demis, Jeff, Corai, all the great people there. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3465.06s)]
*  They worked super hard to combine the best of both worlds. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3469.58s)]
*  When you set up that team, a few sleepless nights here and there, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3474.18s)]
*  as we put that thing together, we were patient in how we did it. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3477.94s)]
*  So that it works well for the long term. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3482.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. And and some of that in that moment, I think, yes, with things moving fast, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3486.42s)]
*  I think you definitely felt the pressure. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3492.7s)]
*  But I think we pulled off that transition well. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3495.58s)]
*  And, you know, I think I think, you know, they were obviously [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3498.14s)]
*  doing incredible work and there's a lot more incredible things [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3502.94s)]
*  I had coming from them. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3505.5s)]
*  Like we talked about, you have a very calm, even tempered, respectful Demir. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3506.8199999999997s)]
*  During that time, whether it's the merger or just dealing with the noise, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3511.42s)]
*  were there times where frustration boiled over? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3518.7s)]
*  Like, did you [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3522.02s)]
*  have to go a bit more intense on everybody than you usually would? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3524.58s)]
*  Probably, you know, probably. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3528.34s)]
*  You're right. I think I think in the sense that, you know, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3530.22s)]
*  there was a moment where we were all driving hard. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3532.66s)]
*  But when you're in the trenches working with passion, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3534.7799999999997s)]
*  you're going to have days, right? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3537.98s)]
*  You disagree, you argue, but like all that, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3540.38s)]
*  I mean, just part of the course of working intensely. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3544.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. And, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3548.6600000000003s)]
*  all of us are doing what we are doing because the impact it can have. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3552.7000000000003s)]
*  We are motivated by it. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3557.1s)]
*  It's like, you know, for many of us, this has been a long term [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3559.1s)]
*  journey. And so it's been super exciting. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3563.42s)]
*  The positive moments far outweigh the kind of stressful moments. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3566.54s)]
*  Just early this year, I had a chance to celebrate back to back over two days, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3570.42s)]
*  like, you know, Nobel Prize for Jeff Fintan and the next day, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3576.5s)]
*  a Nobel Prize for Demis and John Jumper. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3579.82s)]
*  You know, you worked with people like that. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3583.7000000000003s)]
*  All that is super inspiring. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3585.7000000000003s)]
*  Is there something like with you where you had to like put your foot down, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3587.5800000000004s)]
*  maybe with less versus more? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3591.94s)]
*  Or like, I'm the CEO and we're doing this. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3595.6600000000003s)]
*  To my earlier point about consequential decisions you make, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3601.1400000000003s)]
*  there are decisions you make people can disagree pretty vehemently. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3604.46s)]
*  And but at some point, like, you know, you make a clear decision [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3608.0600000000004s)]
*  and you just ask people to commit. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3613.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. Like, you know, you can disagree, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3616.98s)]
*  but it's time to disagree and commit so that we can get moving. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3619.7400000000002s)]
*  And that it's putting the foot down or, you know, like, you know, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  it's a natural part of what all of us have to do. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3627.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I think you can do that calmly and be very firm in the direction [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3630.02s)]
*  you're making the decision. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3634.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think if you're clear, actually, people over time respect that. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3636.7s)]
*  Right. Like, you know, if you can make decisions with clarity, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3640.66s)]
*  I find it very effective in meetings where you're making such decisions [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3643.8599999999997s)]
*  to hear everyone out. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3648.8999999999996s)]
*  I think it's important when you can to hear everyone out. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3650.98s)]
*  Sometimes what you're hearing actually influences how you think about [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3655.14s)]
*  and you're wrestling with it and making a decision. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3658.62s)]
*  Sometimes you have a clear conviction and you state so, look, I. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3661.38s)]
*  I, you know, this is how I feel and, you know, this is my conviction. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3666.7000000000003s)]
*  And you kind of place the bet and you move on. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3670.82s)]
*  Are there big decisions like that? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3673.18s)]
*  I'm kind of intuitively assume the merger was the big one. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3675.02s)]
*  I think that was a very important decision, you know, for the company to [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3679.5s)]
*  to meet the moment. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3684.34s)]
*  I think we had to make sure we were we were doing that and doing that well. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3685.34s)]
*  I think that was a consequential decision. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3689.86s)]
*  There were many other things. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3691.78s)]
*  We set up a infrastructure team [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3692.86s)]
*  like to really go meet the moment to scale up the compute we needed to [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3695.82s)]
*  and really brought teams from disparate parts of the company [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3700.3s)]
*  kind of created it to to move forward. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3704.0200000000004s)]
*  You know, bringing people like getting people [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3709.3s)]
*  to kind of work together physically, both in London, the deep mind [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3712.46s)]
*  and what we call gradient canopy, which is where the mountain view [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3717.0600000000004s)]
*  Google DeepMind teams are. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3721.34s)]
*  But one of my favorite moments is I routinely walk [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  multiple times per week to the gradient canopy building [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3726.94s)]
*  where our top researchers are working on the models. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3730.5400000000004s)]
*  Sergey is often there amongst them, right? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3735.46s)]
*  You know, just looking at, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3737.62s)]
*  you know, getting an update on the model, seeing the loss curve. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3741.62s)]
*  So all that I think that cultural part of getting the teams together back. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3744.06s)]
*  With that energy, I think I ended up playing a big role, too. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3749.18s)]
*  What about the decision to recently add a mode? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3752.5s)]
*  So Google Search is the, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3756.74s)]
*  as they say, the front page of the Internet. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3760.14s)]
*  It's like a legendary minimalist [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3762.7s)]
*  thing with 10 blue links like that's when people think Internet, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3765.78s)]
*  they think that page. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3769.74s)]
*  And now you're starting to mess with that. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3771.9s)]
*  So the AI mode, which is a separate tab and then integrating AI and the results. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3774.34s)]
*  I'm sure there were some battles in meetings on that one. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3778.74s)]
*  Look, you know, in some ways, when mobile came, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3782.18s)]
*  you know, people wanted answers to more questions. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3786.2599999999998s)]
*  So we kind of constantly evolving it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3789.86s)]
*  But you're right. This moment, you know, that evolution [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3791.78s)]
*  because the underlying technology is becoming much more capable. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3795.3s)]
*  You know, you can have AI give a lot of context, you know, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3799.9s)]
*  but one of our important design goal stores, when you come to Google Search, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3803.82s)]
*  you're going to get a lot of context, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3807.9s)]
*  but you're going to go and find a lot of things out on the web. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3811.18s)]
*  So that will be true in AI mode, in AI overviews and so on. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3813.78s)]
*  But I think to our earlier conversation, we are still giving you access to links. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3819.1s)]
*  But think of the AI as a layer which is giving you context, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3823.66s)]
*  summary, maybe in AI mode, you can have a dialogue with it back and forth [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3828.3399999999997s)]
*  on your journey. Right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3833.7s)]
*  And but through it all, you're kind of learning what's out there in the world. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3836.5s)]
*  So those core principles don't change. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3839.98s)]
*  But I think AI mode allows us to push the we have our best models there. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3842.5s)]
*  Right. Models which are using search as a deep tool. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3847.8199999999997s)]
*  Really, for every query you're asking, kind of fanning out, doing multiple searches, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3852.42s)]
*  like kind of assembling that knowledge in a way so you can go and consume what you want to. Right. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3857.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's how we think about it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3862.66s)]
*  I got to just listen to a bunch of Elizabeth, Liz Reed, describe this. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3864.58s)]
*  Two things stood out to me that she mentioned. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3869.82s)]
*  One thing is what you were talking about is the query fan out, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3871.78s)]
*  which I didn't even think about before, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3876.38s)]
*  is the powerful aspect of integrating a bunch of stuff on the web for you in one place. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3879.02s)]
*  So, yes, it provides that context so that you can decide which page to then go on to. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3884.06s)]
*  The other really, really big thing speaks to the earlier [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3890.2200000000003s)]
*  in terms of productivity multiply that we're talking about that she mentioned was language. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3894.3s)]
*  So one of the things you don't quite understand is through AI mode, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3900.06s)]
*  through AI mode, you make for non-English speakers, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3904.06s)]
*  you make sort of, let's say, English language websites accessible [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3909.34s)]
*  in the reasoning process as you try to figure out what you're looking for. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3916.06s)]
*  Of course, once you show up to a page, you can use a basic translate. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3920.54s)]
*  But that process of figuring it out, if you empathize with a large part of the world that [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3923.98s)]
*  doesn't speak English, their web is much smaller in that original language. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3929.74s)]
*  So it unlocks, again, unlocks that huge cognitive capacity there. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3937.58s)]
*  You take for granted here with all the bloggers and the journalists writing about AI mode, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3942.62s)]
*  you forget that this now unlocks because Gemini is really good at translation. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3947.1s)]
*  No, it is. I mean, the multimodality, the translation, stability to reason, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3953.8199999999997s)]
*  we are dramatically improving tool use. As a putting that power in the flow of search, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3959.98s)]
*  I think, look, I'm super excited with AI overviews. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3966.94s)]
*  We've seen the product has gotten much better. We measured using all kinds of user metrics. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3972.54s)]
*  It's obviously driven strong growth of the product. We've been testing AI mode. It's now [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3979.1s)]
*  in the hands of millions of people. The early metrics are very encouraging. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3987.98s)]
*  I'm excited about this next chapter of search. For people who are not thinking through or are [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3993.98s)]
*  aware of this. There's the 10 blue links with AI overview on top that provides a nice summarization. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3998.14s)]
*  You can expand it. You have sources and links now embedded. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4004.38s)]
*  I believe, at least Liz said so, I actually didn't notice it, but there's ads in the AI [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4009.34s)]
*  overview also. I don't think there's ads in AI mode. When ads in AI mode? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4014.3s)]
*  We should say that in the 90s, I remember the animated banner gifts that take you to some [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4025.98s)]
*  shady websites that have nothing to do with anything. AdSense revolutionized the advertisement. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4033.5s)]
*  It's one of the greatest inventions in recent history because it allows us for free [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4037.98s)]
*  to have access to all these kinds of services. Ads fuel a lot of really powerful services. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4046.54s)]
*  At its best, it's showing you relevant ads, but also very importantly, in a way that's not super [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4052.94s)]
*  annoying, in a classy way. When do you think it's possible to add ads into AI mode? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4058.86s)]
*  What does that look like from a classy, non-annoying perspective? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4068.06s)]
*  Two things. Early part of AI mode will obviously focus more on the organic experience to make sure [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4072.3s)]
*  we are getting it right. I think the fundamental value of ads is it enables access to deploy the [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4077.6600000000003s)]
*  services to billions of people. The reason we've always taken ads seriously is we view ads as [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4085.82s)]
*  commercial information, but it's still information. We bring the same quality metrics to it. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4093.6600000000003s)]
*  I think with AI mode, to our earlier conversation about, I think AI itself will help us [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4099.82s)]
*  over time figure out the best way to do it. I think given we are giving context around everything, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4105.74s)]
*  I think it'll give us more opportunities to also explain, okay, here's some commercial information. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4114.22s)]
*  Today as a podcaster, you do it at certain spots and you probably figure out what's best in your [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4119.660000000001s)]
*  podcast. I think there are aspects of that, but I think the underlying need of people value [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4124.780000000001s)]
*  commercial information, businesses are trying to connect to users, all that doesn't change in an AI [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4134.14s)]
*  moment. But look, we will rethink it. You've seen us in YouTube now do a mixture of subscription [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4140.86s)]
*  and ads. Obviously, we are now introducing subscription offerings across everything. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4148.0599999999995s)]
*  As part of that, the optimization point will end up being at different places as well. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4157.259999999999s)]
*  Do you see it projected in the possible future where AI mode completely replaces [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4163.259999999999s)]
*  the 10 Blue Links plus AI overview? Our current plan is AI mode is going to be there as a separate [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4168.0599999999995s)]
*  tab for people who really want to experience that. But it's not yet at the level where our main search [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4174.86s)]
*  pages. But as features work, we'll keep migrating it to the main page. And so you can view it as a [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4181.82s)]
*  continuum. AI mode will offer you the bleeding edge experience, but it'll think that work will keep [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4189.339999999999s)]
*  overflowing to AI overviews and the main experience. And the idea that AI mode will still take you to [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4196.22s)]
*  the web, to the human created web. Yes, that's going to be a core design principle for us. So [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4202.54s)]
*  really, if users decide, they drive this. It's just exciting, a little bit scary that it might [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4207.42s)]
*  change the internet. Google has been dominating with a very specific look and idea of what it [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4214.7s)]
*  means to have the internet. And as you move to AI mode, it's just a different experience. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4223.74s)]
*  I think Liz was talking about, I think you've mentioned that you ask more questions, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4232.7s)]
*  you ask longer questions. Dramatically different types of questions. Yeah, it actually fuels [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4238.54s)]
*  curiosity. I think for me, I've been asking just a much larger number of questions of this black box [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4243.74s)]
*  machine, let's say, whatever it is. And with AI overview, it's interesting because I still value [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4251.9s)]
*  the human. I still ultimately want to end up on the human created web. But like you said, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4259.98s)]
*  the context really helps. It helps us deliver higher quality referrals, right? Where people [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4268.139999999999s)]
*  are like, they have much higher likelihood of finding what they're looking for. They're exploring, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4274.54s)]
*  they're curious, their intent is getting satisfied more. So that's what all our metrics show. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4279.66s)]
*  It makes the humans that create the web nervous. The journalists are getting nervous. They've [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4285.26s)]
*  already been nervous. Like you mentioned, CNN is nervous because of podcasts. It makes people [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4289.099999999999s)]
*  nervous. Look, I think news and journalism will play an important role in the future. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4296.139999999999s)]
*  We're pretty committed to it. So I think making sure that ecosystem, in fact, I think we'll be [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4304.860000000001s)]
*  able to differentiate ourselves as a company over time because of our commitment there. So it's [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4311.34s)]
*  something I think I definitely value a lot. And as we are designing, we'll continue prioritizing [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4317.820000000001s)]
*  approaches. I'm sure for the people who want, they can have a fine-tuned AI model that's clickbait [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4323.820000000001s)]
*  hit pieces that will replace current journalism. That's a shot of journalism, forgive me. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4330.3s)]
*  But I find that if you're looking for really strong criticism of things, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4337.099999999999s)]
*  that Gemini is very good at providing that. Absolutely. It's better than anything. For now, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4341.42s)]
*  people are concerned that there will be bias that's introduced that as the AI systems become more and [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4346.78s)]
*  more powerful, there's incentive from sponsors to roll in and try to control the output [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4352.62s)]
*  of the AI models. But for now, the objective criticism that's provided is way better than [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4358.3s)]
*  journalism. Of course, the argument is the journalists are still valuable. But then, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4364.06s)]
*  I don't know, the crowdsourced journalism that we get on the open internet is also very, very [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4369.02s)]
*  powerful. I feel like they're all super important things. I think it's good that [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4374.14s)]
*  you get a lot of crowdsourced information coming in. But I feel like there is real value for [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4378.9400000000005s)]
*  high-quality journalism. I think these are all complimentary. I think I viewed as [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4387.1s)]
*  I find myself constantly seeking out also, try to find objective reporting on things too. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4395.740000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you get more context from the crowdfunded sources you read online, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4403.26s)]
*  but I think both end up playing a super important role. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4408.3s)]
*  Demis talked about this, the slice of the web that will increasingly become about [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4410.78s)]
*  providing information for agents. We can think about it as two layers of the web. One is for [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4416.94s)]
*  humans, one is for agents. Do you see the AI agents? Do you see the one that's for AI agents [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4422.94s)]
*  growing over time? Do you see there still being long-term five, 10 years of AI agents growing [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4430.7s)]
*  long-term five, 10 years of value for the human created for the purpose of human consumption web? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4438.22s)]
*  Or will it all be agents in the end? Today, like not everyone does, but you go to a big retail [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4446.06s)]
*  store, you love walking the aisle, you love shopping or grocery store, picking out food, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4455.740000000001s)]
*  etc. But you're also online shopping and they're delivering. Both are complimentary and that's [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4462.06s)]
*  true for restaurants, etc. I do feel like over time, websites will also get better for humans. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4468.780000000001s)]
*  They will be better designed. AI might actually design them better for humans. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4476.38s)]
*  I expect the web to get a lot richer and more interesting and better to use. At the same time, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4482.46s)]
*  there'll be an agentic web, which is also making a lot of progress. You have to solve the business [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4490.139999999999s)]
*  value and the incentives to make that work well for people to participate in it. But both will [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4499.66s)]
*  coexist. Obviously, the agents won't need the same design and UI paradigms which humans need to [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4507.0199999999995s)]
*  interact with. But I think both will be there. I have to ask you about Chrome. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4518.46s)]
*  I have to say, for me personally, Google Chrome is probably... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4525.58s)]
*  I don't know. I'd like to see where I would rank it. But in this temptation, and this is not a [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4530.94s)]
*  recency bias, although it might be a little bit, but I think it's up there. Top three, maybe the [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4536.139999999999s)]
*  number one piece of software for me of all time. It's incredible. It's really incredible. The [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4541.099999999999s)]
*  browser is our window to the web. Chrome really continued for many years, but even initially, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4547.02s)]
*  to push the innovation on that front when it was stale. It continues to challenge. It continues to [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4554.14s)]
*  make it more performant, so efficient, and just innovate constantly. And the Chromium aspect of [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4559.9800000000005s)]
*  it. Anyway, you were one of the pioneers of Chrome pushing for it when it was an insane idea. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4566.860000000001s)]
*  Probably one of the ideas that was criticized and doubted and so on. Can you tell me [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4575.18s)]
*  the story of what it took to push for Chrome? What was your vision? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4582.38s)]
*  Look, it was such a dynamic time around 2004, 2005 with Ajax, the web suddenly becoming dynamic. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4589.1s)]
*  In a matter of a few months, Flickr, Gmail, Google Maps, all kind of came into existence. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4601.26s)]
*  The fact that you have an interactive, dynamic web. The web was evolving from simple [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4610.06s)]
*  text pages, simple HTML to rich, dynamic applications. But at the same time, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4615.9800000000005s)]
*  you could see the browser was never meant for that world. JavaScript execution was super slow. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4622.78s)]
*  The browser was far away from being an operating system for that rich modern web, which was [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4631.42s)]
*  coming into place. So that's the opportunity we saw. It's an amazing early team. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4639.02s)]
*  I still remember the day we got a shell on WebKit running and how fast it was. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4646.86s)]
*  We had a clear vision for building a browser. We wanted to bring core OS principles into the [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4653.5s)]
*  browser. So we built a secure browser sandbox. These things are common now, but at the time, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4663.18s)]
*  it was pretty unique. We found an amazing team in Aarhus, Denmark with a leader who built the [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4673.1s)]
*  JavaScript VM, which at the time was 25 times faster than any other JavaScript VM out there. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4681.74s)]
*  By the way, you're right. We open sourced it all and put it in Chromium too. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4689.9s)]
*  We really thought the web could work much better, much faster, and you could be much safer [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4695.42s)]
*  browsing the web. The name Chrome came was because we literally felt people were like the [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4702.54s)]
*  Chrome of the browser was getting clunkier. We wanted to minimize it. That was the origins of [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4709.18s)]
*  the project. Definitely, obviously, a highly biased person here talking about Chrome, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4715.58s)]
*  but it's the most fun I've had building a product from the ground up. It was an extraordinary team. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4723.42s)]
*  Had my co-founders in the project, were terrific. So, definitely fond memories. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4731.26s)]
*  For people who don't know, Sundar, it's probably fair to say you're the reason we have Chrome. Yes, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4736.379999999999s)]
*  I know there's a lot of incredible engineers, but pushing for it inside a company that probably was [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4741.98s)]
*  opposing it because it's a crazy idea. Because as everybody probably knows, it's incredibly difficult [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4746.139999999999s)]
*  to build a browser. Look, Eric, who was the CEO at the time, I think it was less than he was supposed [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4752.379999999999s)]
*  to do it. He kind of first-hand knew what a crazy thing it is to go build a browser. He definitely [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4758.299999999999s)]
*  was like, there was a crazy aspect to actually wanting to go build a browser. But he was very [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4764.94s)]
*  supportive. Everyone, the founders were. I think once we started building something and we could [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4773.179999999999s)]
*  use it and see how much better, from then on, you're really tinkering with the product and making it [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4780.0599999999995s)]
*  better, it came to life pretty fast. What wisdom do you draw from that? From pushing through on a [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4785.66s)]
*  crazy idea in the early days that ends up being revolutionary? What, for future crazy ideas like it? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4793.42s)]
*  I mean, this is something Larry and Sergey have articulated clearly. I really internalized this [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4800.78s)]
*  early on, which is their whole feeling around working on moonshots as a way. When you work [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4807.1s)]
*  on something very ambitious, first of all, it attracts the best people. So that's an advantage [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4814.7s)]
*  you get. Number two, because it's so ambitious, you don't have others working on something crazy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4820.54s)]
*  You pretty much have the path to yourselves. It's like Waymo and self-driving. Number three, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4826.38s)]
*  even if you end up quite not accomplishing what you set out to do and you end up doing 60, 80% of it, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4832.3s)]
*  it'll end up being a terrific success. That's the advice I would give people. I think it's [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4838.62s)]
*  just aiming for big ideas, has all these advantages. It's risky, but it also has all these [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4846.06s)]
*  advantages, which people I don't think fully internalize. I mean, you mentioned one of the [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4854.9400000000005s)]
*  craziest, biggest moonshots, which is Waymo. It's one of when I first saw over a decade ago, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4858.620000000001s)]
*  a Waymo vehicle, a Google self-driving car vehicle. For me, it was an aha moment [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4866.46s)]
*  for robotics. It made me fall in love with robotics even more than before. It gave me [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4874.78s)]
*  a glimpse into the future, so it's incredible. I'm truly grateful for that project, for what [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4879.66s)]
*  it symbolizes. But it's also a crazy moonshot. For a long time, Waymo has been just, like you [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4884.0599999999995s)]
*  mentioned, with scuba diving, just not listening to anybody, just calmly improving the system, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4891.5s)]
*  better and better, more testing, just expanding the operational domain more and more. First of [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4897.66s)]
*  all, congrats on 10 million paid robotaxi rides. What lessons do you take from Waymo [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4904.06s)]
*  about the perseverance, the persistence on that project? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4912.700000000001s)]
*  Really proud of the progress we have had with Waymo. One of the things I think we were very [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4917.18s)]
*  committed to, the final 20% can look like, we always say, the first 80% is easy, the final 20% [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4922.38s)]
*  takes 80% of the time. I think we definitely were working through that phase with Waymo, but [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4929.82s)]
*  I was aware of that. We knew we were at that stage. We knew we were the technology gap between, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4936.86s)]
*  while there were many people, many other self-driving companies, we knew the technology [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4945.099999999999s)]
*  gap was there. In fact, right at the moment when others were doubting Waymo is when [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4949.42s)]
*  I made the decision to invest more in Waymo. In some ways, it's counterintuitive, but I think, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4955.74s)]
*  look, we've always been a deep technology company and Waymo is a version of building an AI robot [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4964.86s)]
*  that works well. We get attracted to problems like that, the caliber of the teams there, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4973.74s)]
*  phenomenal teams. I know you followed the space super closely. I'm talking to someone who knows [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4980.14s)]
*  the space well, but it was very obvious it's going to get there and there's still more work to do. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4984.06s)]
*  It's a good example where we always prioritized being ambitious and safety at the same time, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4991.58s)]
*  and equally committed to both and pushed hard. We were very committed to both. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4999.42s)]
*  Couldn't be more thrilled with how it's working, how much people love the experience. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5009.74s)]
*  This year, definitely, we've scaled up a lot and will continue scaling up in 2016. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5017.5s)]
*  That said, the competition is heating up. You've been friendly with Elon, even though Technic is [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5022.22s)]
*  a competitor, but you've been friendly with a lot of tech CEOs in that way, just showing respect [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5029.34s)]
*  towards them and so on. What do you think about the RoboTaxi efforts that Tesla is doing? Do you [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5033.9800000000005s)]
*  see this competition? What do you think? Do you like the competition? We are one of the earliest [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5038.7s)]
*  and biggest backers of SpaceX, as Google. Thrilled with what SpaceX is doing and fortunate to be [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5044.38s)]
*  investors as a company there. We don't compete with Tesla directly. We are not making cars, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5056.22s)]
*  etc. We are building L45 autonomy. We are building a Waymo driver, which is general purpose and can [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5062.38s)]
*  be used in many settings. They are obviously working on making Tesla self-driving too. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5069.34s)]
*  I just assume it's a de facto that Elon would succeed in whatever he does. That is not something [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5076.06s)]
*  I question. But I think we are so far from these spaces are such vast spaces. Think about [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5084.86s)]
*  transportation, the opportunity space. The Waymo driver is a general purpose technology we can [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5094.299999999999s)]
*  apply in many situations. You have a vast green space. In all future scenarios, I see Tesla doing [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5100.38s)]
*  well and Waymo doing well. Like we mentioned with the Neolithic package, I think it's very [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5110.7s)]
*  possible that in the quote unquote AI package when the history is written, autonomous vehicles, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5116.86s)]
*  self-driving cars is like the big thing that changes everything. Imagine over a period of [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5122.38s)]
*  a decade or two, just the complete transition from manual to autonomous in ways we might not predict. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5129.9s)]
*  It might change the way we move about the world completely. The possibility of that and then the [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5137.18s)]
*  second and third order effects as you're seeing now with Tesla, very possibly you would see [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5145.5s)]
*  some internally with Alphabet, maybe Waymo, maybe some of the Gemini robotics stuff. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5150.62s)]
*  It might lead you into the other domains of robotics. We should remember that Waymo is a [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5157.1s)]
*  robot. It just happens to be out of four wheels. You said that the next big thing, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5163.66s)]
*  we can also throw that into AI package, the big aha moment might be in the space of robotics. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5171.0199999999995s)]
*  What do you think that would look like? Demis and the Google DeepMind team is very [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5177.74s)]
*  focused on Gemini robotics. We are definitely building the underlying models well. We have a [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5181.98s)]
*  lot of investments there and I think we are also pretty cutting edge in our research there. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5189.42s)]
*  We are definitely driving that direction. We obviously are thinking about applications [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5194.9400000000005s)]
*  in robotics. We'll work seriously. We are partnering with a few companies today, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5200.54s)]
*  but it's an area I would say stay tuned. We are yet to fully articulate our plans outside, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5206.22s)]
*  but it's an area we are definitely committed to driving a lot of progress. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5212.62s)]
*  I think AI ends up driving that massive progress in robotics. The field has been held back [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5216.860000000001s)]
*  for a while. The hardware has made extraordinary progress. The software had been the challenge, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5223.02s)]
*  but with AI now and the generalized models we are building, we are building these models, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5230.38s)]
*  getting them to work in the real world in a safe way, in a generalized way, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5238.22s)]
*  is the frontier we are pushing pretty hard on. Well, it's really nice to see the models and the [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5243.42s)]
*  different teams integrated to where all of them are pushing towards one world model that's being [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5247.74s)]
*  built. From all these different angles, multimodal, you're ultimately trying to get Gemini. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5252.139999999999s)]
*  The same thing that would make AI mode really effective in answering your questions, which [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5261.74s)]
*  requires a kind of world model, is the same kind of thing that would help a robot be useful in [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5266.219999999999s)]
*  the physical world. Everything is aligned. That is what makes this moment so unique [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5271.42s)]
*  because running a company for the first time, you can do one investment in a very deep horizontal [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5276.86s)]
*  way. On top of it, you can drive multiple businesses forward. That's effectively [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5283.9s)]
*  what we are doing in Google in alphabet. It's all coming together like it was planned [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5292.22s)]
*  ahead of time, but it's not, of course. It's all distributed. If Gmail and Sheets and [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5296.46s)]
*  all these other incredible services, I can sing Gmail praises for years. It's just revolutionized [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5302.78s)]
*  email. The moment you start to integrate AI Gemini into Gmail, that's the other thing. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5307.5s)]
*  Speaking of productivity multiplier, people complain about email, but that changed everything. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5314.219999999999s)]
*  Email, the invention of email changed everything. It's been ripe. There's been a few folks trying [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5318.46s)]
*  to revolutionize email, some of them on top of Gmail, but that's ripe for innovation. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5323.58s)]
*  Not just spam filtering, but you demoed a really nice demo of personalized responses. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5329.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5336.46s)]
*  Personalized responses. At first, I felt really bad about that, but then I realized that there's [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5336.62s)]
*  nothing wrong to feel bad about. The example you gave is when a friend asks, you went to whatever [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5345.58s)]
*  hiking location, do you have any advice? They just search us through all your information to [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5352.86s)]
*  give them good advice, and then you put the cherry on top. Maybe some love or whatever, camaraderie, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5359.259999999999s)]
*  but the informational aspect, the knowledge transfer does for you. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5364.46s)]
*  I think there'll be important moments. Today, if you write a card in your own handwriting and [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5368.62s)]
*  send it to someone, that's a special thing. Similarly, there'll be a time to your friends, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5374.94s)]
*  maybe a friend wrote and said he's not doing well or something. Those are moments you want to [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5380.22s)]
*  save your time for writing something, reaching out, but saying, give me all the details of the trip [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5385.18s)]
*  you took, to me makes a lot of sense for an AI assistant to help you. I think both are important, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5393.34s)]
*  but I think I'm excited about that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5401.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think ultimately it gives more time for us humans to do the things we humans find meaningful. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5404.780000000001s)]
*  I think it scares a lot of people because we're going to have to ask ourselves the hard question [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5409.9800000000005s)]
*  of what do we find meaningful? I'm sure there's answers. It's the old question of the meaning [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5414.38s)]
*  of existence. You have to try to figure that out. That might be ultimately parenting or being [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5420.620000000001s)]
*  creative in some domains of art or writing. It's a good question to ask yourself, in my life, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5427.1s)]
*  what is the thing that brings me most joy and fulfillment? If I'm able to actually focus more [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5435.82s)]
*  time on that, that's really powerful. I think that's the holy grail. If you get this right, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5442.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it allows more people to find that. I have to ask you, on the programming front, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5449.0199999999995s)]
*  AI is getting really good at programming. Gemini, both the Agentec and just the LLM has been [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5455.34s)]
*  incredible. A lot of programmers are really worried that their jobs, they will lose their jobs. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5459.9s)]
*  How worried should they be and how should they adjust so they can be thriving in this new world [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5467.66s)]
*  where more and more code is written by AI? I think a few things. Looking at Google, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5474.299999999999s)]
*  we've given various tests around 30% of code now uses AI-generated solutions or whatever it is. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5479.42s)]
*  But the most important metric, and we carefully measure it, is how much has our engineering [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5488.94s)]
*  velocity increased as a company due to AI? It's tough to measure and we rigorously try to measure [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5496.54s)]
*  it. Our estimates are that the number is now at 10%. Now, across the company, we've accomplished [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5503.82s)]
*  a 10% engineering velocity increase using AI. But we plan to hire more engineers next year. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5515.74s)]
*  Right. Because the opportunity space of what we can do is expanding too. I think hopefully, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5526.54s)]
*  at least in the near to midterm, for many engineers, it frees up more and more of the [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5539.18s)]
*  even in engineering and coding, there are aspects which are so much fun. You're designing, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5548.14s)]
*  architecting, solving a problem, there's a lot of grant work which all goes hand in hand. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5554.0599999999995s)]
*  But it hopefully takes a lot of that away, makes it even more fun to code, frees you up more time to [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5561.179999999999s)]
*  create, problem solve, brainstorm with your fellow colleagues and so on. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5568.219999999999s)]
*  That's the opportunity there. Second, I think it'll put the creative power in [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5573.099999999999s)]
*  more people's hands, which means people create more. That means there'll be more engineers doing [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5583.42s)]
*  more things. It's tough to fully predict, but I think in general in this moment, it feels like [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5587.66s)]
*  people adopt these tools and be better programmers. There are more people playing chess now than ever [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5597.26s)]
*  before. It feels positive that way to me, at least speaking from within a Google context. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5604.38s)]
*  That's how I would talk to them about it. I just know anecdotally a lot of great programmers [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5613.1s)]
*  are generating a lot of code. Their productivity, they're not always using all the code, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5620.22s)]
*  there's still a lot of editing. Even for me, programming is a side thing, I think I'm like [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5625.26s)]
*  5x more productive. I think that's even for a large code base that's touching a lot of users, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5634.06s)]
*  like Google's does, I'm imagining very soon that productivity should be going up even more. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5642.06s)]
*  The big unlock will be as we make the agentic capabilities much more robust. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5648.9400000000005s)]
*  That's what unlocks that next big wave. I think the 10% is a massive number. If tomorrow I showed [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5655.740000000001s)]
*  up and said you can improve a large organization's productivity by 10% when you have tens of [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5662.22s)]
*  thousands of engineers, that's a phenomenal number. That's different than what other [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5669.42s)]
*  site statistics say. This percentage of code is now written by AI. I'm talking more about [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5675.26s)]
*  overall actual productivity, engineering productivity, which is two different things, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5681.900000000001s)]
*  and which is the more important metric. I think it'll get better. I think there's no engineer who [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5688.3s)]
*  tomorrow, if you magically became 2x more productive, you're just going to create more things, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5697.58s)]
*  you're going to create more value-added things. I think you'll find more satisfaction in your job. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5702.860000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of aspects. The actual Google code base might just improve [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5708.78s)]
*  because it'll become more standardized, easier for people to move about the code base because AI [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5712.700000000001s)]
*  will help with that. Therefore, that will also allow the AI to understand the entire code base [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5718.06s)]
*  better, which makes the engineering aspect. I've been using Cursor a lot as a way to program with [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5723.02s)]
*  Gemini and other models. One of its powerful things is it's aware of the entire code base. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5729.34s)]
*  That allows you to ask questions of it. It allows the agents to move about that code base and really [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5736.22s)]
*  powerfully. That's a huge unlock. Think about migrations, refactoring old code bases. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5742.06s)]
*  Refactoring, yeah. Once we can do all this in a much better, more robust way than where we are [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5749.740000000001s)]
*  today. I think in the end, everything will be written in JavaScript and run in Chrome. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5756.22s)]
*  I think it's all going to that direction. Just for fun, Google has legendary coding interviews, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5760.9400000000005s)]
*  like rigorous interviews for the engineers. Can you comment on how that has changed in the era [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5768.62s)]
*  of AI? It's just such a weird... The whiteboard interview, I assume, is not allowed to have some [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5775.82s)]
*  prompts. Such a good question. Look, I do think we're making sure we'll introduce at least one [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5782.86s)]
*  round of in-person interviews for people, just to make sure the fundamentals are there. I think [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5795.26s)]
*  they'll end up being important. It's an equally important skill. If you can use these tools to [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5800.22s)]
*  generate better code, I think that's an asset. Overall, I think it's a massive positive. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5805.42s)]
*  Vibe coding engineer, do you recommend students interested in programming still get an education [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5815.98s)]
*  in computer science, in college education? What do you think? I do. If you have a passion [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5823.5s)]
*  for computer science, I would. Computer science is obviously a lot more than programming alone. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5827.9s)]
*  So I would. I still don't think I would change what you pursue. I think AI will horizontally [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5832.3s)]
*  allow impact every field. It's pretty tough to predict in what ways. So any education in which [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5842.38s)]
*  you're learning good first principles thinking, I think is good education. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5852.860000000001s)]
*  You've revolutionized web browsing. You've revolutionized a lot of things over the years. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5857.5s)]
*  Android changed the game. It's an incredible operating system. We could talk for hours about [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5862.62s)]
*  Android. What does the future of Android look like? Is it possible it becomes more and more [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5868.38s)]
*  AI-centric, especially now that you throw into the mix Android XR with being able to do augmented [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5874.7s)]
*  reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality in the physical world? The best innovations in computing [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5884.379999999999s)]
*  have come when you're through a paradigm I over change, right? Like when with GUI and then with [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5891.58s)]
*  a graphical user interface and then with multi-touch in the context of mobile voice later on. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5898.7s)]
*  Similarly, I feel like AR is that next paradigm. I think it was held back both [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5906.139999999999s)]
*  the system integration challenges of making good AR is very, very hard. The second thing is you [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5914.3s)]
*  need AI to actually kind of, otherwise the IOS is too complicated for you to have a natural seamless [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5919.82s)]
*  IO to that paradigm. AI ends up being super important. This is why Project Astra ends up [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5927.26s)]
*  being super critical for that Android XR world. But it is. I think when you use glasses and [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5935.9s)]
*  always been amazed at how useful these things are going to be. I think it's a real opportunity for [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5944.62s)]
*  Android. I think XR is one way it will kind of really come to life. But I think there's an [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5952.38s)]
*  opportunity to rethink the mobile OS too, right? I think we've been kind of living in this paradigm [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5958.9400000000005s)]
*  of apps and shortcuts, all that won't go away. But again, if you're trying to get stuff done [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5963.5s)]
*  at an operating system level, it needs to be more agent-tick so that you can kind of describe what [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5972.54s)]
*  you want to do or like it proactively understands what you're trying to do, learns from how you're [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5979.1s)]
*  doing things over and over again, and kind of is adapting to you. All that is kind of like the [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5983.660000000001s)]
*  unlock we need to go and do. With the basic, efficient, minimalist UI, I've gotten a chance [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5988.9400000000005s)]
*  to try the glasses and they're incredible. It's the little stuff. It's hard to put into words, but [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5995.900000000001s)]
*  no latency. It just works. Even that little map demo where you look down and you look up and there's [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6000.700000000001s)]
*  a very smooth transition between the two and useful, very small amount of useful information [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6007.34s)]
*  is shown to you. Enough not to distract from the world outside, but enough to provide a bit of [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6015.1s)]
*  context when you need it. In order to bring that into reality, you have to solve a lot of the OS [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6020.7s)]
*  problems to make sure it works when you're integrating the AI into the whole thing. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6028.7s)]
*  Everything you do launches an agent that answers some basic question. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6034.22s)]
*  It's a good moonshot. I love that. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6038.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6040.38s)]
*  But I think we are, but it's much closer to reality than other moonshots. We expect to have [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6041.66s)]
*  glasses in the hands of developers later this year and in consumer science next year, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6051.66s)]
*  so it's an exciting time. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6057.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, extremely well executed. Beam, all this stuff. Sometimes you don't know, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6059.0199999999995s)]
*  somebody commented on a top comment on one of the demos of Beam. They said, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6065.1s)]
*  this will either be killed off in five weeks or revolutionize all meetings in five years. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6072.38s)]
*  There's very much Google tries so many things and sometimes, sadly, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6078.86s)]
*  kills off very promising projects, but because there's so many other things to focus on. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6083.0199999999995s)]
*  I use so many Google products. Google Voice I still use. I'm so glad that's not being [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6088.06s)]
*  killed off. That's still alive. Thank you, whoever is defending that because it's awesome. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6092.38s)]
*  It's great. They keep innovating. I just want to list off just as a big thank you. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6098.14s)]
*  Search, obviously Google revolutionized. Chrome, and all of these can be multi-hour conversations. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6102.78s)]
*  Gmail, I've been singing Gmail praises forever. Maps, incredible technological innovation and [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6108.22s)]
*  revolutionizing mapping. Android, like we talked about. YouTube, like we talked about. AdSense, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6115.26s)]
*  Google Translate for the academic mind, a Google Scholar is incredible. Also, the scanning of the [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6120.9400000000005s)]
*  books, making all the world's knowledge accessible, even with that knowledge is a niche thing, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6128.7s)]
*  which Google Scholar is. Then obviously with DeepMind, with AlphaZero, AlphaFold, AlphaEvolve, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6135.74s)]
*  I could talk forever about AlphaEvolve. That's mind blowing. All of that released. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6143.02s)]
*  As part of that set of things you've released in this year when those brilliant articles were [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6147.900000000001s)]
*  written about Google is done. Like we talked about, pioneering self-driving cars and quantum [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6154.62s)]
*  computing, which could be another thing that is low key, is scuba diving. It's a way to changing [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6160.9400000000005s)]
*  the world forever. Another pothead slash micro kitchen question, if you build AGI, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6167.98s)]
*  what kind of question would you ask it? What would you want to talk about? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6177.98s)]
*  Definitively, Google has created AGI that can basically answer any question. What topic are [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6183.9s)]
*  you going to? Where are you going? That's a great question. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6190.7s)]
*  Maybe it's proactive by then and should tell me a few things I should know. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6198.78s)]
*  But I think if I were to ask it, I think it'll help us understand ourselves much better [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6204.38s)]
*  in a way that will surprise us, I think. You already see people do it with the products, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6211.66s)]
*  but in an AGI context, I think that'll be pretty powerful. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6220.22s)]
*  At a personal level or a general human nature? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6223.5s)]
*  At a personal level. You're talking to AGI. I think there is some chance it'll understand you [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6226.3s)]
*  in a very deep way. I think in a profound way that's a possibility. I think there's [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6236.62s)]
*  also the obvious thing of maybe it helps us understand the universe better [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6244.14s)]
*  in a way that expands the frontiers of our understanding of the world. That is something [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6250.22s)]
*  super exciting. But look, I really don't know. I haven't had access to something that powerful yet, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6256.9400000000005s)]
*  but I think those are all possibilities. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6267.740000000001s)]
*  I think on the personal level, asking questions about yourself could be a sequence of questions [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6269.66s)]
*  like that about what makes me happy. I think we'd be very surprised to learn through those [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6275.98s)]
*  sequence of questions and answers, we might explore some profound truths in a way that [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6283.9s)]
*  sometimes art reveals to us, great books reveal to us, great conversations with loved ones reveal, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6289.66s)]
*  things that are obvious in retrospect but are nice when they're said. But for me, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6294.7s)]
*  number one question is about how many alien civilizations are there? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6300.06s)]
*  That's going to be your first question. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6302.54s)]
*  Number one, how many living and dead alien civilizations? Maybe a bunch of follow-ups, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6305.58s)]
*  like how close are they? Are they dangerous? If there's no alien civilizations, why? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6310.78s)]
*  Or if there's no advanced alien civilizations but bacteria-like life everywhere, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6319.34s)]
*  why? What is the barrier preventing it from getting to that? Is it because when you get [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6323.900000000001s)]
*  sufficiently intelligent, you end up destroying ourselves because you need competition in order [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6331.18s)]
*  to develop an advanced civilization? And when you have competition, it's going to lead to [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6337.1s)]
*  military conflict and conflict eventually kills everybody. I'm going to have that kind of discussion. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6342.22s)]
*  Get an answer to the Fermi paradox. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6346.46s)]
*  Exactly. And have a real discussion about it. I'm not sure if it's a [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6348.14s)]
*  I'm realizing now with your answer is a more productive answer because I'm not sure what I'm [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6351.82s)]
*  going to do with that information, but maybe it speaks to the general human curiosity that [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6356.0599999999995s)]
*  Liz talked about that we're all just really curious and making the world's information [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6360.0599999999995s)]
*  accessible allows our curiosity to be satiated some with AI even more. We can be more and more [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6365.34s)]
*  curious and learn more about the world, about ourselves. And in so doing, I always wonder if, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6373.42s)]
*  I don't know if you can comment on like, is it possible to measure the, not the GDP productivity [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6378.54s)]
*  increase like we talked about, but maybe the, whatever that increases the, the breadth and [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6385.9s)]
*  depth of human knowledge that Google has unlocked with Google search and now with AI mode with Gemini [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6393.82s)]
*  is a difficult thing to measure. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6402.94s)]
*  Many years ago, there was a, I think it was a MIT study. They just estimated the impact of Google [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6404.22s)]
*  search and they basically said it's the equivalent to on a per person basis. It's a few thousands of [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6411.34s)]
*  dollars per year per person, right? Like it's the value that got created per year, right? And, and [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6418.46s)]
*  but it's, yeah, it's tough to capture these things, right? Like you kind of take it, take it for [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6426.38s)]
*  granted as these things come and the frontier keeps moving, but, you know, how do you measure the [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6430.22s)]
*  value of something like alpha fold over time, right? And, and, and so on. So it's. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6435.740000000001s)]
*  And also the increase in quality of life when you learn more. I have to say like, with some of the [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6440.860000000001s)]
*  programming I do done by AI, for some reason, I'm more excited to program. Yeah. And so the same [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6447.5s)]
*  with knowledge, with discovering things that are not so easy to learn, but I think it's, it's [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6453.02s)]
*  with discovering things about the world. It makes you more excited to be alive. It makes you more [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6458.78s)]
*  curious to, and it keeps the more curious you are, the more exciting it is to live and experience [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6464.22s)]
*  the world. And it's very hard to, I don't know if that makes you more productive. It probably not [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6470.38s)]
*  nearly as much as it makes you happy to be alive. And that's a hard thing to measure the quality of [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6474.54s)]
*  life increases. Some of these things do as they add continues to get better and better at everything [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6481.5s)]
*  that humans do. What do you think is the biggest thing that makes us humans special? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6487.82s)]
*  Look, I, I think. It's tough to, I mean, the essence of humanity, there's something about, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6494.299999999999s)]
*  you know, the consciousness we have, what makes us uniquely human. Maybe the lines will blur over [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6503.58s)]
*  time. And it's tough to articulate, but I hope, hopefully, you know, we live in a world where [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6509.58s)]
*  if you make resources more plentiful and make the world lesser of a zero sum game over time, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6517.66s)]
*  right. And, and which it's not, but you know, in a resource constrained environment, people perceive [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6528.22s)]
*  it to be right. And, and, and so I hope the values of what makes us uniquely human, empathy, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6533.98s)]
*  kindness, all that surfaces more as the aspirational hope I have. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6544.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It multiplies the compassion, but also the curiosity, just the banter, the debates we'll have [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6551.5s)]
*  about the meaning of it all. And I also think in the scientific domains, all the incredible work [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6558.0599999999995s)]
*  the DeepMind is doing, I think we'll still continue to play, to explore scientific questions, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6563.18s)]
*  mathematical questions, physics questions, even as AI gets better and better at helping us solve [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6572.46s)]
*  some of the questions. Sometimes the question itself is a really difficult thing. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6578.38s)]
*  Both the right new questions to ask and the answers to them and, and, and the self-discovery [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6583.02s)]
*  process, which it will drive, I think, you know, our early work with both coscientists and Alpha [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6589.18s)]
*  Evolve, just, just super exciting to see. What gives you hope about the future of human [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6595.1s)]
*  civilization? Look, I've always, I'm an optimist and, you know, I, I, I look at, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6601.02s)]
*  now, if you were to say you take the journey of human civilization, it's been, you know, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6610.46s)]
*  we've relentlessly made the world better, right? In many ways, at any given moment in time, there [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6615.82s)]
*  are big issues to work through. It may look, but, you know, I always ask myself the question, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6622.38s)]
*  would you have been born now or any other time in the past? I most often, not most often, almost [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6627.74s)]
*  always would rather be born now, right? You know, and so that's the extraordinary thing the human [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6635.259999999999s)]
*  civilization has accomplished, right? And like, you know, and we've kind of constantly made the [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6643.1s)]
*  world a better place. And so something tells me as humanity, we always rise collectively [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6648.3s)]
*  to drive that frontier forward. So I expect it to be no different in the future. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6655.58s)]
*  I agree with you totally. I'm truly grateful to be alive in this moment. And I'm also really [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6660.860000000001s)]
*  excited for the future and the work you and the incredible teams here are doing is one of the big [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6665.660000000001s)]
*  reasons I'm excited for the future. So thank you. Thank you for all the cool products you built. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6672.06s)]
*  And please don't kill Google Voice. Thank you, Sundar. We won't, yeah. Thank you for talking [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6677.18s)]
*  today. This was incredible. Thank you. Real pleasure. Appreciate it. Thanks for listening to [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6683.42s)]
*  this conversation with Sundar Pichai. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6687.740000000001s)]
*  in the description or at lexfreedman.com slash sponsors. Shortly before this conversation, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6692.780000000001s)]
*  I got a chance to get a couple of demos that frankly blew my mind. The engineering was really [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6699.18s)]
*  impressive. The first demo was Google Beam. And the second demo was the XR glasses. And some of it [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6705.42s)]
*  was caught on video. So I thought I would include here some of those video clips. Hey, Lex, my name [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6714.38s)]
*  is Andrew. I lead the Google Beam team and we're going to be excited to show you a demo. We're [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6722.3s)]
*  going to show you, I think, a glimpse of something new. So that's the idea, a way to connect, a way [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6725.98s)]
*  to feel present from anywhere with anybody you care about. Here's Google Beam. This is a development [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6730.54s)]
*  platform that we've built. So there's a prototype here of Google Beam. There's one right down the [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6736.7s)]
*  hallway. I'm going to go down and turn that on in a second. We're going to experience it together. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6741.58s)]
*  We'll be back in the same room. Wonderful. Whoa. Okay. Here we are. All right. This is real already. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6745.419999999999s)]
*  Wow. This is Google Beam. We're trying to make it feel like you and I could be anywhere in the [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6754.7s)]
*  world, but when these magic windows open, we're back together. I see you exactly the same way you [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6760.86s)]
*  see me. It's almost like we're sitting at the table sharing a table together. We could learn from you, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6766.7s)]
*  talk to you, share a meal with you, get to know you. So you can feel the depth of this. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6772.22s)]
*  Wow. So for people who probably can't even imagine what this looks like, there's a 3D version. It [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6778.7s)]
*  looks real. You look real. Yeah, it looks real to me. It looks real to you. It looks like you're [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6784.06s)]
*  coming out of the screen. We quickly believe once we're in Beam that we're just together. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6787.9800000000005s)]
*  You settle into it. You're naturally attuned to seeing the world like this, and you just get used [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6794.06s)]
*  to seeing people this way, but literally from anywhere in the world with these magic screens. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6798.9400000000005s)]
*  This is incredible. It's a neat technology. Wow. So I saw demos of this, but they don't come close [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6802.9400000000005s)]
*  to the experience of this. I think one of the top YouTube comments on one of the demos I saw was [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6808.860000000001s)]
*  why would I want to high definition? I'm trying to turn off the camera, but this actually is, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6813.1s)]
*  this feels like the camera has been turned off and we're just in the same room together. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6817.9800000000005s)]
*  This is really compelling. That's right. I know it's kind of late in the day too, so I brought you a [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6822.3s)]
*  snack just in case you're a little bit hungry. So can you push it farther and it just becomes... [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6826.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's try to float it between rooms. It kind of fades it from my room into your room. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6833.02s)]
*  And then you see my hand, the depth of my hand. Of course, yeah. It feels like you... Try this. Try [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6836.700000000001s)]
*  give me a high five and there's almost a sensation of being in touch. Yeah. Almost feel. Yes. Because [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6841.82s)]
*  you're so attuned to, you know, that should be a high five. Feeling like you could connect with [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6846.38s)]
*  someone that way. So it's kind of a magical experience. Oh, this is really nice. How much does [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6850.62s)]
*  it cost? We've got a lot of companies testing it. We just announced that we're going to be bringing it [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6854.38s)]
*  to offices soon as a set of products. We've got some companies helping us build these screens, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6859.74s)]
*  but eventually I think this will be in almost every screen. There's nothing. I'm not wearing [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6864.62s)]
*  anything. Well, I'm wearing a suit and tie to clarify. I am wearing clothes. This is not CGI, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6868.54s)]
*  but outside of that, cool. And the audio is really good. And you can see me in the same [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6874.86s)]
*  three-dimensional way. Yeah. The audio is spatialized. So if I'm talking from here, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6879.42s)]
*  of course it sounds like I'm talking from here. You know, if I move to the other side of the room. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6883.58s)]
*  So these little subtle cues, these really matter to bring people together. All the non-verbals, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6888.7s)]
*  all the emotion, the things that are lost today, here it is. We put it back into the system. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6893.26s)]
*  You pulled this off. Holy shit. They pulled it off. And integrated into this, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6897.74s)]
*  I saw the translation also. Right. This is the- Yeah. We've got a bunch of things. Let me show [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6903.5s)]
*  you a couple kind of cool things. Let's do a little bit of work together. Maybe we could [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6907.179999999999s)]
*  critique one of your latest- So, you know, it's you and I work together. So of course we're in [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6911.98s)]
*  the same room, but with the super power, I can bring other things in here with me. And it's nice. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6918.62s)]
*  You know, it's like we could sit together, we could watch something, we could work. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6923.82s)]
*  We've shared meals as a team together in this system. But once you do the presence aspect of [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6928.38s)]
*  this, you want to bring some other superpowers to it. And so you could do review code together. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6933.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I've got some slides I'm working on. You know, maybe you could help me [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6938.54s)]
*  with this. Keep your eyes on me for a second. I'll slide back into the center. I didn't really move, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6942.219999999999s)]
*  but the system just kind of puts us in the right spot and knows where we need to be. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6946.86s)]
*  You just turn to your laptop, the system moves you and it does the overlay automatically. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6950.139999999999s)]
*  It kind of warps the room to put things in the spot that they need to be in. Everything has a [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6955.259999999999s)]
*  place in the room. Everything has a sense of presence or spatial consistency. And that kind [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6959.66s)]
*  of makes it feel like we're together with us and other things. I should also say you're not just [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6964.139999999999s)]
*  three-dimensional. It feels like you're leaning like out of the screen. You're like coming out [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6968.139999999999s)]
*  of the screen. You're not just in that world three-dimensional. Yeah, exactly. Holy crap. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6975.58s)]
*  Move back to center. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me tell you how this works. You probably [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6981.9s)]
*  already have the premise of it, but there's two things, two really hard things that we put [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6985.1s)]
*  together. One is a AI video model. So there's a set of cameras. You asked kind of about those [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6989.9s)]
*  earlier. There's six color cameras, just like webcams that we have today, taking video streams [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6995.5s)]
*  and feeding them into our AI model and turning that into a 3D video of you and I. It's effectively [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7001.18s)]
*  a light field. So it's kind of an interactive 3D video that you can see from any perspective. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7006.46s)]
*  That's transmitted over to the second thing, and that's a light field display. And it's happening [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7010.860000000001s)]
*  bidirectionally. I see you and you see me both in our light field displays. These are effectively [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7015.26s)]
*  flat televisions or flat displays, but they have the sense of dimensionality, depth, size is correct. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7020.3s)]
*  You can see shadows and lighting are correct, and everything's correct from your vantage point. So [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7027.82s)]
*  if you move around ever so slightly and I hold still, you see a different perspective. You see [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7033.099999999999s)]
*  kind of things that were included become reveal. You see shadows that move in the way they should [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7037.74s)]
*  move. All of that's computed and generated using our AI video model for you. It's based on your [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7042.219999999999s)]
*  eye position. Where does the right scene need to be placed in this light field display for you just [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7048.139999999999s)]
*  to feel present? It's real time, no latency. I'm not seeing, you weren't freezing up at all. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7052.54s)]
*  No, no, I hope not. I think it's you and I together, real time. That's what you need for [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7057.82s)]
*  real communication. And at a quality level, this is awesome. Realistic. Is it possible to do three [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7061.58s)]
*  people? Like is that gonna move that way also? Yeah, let me let me kind of show you. So if [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7068.139999999999s)]
*  if she enters the room with us, you can see her, you can see me. And if we had more people, [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7072.38s)]
*  you eventually lose a sense of presence, you kind of shrink people down, you lose a sense of scale. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7078.38s)]
*  So think of it as the window fits a certain number of people. If you want to fit a big group of [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7083.0199999999995s)]
*  people, you want, you know, the boardroom or the big room, you need like a much wider window. If [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7087.66s)]
*  you want to see, you know, just grandma and the kids, you can do smaller windows. So everybody has [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7092.139999999999s)]
*  a seat at the table, or everybody has a sense of where they belong. And there's kind of the sense [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7097.18s)]
*  of presence that's obeyed. If you have too many people, you kind of go back to like 2d metaphors [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7100.78s)]
*  that we're used to people in tiles placed anywhere. For the image I'm seeing, did you have to get [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7104.86s)]
*  scanned? I mean, I see you without being scanned. So it's just so much easier if you don't have to [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7108.62s)]
*  wear anything, you don't have to preach and you just do it the way it's supposed to happen without [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7112.78s)]
*  anybody having to learn anything or put anything on. I thought you had to solve the scanning problem, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7117.18s)]
*  but here you don't. It's just cameras. It's just vision. It's video. Yeah, we're not trying to kind [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7121.820000000001s)]
*  of make an approximation of you because everything you do every day matters. You know, I cut myself [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7128.38s)]
*  shaving, I put on a pin, all the little kind of, you know, aspects of you, those just happen. We [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7133.5s)]
*  don't have the time to scan or kind of capture those or dress avatars. We kind of appear as we [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7139.740000000001s)]
*  appear. And so all that's transmitted truthfully at topony. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7144.38s)]
*  Hi Chris, how you doing? Good to meet you. So as Max mentioned, we have glasses here. We start with [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7149.900000000001s)]
*  the foundation of great glasses, something stylish, lightweight, wearable. I'm going to say how can we [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7155.74s)]
*  build great technology and experiences on top of that. One of the core tenets of the Android [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7159.900000000001s)]
*  XR platform, this idea of a multimodal conversational device, see what you see, what you hear. So we've [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7164.62s)]
*  got a camera, you've got speakers, multiple microphones for speaker isolation. I'll give you [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7169.82s)]
*  a chance to try these yourself. Yeah, sorry, I woke it up there. Whoa. Yeah. So the first thing you see [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7175.099999999999s)]
*  is a super simple, straightforward home screen. So you probably see the time, the weather, calendar [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7181.74s)]
*  appointments there. This is designed to be sort of your one-stop shop for quick glanceable information [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7188.219999999999s)]
*  throughout the day. We want to do something that's easy to get what you need and then go back to what [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7192.78s)]
*  you're doing. So you can imagine, you know, turning on the display, getting that quick glance, then [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7197.18s)]
*  continuing on your way. You can be fully conversational at this point. You can ask [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7201.740000000001s)]
*  questions, for example, about the paintings. You can interrupt, you can ask follow-up questions. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7205.26s)]
*  As I mentioned before, if you want to at any time pause, you just tap there on the right. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7209.02s)]
*  Gemini, how much does this painting cost? The painting is called The Bridge of Lephaelib 1875 [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7212.54s)]
*  by Armand Guilmet. It appears to be a print and it would be impossible to know its cost without [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7219.66s)]
*  Okay, so this is fake. I understand. Why do humans pay so much money for paintings? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7225.5s)]
*  People pay a lot for paintings because of their artistic merit. The artist's [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7230.46s)]
*  thanks and cease and rarity and for the appreciation they earn. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7233.82s)]
*  So a few more things I want to show you just for sake of time. If you go ahead and long press on [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7238.06s)]
*  the side again to just loop Gemini there. There you go. Did you catch Google I.O. last week by any chance? [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7241.9s)]
*  So you might have seen on stage the Google Maps experience very briefly. I wanted to give you a [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7248.54s)]
*  chance to get a sense of what that feels like today. You can imagine you're walking down the [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7253.18s)]
*  street. If you look up like you're walking straight ahead, you get quick turn by turn directions. So [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7256.860000000001s)]
*  you have a sense of what the next turn is like. Nice. You're keeping your phone in your pocket. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7261.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's so intuitive. Sometimes you need that quick sense of which way is the right way. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7266.3s)]
*  Sometimes. Yeah. So let's say you're coming out of a subway, get out of a cab. You can just glance down [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7270.700000000001s)]
*  at your feet. We have it set up to translate from Russian to English. I think I get to wear the [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7275.18s)]
*  glasses. You speak to me if you don't mind. I can speak Russian. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7279.66s)]
*  I'm doing well. How are you doing? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7289.34s)]
*  Tempted to swear, tempted to say inappropriate things. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7292.94s)]
*  I see it transcribed in real time. And so obviously, you know, based on the different languages and [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7301.9s)]
*  the sequence of subjects and verbs, there's a slight delay sometimes, but it's really just [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7307.34s)]
*  like subtitles for the real world. Cool. Thank you for this. All right, back to me. Hopefully [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7311.02s)]
*  watching videos of me having my mind blown like the apes in 2001, Space Odyssey playing with [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7315.900000000001s)]
*  the monolith was somewhat interesting. Like I said, I was very impressed. And now I thought [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7322.46s)]
*  if it's okay, I could make a few additional comments about the episode and just in general. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7328.78s)]
*  In this conversation with Sundar Pichai, I discussed the concept of the Neolithic package, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7333.34s)]
*  which is the set of innovations that came along with the first agricultural revolution [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7339.26s)]
*  about 12,000 years ago, which included the formation of social hierarchies, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7343.74s)]
*  the early primitive forms of government, labor specialization, domestication of plants and [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7348.860000000001s)]
*  animals, early forms of trade, large scale cooperations of humans like that required to [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7354.46s)]
*  build, yes, the pyramids and temples like Gobekli Tepe. I think this may be the right way to [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7361.18s)]
*  actually talk about the inventions that changed human history, not just as a single invention, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7369.1s)]
*  but as a kind of network of innovations and transformations that came along with it. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7375.42s)]
*  And the productivity multiplier framework that I mentioned in the episode, I think is a nice way to [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7382.14s)]
*  try to concretize the impact of each of these inventions under consideration. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7388.22s)]
*  And we have to remember that each node in the network of the sort of fast follow on inventions [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7393.18s)]
*  is in itself a productivity multiplier. Some are additive, some are multiplicative. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7400.22s)]
*  So in some sense, the size of the network in the package is the thing that matters when you're [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7406.14s)]
*  trying to rank the impact of inventions on human history. The easy picks for the [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7413.02s)]
*  period of biggest transformation, at least in sort of modern day discourse, is the industrial [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7422.14s)]
*  revolution or even in the 20th century, the computer or the internet. I think it's because [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7429.18s)]
*  it's easiest to intuit for modern day humans, the impact, the exponential impact of those [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7436.38s)]
*  technologies. But recently, I suppose this changes week to week, but I have been doing a lot of [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7444.22s)]
*  reading on ancient human history. So recently my pick for the number one invention would have to [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7449.9800000000005s)]
*  be the first agricultural revolution, the Neolithic package that led to the formation of [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7455.1s)]
*  human civilizations. That's what enabled the scaling of the collective intelligence machine [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7461.98s)]
*  of humanity and for us to become the early bootloader for the next 10,000 years of [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7467.82s)]
*  technological progress, which yes includes AI and the tech that builds on top of AI. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7473.099999999999s)]
*  And of course, it could be argued that the word invention doesn't properly apply to the [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7480.139999999999s)]
*  agricultural revolution. I think actually Yvon Harari argues that it wasn't the humans [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7485.34s)]
*  who were the inventors, but a handful of plant species, namely wheat, rice, and potatoes. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7493.02s)]
*  This is strictly a fair perspective, but I'm having fun, like I said, with this discussion. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7500.62s)]
*  Here, I just think of the entire earth as a system that continuously transforms, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7506.860000000001s)]
*  and I'm using the term invention in that context, asking the question of when was the biggest leap [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7511.18s)]
*  on the log scale plot of human progress? Will AI, AGI, ASI eventually take the number one spot [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7518.14s)]
*  in this ranking? I think it has a very good chance to do so, due again to the size of the network of [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7527.02s)]
*  inventions that will come along with it. I think we discussed in this podcast the kind of things [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7534.38s)]
*  that would be included in the so-called AI package, but I think there's a lot more possibilities, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7541.66s)]
*  including discussed in previous podcasts, in many previous podcasts, including with Dari Elmadei [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7548.86s)]
*  talking on the biological innovation side, the science progress side. In this podcast, I think we [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7554.9400000000005s)]
*  talk about something that I'm particularly excited about in the near term, which is unlocking the [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7560.860000000001s)]
*  cognitive capacity of the entire landscape of brains that is the human species, making it [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7566.9400000000005s)]
*  more accessible through education and through machine translation, making information, knowledge, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7574.3s)]
*  and the rapid learning and innovation process accessible to more humans, to the entire 8 billion, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7580.7s)]
*  if you will. So I do think language or machine translation applied to all the different methods [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7589.18s)]
*  that we use on the internet to discover knowledge is a big unlock. But there are a lot of other stuff [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7596.780000000001s)]
*  in the so-called AI package, like discussed with Dario curing all major human diseases. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7603.42s)]
*  He really focuses on that in the Machines of Love and Grace essay. I think there will be huge leaps [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7608.62s)]
*  in productivity for human programmers and semi-autonomous human programmers. So humans [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7615.66s)]
*  in the loop, but most of the programming is done by AI agents. And then moving that towards a [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7621.099999999999s)]
*  superhuman AI researcher that's doing the research that develops and programs the AI system in itself. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7626.78s)]
*  I think there'll be huge transformative effects from autonomous vehicles. These are the things that [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7635.26s)]
*  we maybe don't immediately understand or we understand from an economics perspective, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7640.0599999999995s)]
*  but there will be a point when AI systems are able to interpret, understand, interact [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7645.42s)]
*  with the human world to a sufficient degree to where many of the manually controlled human [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7654.46s)]
*  in the loop systems we rely on become fully autonomous. And I think mobility is such a big [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7659.9800000000005s)]
*  part of human civilization that there will be effects on that. That they're not just economic, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7665.5s)]
*  but are social, cultural, and so on. And there's a lot more things I could talk about for a long [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7672.78s)]
*  time. So obviously the integration, utilization of AI in the creation of art, film, music, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7678.219999999999s)]
*  I think the digitalization and automating basic functions of government and then integrating AI [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7687.099999999999s)]
*  into that process, thereby decreasing corruption and costs and increasing transparency and [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7695.0199999999995s)]
*  efficiency. I think we as humans, individual humans will continue to transition further [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7701.34s)]
*  and further into cyborgs. So there's already AI in the loop of the human condition and that will [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7708.86s)]
*  become increasingly so as the AI becomes more powerful. The thing I'm obviously really excited [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7718.7s)]
*  about is major breakthroughs in science and not just on the medical front, but on physics. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7725.099999999999s)]
*  Fundamental physics, which would then lead to energy breakthroughs, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7730.86s)]
*  increasing the chance that we actually become a Kardashev type one civilization, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7735.82s)]
*  and then enabling us in so doing to do interstellar exploration of space and colonization of space. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7740.62s)]
*  I think they're also in the near term, much like with the industrial revolution that led to [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7747.9s)]
*  rapid specialization of skills and expertise, there might be a great sort of despecialization. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7756.06s)]
*  So as the AI system become superhuman experts of particular fields, there might be greater [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7763.740000000001s)]
*  and greater value to being the integrator of AIs for humans to be sort of generalists. And so [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7770.780000000001s)]
*  the great value of the human mind will come from the generalists, not the specialists. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7782.54s)]
*  That's a real possibility that that changes the way we are about the world. We want to know a [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7787.9s)]
*  little bit of a lot of things and move about the world in that way. That could have, when passing [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7792.62s)]

*  Also, as an aside, when thinking about the invention that was the greatest in human history, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7806.3s)]
*  again, for a bit of fun, we have to remember that all of them build on top of each other. And so [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7810.7s)]
*  we need to look at the Delta, the step change on the, I would say, impossibly to perfectly [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7816.3s)]

*  of life on earth. And a previous podcast guest, Nick Lane, does a great job of this in his book, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7827.26s)]
*  Life Ascending, listing these 10 major inventions throughout the evolution of life on earth, like [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7833.9s)]
*  DNA, photosynthesis, complex cells, sex, movement, sight, all those kinds of things. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7840.86s)]
*  I forget the full list that's on there, but I think that's so far from the human experience that [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7848.62s)]
*  my intuition about, let's say, productivity multipliers of those particular invention [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7854.46s)]
*  completely breaks down. And a different framework is needed to understand the impact [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7859.58s)]
*  of these inventions of evolution. The origin of life on earth, or even the Big Bang itself, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7865.740000000001s)]
*  of course, is the OG invention that set the stage for all the rest of it. And there are probably [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7872.3s)]
*  many more turtles under that which are yet to be discovered. So anyway, we live in interesting [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7881.18s)]

*  the set of negative trajectories, but not by much. So let's not mess this up. And now, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7895.26s)]
*  let me leave you with some words from French philosopher Jean de la Bruyère. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=7902.62s)]
