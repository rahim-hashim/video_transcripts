# Bill Ackman: Investing, Financial Battles, Harvard, DEI, X & Free Speech | Lex Fridman Podcast #413
**Lex Fridman:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgGKhsWhUu8)
*  The only person who can cause you more harm than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.
*  The following is a conversation with Bill Ackman, a legendary activist investor who has been part of some of the biggest and at times controversial trades in history.
*  Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter, and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in.
*  For example, he was a central figure in the resignation of the president of Harvard University, Claudine Gay, the saga of which we discuss in this episode.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Bill Ackman.
*  In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing, you mention a book, Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, as being formative in your life.
*  What key lesson do you take away from that book that informs your own investing?
*  Sure. Actually, it was the first investment book I read. And as such, it was kind of the inspiration for my career and a lot of my life.
*  So, important book. You know, bear in mind this is sort of after the Great Depression.
*  People lost confidence investing in markets. World War II. And then he writes this book. It's for like the average man.
*  And basically, he says that you have to understand the difference between price and value.
*  Right? Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. And he said the stock market is here to serve you.
*  Right? And it's a bit like the neighbor that comes by every day and makes you an offer for your house.
*  Makes you a stupid offer. You ignore it. Makes you a great offer. You can take it. And that's the stock market.
*  And the key is to figure out what something's worth. And you have to kind of weigh it.
*  He talked about the difference between, you know, the stock market in the short term is a voting machine.
*  It represents speculative interests, you know, supply and demand of people in the short term.
*  But in the long term, the stock market is a weighing machine. You're much more accurate.
*  It's going to tell you what something's worth. And so if you can divine what something's worth,
*  then you can really take advantage of the market because it's really here to help you.
*  And that's kind of the message of the book.
*  In that same way, there's a kind of difference between speculation and investing.
*  Yeah. Speculation is just a bit like buying, trading crypto. Right?
*  Strong words.
*  Well, short term trading crypto. Maybe in the long run, there's intrinsic value. But
*  the, you know, it's many investors, you know, in a bubble going into the, you know, the crash,
*  were really just pure speculators. They didn't know what things were worth.
*  They just knew they were going up. Right? That's speculation.
*  And investing is, you know, doing your homework, digging down, understanding a business,
*  understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry, understanding what management's
*  going to do, understanding what price you're going to pay, you know, the value of any
*  anything, I would say, other than love, let's say, is the present value of the cash you can
*  take out of it over its life. Now, some people think about love that way, but it's not,
*  it's not the right way to think about love, but it's, yeah. So investing is about
*  basically building a model of what this business is going to produce over its lifetime.
*  So how do you get to that? This idea of called value investing, how do you get to the value
*  of a thing, even like philosophically value of anything really, but we can just talk about
*  the things that are on the stock market. Sure. Companies, the value of a security,
*  is the present value of the cash you can take out of it over its life.
*  So if you think about a bond, you know, bond, you know, pays a 5% coupon interest rate. You get that,
*  let's say every year or twice a year split in half, and it's very predictable. And if it's a
*  U.S. government bond, you know, you're going to get it. So that's a pretty easy thing to value.
*  A stock is an interest in a business. It's like owning a piece of a company.
*  And a business, a profitable one is like a bond in that it generates these coupons or these earnings
*  or cashflow, you know, every year. The difference with a stock and a bond is that the bond, it's a
*  contract. You know what you're going to get as long as they don't go bankrupt and default.
*  With a stock, you have to make predictions about the business. You know, how many widgets are going
*  to sell this year? How many are going to sell next year? What are the costs going to be? How much of
*  the money that they generate? Do they need to reinvest in the business to keep the business going?
*  And that's more complicated. But, you know, what we do is we try to find businesses where,
*  with a very high degree of confidence, we know what those cash flows are going to be for a very
*  long time. And there are a few businesses that you can have really high degree of certainty about.
*  As a result, you know, many investments are speculations because it's really very difficult
*  to predict the future. So we, what we do for a living, what I do for a living is find those rare
*  companies that you can kind of predict what they're going to look like over a very long period of time.
*  So what are the factors that indicate that a company is something, is going to be something
*  that's going to make a lot of money, it's going to have a lot of value, and it's going to be reliable
*  over a long period of time? And what is your process of figuring out whether a company is
*  or isn't that? So every consumer has a view on different brands and different companies.
*  And, you know, what we look for are sort of these non-disruptible businesses, a business where you
*  can kind of close your eyes, stock market shuts for a decade, and you know that 10 years from now,
*  it's going to be a more valuable, more profitable company. So we own a business called Universal
*  Music Group. It's in the business of helping artists become global artists, sort of recorded
*  music business, and it's in the business of owning rights to the music publishing rights of
*  songwriters. And I think music is forever. Music is a many thousand year old part of the human
*  experience, and I think it will be thousands of years from now. And so that's a pretty good
*  backdrop to invest in a company. And the company basically owns a third of the global recorded
*  music. That's, you know, the most dominant sort of market share in the business. They're the best
*  at taking an artist who's 18 years old, who's got a great voice and has started to get a presence on
*  YouTube and Instagram and helping that artist become a superstar. And that's a unique talent,
*  and the result is the best artists in the world want to come work for them. But they also have
*  this incredible library of, you know, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, YouTube, etc. So,
*  and then if you think about what music has become, used to be about records and CDs and,
*  you know, eight track tapes, for those of whom it was about a new format, and that's how they drive
*  sales. And it's become a business, which is like the podcast business about streaming.
*  And you can streaming is a lot more predictable than with than selling records, right? You can
*  sort of say, okay, how many people have smartphones? How many people can have smartphones next year?
*  There's a kind of global penetration over time of smartphones. You pay call it 10,
*  11 bucks a month for a subscription or last for a family plan. And you can kind of build a model
*  of what the world looks like and predict, you know, the growth of the streaming business,
*  predict what kind of market share Universal is going to have over time. And you can't get to a
*  precise view of value. You can get to an approximation. And the key is to buy at a price
*  that represents a big discount to that approximation. And that gets back to Ben
*  Graham. Ben Graham was about what he called invented this concept of margin of safety,
*  right? You want to buy a company at a price that if you're wrong about what you think it's worth,
*  and it turns out to be worth 30% less, you paid a deep enough discount to your estimate
*  that you're still okay. It's about investing. A big part of investing is not losing money.
*  If you can avoid losing money and then have a few great hits, you can do very, very well over time.
*  Well, music is interesting because yes, music's been around for a very long time,
*  but the way to make money from music has been evolving. Like you mentioned streaming,
*  there's a big transition initiated by, I guess, Napster then created Spotify of how you make money
*  on music with Apple and with all of this. And the question is how well are companies
*  like UMG able to adjust to such transformations? One, I could ask you about the future,
*  which is artificial intelligence, being able to generate music, for example,
*  there've been a lot of amazing advancements with. So do you have to also think about that? Like when
*  you close your eyes, all the things you think about, are you imagining the possible ways that the
*  future is completely different from the present and how well this company will be able to surf
*  the wave of that? Sure. And they've had to surf a lot of waves. And actually the music business
*  peaked the last time in the late 90s or 2000 timeframe. And then really innovation, Napster,
*  digitization of music almost killed the industry. And Universal really led an effort to save the
*  industry and actually made an early deal with Spotify that enabled the industry to really
*  recover. And so by virtue of their market position and their credibility and their
*  willingness to adopt new technologies, they've kept their position. Now they, of course, had this
*  huge advantage because I think the Beatles are forever. I think U2 is forever. I think Rolling
*  Stones are forever. So they had a nice base of assets that were important and I think will forever
*  be. And forever is a long time. But again, there's enormous, there are all kinds of risks in every
*  business. This is one that I think is a very high degree of persistence. And I can't envision a world
*  where beyond streaming in a sense. Now you may have a Neuralink chip in your head instead of a
*  phone, but the music can come in a digitized format. You're going to want to have an infinite
*  library that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain. It's not going to matter that much
*  of the form factor. The device changes. It's not really that important, whether it's Spotify or
*  Apple or Amazon that are the so-called DSPs or the providers. I think the values really
*  can reside in the content owners and that's really the artists and the label.
*  And I actually think AI is not going to be the primary creator of music. I think we're going to
*  actually face the reality that it's not that music has been around for thousands of years, but
*  musicians and music has been around. We actually care to know who's the musician that created it.
*  Just like we want to know who's the artist, human artist that created a piece of art.
*  I totally agree. And I think if you think about it, there's lots of other technologies
*  and computers that have been used to generate music over time. But no one wants to, no one falls
*  in love with a computer generated track. Taylor Swift, incredible music, but it's also about the
*  artist and her story and her physical presence and the live experience. I don't think you're
*  going to sit there and someone's going to put a computer up on stage and then it's going to
*  play and people are going to get excited around it. So I think AI is really going to be a tool
*  to make artists better artists. And I think like a synthesizer,
*  right? Really created the opportunity for one man to have an orchestra.
*  Maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist, but maybe not. Maybe it drove even more demand for
*  the live experience. Unless that computer has human-like sentience, which I believe is a real
*  possibility. But then it's really from a business perspective, no different than a human.
*  If it has an identity, that's basically fame and influence and there'll be a robot Taylor Swift.
*  And it doesn't matter. That's a copyrightable asset, I would think.
*  Right. Yeah. And then there'll be- I'm not sure that's the world I'm excited about.
*  That's a different discussion. The world is not going to ask your permission to become what it's
*  becoming. So, well, you can still make money on it. Presumably there'd be a capital system and
*  there'd be some laws under which AI systems will have rights that are akin to human rights.
*  And we're going to have to contend with what that means.
*  Well, there's sort of name and likeness rights that have to be protected. Now, can a name
*  be attributed to a Tesla robot? I don't know.
*  I think so. I think it's quite obvious to me.
*  Okay. So those are more potential artists for us to represent at university.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  All right. That's sort of one example. Another example could be just the restaurant industry,
*  if you can look at businesses like McDonald's, right? It's a whatever. The company's like a 1950
*  vintage business and here we are, it's 75 years later. And you can kind of predict what it's
*  going to look like over time. And the menu is going to adjust over time to consumer tastes.
*  But I think the hamburger and fries is probably forever.
*  The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the hamburger and fries are forever.
*  I was eating at Chipotle last night as I was preparing these notes.
*  Thank you. Thank you.
*  And yeah, it is one of my favorite places to eat. You said it is a place that you eat.
*  You obviously also invest in it. What do you get at Chipotle?
*  I tend to get a double chicken.
*  Bowl or burrito?
*  I like the burrito, but I generally try to order the bowl.
*  Yeah.
*  Cut the carb part.
*  For health reasons. All right.
*  And you know, double chicken, guac, lettuce, black beans.
*  And I'm more of a steak guy, just putting that on the record.
*  What's the actual process you go through? Like literally, like the process of figuring out
*  what the value of a company is. Like how do you do the research?
*  Is it reading documents? Is it talking to people? How do you do it?
*  It's all of the above. So Chipotle, what attracted us initially is the stock price dropped by
*  about 50%. Great company, great concept. Athletes love it. Consumers love it.
*  Healthy, sustainable, fresh food made in front of your eyes. And great, Steve Ells, the founder,
*  did an amazing job. But ultimately, the company is lacking some of the systems
*  and had a food safety issue. Consumers got sick, almost killed their rent.
*  And the reality of the fast food quick service industry is almost every fast food company has
*  had a food safety issue over time. And the vast majority have survived. And we said,
*  look, such a great concept. But their approach was not as far from ideal.
*  But we start with usually reading the SEC filing. So companies file a 10K or an annual report.
*  They file these quarterly reports called 10Qs. They have a proxy statement, which describes
*  the governance, the board structure. Conference call transcripts are publicly available. It's
*  very helpful to go back five years and learn the story. Here's how management describes their
*  business. Here's what they say they're going to do. And then you can follow along to see what they
*  do. It's like a historical record of how competent and truthful they are. It's a very useful device.
*  Then of course, looking at competitors and thinking about what could dislodge this company.
*  If it's an industry we don't know well, we know the restaurant industry really well.
*  Music industry, we'll talk to people in the industry. We'll try to understand
*  the difference between publishing and recorded music. We'll look at the competitors.
*  We'll read books. I read a book about the music industry or a couple books about the industry.
*  So it's a bit like a big research project. There are these so-called expert networks now.
*  You can get pretty much anyone on the phone and they'll talk to you about an aspect of the
*  industry that you don't understand and want to learn more about. Try to get a sense.
*  Public filings of companies generally give you a lot of information, but not everything you want to
*  know. You can learn more by talking to experts about some of the industry dynamics, the
*  personalities. You want to get a sense of management. I like watching podcasts. If a CEO
*  were to do a podcast or a YouTube interview, you get a sense of the people.
*  So in the case of Chipotle, for example, by the way, I could talk about Chipotle all day.
*  I just love it. I love it. I wish there was a sponsor.
*  I'll mention it to the CEO.
*  Don't make promises you can't keep, Bill.
*  I'm not making it. Brian Nichols is a fantastic CEO. He's not going to spend one dollar that
*  doesn't think it's a company's best interest.
*  All right. All I want is for Chipotle. Come on now.
*  And so you look at a company like Chipotle and then you see there's a difficult moment in its
*  history. Like you said, that there was a food safety issue. And then you say, okay, well,
*  I see a path where we can fix this. And therefore, even though the price is low,
*  we can get it to where the price goes up to its value.
*  So the kind of business we're looking for is short of the kind of business everyone should be
*  looking for. A great business. It's got a long-term trajectory of growth out into the force, even
*  beyond the foreseeable distance. Those are the kind of businesses you want to own. You want
*  businesses that generate a lot of cash. You want businesses you can easily understand.
*  You want businesses with these sort of huge barriers to entry where it's difficult for others
*  to compete. You want companies that don't have to constantly raise capital. And these are some of
*  the great businesses of the world. But people figured out that those are the great businesses.
*  So the problem is those companies tend to have very high stock prices and the value is generally
*  built into the price you have to pay for the business. So we can't earn the kind of returns
*  we want to earn for investors by paying a really high price. Price matters a lot. You can buy the
*  best business in the world and if you overpay, you're not going to earn particularly attractive
*  returns. So we get involved in cases where a great business has kind of made a big mistake
*  or even a company that's kind of lost its way, but it's recoverable. And that's we buy from
*  shareholders who are disappointed, who've lost confidence, selling at a low price relative to
*  what it's worth if fixed. And then we try to be helpful in fixing the company.
*  You said that barriers to entry, you said a lot of really interesting qualities of companies very
*  quickly in a sequence of statements that took like less than 10 seconds to say. But some of them were
*  fascinating. All of them were fascinating. So you said barriers to entry. How do you know
*  if there's a type of moat protecting the competitors from stepping up to the plate?
*  The most difficult analysis to do as an investor is that. It's kind of figuring out how wide is the
*  moat? How much at risk is the business to disruption? And we're in, I would say, the
*  greatest period of disruptability in history. Technology, a couple of 19-year-olds can leave
*  whatever university or maybe they didn't go in the first place. They can raise millions of dollars.
*  They can get access to infinite bandwidth storage. They can contract with engineers in
*  low-cost markets around the world. They could build a virtual company and they can disrupt
*  businesses that seem super established over time. And then on top of that, you have major companies
*  with multi-trillion dollar market caps working to find profits wherever they can. And so that's a
*  dangerous world in a way to be an investor. And so you have to find businesses that it's hard to
*  foresee a world in which they get disrupted. And the beauty of the restaurant business,
*  and we actually, our best track record is in restaurants. We've never lost money.
*  We've only made a fortune, interestingly, investing in restaurants. A big part of it's
*  a really simple business. And if you get your potely right and you're at a hundred stores,
*  it's not so hard to envision getting to 200 stores and then getting to 500 stores.
*  And the key is maintaining the brand image, growing intelligently, having the right systems.
*  When you go from 100 stores to 3,500 stores, you have to know what you're doing. There's a
*  lot of complexity. If you think about your local restaurant, the family's working in the business,
*  they're watching the cash register and you can probably open another restaurant
*  across town. But there are very few restaurant operators that own more than a few
*  restaurants and operate them successfully. And the quick service business is about systems
*  and building a model that a stranger who doesn't know the restaurant industry can come in and
*  enter the business and build a successful franchise. Now Chipotle is not a franchise company.
*  They actually own all their own stores, but many of the most successful restaurant companies are
*  franchise models like a Burger King, a McDonald's, Tim Hortons, all these various brands, Popeyes.
*  And there it's about systems, but the same systems apply whether you own all the stores
*  and it's run by a big corporation or whether the owners of the restaurants are franchisees,
*  local entrepreneurs. So if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number, that means they've
*  figured out some kind of system that works. It's very difficult to develop that kind of system.
*  So that's a mode. A mode is you get to a certain scale and you do it successfully and the brand
*  is now understood by the consumer. And what's interesting about Chipotle is what they've
*  achieved is difficult. They're not buying frozen hamburgers getting shipped in. They're buying
*  fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients. They're preparing food in the store. That was a first.
*  Quality of the product at Chipotle is incredible. It's the highest quality food you can get.
*  You can get a serious dinner for under 20 bucks and eat really healthfully and very high quality
*  ingredients. And that's just not available anywhere else. And it's very hard to replicate
*  and to build those relationships with farmers around the country. It's a lot easier to make
*  a deal with one of the big massive food producers and buy your pork from them than to buy from a
*  whole bunch of farmers around the country. And so that is a big moat for Chipotle, very difficult
*  to replicate. And by the way, another company I think you have a stake in is McDonald's? No,
*  we own a company called Restaurant Brands. Restaurant Brands owns a number of quick service
*  companies, one of which is Burger King. Burger King. Okay. Well, it's been a meme for a while,
*  but Burger King is great too, Wendy's, whatever. But usually they go McDonald's. I'll just eat
*  burger patties. I don't know if you knew you could do this, but a burger patty at Burger King can do
*  this. McDonald's, it's actually way cheaper. They'll just sell you the patty. The patty. And
*  it's cheap. It's like a dollar 50 or $2 per patty. And it's about 250 calories and it's just meat.
*  And despite the criticism of memes out there, that's- Pretty healthy stuff. It's healthy stuff.
*  And so when I go, the healthiest I feel is when I do carnivore. It doesn't sound healthy, but if I
*  eat only meat, I feel really good. I lose weight. I have all this energy. It's crazy. And when I'm
*  traveling, the easiest way to get meat is that- So you go to McDonald's, you order six patties.
*  Exactly. So there's this sad meme of me just sitting alone in a car when I'm traveling,
*  just eating beef patties at McDonald's. But I love it. And you got to do what you love,
*  what makes you happy. And that's what makes me happy. Okay. We should maybe have Burger King
*  featuring in it. What about Flame Broiled? What's with these fried burgers? We've got to get you to
*  Burger King grilled burgers. Wait, is this like fast food trash? I didn't know. I don't know the
*  details of how they're made. I'm not- Ah, because should-
*  I don't have allegiance to McDonald's. I think we got a chance to switch you to Burger King.
*  Great. We'll see. I'm making so many deals today. It's wonderful. Okay. You were talking about most,
*  and this kind of remind me of Alphabet, the parent company.
*  Sure. It's a big position for us. So it's interesting that you think that maybe
*  Alphabet fits some of these characteristics. It's tricky to know with everything that's happening
*  in AI. And I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon. It's interesting that you think that there's a
*  moat. And it's also interesting to analyze it because the consumer is just a fan of technology.
*  Why is Google still around? It's not just the search engine is doing it all. The basics
*  of the business of search really well, but they're doing all these other stuff. So
*  what's your analysis of Alphabet? Why are you still positive about it?
*  Sure. So it's a business we've admired as a firm for, whatever, 15 years, but rarely got to a price
*  that we felt we could own it because again, the expectations were so high and price really matters.
*  Really the sort of AI scare, I would call it. Microsoft comes out with ChatGPT.
*  They do an amazing demonstration. People like this most incredible product. And Google,
*  which had been working on AI even earlier, obviously the Microsoft. Microsoft was behind
*  an AI. That was really their ChatGPT deal that gave them a kind of a market presence.
*  And then Google does this fairly disastrous demonstration of BARD. And the world says,
*  oh my God, Google's fallen behind in AI. AI is the future. Stock gets crushed.
*  Google gets to a price around 15 times earnings, which for a business of this quality is an
*  extremely, extremely low price. And our view on Google, one way to think about it, when a business
*  becomes a verb, that's usually a pretty good sign about the mode around the business. So you open
*  your computer and you open your search and very high percentage of the world starts with a Google
*  page and a one line. We type in your search. The Google advertising search YouTube franchise
*  is one of the most dominant franchises in the world. Very difficult to disrupt, extremely
*  profitable. The world is moving from offline advertising to online advertising. And that
*  trend, I think, continues. Why? Because you can actually see with your ads work. They used to
*  say about advertising, you spend a fortune and you just don't know which 50% of its works,
*  but you just sort of spend the money because you know ultimately that's going to bring in the
*  customer. And now with online advertising, you can see with granularity which dollars I'm spending.
*  When people click on the search term and end up buying something and I pay, it's a very high
*  return on investment for the advertiser and they really dominate that business. Now AI, of course,
*  is a risk. If all of a sudden people start searching or asking questions of chat GPT and
*  don't start with the Google search bar, that's a risk to the company. And so our view based on
*  work we had done and talked to industry experts is that Google, if anything, had a virtue of the
*  investment they've made, the time, the energy that people put into it. We felt their AI
*  capabilities were, if anything, potentially greater than Microsoft chat GPT and that the
*  market had overreacted. And because Google is a big company, global business, regulators
*  scrutinized it incredibly carefully, they couldn't take some of the same liberties.
*  A startup like OpenAI did in releasing a product and I think Google took a more cautious approach
*  in releasing an early version of Bard in terms of its capabilities. And that let the mark the world
*  to believe that they were behind. And we ultimately concluded if they're tied or ahead and you're
*  paying nothing for that potential business. And they also have huge advantages by virtue. You think
*  of all the data Google has, like the search data, all the various applications, email and otherwise,
*  and the Google suite of products, it's an incredible data set. So they have more training data
*  than pretty much any company in the world. They have incredible engineers, they have
*  enormous financial resources. So that was kind of the bet. And we still think it's probably the
*  cheapest of the big seven companies in terms of the price you're paying for the business relative
*  to its current earnings. It also is a business that has a lot of potential for efficiency.
*  Sometimes when you have this enormously profitable dominant company, all of the technology companies
*  in the post-March 20 world grew enormously in terms of their teams, and they probably over-hired.
*  And so you've seen some, you know, the Facebooks of the world and now even Google
*  starting to get a little more efficient in terms of their operations. So we paid a low multiple for
*  their business. One way to think about the value of the business is the price you pay for the earnings.
*  Or alternatively, what's the yield? If you flip over the price over the earnings, it gives you kind
*  of the yield of the business. So a 15 multiple is about almost a seven and a half percent yield.
*  And that earnings yield is growing over time as the business grows. That's a, you know, compared to
*  what you can earn lending your money to the government, you know, 4%. That's a very
*  attractive going in yield. And then there's all kinds of what we call optionality in all
*  the various businesses and investments they've made that are losing money. They've got a cloud
*  business that's growing very rapidly, but they're investing basically 100% of the profits from that
*  business and growth. So you're in that earnings number, you're not seeing any earnings from the
*  cloud business and you know, they're one of the top cloud players. So very interesting,
*  generally well managed company with incredible assets and resources and dominance, you know,
*  and has no debt. It's got a ton of cash and so pretty good story.
*  LW is there something fundamentally different about AI that makes all of this more complicated,
*  which is the sort of the exponential possibilities of the kinds of products and impact that
*  AI could create when you're looking at Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, all these companies,
*  XAI, or maybe startups? Like is there some more risk introduced by the possibilities of AI?
*  Absolutely. That's a great question. You know, business investing is about finding
*  companies that can't be disrupted. AI is the ultimate disruptible asset or technology and
*  that's what makes investing treacherous is that you own a business that's enormously profitable,
*  management gets, if you will, fat and happy, and then a new technology emerges that just
*  takes away all their profitability. And AI is this incredibly powerful tool, which is why
*  every business is saying, how can I use AI in my business to make us more profitable,
*  more successful, grow faster, and also disrupt or protect ourselves from the incomings?
*  Buffett talks about a great business like a castle surrounded by this really wide moat,
*  but you have all these barbarians trying to get in and steal the princess. And it happens. Kodak,
*  for example, was an amazing, incredibly dominant company until it disappeared. Polaroid,
*  this incredible technology. And that's why we have tended to stay away from companies that
*  are technology companies because technology companies, generally the world is such a
*  dynamic place that someone's always working on a better version. And Kodak was caught up in the
*  analog film world and then the world changed. Well, Google is pretty fat and happy until
*  Chagy Patek came out. How would you rate their ability to wake up, lose weight, and be less
*  happy and aggressively rediscover their search for happiness? I think you've seen a lot of that
*  in the last year. And I would say some combination of embarrassment and pride are huge motivators
*  for everyone from Sergey Brin to the management of the company. And Demis Asab is thrown into
*  the picture and all of DeepMind teams and the unification of teams and all the shakeups. It
*  was interesting to watch the chaos. I love it. I love it when everybody freaks out. Like you said,
*  partly embarrassment and partly that competitive drive that drives engineers is great. I can't wait
*  to see what they've diminished a lot of improvement in the product. Let's see where it goes.
*  You mentioned management. How do you analyze the governance structure and the individual humans
*  that are the managers of a company? So as I like to say, incentives drive all human behavior.
*  And that certainly applies in the business world. So understanding the people and what drives them
*  and what the actual financial and other incentives of a business are a very important
*  part of the analysis for investing in a company. And you can learn a lot. I mentioned before one
*  great way to learn about a business is go back a decade and read everything that management has
*  written about the business and see what they've done over time. See what they've said. Conference
*  calls are actually relatively recent. When I started in the business, there weren't
*  conference call transcripts. Now you have a written record of everything management has said
*  in response to questions from analysts at conferences and otherwise. And so just you
*  learn a lot about people by listening to what they say, how they answer questions,
*  and ultimately their track record for doing what they say they're going to do. Do they under
*  promise and over deliver? Do they over promise and under deliver? Do they say what they're going to
*  do? Do they admit mistakes? Do they build great teams? Do people want to come work for them?
*  Are they able to retain their talent? And then part of it is how much are they running the business
*  for the benefit of the business? How much are they running the business for the benefit of themselves?
*  And that's kind of the analysis you do. Are we talking about CEO, COO? What does management mean?
*  How deep does it go? Sure. So this very senior management matters enormously. We use the
*  Chipotle example. Steve Ells, great entrepreneur, business got to a scale he really couldn't
*  run it. We recruited a guy named Brian, helped a company recruit a guy named Brian Nickel.
*  And he was considered the best person in the quick service industry. He came in and completely
*  rebuilt the company. Actually, we moved the company. Chipotle was moved to California.
*  And sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company is just to move it geographically.
*  And then you can kind of reboot the business. But a great leader has great followership.
*  Over the course of their career, they'll have a team they've built that will come follow them
*  into the next opportunity. But the key is really the top person matters enormously.
*  And then it's who they recruit. You recruit an A plus leader and they're going to recruit other A
*  type people. You grew a B leader, you're not going to recruit any great talent beneath them.
*  You mentioned Warren Buffett. You said you admire him as an investor. What do you find
*  most interesting and powerful about his approach? What aspects of his approach to investing do you
*  also practice? Sure. So most of what I've learned in the investment business, I learned from Warren
*  Buffett. He's been my great professor of this business. My first book I read in the business
*  was the Ben Graham Intelligent Investor. But fairly quickly you get to learn about Warren Buffett.
*  And I started by reading the Berkshire Hathaway Ender Reports. And then I eventually got the
*  Buffett Partnership Letters that you can see, which are an amazing read to go back to the
*  mid 1950s and read what he wrote to his limited partners when he first started out and just
*  follow that trajectory over a long period of time. So what's remarkable about him is one
*  duration, right? He's still at it at 93. Two, it takes a very long term view.
*  But a big thing that you learn from him, investing requires this incredible, dispassionate,
*  unemotional quality. You have to be extremely economically rational, which is not a basic,
*  it's not something you learn in the jungle. I don't think it's something that, if you think
*  about the surviving the jungle, the lion shows up and everyone starts running, you run with them.
*  That does not work well in markets. In fact, you generally have to do the opposite, right?
*  When the lemmings are running over the cliff, that's the time where you're facing the other
*  direction and you're running the other direction, i.e. you're stepping in, you're buying stocks at
*  really low prices. Buffett's been great at that and great at teaching about what he calls temperament,
*  which is this sort of emotional kind of or unemotional quality that you need to be able
*  to dispassionately look at the world and say, okay, is this a real risk? Are people overreacting?
*  People tend to get excited about investments when stocks are going up and they get depressed when
*  they're going down. And I think that's just inherently human. You have to reverse that.
*  You have to get excited when things get cheaper and you got to get concerned when things get more
*  expensive. You've been a part of some big battles, some big losses, some big wins.
*  So it's been a roller coaster. So in terms of temperament, psychologically, how do you
*  not let that break you? How do you maintain a calm demeanor and avoid running with the lemmings?
*  I think it's something you kind of learn over time. A key success factor is you want to have
*  enough money in the bank that you're going to survive regardless of what's going on with
*  volatility in markets. One, you shouldn't borrow money. So if you borrow money, you own stocks on
*  margin, markets are going down and you have your livelihood at risk, it's very difficult to be
*  rational. So a key is getting yourself to a place where you're financially secure. You're not going
*  to lose your house. That's a kind of a key thing. And then also doing your homework.
*  Stocks can trade at any price in the short term. And if you know what a business is worth
*  and you understand the management, you know it extremely well. It doesn't bother you when
*  a stock price goes down or it has much less impact on you because you know, again, as Mr. Graham said,
*  the short term markets are voting machine. You have a bunch of lemmings voting one direction.
*  That's concerning. But if it's a great business, doesn't have a lot of debt,
*  and people are going to just listen to more music next year than this year, you know you're going
*  to do well. So it's a bit some combination of being personally secure and also just knowing
*  what you own. And over time, you build a calluses, I would say. So psychologically, just as a human
*  being, speaking of lines and gazelles and all this kind of stuff, is there some,
*  is it as simple as just being financially secure? Is there some just human qualities
*  that you have to be born with slash develop? I think so. I think now I'm a pretty emotional
*  person, I would say, or feel pretty strong emotions, but not in investing. I'm remarkably
*  immune to kind of volatility. And that's a big advantage. And it took some time for me to develop
*  that. So you weren't born with that, you think? No. So being emotional, do you want to respond to
*  volatility? Yeah. And you just, it's a bit, again, you can learn a lot from other people's experience.
*  It's one of the few businesses where you can learn an enormous amount by reading about other periods
*  in history, following Buffett's career, the mistakes he made. If you're investing a lot of
*  capital, every one of your mistakes can be big. So we've made big mistakes. The good news is that
*  the vast majority of things we've done have worked out really well. And so that also gives you
*  confidence over time. But because we make very few investments, we own eight things today or seven
*  companies of that matter. If we get one wrong, it's going to be big news. And so the other
*  nature of our business you have to be comfortable with is a lot of public scrutiny, a lot of public
*  criticism, and that requires some experience. I think we'll talk about some of that.
*  Financially secure is something I believe also recommend for even just everyday investors. Is
*  there some general advice from the things you've been talking about that applies to everyday
*  investors? Sure. So never invest money you can't afford to lose. Where it would, if you lost this
*  money, you lose your house, et cetera. So having, being in a place where you're investing money
*  that you don't care about the price in the short term, it's money for your retirement,
*  and you take a really long-term view. I think that's key. Never investing where you borrow
*  money against your securities. The markets offer you the opportunity to leverage your investment.
*  And in most worlds, you'll be okay. Except if there's a financial crisis or a nuclear device
*  gets detonated, God forbid, somewhere in the world. Or there's an unexpected war, or someone kills a
*  leader unexpectedly. Things happen that can change the course of history, and markets react
*  very negatively to those kinds of events. And you can own the greatest business in the world,
*  trading for a hundred dollars a share, and next moment it could be 50. So as long as you
*  don't borrow against securities, you own really high quality businesses, and it's not money that
*  you need in the short term, then you can actually be thoughtful about it. And that is a huge
*  advantage. The vast majority of investors, it seems, tend to be the ones that panic and
*  the downturns get over-related when markets are doing well.
*  LW So be able to think long-term and be sufficiently financially secure such that you can afford
*  to think long-term.
*  DFB Yeah, Buffett is the ultimate long-term thinker. And just the decisions he makes,
*  the consistency of the decisions he's made over time, and fitting into that sort of long-term
*  framework is a very educational, let's put it that way, for learning about this business.
*  LW So you mentioned eight companies, but what do you think about mutual funds for everyday
*  investors that diversify across a larger number of companies?
*  DFB I think there are very few mutual funds. There are thousands and thousands of mutual funds.
*  There are very few that earn their keep in terms of the fees they charge. They tend to be too
*  diversified and too short-term, and you're often much better off just buying an index fund.
*  Many of them perform, if you look carefully at their portfolios, they're not so different from
*  the underlying index itself, and you tend to pay a much higher fee. Now, all of that being said,
*  there's some very talented mutual fund managers. A guy named Will Danoff at Fidelity has had a great
*  record over a long period of time. The famous Peter Lynch, Ron Barron, another great long-term
*  growth stock investor. So there's some great mutual funds, but I put them in the handful
*  versus the thousands. And if you're in the thousands, I'd rather someone bought just an
*  index fund basically. LW Yeah, index funds.
*  But what would be the leap for an everyday investor to go to investing in a small number
*  of companies, like two, three, four, five companies? DFB I even recommend for individual investors to
*  invest in a dozen companies. You don't get that much more benefit of diversification going from
*  a dozen to 25 or even 50. Most of the benefits of diversification come in the first, call it 10 or
*  12. And if you're investing in businesses that don't have a lot of debt, they're businesses that
*  you can understand yourself. You understand, you know, actually individual investors did a much
*  better job analyzing Tesla than the so-called professional investors or analysts, the vast
*  majority of them. So if it's a business, you understand, if you bought a Tesla, you understand
*  the product and its appeal to consumers. You know, it's a good place to start when you're
*  analyzing a company. So I would invest in things you can understand. That's kind of a key,
*  you know, you like Chipotle, you understand why they're successful. You can go there every week
*  and you can monitor, you know, is anything changing? How these new kind of, how's chicken
*  al pastor? Is that a good upgrade from the basic chicken? You know, the drink offering's improving,
*  the store's clean. I think you should invest in companies you really understand, simple businesses
*  where you can predict with a high degree of confidence what it's going to look like over time.
*  And if you do that in a not particularly concentrated fashion and you don't borrow money
*  against your securities, you'll probably do much better than your typical mutual fund.
*  Yeah, it's interesting. Consumers that love a thing are actually good analysts of that thing,
*  or I guess a good starting point. By the way, there's much more information available today.
*  When I was first investing, literally we had people faxing us documents from the SEC filings
*  in Washington, DC. Now everything's available online. Conference call transcripts are free.
*  You know, you have AI, you know, you have unlimited data and all kinds of message boards and
*  Reddit forums and things where people are, you know, sharing advice. And everyone has their own,
*  you know, by virtue of their career or experience, they'll know about an industry
*  or a business. And that gives them, I would take advantage of your own competitive advantages.
*  I'm just afraid if I invest in Chipotle, I'll be like analyzing every little change of menu
*  from a financial perspective and just be very critical.
*  If it's going to affect your experience, I wouldn't buy the stock.
*  Yeah, I mean, I should also say that I am somebody that emotionally does respond to
*  volatility, which is why I've never bought index funds. And I just noticed myself psychologically
*  being affected by the ups and downs of the market. I want to tune out because if I'm at all tuned in,
*  it has a negative impact on my life. Yeah, that's really important.
*  Can you explain what activist investing is? You've been talking about investing and then
*  looking at companies when they're struggling, stepping in and reconfiguring things within that
*  company and helping it become great. So that's part of it. But let's just zoom out. What's this
*  idea of activist investing? I think recently in the last couple of days, I read an article saying
*  that more than 50% of the capital in the world today invests in the stock market's passive,
*  indexed money. And that's the most passive form. So if you think about an index fund,
*  a machine buys a fixed set of securities in certain proportion. There's no human judgment
*  at all. And there's no real person behind it in a way. They never take steps to improve a business.
*  They just quietly own securities. What we do is we invest our capital in a handful of things.
*  We get to know them really, really well because you're going to put 20% of your assets in
*  something. You need to know it really well. But once you become a big holder, and if you've got
*  some thoughts on how to make a business more valuable, you can do more than just be a passive
*  investor. So our strategy is built upon finding great companies in some cases that have lost
*  their way and then helping them succeed. And we can do that with ideas from outside the boardroom.
*  Sometimes we take a seat on a board or more than one. And we work with the best management
*  teams in the world to help these businesses succeed. So when I first went into this business,
*  no one knew who we were. And we didn't have that much money. And so to influence what was to us a
*  big company, we had to make a fair bit more noise. So we would buy a stake, we'd announce
*  it publicly, we'd attempt to engage with management. The first activist investment we made at Persian
*  Square was Wendy's. I couldn't get the CEO to ever return my call. He didn't return my call.
*  So we actually, in that case, our idea was Wendy's owned a company called Tim Hortons,
*  which was this coffee donut chain. And you could buy Wendy's for basically $5 billion.
*  $5 billion. And they owned 100% of Tim Hortons, which itself was worth more than $5 billion. So
*  you could literally buy Wendy's, separate Tim Hortons and get Wendy's for negative value.
*  That seemed like a pretty good opportunity, even though the business wasn't doing that well.
*  So we bought the stake, called the CEO, couldn't get a meeting, nothing. So we hired actually
*  Blackstone, which was at that time had an investment bank. And we hired them to do what's
*  called a fairness opinion of what Wendy's would be worth if they followed our advice. And they
*  agreed to do it, paid them a fee for it. And then we've mailed in a letter with a copy of the
*  fairness opinion saying Wendy's would basically be worth 80% more if they did what we said.
*  And six weeks later, they did what we said. So that's activism, at least an early form of activism.
*  With that kind of under our belt, we have a little more credibility. And now we started to take things
*  and stakes in companies. The media would pay attention. So the media became kind of an
*  important partner. And some combination of shame, embarrassment and opportunity,
*  motivated management teams to do the right thing. And then beyond that, there's certain steps you
*  can take if management's recalcitrant and the shareholders are on your side. But it's a bit
*  like running for office. You've got to get all the constituents to support you and your ideas.
*  And if they support you and your ideas, you can overthrow, if you will, the board of a company.
*  You bring in new talent and then take over the management of a business. And that's the most
*  extreme form of activism. So that's kind of the early days and what we did. And a lot of the early
*  things that we did were what we call sort of like investment banking activism, where we'd go in and
*  recommend something a good investment bank would have recommended. And if they do it, we make a
*  bunch of money. And then we moved on to the next one. And then we realized an investment, a company
*  called General Growth, was the first time we took a board seat on a company. And there was
*  some financial restructuring and also an opportunity to improve the operations of the
*  business, sit on the board of a company. And that was one of the best investments we ever made.
*  And we said, okay, we can do more than just be an outside the boardroom investor. And we can get
*  involved in helping select the right management teams and helping guide the right management
*  teams. And then we've done that over years. And then I would say the last seven years,
*  we haven't had to be an activist. An activist is generally someone who's outside banging on the
*  door trying to get in. We've sort of built enough credibility that they open the door, and they say,
*  hey, Bill, what ideas do you have? So welcome, would you like to join the board? We're treated
*  differently today than we were in the beginning. And that is, I would say some people might just
*  call it being an engaged owner. By the way, that's the way investing was done in the Andrew Carnegie
*  JP Morgan days, 150 years ago. You had these iconic business leaders that would own 20% of
*  US steel. And when things would go wrong, they'd replace the board and the management and fix them.
*  And over time, we went to a world where mutual funds were created like in the 1920s, 30s,
*  index funds with Vanguard and others. And that all these controlling shareholders would kind of
*  give their stock to society or their children and multiple generations. And there were no longer
*  kind of controlling owners of businesses or very few. And that led to underperformance and the
*  opportunity for activists over time. And what activism has done, and I think we've helped lead
*  this movement, is it restored kind of the balance of power between the owners of the business
*  and the management of the company. And that's been a very good thing for the performance
*  of the US stock market, actually. So the owners meaning the shareholders.
*  And so there's a more direct channel of communication with activists investing
*  between the shareholders and the people running the company.
*  Yes. So activists generally never own more than 5% or 10% of a business. So they don't have control.
*  So the way they get influence is they have to convince the other,
*  they have to get to sort of majority of the other shareholders to support them.
*  And if they can get that kind of support, they can behave almost like a controlling
*  shareholder. And that's how it works. So the running of companies,
*  according to Bill Ackman, is more democratic now.
*  It is. It is. But you need some thought leaders. So activists are kind of thought leaders,
*  because they can spend the time and the money. A retail investor that owns a thousand shares doesn't
*  have the resources or the time. They got a day job. Whereas an activist day job is finding the
*  handful of things where there are opportunities.
*  So on average, is it good to have such an engaged, powerful, influential investor
*  helping control direct the direction of a company?
*  It depends whether that investor is. But generally, I think it's a good thing.
*  And that's why, you know, one of the problems with being CEO of a company today and having
*  a very diversified shareholder base is the kind of short term, long term balance.
*  And you have investors who have all different interests in terms of what they want to achieve
*  and when they want it achieved. And CEO of a new company, a new CEO of an old company, let's say,
*  hasn't had the chance to develop the credibility to make the kind of longer term decisions and can
*  be stuck in a cycle of being judged on a quarterly basis. And a business, the best businesses are
*  forever assets. And decisions you make now have impact three, four or five years from now.
*  In order to make and sometimes there are decisions we make that have the effect of reducing the
*  earnings of a company in the short term, because in the long term, it's going to make the business
*  much more valuable. But sometimes it's hard to have that kind of credibility when you're a new
*  CEO of a company. So when you have a major owner that's respected by other shareholders,
*  sitting on the board saying, hey, the CEO is doing the right thing and making this
*  expensive investment in a new factory, we're spending more money on R&D, because we're
*  developing something that's going to pay off over time. That large owner on the board can help
*  buy the time necessary for management to behave in a longer term way. And that's, I think,
*  good for all the shareholders. So that's the good story, but can it get bad? Can you have a CEO who
*  is a visionary and sees the long term future of a company and an investor come in and have very
*  selfish interest in just making more money in the short term and therefore destroy and
*  and manipulate the opinions of the shareholders and other people on the board in order to
*  sink the company, maybe increase the price, but destroy the possibility of long term value?
*  It could theoretically happen. But again, the activist in your example,
*  which only doesn't own a lot of stock, the shareholder basis today, the biggest shareholders
*  are these index funds that are forever, right? The Black Rock, Vanguard, State Street,
*  their ownership stakes are just at this point only growing because of the inflows of capital
*  they have from shareholders. So they have to think or they should think very long term,
*  and they're going to be very skeptical of someone coming in with a short term idea
*  that drives the stock price up in the next six months, but impairs the company's long term
*  ability to compete. And basically that ownership group prevents this kind of activity from really
*  happening. So people are generally skeptical short term activist investors. Yes. And they're very
*  few. I don't really know any short term activist investors. That's not ones with credibility.
*  You mentioned general growth. I read somewhere called arguably one of the best hedge fund trades
*  of all time. So I guess it went from $60 million to over $3 billion.
*  All right. It was a good one. All right. But it wasn't a trade. I wouldn't describe it as a trade.
*  A trade is something you buy and you flip. This is something where we made the investment initially
*  in November of 2008. And we still own a company we spun off of general growth and it's now 15
*  years later. So can you describe what went into making that decision to actually increase
*  the value of the company? Sure. So this was at the time of the financial crisis,
*  circa November 2008. Real estate has always been a kind of sector that I've been interested in.
*  I began my career in the real estate business working for my dad actually,
*  arranging mortgages for real estate developers. So I have kind of deep, deep ties and interest
*  in the business. And general growth was the second largest shopping mall company in the country.
*  Simon properties, many people have heard of general growth was number two. They own some of
*  the best malls in the country. And at that time, people thought of shopping malls as these non
*  disruptible things. Again, we talk about disruption. Malls have been disrupted in many ways.
*  And general growth stock, the company, the CFO in particular was very aggressive in the way that he
*  borrowed money. And he borrowed money from a kind of Wall Street, not long-term mortgages,
*  but generally relatively short-term mortgages. It was pretty aggressive. As the value went up,
*  he would borrow more and more against the assets and that helped the short-term results of the
*  business. The problem was during the financial crisis, the market for what's called CNBS,
*  commercial mortgage backed securities basically shut. And the company, because its debt was
*  relatively short-term, had a lot of big maturities coming up that they had no ability to refinance.
*  And the market said, oh my God, the lenders are going to foreclose and the shareholders are going
*  to get wiped, the company is going to go bankrupt, they're going to get wiped out. The stock went
*  from $63 a share to 34 cents. And there was a family, the Bucksbound family owned, I think,
*  about 25% of the company and they had a $5 billion of stock that was worth $25 billion or something
*  by the time we bought a stake in the business. And what interested me was I thought the assets
*  were worth substantially more than the liabilities. The company had $27 billion of debt and had $100
*  million value of the equity down from like 20 billion. Okay. And one that's sort of an
*  interesting place to start with the stock down 99%. But the fundamental drivers, the mall business
*  are occupancy, how occupied are the malls. Occupancy was up year on year between 07 and 08,
*  interestingly. Net operating income, which is kind of a measure of cashflow from the malls,
*  that was up year on year. So kind of the underlying fundamentals were doing fine.
*  The only problem they had is they had billions of dollars of debt that they had to repay,
*  they couldn't repay. And if you kind of examine the bankruptcy code,
*  it's precisely designed for a situation like this, where it's kind of this resting place you can go
*  to kind of restructure your business. Now, the problem was that every other company that had
*  gone bankrupt, the shareholders got wiped out. And so the market seeing every previous example,
*  the shareholders get wiped out, the assumption is the stock is going to go to zero. But that's
*  not what the bankruptcy code says. What the bankruptcy code says is that the value gets
*  apportioned based on value. And if you could prove to a judge that there was the assets worth more
*  than the liabilities, then the shareholders actually get to keep their investment in the company.
*  And that was the bet we made. And so we stepped into the market and we bought 25% of the company
*  in the open market for we had to pay up started out at 34 cents, I think there were 300 million
*  shares. So it was at $100 million value. By the time we were done, we paid an average of
*  we paid 60 million for 25% of the business. So about $240 million for the equity of the company.
*  And then we had to get on the board to convince the directors the right thing to do. And the board was
*  in complete panic, didn't know what to do, spending a ton of money on advisors.
*  And, you know, I was a shareholder activist, you know, four years into Pershing Square,
*  and no one had any idea what we were doing. I thought we were crazy. Every day, every day
*  we go into the market, we'd buy this penny stock. And we'd file what's called a 13 D,
*  every 1% increase in our stake. And people just thought we were crazy. We're buying stock in a
*  company that's going to go bankrupt, bill, you're gonna lose all your money. You know, run. Okay.
*  And I said, well, wait, you know, bankruptcy code says that if there's more asset value than
*  liabilities, we should be fine. And the key moment, if you're looking for fun moments,
*  is there's a woman named Maddie Buxbaum, who was from the Buxbaum family. And her cousin, John,
*  was chairman of the board, CEO of the company. And I said, as she calls me after we disclose
*  our stake in the company, she's like, Billy Ackman, I'm really glad to see you here. And I met her
*  like, I don't think it was a date, but I kind of met her in a social context when I was like 25
*  or something. And she said, Look, I'm really glad to see you here. And it's anything I can do
*  to help you. Call me. I said, Sure. We kept trying to get on the board of the company,
*  they wouldn't invite us on, couldn't really run a proxy contest that you know, not with a company
*  going bankrupt. And their advisors actually were Goldman Sachs. And they're like, you don't want
*  the Fox in the hen house. And they were listening to their advisors. So I called Maddie up. And I
*  said, Maddie, I need to get on the board of the company to help. And she says, you know what,
*  I will call my cousin, I'll get it done. Like, you know, she calls back a few hours later,
*  you'll be going on to the board. I don't know what she said.
*  What she was convincing. Next thing you know, I'm invited to on the board of the company.
*  And the board is talking about the old equity of general growth. Old equity is what you talk
*  about the shareholders are getting wiped out. I said, No, no, no, this board represents
*  the current equity of the company. And I'm a major shareholder, john's a major shareholder,
*  there's plenty of asset value here, this company should be able to restructure restructure for the
*  benefit of shareholders. And we led a restructuring for the benefit of shareholders. And it took,
*  let's say, eight months, and the company emerged from chapter 11, we made an incremental investment
*  into the company. And the shareholders kept the vast majority of their investment, all the creditors
*  got their face amount of their investment par plus acute crude interest. And it was a great
*  outcome. All the employees kept their jobs, the mall stayed open, there was no liquidation,
*  the bankruptcy system worked the way it should. You know, I was in court, you know, all the time.
*  And the first meeting with the judge, the judges like, look, this would never have happened were
*  it not for a financial crisis. And once the judge said I knew we were going to be fine,
*  because the company really not done anything fundamentally wrong, maybe a little too aggressive
*  in how they borrowed money. And stock went from 34 cents to $31 a share. And actually fun little
*  anecdote, we made a lot of people a lot of money who followed us into it. I got a lot of nice thank
*  you notes, which you get on occasion in this business, believe it or not. And then one day,
*  I get a voicemail. This is when there was something called voicemail, probably a few years later.
*  And it's a guy with a very thick Jamaican accent, leaving a message for Bill Ackman. So you know,
*  I return all my calls, call the guy back. He's like, Hi, it's Bill Ackman. I'm just returning
*  your call. He's like, Oh, Mr. Ackman. Thank you so much for calling me. I said, Oh, how can I help?
*  He says, I wanted to thank you. I said, What do you mean? He said, I saw you on CNBC, you know,
*  a couple years ago, and you were talking about this general growth. And the stock I said,
*  where was the stock at the time? He said, it's 60 cents or something like this. And I bought a lot
*  of stock. And I'm like, well, how much did you invest? Oh, I invest all of my money in the company.
*  And he was a New York City taxi driver. And he invested like $50,000 or something like this at
*  60 cents a share. And he was still holding it. And he went into retirement. And he made, you know,
*  50 times his money. And, you know, those are the moments that you feel pretty good about investing.
*  We'll give you confidence through that once a penny stock. And I'm sure you were getting a lot
*  of naysayers and people saying that this is crazy. It's the same thing. You just do the work. Like,
*  we got a lot of pushback from our investors, actually, because we had never invested in a
*  bankrupt company before. It's a field called distressed investing. And they're dedicated,
*  distressed investors, and we weren't considered one of them. So Bill, what are you doing? You
*  don't know anything about distressed investing. You don't know anything about bankruptcy investing.
*  But I can read. And you learned. And I learned. And it sometimes is very helpful not to be a
*  practitioner, an expert in something, because you get used to the conventional wisdom. And so we just,
*  you know, abstractly read the step back and look at the facts. And it was just a really interesting
*  setup for one of the best investments we ever made. How hard is it to learn some of the legal
*  aspects of this? Like you mentioned bankruptcy code. Like I imagine it's very sort of dense
*  language and dense ideas and the loopholes and all that kind of stuff. Like if you're just stepping
*  in and you've never done distressed investing, how hard is it to figure out? It's not that hard.
*  No, it's not that hard. Okay. I mean, I literally read a book on distressed investing.
*  Okay. Ben Branch or something, something on distressed invest. So you were able to pick
*  up the intuition from that. Just all the basic skills involved, the basic facts to know,
*  all that kind of stuff. Most of the world's knowledge has already been written somewhere.
*  You just got to read the right books. And also had great lawyers. You know, built up some great
*  relationships. We work with Sullivan and Cromwell and the lawyer there named Joe Schenker, who I
*  met earlier in my career. Pershing Square is actually my second act in the hedge fund business.
*  I started a fund called Gotham Partners when I was 26. One of my early investments was a company
*  called Rockefeller Center Properties that was heading for bankruptcy. And the lawyer on the
*  other side representing Goldman Sachs was a guy named Joe Schenker. So he was like an obvious
*  phone call because we had yet another real estate bankruptcy. And that one we did very well, but I
*  missed the big opportunity. And I suffered severe psychological torture every time I walked by
*  Rockefeller Center because we could have made, we knew more about that property than anyone else,
*  but I knew less about deal making and didn't have the resources. And I was 28 years old or 27.
*  And they hired a better lawyer than we did. And they outsmarted us on that one in a way.
*  So I said, okay, I'm going to go hire this guy the next time around.
*  Okay. We'll probably talk about Rockefeller Center and some failures. But first you said Fox in the
*  hen house. Yes. Something that the board and the chairman were worried about. Why would they call
*  you a Fox? So you keep saying activists investing is nothing to worry about. It's always good.
*  Sure. Mostly good. But that expression applied in this context, they were still worried about that.
*  Sure. And so maybe there's a million questions here, but first of all, what is the process of
*  getting on the board look like? So a board can always admit a member at any time in their
*  discretion for a U.S. company. Maybe there's some jurisdiction where you need a shareholder vote,
*  but in most cases, a board can vote on any director that they want. If the board doesn't
*  invite you to the party, you have to apply to be a member in effect. And that process is called,
*  basically is this the process of ultimately running a slate for a meeting where you propose
*  a number of every, any shareholder can propose to be on a board of a company if they own one share
*  of stock in the business. And getting your name in the company's, the materials they sent to
*  shareholders, those rules were written in a way that were very unfavorable and very difficult
*  to get in the door. And those rules have been changed very recently where the company now has
*  to include a candidate, really all the candidates in the materials they sent to shareholders so the
*  shareholders pick the best ones. When we applied, or when we applied, when we ran proxy contests in
*  the past, that was not the case. And so you have to spend a lot of money, mostly mailing fees and
*  all kinds of other legal and other expenses to let everyone know you're running, like running
*  a political campaign. And then you got to run around and meet with the big shareholders,
*  you know, fly around the country, explain your case to them. And then there's a shareholder
*  meeting. And if you get a majority of the votes, you get on. What's this proxy contest battle idea?
*  The battle comes when they don't want you to get on. And a lot of that has to do with,
*  I would say, pride, normal human kind of stuff. You know, a lot of times, a board of an underperforming
*  company doesn't want to admit that they've underperformed. And boards of directors 20
*  years ago, when we started Pershing Square, were pretty cushy jobs. Sit on a board of a company,
*  you play golf with the CEO, you know, at nice golf courses, you make a few hundred thousand dollars
*  a year to go to four meetings. It was kind of a rubber stamp world where boards, you know,
*  at the end of the day, they, the CEO really ran the show. Once shareholders could actually
*  dislodge board members, and they could lose their seats. And that's really the rise of
*  shareholder activism, boards started taking their responsibilities much more seriously,
*  because directors are typically, you know, there are many cases, they're retired CEOs.
*  This is kind of how they're making a living in the later part of their career. They sit on four
*  boards, they collect a million, a million and a half dollars a year in directors fees. If they
*  get thrown off the board by the shareholders, that's embarrassing, obviously. And it affects
*  their ability to get on other boards. So again, incentives, as I said earlier, drive all human
*  behavior. The incentives of directors, they want to preserve their board seats. So if you have a
*  director, now, the directors on board serve in various roles. The most vulnerable ones are ones
*  who, for example, chair a compensation committee. And if they put in a bad plan, or they overpaid
*  management, you know, they're subject to attack by shareholders. But you know, these contests are not
*  dissimilar to political contests, or as mudslinging, and other side puts out false information about
*  you, you have to respond, and they're spending the shareholders money. So they have sort of
*  unlimited resources, and you're spending your and your investors money, you know, when you're a small
*  firm, finite resources, so they can outspend you, they can sue you, they can try to, you know,
*  jigger the mechanics in such a way that you're going to lose, there's some unfortunate stuff
*  that's happened in the past, you know, some manipulative stuff. So also some stuff that's
*  public, like in the press and all this kind of stuff? Oh, of course, you know, there'll be, you
*  know, articles about Campbell, you know, the dirty days where they would go through your trash and,
*  you know, make sure that, you know, you're not sleeping around and, you know, things like this.
*  That's okay. I can, I'm subject to, I can survive extreme scrutiny because I've been through this
*  for a long time. So you're saying the fat and happy hens can get very wolf-like when the fox is trying
*  to break in? Is this how we extend the law? Well, the fox is a threat to the hens. Yeah, yeah, but,
*  but you're, you just care, the charismatic fox just explained to me why the fox is good for everybody
*  in the hen house. At the end of the day, it's actually very good on a board to have someone,
*  you know, if you, there are many examples over time and some handful of high profile ones where
*  the board fought tooth and nail to keep the activists off the board. And then once the
*  activists got on the board and they said, you know, the guy's not so bad after all, the shareholders
*  voted them on, he's got some decent ideas and let's all work together to have this workout.
*  And so there are very few cases where after the contest, when the, by the way, sometimes you have
*  to replace the entire board. We've done that. But some, in most cases you get a couple of seats on
*  the board and it's just, you know, you, you want to build a board comprised of diverse points of
*  view. And that's how you get to the truth. What was the most dramatic battle for the board
*  that you have been a part of? The Canadian Pacific proxy contest. So Canadian Pacific was like,
*  considered the most iconic company in Canada. It literally built the country because the rail
*  that got built over the, over Canada is what united the various provinces into a country.
*  And, and then over time, because the railroad business is pretty good business,
*  they built a ton of hotels, they owned a lot of real estate and it became this massive conglomerate,
*  but it was horribly mismanaged for decades. By the time we got involved, it was by far the worst
*  run railroad in North America. They had the lowest profit margins. They had the lowest growth rate.
*  Every quarter management would make excuses generally about the weather as to why they
*  underperform versus, and there, there's a direct competitor company called Canadian National.
*  As the rail goes right across the country, the Canadian Pacific would constantly be complaining
*  about the weather. Basically, you know, same country, same regions tracks weren't that far
*  apart. And, but it was a really important company and being on this board was like an
*  honorary thing. And everyone on the board was an icon of Canada, you know, the chairman of the
*  Royal Bank of Canada, you know, the head of the most important grain, privately held grain company,
*  the sort of an important collection of, you know, big time Canadian executives. Here we were, you
*  know, this is probably about 13 years ago and, you know, still maybe 44 year old from New York,
*  not Canadian, basically saying this is the worst run railroad in North America.
*  And we bought 12% of the railroad at a really low price. And we brought with us to our first
*  meeting the greatest railroader ever, a guy named Hunter Harrison, who had turned around Canadian
*  National. So we'd like, okay, we've got a great asset. We've got the greatest railroad CEO of all
*  time. He's come out of retirement to step in and run the railroad. And we brought him to the first
*  meeting and they wouldn't even meet with him. And they wouldn't certainly consider hiring him.
*  And that led us to a proxy contest. And this is where the engine starts churning
*  to figure out how this contest can be won. So what's involved?
*  Well, the key is we had to one, come up with a group of directors who would be willing to step
*  into a battle. And we didn't want a bunch of New York directors or even American directors. We
*  wanted Canadians. The problem was this was the most iconic company in Canada. And we wanted high
*  profile people. So we talked to all the high profile people in Canada. Every one of them would say,
*  Bill, you're entirely right. This thing is the worst right off the road. It needs to be fixed.
*  But, you know, I see John at the club, you know, I see him at the Toronto club. You know, I can't,
*  I can't do this, but you're totally right. And we had to and that was the concern because you have
*  to file your materials by a certain day. You got to put together a slate. We needed a big slate
*  because we knew that we had to replace basically all the directors. And then one, I spoke to a guy
*  who was one of the wealthiest guys in Canada, who was on the board at one point in time. And he said,
*  Bill, I have an idea for you. There's this woman, Rebecca McDonald,
*  why don't you give her a call? And I called Rebecca, and she was the first woman to take
*  a company public in Canada as CEO. And she was a kind of anti-establishment, not afraid to take on
*  anything kind of person. And I called her, we had a great conversation. And she was in the Dominican
*  Republic at her house. And I flew down to see her. And she said, Yeah, I'm all in. And actually,
*  once we got her, that enabled us to get others, and then we put together our slate,
*  and we had some pretty interesting dialogue with the company. They tried to embarrass us all the
*  time. In the press publicly, what do we press publicly? You know, at one point, I wrote an
*  email saying, look, let's come to peace on this thing. But if we don't, you're really forcing my
*  hand. And we're going to have to rent the largest hall in Toronto, and invite all the shareholders
*  and it's going to be embarrassing for management. And I made reference to some nuclear winter,
*  let's not have it be a nuclear winter. And they thought they'd embarrass me by releasing the email,
*  but it only inspired us. And we rented the largest hall in Canada, and we put up a presentation,
*  walking through, you know, here's Canadian national, here's Canadian Pacific, here's what
*  they said, here's what they did. And we had Hunter get up, it was this incredibly charismatic guy
*  from Tennessee. That amazing, you know, he's like a lion. Incredibly deep voice, unbelievable track
*  record, incredibly respected guy. It's like getting Michael Jordan to come out of retirement and
*  come run the company. And Hunter was incredible. And other members of my team were, you know,
*  super engaged. And the board, you know, Canadians are known to be nice. So one of the problems we
*  had is shareholders would never tell management or the board that they were losing. It was not
*  until the night before the meeting when the vote came in, the management realized that they lost
*  we got 99% of the vote. And they offered us a deal. When they begged us to take a deal,
*  they said, look, we'll resign tonight. So that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow.
*  That's how embarrassed they were. That was kind of an interesting one.
*  So for in both this proxy battle and the company itself, this was one of your
*  more successful investments.
*  It was. I mean, the stock's up about 10 times. And it's an industrial company. It's a railroad.
*  It's not like a growth like it's not Google. So it's a great story. And the company is now
*  run by a guy named Keith Creel. And Keith, it was Hunter's protege. And in many ways,
*  he's actually better than Hunter. He's doing an incredible job. And we're the sad part here is
*  we made it we did very well. We tripled our money over several years. And then I went through a very
*  challenging period because of a couple of bad investments. And we had to sell our Canadian
*  Pacific to pay to raise capital to pay for investors who were who were leaving.
*  But we had another opportunity to buy back in the last couple of years. And so we're now again,
*  a major owner of the company. But had we held on to original stock,
*  it would have been epic, if you will.
*  So on this one, you were right.
*  Yes.
*  And I read an article by you. And there's many articles about you. I read an article that said,
*  Bill is often right, but you approach it with a scorched earth approach that can often do more
*  sort of can do damage.
*  I haven't read the often right article. But the good news is we are often right. And I say we
*  because we're a team, a small team, but a but a fortunately, very successful one, you know, so
*  our batting average as investors is extremely high. And the good news is our records totally
*  public, you can see everything we've ever done. But the press doesn't rely generally right about
*  the success stories. They write about the failures. And so we've had some epic failures,
*  you know, big losses. Good news is they've been a tiny minority of the cases. Now, no one likes to
*  lose money. It's even worse to lose other people's money. And I've done that occasionally. The good
*  news is if you stuck with us, you've done very well, you know, over a long time.
*  On a small tangent, since we're talking about boards,
*  did you get a chance to see what happened with the OpenAI board? Because I'm talking to Sam
*  Altman soon. Is there any insight you have just maybe lessons you draw from this kind of sure
*  these kinds of events, especially with an AI technology company, such dramatic things happening?
*  Yeah, that was an incredible story. Look, governance really matters. And the governance
*  structure of OpenAI, I think leaves something to be desired. You know, I think Sam's point was this
*  and maybe Musk, Elon Musk point originally set up as a nonprofit. And it reminds me actually,
*  I invested in a nonprofit run by a former Facebook founder, where he's going to create a Facebook
*  like entity for nonprofits to promote, you know, goodness in the world. And the problem was he
*  couldn't hire the talent he wanted because he couldn't grant stock options, he couldn't
*  pay market salaries. And ultimately, we ended up he ended up selling the business to a for profit.
*  So it taught me for profit solutions to problems are much better than nonprofits.
*  And here you had kind of a blend, right? It was set up as a nonprofit. But I think they
*  found the same thing. They couldn't hire the talent they wanted without having a for profit
*  subsidiary. But the nonprofit entity, as I understand it, owns a big chunk of OpenAI.
*  And the investors own sort of a capped interest where their upside is capped. And they don't have
*  representation on the board. And I think that's a, you know, was a setup for a problem. And that's
*  clearly what happened here. And there's, I guess, some kind of complexity in the governance.
*  I mean, because of this nonprofit and cap profit thing, it seems like there's a bunch of complexity
*  and non standard aspects to it that perhaps also contributed to the problem.
*  Yeah. Governance really matters. Boards of directors really matter.
*  Giving the shareholders the right to have input at least once a year in the structure of the
*  governance of companies is really important. And private, you know, venture backed boards
*  are also not ideal. You know, I'm an active investor and ventures. And there are some
*  complicated issues that emerge in private, as sort of venture stage companies, where board members
*  have somewhat divergent incentives from, you know, the long term owners of a business. And
*  what you see a lot in venture boards is, you know, they're presided over generally by venture
*  capital investors who are big investors in the company. And oftentimes it's more important to
*  them to give the, to have the public perception that they're good directors. So they get the
*  next best deal, right? If they get a, you know, if they have a reputation for kind of taking on
*  management too aggressively, word will get out in the small community of founders and they'll
*  miss the next Google. And so they, their interests are not just in that particular company. That's
*  also, you know, one of the problems. Again, it all comes back to incentives.
*  Can you explain to me the difference, you know, venture backed, like VCs and shareholders. So this
*  means before the company goes public. Yeah. So private venture backed companies,
*  the boards tend to be very small. It could be a handful of the venture investors and management.
*  They're often very rarely independent directors. It's just not an ideal structure.
*  Oh, I see you want independent.
*  It's beneficial to have people who have an economic interest in the business and they care
*  only about the success of that company. As opposed to someone who, you know, if you think about the
*  venture business, getting into the best deals is more important than any one deal. And you see cases
*  where, you know, the boards go along with, in some sense, cases, bad behavior on the part of management
*  because they want a reputation for being kind of a, a founder friendly director. You know, that's,
*  that's kind of problematic. You don't have the same issue in public company boards.
*  So we talked about some of the big wins and your track record, but you said there were some big
*  losses. So what's, what's the biggest loss of your career? Biggest loss of my career is a company
*  called Valiant Pharmaceuticals. We made an investment in a business that didn't meet our
*  core principles. The problem in the pharmaceutical industry, and there are many problems as I've
*  learned, is it's a very volatile business, right? It's based on drug discovery. It's based on,
*  you know, predicting kind of the future revenues of a drug before it goes off patent.
*  You know, lots, lots of complexities. And we thought we had found a, a pharmaceutical company
*  we could own because of a very unusual founder and the way he approached his business.
*  We, it was a company where another activist was on the board of directors of the company
*  and kind of governing and overseeing the day-to-day decisions. And we ended up making
*  a passive investment in the company. And up until this point in time, we really didn't make passive
*  investments. And the company made a series of decisions that were, you know, disastrous.
*  And then we stepped in to try to solve the problem. It was the first time I ever joined a board
*  and the mess was much larger than I realized from the outside. And then I was kind of stuck.
*  And it was a very much a confidence sensitive strategy because they, they built their business
*  by acquiring pharmaceutical assets and they often issued stock when they acquired targets.
*  And so once the market lost confidence in management, the stock price got crushed and
*  impaired their ability to continue to acquire low costs, you know, drugs. And we lost $4 billion.
*  $4 billion. Yeah. How's that for a big loss? That's up there.
*  So I'm sweating this whole conversation, both the wins and the losses and the stakes involved.
*  And by the way, that loss catalyzed other, what I call mark to market losses. So very high profile,
*  huge number, disastrous press. Then people said, okay, Bill's going to go out of business.
*  So we're going to bet against everything he's doing. And we know his entire portfolio because
*  we only own 10 things. And we were short a company called Herbalife. Very famously,
*  we've only really shorted two companies. The first one, there's a book. The second one,
*  there's a movie. We no longer short companies. But so people pushed up the price of Herbalife,
*  which is when you're a short seller, that's catastrophic. I can explain that. And then
*  they also shorted the other stocks that we owned. And so that valiant loss led to an overall more
*  than 30% loss in the value of our portfolio. The valiant loss was real and was crystallized. We
*  ended up selling the position, taking that loss. Most of the other losses were what I would call
*  mark to market losses. They were temporary. But many people go out of business because,
*  as I mentioned before, large move in a price, if investors are redeeming or you have leverage,
*  it can put you out of business. And people assumed if we got put out of business,
*  we'd have to sell everything or cover our short position. And that would make the losses even
*  worse. So Wall Street is kind of ruthless. So they can make money off of that whole thing.
*  So they use the opportunity of valiant to try to destroy you.
*  Reputation financially and then capitalize and make money off of that.
*  That's a terrifying spot to be in. What was the light going through that?
*  I was pretty grim. It's actually much worse than that, because I had a lot of stuff going on
*  personally as well. And these things tend to be correlated. The valiant mistake came at a time
*  where I was contemplating my marriage. And the problem with the hedge fund business
*  is when you get to a certain scale, the CEO becomes like the chief marketing officer of
*  the business. And I'm really an investor as opposed to a marketing guy. But when you have investors who
*  give you a few hundred million dollars, they want to see you once a year, Bill, I'd love to see you
*  for an hour. But if you've got a couple hundred of those, you find yourself on a plane to the Middle
*  East, to Asia, flying around the country. This is pre-Zoom. And that takes you away from the
*  investment process. You have to delegate more. That was a contributor to the valiant mistake.
*  So now we lose a ton of money on valiant. My ex-wife and I were talking about separating,
*  getting divorced. I put that on hold because I didn't want to make a decision in the middle of
*  this crisis. And things just kept getting worse. We were also sued. When you lose a lot of money,
*  we didn't get sued by our investors, but we got sued by a shareholder because when the stock price
*  goes down, shareholders sue. We'd done nothing wrong other than make a big mistake. So you have
*  litigation. Your investors are taking their money out. I'm in the middle of a divorce.
*  The divorce starts to proceed. My ex-wife's lawyer's expectations of what my net worth was
*  about three times what it actually was. And it was going lower in the middle of this.
*  And I remember the lawyer saying, look, Bill, you know, we've estimated your net worth at X,
*  but don't worry, we only want a third. But X was 3X. So a third was 100%. And then we had
*  litigation and actually never before publicly disclosed. And I'll share it with you now.
*  We had a public company that owned about a third of our portfolio that was called our version of
*  Berkshire Hathaway. I tried to learn from Mr. Buffett over time. And it was so to speak,
*  permanent capital. The problem with hedge funds is people can take their money out every quarter.
*  What Buffett has is a company where people want to take their money out, they sell the stock,
*  but the money stays. So we set up a similar structure in October of 2014. And then a year
*  later, Valiant happens. And then a year later, we're in the middle of the mess.
*  And we're still in the mess. You know, like by kind of mid 2017, we've got litigation underway.
*  And another activist investor, a firm called Elodie Associates, which is run by a guy named
*  Paul Singer, took a big position in our public company that was the bulk of our capital. And
*  they shorted all the stocks that we owned. And they went long the short, probably went long the
*  short that we were short. And they were making a bet that we'd be forced to liquidate. And then
*  they would make money on, you know, our public company was trading at a discount
*  to what all the securities were. So they bought the public company, they shorted the securities.
*  And then they, you know, came to see us and to try to, you know, be activists and force us to liquidate.
*  And that's sort of, wow. So I thought this was going to be, wow. I envisioned an end
*  where the divorce takes all of my resources, the permanent capital vehicle ends up getting
*  liquidated. And another activist in my industry puts me out of business. And I had met Neri
*  Oxman right around this time. And I had fallen completely in love with her. And I was envisioning
*  a world where I was bankrupt, a judge found me guilty of, you know, whatever, you know,
*  he sends me off to jail, not that judge because he was a civil judge, but another judge sues the
*  SEC Department of Justice. And I find myself in this incredible mess. And I decided I didn't want
*  things to end that way. So I did something I'd never done before. I talked to all before, but
*  you don't borrow money, I borrowed money. And I borrowed $300 million from JP Morgan, in the middle
*  of this mess. And I give JP Morgan enormous credit in seeing through it. And also, you know,
*  I had been a good client over a long period of time. And it's like, you know, it's a handshake
*  bank. And they bet that I would succeed. And I took that money to buy enough stock in my public
*  company that could prevent an activist from taking over and effectively by control of our little
*  public company. And I got that done. And that I knew was the moment the turning point.
*  And I resolved my divorce and divorces get easier to resolve when things are going badly.
*  I was able to resolve that we settled a litigation. I was buying blocks of our stock in the market.
*  I remember a day I bought a big block of stock in the market. I get a call from Gordon Singer,
*  who's Paul Singer's son who runs their London part of their business. He's like, Bill, was that
*  you buying that block? I said, Yes. He's like, Fuck. So he knew, he knew that once I got that,
*  they were not going to be able to succeed. And they went away. And that that was the bottom.
*  And I, I, we've had an incredible run since then.
*  And then you were able to protect your reputation from the valiant failure still?
*  I mean, you know, this is a business where you're gonna make some mistakes. It was a big one.
*  It was very reputationally damaging. The press was a total disaster. But I'm not a quitter.
*  And actually, the key moments for us, we've never taken our core investment principles and actually
*  really written them down. Something we talked about at meetings, investor, you know, kind of
*  our investment team meetings. I had a member of the team, I said, Look, go find a big piece of
*  granite and a chisel. And let's take those core principles. I want them like Moses's 10 commandments.
*  Okay, we're gonna chisel them, then we're gonna put it up on the wall. And once we produce those,
*  we put one on everyone's desk. I said, Look, if we ever again veer from the core principles,
*  you know, hit me with a baseball bat. Yeah. And that was the bottom. And ever since then,
*  we've done we've had the best six years in the history of the firm. So refocus on the fundamentals.
*  And love helps. Love helps. I literally met Neri at the absolute bottom. Our first date was September
*  7th, 2017. That was very close to the bottom. Actually, there's one other element to the story.
*  So this went on for a few months after I met her. The other element is that one day I got a call
*  from Neri. She's like, Bill, guess what? I'm like, what? Brad Pitt is coming to the media lab. He
*  wants to see my work. I'm like, that's beautiful, sweetheart. I didn't know Brad Pitt was interested
*  in your work. As a man, that's a difficult phone call to take. And apparently, he's really interested
*  in architecture. Okay. Now, Neri and I were like, you know, we would WhatsApp all day every day.
*  We talked throughout the day. Brad Pitt shows up at the media lab at 10 o'clock. I talked to her
*  in the morning. I'd kind of text her to see how things are going. Don't hear back. And on WhatsApp,
*  you can see like whether the other person's read it or not. Okay. No response. Yeah. A couple hours
*  later, send her the text. No response. Six o'clock. No response. Eight o'clock. No response. Ten o'clock.
*  No response. And, you know, yeah, she finally calls me at 10 30 and tells me how great.
*  So I had this scenario. Okay. I'm going to, the judge is going to find me. We're going to lose to
*  the judge. All my assets will disappear. And then Brad Pitt is going to take my girlfriend.
*  Brad Pitt's your competition. This is great. So it was like a moment. That was sort of the bottom.
*  And then sort of, you know, the motivational thing, I didn't want to lose to an activist.
*  Didn't want to lose my girl to some other guy. So Brad Pitt and you emerged from all that,
*  the winner on all fronts. I'm a very fortunate guy. Very fortunate and lucky. You talked about
*  some of the technical aspects of that, but psychologically just, is there a,
*  like, what are you doing at night by yourself? That was a hard time. Hard time. Cause I was
*  separated from my wife and my kids. Uh, I was living in, you know, not the greatest apartment.
*  You know, I had a beautiful home and so I had to go find like a bachelor place.
*  And I was, I didn't want to be away from my kids. I moved like 10 blocks away and I wasn't seeing
*  them and they didn't like it. So I ended up buying an apartment I didn't like in the same building as
*  my kids, like with a different, different entrance so I could be near them. And I was home alone.
*  I got a dog that was a, uh, Babar. You can call him Babar, not the elephant. He's a black
*  Labradoodle. He was supposed to be a mini, but he's not so as many. Um, but I got him at six weeks
*  old and he would keep me company. And I started meditating actually. Uh, and, uh, a friend
*  recommended, um, TM and I would meditate 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the evening.
*  And I also, big believer in exercise and, you know, weightlifting and I played tennis.
*  And, uh, I had been, this is not my first, you know, proximity to disaster. I had another moment,
*  uh, in my career, like, uh, you know, 2002. And I learned this method for dealing with these kind
*  of moments, which is, uh, you just make a little progress every day. So today I'm going to wake up,
*  I'm going to make progress. You know, I'll make progress on the litigation, make progress on the
*  portfolio. I'll make progress with my life. Uh, and progress compounds a bit like money compounds.
*  You don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks, but like 30 days in like, oh, okay.
*  You know, like you can't look up at the mountain top where you used to be because then you'll,
*  you'll give up, right? But you just, okay, just make step by step by step. Uh, and then 90 days
*  in, you're like, okay, I was way down there. Okay. I'm not the mom. Okay. I don't look up.
*  Okay. Just keep making, you know, progress, progress, progress. And progress really does
*  compound. And, and one day you wake up and like, wow, it's amazing how far I've come.
*  And if you look at a chart of Pershing square, our company, you can see the absolute bottom,
*  you can see where we were, you can see the drop and you can see where we are now.
*  And that huge drop that felt like a complete unbelievable disaster looks like a little bump
*  on the curve. And, uh, it really gives you perspective on these things. You just have
*  to power through. And I think the key is, you know, I've always been fortunate like from a mental
*  health point of view and, you know, nutrition, sleep, exercise, a little progress every day.
*  That's it. And, you know, good friends and family, you know, I had, uh, you know,
*  go take a walk with a friend every night, um, you know, and a sister who loves me and parents who
*  are supportive, but they were, you know, they were all worried about their, their son, their brother,
*  you know, it was, it was a moment. And also, by the way, the other thing to think about is, uh,
*  when you recover from something like this, you really appreciate it, you know, and, uh, and also
*  the, you know, as much as the media loves, okay, when some successful person falls, they love
*  writing the story of success. They love you more the story of failure, but when you recover from
*  that, it's kind of like the American story, right? You know, America, you know, you think of the great
*  entrepreneurs and how many failures they had before they succeeded, you know, how many rocket launches,
*  you know, did SpaceX have explode on the pad, right? And then you look at success. I mean,
*  that's why Musk is so admired. You mentioned Herbalife. Can you take me through the saga of that?
*  It's historic.
*  So we at Pershing Square, um, short of very few stocks. And the reason for that is short selling
*  is just inherently treacherous. Uh, so if you buy a stock, it's called going long, right? You're
*  buying something, your worst case scenario is you lose your whole investment. You buy a stock for
*  a hundred, it goes to zero, you lose a hundred dollars, right? Per share. You buy one share to a hundred.
*  You sure to stock at a hundred. What it means is you borrow the security from someone else.
*  The analogy I gave that made it easy for people to understand. It's a bit like you think, you know,
*  silver coins are going to go down in value. And you have a friend who's got a whole pile of these,
*  1880, uh, silver, silver, U S dollars, and you think you're gonna go down and say, hey, can I borrow,
*  you know, 10 of those dollars from you? He's like, sure, but what are you going to pay me to borrow?
*  I'll pay, you know, uh, I'll pay interest on your, on the value of the dollars today. So you borrow
*  the dollars that are worth a hundred dollars each today. You pay them interest while you're borrowing
*  them. And then you go sell them in the market for a hundred dollars. That's what they're worth.
*  And then they go down in price to 50. You go back in, you buy the silver dollars back at $50 and you
*  give them back to your friend. Your friend is fine. You borrowed 10, you gave them the 10 back and he
*  got interest in the meantime. He's happy. He made money on his coin collection. You, however, made
*  $50 times the 10 coins. You made 500 bucks. That's pretty good. The problem with that is what if you
*  sell them and they go from a hundred to a thousand, now you're going to have to go buy them back
*  and you've got to pay, you know, whatever, uh, $10,000 to buy back coins, you know, that you would,
*  you sold for 500, you're going to lose $9,500 and there's no limit, right? To how high a stock price
*  can go. Companies go to $3 trillion in value, right? Tesla, a lot of people short of Tesla saying,
*  oh, it's overvalued. He's never going to be able to make a successful electric car.
*  Well, I'm sure there are people went bankrupt shorting Tesla. That's why we didn't short stocks,
*  but I was presented with this actually reporter that covered the other short investment we made
*  early in the career, a company called MBIA came to me and said, Bill, I found this incredible
*  company. You got to take a look at it. It's a total fraud and they're scamming poor people.
*  And we should say that MBIA was a very successful short.
*  It was a big part of it was that we used a different kind of instrument to short it where
*  you, we reversed that sort of, we made the investment asymmetric in our favor, meaning
*  put up a small amount of money. If it works, we make a fortune. Where short selling is you kind
*  of sell something and you have to buy it back at a higher price. Herbalife didn't have the,
*  what's called credit default swaps that you could purchase. Not a big enough company.
*  Didn't have enough debt outstanding to be able to implement. You had to short the stock
*  in order to make it as successful to bet against the company. And the more work I did in the
*  company, the more I was like, Oh my God, this thing's an incredible scam. You know, that they
*  purport to sell weight loss shakes. But in reality, they're selling, you know, kind of a fake
*  business plan and the people that adopted it was money and they, they go after poor people.
*  They go after actually in many cases, undocumented immigrants who were pitched on the American dream
*  opportunity. And because they have few other options, because they can't get legal employment,
*  they become herbal life distributors. And it's a business where you so-called multi-level
*  marketing or pyramid, you know, multi-level marketing is sort of the, the name for a legitimate
*  company like this, or it's a pyramid scheme where basically your sales are really only coming from
*  people who are, you convinced to buy the product by getting them into the business.
*  That's precisely what this company is. And like, okay, shorting a pyramid scheme seems like
*  one will make a bunch of money, but you know, two, the world will be behind us
*  because they're harming poor people. You know, regulators will get interested in a company like
*  this. And we thought, you know, the FTC is going to shut this thing down. And we did a ton of work
*  and I gave this sort of epic presentation, laying out all the facts, stock got completely crushed
*  and we were on our way and the government actually got interested early on, launched an
*  investigation pretty early, SEC and other otherwise. But then a guy named Carl Icahn showed up
*  and there's, we have a little bit of a backstory, but his motivations here were not really principally
*  driven by thinking Herbalife was a good company. He thought it was a good way to
*  hurt me. So he, he basically bought a bunch of stock and said it was a really great company.
*  And, you know, Carl, at least at the time threw his weight around a bit. He was a credible investor,
*  had a lot of resources and that began the saga. So he was, we should say,
*  a legendary investor himself. I'd say legendary in a sense. Yes, for sure. An iconic,
*  iconic Carl icon. Oh, that's very well done. So definitely a iconic investor. So what was the
*  backstory between the two of you? So I mentioned that I had another period of time where significant
*  business challenges. This was my first fund called Gotham Partners and we had a court stop
*  a transaction between some private, a private company we owned and a public company. It's
*  another long story. If you want to go there, I would love to hear it as well. But it was really
*  my deciding to wind up my former fund and we owned a big stake in a company called Hallwood Realty
*  Partners, which was a company that owned real estate assets. It was worth a lot more than we
*  were trading, but it needed an activist to really unlock the value. And we were in fact going out of
*  business and didn't have the time or the resources to pursue it. So I sold it to Carl icon.
*  But, and I sold it to him at a premium to where the stock was trading. I think the stock was like
*  66. I sold to him for 80, but it was worth about 150. And I said, look, and part of the deal was
*  Carl's like, look, I'll give you schmuck insurance. You know, I'll make you sure you don't look bad.
*  And I had another deal at a higher price without schmuck insurance. When I deal with Carl at a
*  lower price for schmuck insurance and the way the schmuck insurance went, he said, look, Bill, if I
*  sell the stock in the next three years, you know, for a higher price, I'll give you 50% of my profit.
*  Well, that's pretty good deal. So we made that deal. And because I was dealing with Carl icon,
*  who had a reputation for, you know, being difficult, I was very focused on the agreement
*  and we didn't want him to be able to be cute. So the agreement said, if we sell, if he sells
*  or otherwise transfers his shares, we came up with a definition, include every version of sale.
*  Okay. Cause you know, it's Carl. Well, he then buys the stake and then makes a bid for the company.
*  And, you know, plan is for him to get the company and he bids like 120 a share. And the company
*  hires Morgan Stanley to sell itself and he raises bid to 125 and the 130 eventually gets sold. I
*  don't remember the exact price. Let's say $145 a share and Carl's not the winning bidder. And he
*  sells his stock or loses or transfers his shares for $145 a share. So he owes actually our investors
*  the difference between 145 and 80 times 50%. And I had like, you know, lawyers never like you to put
*  like a arithmetic example. I put like a formula, you know, like out of a math book in the document.
*  So there can be no confusion. It was only an eight page, really simple agreement. So the deal closes
*  and he's supposed to pay us in two business days or three business days. I wait a few business days,
*  no money comes in. I call Carl. I'm like, Carl, congratulations on the Hallwood Realty. Thanks,
*  Bill. I think I'll just want to remind you, I know it's been a few years, but, you know,
*  we have this agreement. Remember the schmuck insurance? It's like, yeah. I said, well,
*  you owe us our schmuck insurance. He said, what do you mean? I didn't sell my shares. I said,
*  do you still have the shares? He says, no. I said, what happened to them? Well, the company
*  did a merger for cash and they took away my shares, but I didn't sell them.
*  You understand what happened. So I had, I said, Carl, I'm going to have to sue you.
*  Sue me. I'm going to sue you. So I sued him and the legal system in America takes some time.
*  And what he would do is we sued and then we won in the whatever, New York Supreme Court.
*  And then he appealed. And you can appeal like six months after the case. We waited to 179th day
*  and they would appeal. And then we fought at the next level. And then he would appeal. He appealed
*  with the Supreme Court. Of course, the Supreme Court wouldn't take the case. It took years. Now
*  we had, as part of our agreement, we got 9% interest on the money that he owed us. So I viewed it as
*  my Carl Icahn money market account with a much higher interest rate. And eventually I won.
*  What was the amount? Just tiny. Now it was material to my investors. So my first fund,
*  I wound it down, but I wanted to maximize everything for my investors. These are the
*  people back me at 26 years old. I was right out of business school, I had no experience.
*  And they supported me. So I'm going to go to the end of the earth for them.
*  And four and a half million relative to our fund at the end was maybe 400 million. So it wasn't a
*  huge number, but it was a big percentage of what was left after I sold all our liquid security.
*  So I was fighting for it. So we got four and a half million plus interest for eight years or
*  something. That's how long the litigation took. So we got about double. So he owed me $9 million,
*  which to Carl Icahn, who had probably a $20 billion net worth at the time, this was nothing.
*  But to me it was like, okay, this is my investor's money. I'm going to get it back.
*  And so, you know, eventually we won. Eventually he paid. And then he called me. He said, Bill,
*  congratulations. Now we can be friends. And we can invest, do some investing together. I'm like,
*  Carl, fuck you. You actually said fuck you. Yes. I'm not that kind of person generally, but,
*  uh, you know, he made eight years to pay me, not me, even me, my investors, money they owed.
*  So I, yeah. So he probably didn't like that. So he kind of hung around in the weeds,
*  waiting for an opportunity. And then from there, I, you know, started Pershing. We had a kind of
*  straight line up, you know, we're up the first 12 years. We could do nothing wrong. Then Valiant,
*  uh, verbal life, right. Uh, he sees an opportunity and he buys the stock.
*  He figures he's going to run me off the road. And so that was the beginning of that.
*  And kind of the, the moment, uh, and I think it's the, I'm told by CNBC, it's the most watched,
*  uh, segment in business television history. Um, they're interviewing me about the herbal life
*  investment on CNBC. And then Carl icon calls into the show and we have kind of a interesting
*  conversation where he calls me all kinds of names and stuff. So it's, it was a moment.
*  It was a moment in my life. It wasn't public information that he was long on herbal life.
*  He didn't yet disclose he had a stake, but he was just telling me how stupid I was to be short.
*  This company. So for him, it wasn't about the fundamentals of the company. It was about,
*  it was just personal. A hundred percent. Is there part of you that regrets saying,
*  fuck you on that phone call to Carl icon? No,
*  I generally have, I generally have no regrets. Um, because I'm very happy with where I am now.
*  And I feel like, you know, it's a bit like, you know, you, you step on the butterfly in the
*  forest and the world changes because, you know, every action has a reaction. You know, if you're
*  happy with who you are, where you are in life, every decision you've made, good or bad over the
*  course of your life, got you to precisely where you are. I wouldn't change anything.
*  He said you lost money on herbal life. So what, so he did the long-term battle.
*  What he did is he, he got on the board of the company and use the company's financial resources
*  plus his stake in the business to squeeze, squeeze us in a squeeze and short selling is where you
*  restrict the supply of the securities. So that there's a scarcity and then you encourage people
*  to buy the stock and you drive the stock up. And as I explained before, you're short those coins at
*  10, they go to a hundred. You can lose it theoretically in unlimited amount of money.
*  And that's scary. That's why we don't short stocks. That's why I didn't short stocks before this,
*  but this was, unfortunately I had to have the personal lesson.
*  So how much was for him personal versus part of the sort of the game of investing?
*  Well, he thought he could make money doing this. He wouldn't have done it if he did otherwise.
*  He thought his bully pulpit, his ability to create a short squeeze, his control over the company
*  would enable him to achieve this. And he made a billion. We lost a billion.
*  So you think it was a financial decision, not a personal?
*  It was a personal decision to pursue it, but he was waiting for an opportunity where he
*  could make money at our expense. And it was kind of a brilliant opportunity for him.
*  Now the irony is, well, first of all, the FTC found a few interesting facts. So one,
*  the government launched an investigation. They ended up settling with the company and the company
*  paid $220 million in fines. I met a professor from Berkeley a couple of years ago who told me
*  that he had been hired by the government as their expert on Herbalife and he got access to all their
*  data, was able to prove that their appearance came. But the government ultimately settled with Carl
*  because they were afraid they could possibly lose in court. So they settled with him.
*  But if you look at the stock, if we'd been able to stay short the entire time, we would have made
*  a bunch of money. Because the stock had a $6 billion market cap and we shorted it today as probably
*  a billion, a billion and a half. So you left the short position or whatever that's called?
*  Covered, closed it out. We sold Valiant, we covered Herbalife. That was the resetting moment for the
*  firm because it would just psychologically... And the beauty of investing is you don't need to make
*  it back the way you lost it. You can just take your loss. By the way, losses are valuable and
*  the government allows you to take a tax loss and that can shelter other gains. And we just refocused.
*  Can you say one thing you really like about Carl Icahn and one thing you really don't like about him?
*  Sure. So he's a very charming guy. So in the midst of all this, at the Hallwood one,
*  he took me out for dinner to his favorite Italian restaurant.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. We were in the middle of the litigation to see if he could resolve it. And he offered
*  10 million to my favorite charity. The problem was that it wasn't my money, it was my investor's
*  money. So I couldn't settle with him on that basis. But I had the chance to spend real time with him
*  at dinner. He's funny, he's charismatic, he's got incredible stories. And actually I made peace with
*  him over time. We had a little hug out on CNBC, even had him to my house, believe it or not.
*  I hosted something called the Finance Cup, which is a tennis tournament between people in finance
*  in Europe and the US. And we had the event at my house and one guy thought to invite Carl Icahn.
*  And so we had Carl Icahn there to present awards. And again, I have to say I kind of like the guy.
*  But I didn't like him much during this.
*  Is there, because at least from the outsider perspective, there's a bit of a personal
*  vengeance here. Or anger can build up. Do you ever worry the personal attacks between
*  powerful investors can cloud your judgment? What is the right financial decision?
*  I think it's possible. But again, I try to be extremely economically rational. And actually,
*  the last seven years have been quite peaceful. I really have not been an activist in the old
*  form for many years. And the vast majority of even our activist investments historically were very
*  polite and respectful cases. The press, of course, focuses on the more interesting ones.
*  Like Chipotle was one of the best investments we ever made. We got four of eight board seats.
*  And we worked with management. It was a great outcome. I don't think there's ever been a story
*  about it. And the stock's up almost 10 times from the time we hired Brian Nicholas C.E.
*  O. But it's not interesting because there was no battle. Whereas Herbalife, of course,
*  was like an epic battle, even Canadian Pacific. So for a period there, most people, when they
*  meet me in person, they're like, Wow, you seem like a really nice guy. But things have been
*  pretty calm for the last seven years. Of course, there's more than just investing
*  that your life is about, especially recently. Let me just ask you about what's going on in
*  the world first. What was your reaction? And what is your reaction and thoughts
*  with respect to the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel?
*  You know, it's a sad world that we live in. That one, we have terrorists, and two, that we could
*  have such barbaric terrorism. And yeah, just a reminder of that.
*  So there's several things I can ask here. First, on your views on the prospects of the Middle East,
*  but also on the reaction to this war in the United States, especially on university campuses.
*  So first, let me just ask, you said that you're pro-Palestinian. Can you explain what you mean by
*  that? You know, with all of my posts about Israel, I'm obviously very supportive of
*  the country of Israel, Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to defend itself.
*  My Arab friends, my Palestinian friends, you know, were kind of saying, hey, Bill, where are you?
*  What about Palestinian lives? And I was pretty early in my life, a guy named Marty Peretz,
*  who's been important to me over the course of my life, a professor, first investor in my fund,
*  introduced me to NERI, asked me right out of school to join this non-profit called
*  the Jerusalem Foundation, which was a charitable foundation that supported Teddy Kallek when he was
*  mayor of Jerusalem. I ended up becoming the youngest chairman of the Jerusalem Foundation
*  in my 30s, and I spent some time in Israel. And the early philanthropic stuff I did with
*  the Jerusalem Foundation, the thing I was most interested in was kind of the Palestinian,
*  the plight of the Palestinians and kind of peaceful coexistence. And so I had kind of an early
*  kind of perspective and, you know, as chairman of the Jerusalem Foundation, I would go into,
*  you know, Arab communities, I would meet with families in their homes, you know, you get a
*  sense of the humanity of a people and I care about humanity. I generally take the side of
*  people who've been disadvantaged. You know, almost all of our philanthropic work
*  has been in that capacity. So it's sort of my natural perspective, but I don't take the side
*  of terrorists ever, obviously. And, you know, the whole thing is just a tragedy.
*  So to you, this is about Hamas, not about Palestine.
*  Yes. I mean, you know, the problem, of course, is when Hamas controls, you know, for the last
*  almost 20 years has controlled Gaza, you know, including the education system, they're educating,
*  you know, you see these, you know, training videos of kindergartners indoctrinating them into hating
*  Jews and Israel. So it's, of course, you don't like to see Palestinians celebrating,
*  you know, some of those early videos of October 7th, where, you know, dead bodies in the back
*  of trucks and people, you know, cheering. So it's a really unfortunate situation. But, you know,
*  I think about, you know, a Palestinian life is important and as valuable as a Jewish life,
*  as an American life. And, you know, what do people really want? They want a place, they want a home.
*  They want to be able to feed their family. They want a job that generates the resources
*  to feed their family. They want their kids to have a better life than they've had. They want peace.
*  I think these are basic human things. I'm sure the vast majority of Palestinians share these views,
*  but it's such an embedded situation with hatred and, as I say, indoctrination. And then, you know,
*  going back to incentives, you know, terrorists generate their resources by committing terrorism,
*  and that's how they get funding. And that's, you know, there's a lot of graft.
*  You know, it's a plutocracy, right? The top of the terrorist pyramid, you know, if you accept the
*  numbers that are in the press, you know, the top leaders, you know, have billions of dollars,
*  40 billion or so has gone into Gaza over the last, and the West Bank over the last
*  30 years, a number like that. And a lot of it's disappeared into some combination of corruption
*  or tunnels or weapons. And the tragedy is, you know, you look at what Singapore has achieved
*  in the last 30 years, right?
*  Do you think that's still possible if we look into the future of 10, 20, 50 years from now?
*  Absolutely.
*  So not just peace, but-
*  Peace comes with prosperity. You know, people are, you know, under the leadership of terrorists,
*  you're not going to have prosperity, and you're not going to have peace. And I think the,
*  you know, the Israelis withdrew in 2005, and fairly quickly Hamas took control of the situation.
*  That should never have been allowed to happen. And I think, you know, if you think about,
*  I had the opportunity to spend what I would call an hour with Henry Kissinger
*  a few months before he passed away. And we were talking about
*  Gaza, or in the early stage of the war, he said, look, you know, this is not,
*  you can think about Gaza as a test of a two-state solution. It's not looking good.
*  These were his words. So the next time around, you know, look, the Palestinian people should have
*  their own state, but it can't be a state where, you know, 40 billion resources goes in and is
*  spent on weaponry and missiles and rockets going into Israel. And I do think a consortium
*  of the Gulf states, you know, the Saudis and others have to ultimately oversee the governance of
*  this region. I think if that can happen, I think you can have peace, you can have prosperity.
*  And, you know, I'm fundamentally an optimist.
*  So coalition of governance.
*  Governance matters, you know, going back to what we talked about before.
*  And, you know, that kind of approach can give the people a chance to flourish.
*  100%. I mean, look at what Dubai has accomplished with, you know, nomads in the desert,
*  right? And that's become a major, it's a tourist destination. Gaza could have been a tourist
*  destination. Take me through the saga of university presidents testifying on this topic,
*  on the topic of protests on college campuses, protests that call for the genocide of Jewish
*  people and the university presidents. Maybe you can describe it more precisely, but they
*  fail to denounce the calls for genocide. So it begins on October 8th, probably. And,
*  you know, you can do a compare and contrast with how Dartmouth managed
*  the events of October 7th and the aftermath and how Harvard did. And on October 8th, or shortly
*  thereafter, you know, the Dartmouth president who had been in her job for precisely the same
*  number of months that the Harvard president had been in her job. The first thing she did is she
*  got the most important professors of Middle East studies who were Arab and who were Jews
*  and they convened them and held, you know, an open session, Q&A for students to talk about
*  what's going on in the Middle East and began an opportunity for common understanding among the
*  student body. And Dartmouth has been a relatively benign environment on this issue. And students
*  are able to do work and there aren't disruptive protests with people with bull horns walking into
*  classrooms interfering with, you know, people pay today $82,000 a year, which itself is crazy
*  to go to Harvard. But imagine your family borrows the money or you borrow the money as a student
*  and your learning is disrupted by constant protests and the university does nothing.
*  You know, when George Floyd died, you know, the Harvard president wrote a very strong letter
*  denouncing what had taken place and, you know, calling this an important moment in American
*  history and took it incredibly seriously. Her first letter about October 7th was not that,
*  let's put it that way. And then her second letter was not that. And then ultimately, you know,
*  she was sort of forced by the board or the pressure to make a more public statement.
*  But it was clear that it was hard for her to come to an understanding of this terrorist act.
*  And then the protests erupted on campus and they started out reasonably benign.
*  And then the protesters got more and more aggressive in terms of violating university rules
*  on things like bullying and the university did nothing. And that obviously for the Jewish
*  students, the Israeli students, the Israeli faculty, Jewish faculty, created an incredibly
*  uncomfortable environment. And the president seemed indifferent. And, you know, I went up to
*  campus and I met with hundreds of students in small groups and larger groups. And they're like,
*  Bill, why is the president doing nothing? Why is the administration doing nothing?
*  And that was really the beginning. And that, you know, I reached out to the president,
*  reached out to the board of Harvard. I said, look, this thing is headed in the wrong direction.
*  And you need to fix it. And I have some ideas, love to share.
*  And I got the heisman, as they say, you know, they just kept pushing off the opportunity for me to
*  meet with the president and meet with the board. And a certain point in time I pushed, you know,
*  I'm kind of an activist when you push me. It reminded me of, you know, early days of activism,
*  where I couldn't get the CEO of Wendy's to return my call. I couldn't get the CEO of Harvard,
*  you know, to take a meeting. And then finally, I spoke to the chairman of the board, a woman by
*  the name of Penny Pritzker, who I knew from on a business school board with her. And it was,
*  as I described, one of the more disappointing conversations of my life. And it did not seem,
*  she seemed a bit like, if you will, deer in the headlights. They couldn't do this,
*  they couldn't do that. The law was preventing them from doing various things. And that led to
*  my first letter to the university and I sort of ended the letter, you know, sort of giving this
*  president of Harvard a dare to be great speech. This is your opportunity. You know, you can fix
*  this. This could be your legacy. And I sent it to the, I emailed it to the president and the
*  board members whose email addresses I had. I posted it on Twitter. I got no response,
*  no acknowledgement, nothing. And in fact, the open dialogue I had with a couple of people on
*  the board basically got shut down after that. And that led to letter number two. And then when the
*  Congress, led by Lee Stefanik, announced an investigation of anti-Semitism on campus
*  and concern about violations of law, the president was called to testify along with two other,
*  the president of MIT, the president of University of Pennsylvania, who were having similar issues
*  on campus. I reached out to the president of Harvard and said, well, one, the Israeli government
*  had gotten in touch and offered the opportunity for me to see the Hamas, if you will, GoPro film.
*  And I said, you know what, I'd love to show it at Harvard. And they thought that would be a great
*  idea. And so I partnered with the head of Harvard Chabad, a guy named Rabbi Hershey.
*  And we were putting the film up on campus and I thought, you know, if the president were to see
*  this, it would give her a lot of perspective on what happened and she should see it before
*  her testimony. And so I reached out to her, or actually Rabbi Hershey did, and he was told she
*  would be out of town and couldn't see it. And then I reached out to her again, said, look, I'll
*  facilitate your attendance in the Congress, you know, come see the film, I'll fly you down.
*  That was rejected. And then she testified. And I watched, you know, a good percentage,
*  80% of the testimony of all three presidents. And it was an embarrassment to the country,
*  embarrassment to the universities. You know, they were evasive. They didn't answer questions. They
*  were rude. They smirked. You know, they looked very disrespectful to our Congress. And then,
*  of course, there was that several minutes where finally, at least, Stefanik was not getting
*  answers to her questions. And she said, you know, let me be, you know, kind of clear.
*  What if protesters were calling for genocide for the Jews? Does that violate your rules on bullying
*  and harassment? And the three of them basically gave the same answer. You know, it depends on the
*  context. And not until they actually executed on the genocide, the university have the right to
*  intervene. And the thing that perhaps bothered me the most was the incredible hypocrisy.
*  You know, Harvard was, you know, each of these universities are ranked by this entity called
*  fire, which is a nonprofit that focuses on free speech on campus. And Harvard has been in the
*  bottom quartile for the last five years and dropped to last before October 7, out of like 250.
*  I should mention briefly that I've interviewed on this podcast the founder of fire and the
*  current head of fire. We discussed this at length, including running for the board of Harvard and the
*  whole procedure of all that. It's quite a fascinating investigation of free speech. For people who care
*  about free speech absolutism, that's a good episode to listen to because those folks kind of fight for
*  this idea. It's a difficult idea actually to internalize what is free speech in college
*  campuses look like. Harvard has become a place where free speech is not tolerated on campus,
*  or at least free speech that's not part of the accepted dialogue or, you know, this whole notion
*  of speech codes and microaggressions really emerged on the elite, you know, the Harvard Yale
*  campuses of the world. And, you know, the president of Harvard's, then president Harvard's
*  explanation for why, you know, you could call for the genocide of the Jewish people on campus was
*  Harvard's commitment to free expression. And, you know, one of the more hypocritical statements
*  of all time. And you really can't have it both ways. Either Harvard has to be a place where it's
*  a free speech. She basically said we're a free speech absolutist place, which is why we have to
*  allow this. And Harvard could not be further from that. And so that was a big part of it.
*  And I was in the barber chair, if you will, getting haircut. And I had a guy on my team send me the
*  three minute section, I said, cut that line of questioning. And I put out a little tweet on that.
*  And it's called my greatest hits of posts, it's got something like 110 million views. And, you
*  know, everyone looked at this and said, what is wrong with, you know, university campuses?
*  And their leadership and their governance, by the way, you know, in a way, this whole conversation
*  has been about governance. Harvard has a disastrous governance structure, which is why we have the
*  problem we have. And just to linger on the testimony, you mentioned, you know, smirks
*  and this kind of stuff. And you mentioned dare to be great. I myself am kind of a sucker for great
*  leadership. And those moments you mentioned Churchill or so on, even great speeches.
*  People talk down on speeches, like it's maybe just words, but I think speeches can define a culture
*  and define a place to find a people that can inspire. And I think actually, the testimony
*  before Congress could have been an opportunity to redefine what Harvard is, dare to be great for
*  dare to be a great leader. President Harvard had a huge opportunity because she went third.
*  Right. The first two gave the world's most disastrous answers to the question.
*  And she literally just copied their answer, which is itself, you know, kind of ironic in
*  light of ultimately what happened. It's tough because you can get busy as a president,
*  as a leader and so on. There's these meetings. So you think Congress, maybe you're smirking
*  at the ridiculousness of the meeting. You need to remember that many of these are opportunities.
*  To give a speech of a lifetime. Sure. Like that if there is principles which you want to see
*  an institution become and embody in the next several decades, there's opportunities to do
*  that. And you as a great leader also need to have a sense of when is the opportunity to do that.
*  And October 7th really woke up the world on all sides, honestly, like there is serious issue
*  going on here. And then the protests woke up the university to there's a serious issue going on
*  here. It's an opportunity to speak on free speech and on genocide, both. Yes.
*  Do you see the criticism that you are a billionaire donor and you sort of used your
*  power and financial influence unfairly to affect the governing structure of Harvard in this case?
*  First of all, I never threatened to use financial or other resources. The only thing I did here was
*  wrote a Republic letters. I spoke privately to a couple members of the board. I spoke for 45
*  minutes to the chairman. None of those conversations were effective or went anywhere as far as I could
*  tell. I think my public letters and then some of the posts I do it. Yeah. And that, you know, that
*  little three minute video excerpt had an impact, but it wasn't about, I mean, you can criticize
*  me for being a billionaire, but that had, you know, it was really the words. It's a bit like,
*  again, going back to the corporate analogy, it's not the fact that you own 5% of the company that
*  causes people to vote in your favor. It's the fact that your ideas are right. And I think,
*  you know, I was disappointed after the congressional testimony, the board of Harvard
*  said that they were 100% behind, unanimously 100% behind President Gay. And so clearly,
*  I was ineffective. And ultimately what took her down was other, I would say activists who identified
*  issues with academic integrity. And then she lost the confidence of the faculty. And once that
*  happens, it's hard to stay. And I wanted her to be fired basically, or be forced to resign because
*  of failures of leadership, because that would have sent a message about the importance of
*  leadership, you know, failure to stop a emergence of anti-Semitism on campus. And, you know, there's
*  some news today, the protests are getting worse. Is there some tension between free speech on
*  college campuses and disciplining students for calls of genocide? Yes, there's certainly a
*  tension. And I think, first of all, I think free speech is incredibly important. And I'm on the
*  side, I'm a lot closer to absolutism on free speech than otherwise. The issue I had was the
*  hypocrisy, right? They were restricting other kinds of speech on campus, principally conservative
*  speech, conservative views. So it wasn't a free speech absolutist campus. And the protests were
*  actually quite threatening to students. And there are limits to even absolutist free speech. And
*  they begin where people feel, you know, intimidation, harassment, and, you know,
*  threat to bodily harm, etc. You know, that kind of speech is generally,
*  again, it's pretty technical. But as people feel like they're an imminent harm by virtue of the
*  protest, that speech is at risk of not meeting the standards for free speech. But Harvard is a private
*  corporation. And as a private corporation, they can put on what restrictions they want. And Harvard
*  had introduced only a few months before bullying and harassment policies. And that's why
*  Representative Stefanik focused on it. Does this it's not like she said, is calling for genocide
*  against the Jews violate your free speech policies? She says it's calling for genocide against the
*  Jews violate your policies on bullying and harassment. And I think everyone looked at this
*  when they said it depends on the context. And they said, look, if you replace Jews with some other
*  ethnic group, students have been who views the n word, for example, have been thrown off campus,
*  were suspended, you know, students who've hate speech directed at LGBTQ people,
*  has led to disciplinary action. But, you know, attacking spitting on Jewish students, or,
*  you know, kind of roughing them up a bit. Seems like, you know, we're calling for their
*  elimination didn't seem to violate the policies. So it's, you know, look, I think a university
*  should be a place where you have broad views and open viewpoints and broad discussion.
*  But it should also be a place where students don't feel threatened going to class,
*  where their learning is not interrupted. When final exams are not interrupted by, you know,
*  people coming in and with loud protest. Students asked me when I went up there,
*  what would you do if you were a president? I said, this was before I knew what was happening on the
*  Dartmouth campus. I said I would, I convene everyone together. This is Harvard. We have
*  access to the best minds in the world. Let's have a better understanding of the history.
*  Let's understand the backdrop. Let's focus on solutions. Let's bring Arab and Jewish and
*  Israeli students together. Let's form groups to create communication. That's how you solve
*  this kind of problem. And none of that stuff has been done. It's not that hard.
*  Do you think this reveals a deeper problem in terms of ideology and the governance of Harvard
*  in the, maybe the culture of Harvard?
*  Yes. So on governance, the governance structure is a disaster. So the way it works today is
*  Harvard has two principal boards. There's the board of the corporation, the so-called fellows
*  of Harvard. It's a board of, I think, 12 independent directors and the president.
*  There's no shareholder vote. There's no proxy system. It's really a self-perpetuating board
*  that effectively elects its own members. So there's, you know, once it becomes, once the balance
*  tips politically one way or another, they can, you know, it can be kept that way forever. There's
*  no kind of rebalancing system. You know, if a US corporation goes off the rails, so to speak,
*  the shareholders can get together and vote off the directors. There's no ability to vote off the
*  directors. Then there's the board of overseers, which is, I think, 32 directors. And there,
*  a few years ago, if you could put together 600 signatures, you could run for that board and
*  put up a bunch of candidates and about five or six get elected each year.
*  And a group did exactly that. And it was an oil and gas kind of disinvestment group. They got the
*  signatures. A couple of them got elected and Harvard then changed the rules. And they said,
*  now we need 3,200 signatures. And by the way, if there are these dissident directors on the board,
*  we're only going to allow, we're going to cap them at five. So if three were elected in the oil and
*  gas thing, now there are only two seats available. And then a group of former students, kind of
*  younger alums, one of whom I knew, approached me and said, look, Bill, we should run for the board.
*  And they decided this pretty late, only a few weeks before the signatures were due and love
*  your support. You know, I took a look at their platform. I thought it looked great. I said,
*  look, happy to support. And I posted about them, you know, did a zoom with them. And they got
*  thousands of signatures, you know, collectively, the four got whatever 12,000 signatures or
*  something like this. And they missed by about 10% the threshold. And what did Harvard do in the
*  middle of the election? They made it very, very difficult to sign up, you know, for a vote. And
*  it just makes them look terrible. And they've got now thousands of alums upset that, and again,
*  this wasn't an election. This was just to put the names on the slate. So the only candidates on the
*  slate are the ones selected by the, you know, the existing members. And so it's, it's businesses
*  fail because of governance failures. Universities fail because of governance failures. It's not
*  really the president's fault, because the job of the board is to fire, hire and fire the president
*  and help guide the institution academically and otherwise. So that's governance. An ideology,
*  I was like, how can this be October 7, the event that woke me up was 30 student organizations
*  came out with a public letter on October 8, literally the morning after this letter was
*  created and said, Israel is solely responsible for Hamas is violent acts. Again, Israel had not even
*  mounted a defense at this point, and there were still terrorists running around in the southern
*  part of Israel. And I'm like, Harvard students, you know, 34 Harvard student organizations signed
*  this letter. And I'm like, what is going on? You know, WTF, right? And that's when I went up on
*  campus. And I started talking to the faculty. And that's when I started hearing about actually,
*  Bill, it's this DEI ideology. I'm like, what? Like, diversity, equity, inclusion, you know,
*  obviously, I'm familiar with these words. And, you know, I see this in the corporate context.
*  And they say, yeah, and they started talking to me about this oppressor oppressed
*  framework, which is effectively taught on campus and represents the backdrop for many of the courses
*  that are offered and the various some of the studies and other degree offerings. I'm like,
*  I had not even heard of this. And, you know, I'm pretty aware person. But I was completely unaware.
*  And basically, they're like, look, Israel is deemed an oppressor. And the Palestinians are
*  deemed the oppressed. And you take the side of the oppressed and any acts of the oppressed to
*  dislodge the oppressor, regardless of how vile or barbaric, okay. I'm like, okay, this is a super
*  dangerous ideology. And so I wrote a like questioning post about this. Like, here's what
*  I'm hearing. You know, my, is this right? Then I had someone, a friend of mine sent me a
*  Christopher Rufo's book, America's Cultural Revolution, which is sort of a sociological
*  study of the origins of the DEI movement and critical race theory. And I found it actually
*  one of the more important books I've read. And also found it quite concerning. And really,
*  it's sort of a, ultimately DEI comes out of a kind of a Marxist socialist backdrop,
*  way to look at the world. And so I think there are a lot of issues with it. But unfortunately,
*  it's advancing, like ultimately concluded racism, as opposed to fighting it, which is what I thought
*  it was ultimately about. So maybe you can speak to that book a little bit. So there's a history that
*  traces back across decades. And then that infiltrated college campuses. So basically,
*  what Rufo argues is that the black power movement of the 60s really failed. It was a very violent
*  movement, and many of the protagonists ended up in jail. And out of that movement, a number of
*  thought leaders, this guy named Marcuse and others, built this framework, kind of an approach. So
*  look, if we're going to be successful, it can't be a violent movement, number one. Number two,
*  we need to infiltrate, if you will, the universities. And we need to become part of the faculty.
*  And we need to teach the students. And then once we take over the universities with this ideology,
*  then we can go into government. And then we can go into corporations, and we can change the world.
*  So I thought important book. And the more I dug in, the more I felt there was credibility to this,
*  not just the kind of sociological backdrop, but to what it meant on campus. And the faculty,
*  Harvard faculty were telling me that there really is no such thing as free speech on campus.
*  And that there was a survey done a year or so ago, the Harvard faculty, and only 2% of the faculty
*  admitted, even in an anonymous survey, admitted to having a conservative point of view. So we
*  have a campus that's 98% non-conservative, liberal progressive, that's adopted this DEI construct.
*  And then I learned from a member of the search committee for the Harvard president
*  that they were restricted in looking at candidates, only those who met the DEI offices
*  criteria. And I shared this in one of my postings, and I was accused of being a racist.
*  And that's someone who believes in diversity is a very good thing for organizations,
*  and that equity and fairness is really important. And having an inclusive culture is critical
*  for a functioning of organization. So here I was, someone who was like, okay, DEI sounds good to me,
*  at least in the small D, small E, I version of events, but this DEI ideology is really problematic.
*  So what's the way to fix this in the next few years? The infiltration of DEI with the
*  uppercase version of universities and the things that have troubled you,
*  the things you saw at Harvard and elsewhere?
*  Pete Slauson In the same way, this was an eye-opening
*  event for me, it has been for a very broad range of other people. I've never gotten,
*  you know, I mentioned general growth, I got a lot of nice letters from people for making money on
*  a stock that went up 100 times. But I literally get hundreds of emails, letters, texts, handwritten
*  letters, typed letters from people the ages of 25 to 85 saying, Bill, this is so important,
*  thanks for speaking out on this. You were saying what so many of us believe but have been afraid
*  to say. What I described is almost a McCarthy-esque kind of movement, and that if you challenge the
*  DEI construct, people accuse you of being racist. It's happened to me already. I'm perhaps,
*  I'm much less vulnerable than a university professor who can get shouted off campus,
*  canceled. I'm sort of difficult to cancel, but that doesn't mean people aren't going to try.
*  And I've been the victim of a couple of interesting articles in the last few days,
*  or at least one in particular in the Washington Post, written by what I thought was a well-meaning
*  reporter. But it's just clear that, you know, I've taken on some big parts of at least the
*  progressive establishment, DEI. I'm also a believer that Biden should have stepped aside a long time
*  ago, and it's only getting worse. You know, so I'm attacking the president, DEI, elite universities.
*  And you make some enemies doing that.
*  I should say, I'm still at MIT, and I love MIT, and I believe in the power of great universities
*  to explore ideas, to inspire young people to think, to inspire young people to lead.
*  Let me ask, okay, how can you explore how to think when you're only shared a certain point of view?
*  How can you learn about leadership when the governance and leadership of the institution
*  is broken, and exposure to ideas, if you're limited in the ideas that you're exposed to?
*  So I think universities at risk. I mean, the concerning thing is if 34 student organizations
*  that each have, I don't know, 30 members or maybe more, that's a thousand. That's a meaningful
*  percentage of the campus, perhaps, that ultimately respond. Now, a ten or so students,
*  the 30 withdrew the statement once many of the members realized what they had written.
*  So I don't think it seems like the statement was signed by the leadership and not necessarily
*  supported by all the various students that were members. But if the university teaches people
*  these precepts, this is the next generation of leadership. Normally, if you think about,
*  I wrote my college thesis on university admissions, the reason why controlling
*  the gates of the Harvard institution, the admissions office is important, is that many
*  of these people who graduate end up with the top jobs in government and ultimately become judges.
*  They permeate through society, so it really matters what they learn. And if they're limited
*  to one side of the political aisle and they're not open to a broader array of people,
*  and they're not open to a broader array of views, and this represents some of the most elite
*  institutions in our country, I think it's very problematic for the country long term.
*  Yeah, I 100% agree. And I also felt like the leadership wasn't even part of the problem as
*  much as they were almost out of touch, like unaware that this is an important moment,
*  it's an important crisis, it's an important opportunity to step up as a leader and define
*  the future of an institution. So I don't even know where the source of the problem is. It could be
*  literally governance structure as we've been talking about.
*  Well, two things. I think it's governance structure. I also think universities are selecting,
*  they're not selecting leaders. It's not clear to me that university should necessarily be run
*  by academics. The dean of a university, the person who helps, there's sort of the business
*  of the university, and then there's the academics of the university. And I would argue having a
*  business leader run these institutions, and then having a board that has itself diverse viewpoints
*  and by the way, permanently structured to have diverse viewpoints is a much better way to run
*  a university than picking an academic that the faculty supports. Because one of the things I
*  learned about how faculty get hired at universities ultimately it's signed off by the board, but
*  the new faculty are chosen by each of the various departments. Once the departments tip, there's
*  sort of a tipping point politically where once they tip in one direction, the faculty
*  recruit more people like themselves. And so the departments go more and more progressive,
*  if you will, with the passage of time and they only advance candidates that match their,
*  that meet their political objectives. It's not a great way to build an institution which allows
*  for- Small D diversity.
*  Allows for, yeah, diversity. And diversity, by the way, is not just race and gender.
*  And that's also something I feel very strongly about.
*  Well, luckily, engineering robotics is touched last by this. It is touched, but you know,
*  when I am at the computing building, Stata and then UN, politics doesn't infiltrate or I haven't
*  seen it infiltrate quite as deeply as elsewhere. But-
*  It's in the biology department at Harvard, because biology is controversial now.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Because biology and gender, you know, there are faculty, there's a woman at Harvard who was
*  canceled from the faculty as a member of, I think she was at the med school.
*  And she was, you know, she made the argument that there are basically, you know, two genders
*  determined by biology, she wasn't allowed to stay. That's another topic for another time.
*  Topic.
*  You should do a show on that one. That'll be an interesting one.
*  So as you said, technically, Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard resigned over plagiarism,
*  not over the thing that you were initially troubled by.
*  It's hard to really know, right? It's not like a provable fact. I would say at a certain point
*  in time, she lost the confidence of the faculty. And that was ultimately the catalyst. And whether
*  that was, how much of that was the plagiarism issue? How much of that was some of the things
*  that preceded it? Or was it all of these issues in their entirety? We don't really, there's no way to
*  do a calculus.
*  Can you explain the nature of this plagiarism from what you remember?
*  So Aaron Cerberium and Christopher Ruffo, one from the Free Beacon, and Chris, you know,
*  surfaced some allegations on or identified some plagiarism issues that I would say the initial
*  examples were, you know, use of the same words with proper attribution, some missing, you know,
*  footnotes. And then over time, with, I guess, more digging, they released, I think, ultimately,
*  something like 76 examples of what they call plagiarism in, I think, eight of 11 of her
*  articles. And one of the other things that came forth here is, as president of the university,
*  she had sort of the thinnest transcript academically of any previous president, you know,
*  very small, relatively small body of work. And then when you couple that with the amount of
*  plagiarism that was pervasive, and then I guess some of the other examples that surfaced were not
*  missing quotation marks where the authors of the work felt that their ideas had been stolen.
*  And really, plagiarism is academic fraud. There's their indicia, one indicia of plagiarism is a
*  missing footnote. That could also be a clerical error. And so when a, you know, professors
*  accused of plagiarism, the university does sort of a deep dive, they have these administrative boards,
*  and it can take six months, nine months, a year to evaluate, you know, intent matters,
*  was this intentional theft of another person's idea? That's academic fraud, or was this sloppy,
*  you know, you missed or just humanity, right? You miss a footnote here or there. And I think
*  once it got to a place where people felt it was theft of someone else's intellectual property,
*  that's when it became intolerable for her to stay as president of Harvard.
*  . So is there a spectrum for you between
*  the different kinds of plagiarism, maybe plagiarizing words and plagiarizing ideas,
*  and plagiarizing novel ideas? Of course, the common understanding
*  plagiarism, if you look in the dictionary, it's about theft. Theft requires an intent.
*  Did the person intentionally take someone else's ideas or words? Now, if you're, if you're writing
*  a novel, right, words matter more, right, if you're taking Shakespeare and presenting it
*  as your own words. If you're, you know, writing about ideas, you know, ideas matter, but you're
*  not supposed to take someone else's words without properly acknowledging them, whether it's quotation
*  marks or otherwise. But in the context of academics, life's work before AI, everyone's
*  going to have missing quotation marks and footnotes. I remember writing my own thesis,
*  you know, I would write, I would take the books you couldn't take out of Widener Library.
*  So I'd have index cards and I'd write stuff on index cards and I put a little citation to make
*  sure I remember to cite it properly. And, you know, scrambling to do your thesis, get it in on time.
*  What's the chances you forget at what point, what are your words versus the
*  author's words and you forgot to put quotation marks, just the humanity, you know, the human
*  fallibility of it. So, you know, you don't get, it's not academic fraud to have human fallibility,
*  but it's academic fraud if you take someone else's ideas that are an integral part of your work.
*  Is there a part of you that regrets that, at least from the perception of it, the president of Harvard
*  stepped on over plagiarism versus over refusing to say that the calls for genocide are wrong?
*  Again, I think it would have sent a better message if a leader fails as a leader,
*  and that's the reason for their resignation or dismissal, then she gets, if you will,
*  caught on a technical violation that had nothing to do with failed leadership. Because I don't know
*  what lesson that, you know, what's lesson that teaches the board about selecting the next
*  candidate. I mean, the future of Harvard, a lot of it's going to depend on who they pick as the next
*  leader. Here's an interesting anecdote that I think has not surfaced publicly.
*  So, a guy named Larry Bacow was the previous president of Harvard. Larry Bacow was on the
*  search committee, and they were looking for a new president. And what was strange was they picked
*  an old white guy to be president of Harvard when there was, you know, a call for a more diverse
*  president. And what I learned was Harvard actually ran a process, had a diverse new president of
*  Harvard, and in the due diligence on that candidate shortly before the announcement of the new
*  president, they found out that the president, that presidential candidate had a plagiarism problem.
*  And the search had gone on long enough, they couldn't restart a search to find another
*  candidate. So they picked Larry Bacow off the board, off the search committee, to be the next
*  president of Harvard as kind of an interim solution. And then there was that much more pressure
*  to have a more diverse candidate this time around, because there was a big disappointment to the DEI
*  office, if you will, and I would say to the community at large, Harvard, of all places, couldn't
*  have a racially diverse president. It sent an important message.
*  So the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence on president Gay,
*  and that it was a relatively quick process. So the whole thing, I think, is worthy of further,
*  you know, exploration. So this goes deeper than just the president.
*  Yes, for sure. When a company fails, most people blame the CEO. I generally blame the board,
*  right? Because the board's job is to make sure the right person is running the company. And if
*  they're failing, help the person. If they can't help the person make a change. That's not what's
*  happened here. The board's hand was sort of forced from the outside, whereas they should
*  have made their own decision from the inside. Do you still love Harvard?
*  Sure. It's a 400 odd year institution. It's enormously helpful to me in my life, I'm sure.
*  My sister also went to Harvard. And, you know, the experiences, learnings, friendships,
*  relationships. You know, I'm very happy with my life. Harvard was an important part of my life.
*  I went there for both undergrad and business school. I learned a ton, met a lot of faculty,
*  a lot from a number of my closest friends who I still really keep in touch with.
*  I made then. So yeah, it's a great place. But it needs a reboot.
*  Yeah, I still have hope. I think universities are really important institutions.
*  When I went to Harvard, there were 1600 people in my class. I think today's class is about the
*  same size. And their online education really has not sort of taken off. Right. So I heard
*  Peter Thiel speak at one point in time. And he's like, what great institution do you know
*  that's truly great that hasn't grown in 100 years? Right. And the incentives in some sense of the
*  alums are for it. It's a bit like a club. If you're proud of the elitism of the club, you don't
*  want any that many new members. But the fact that the population has grown of the country is so,
*  you know, significantly since certainly I was a student in 1984. And the fact that Harvard
*  recruits people from all over the world, it's really serving a smaller and smaller percentage
*  of the population today. And, you know, some of our most talented and successful entrepreneurs
*  anyway, you know, it's a token of success that they didn't make it through their undergraduate
*  years. You know, they left as a freshman or they didn't attend at all. For entrepreneurs,
*  yes. But it's still a place. Very important for research, very important for advancing ideas.
*  And yes, and shaping dialogue and the next generation of Supreme Court justices.
*  And, you know, the members of government, politicians. So yes, it's critically important,
*  but it's not doing the job it should be doing. Neri Oxman, somebody you mentioned several times
*  throughout this podcast, somebody I had a wonderful conversation with, a friendship with, I've known,
*  looked up to her, admired her, has been a fan. I've been a fan of hers for a long time, of her work,
*  and of her as a human being. Looks like you're a fan of hers as well.
*  Yes. What do you love about Neri? What do you admire about her as a scientist, artist, human being?
*  I think she's the most beautiful person I've ever met. And I mean that from like the center of her
*  soul. She's the most caring, warm, considerate, thoughtful person I've ever met. And she couples
*  those remarkable qualities with brilliance, incredible creativity, beauty, elegance, grace.
*  Yeah, I'm talking about my wife, but I'm talking incredibly dispassionately.
*  But I mean what I say. She's the most remarkable person I've ever met. And I've met a lot of
*  remarkable people. And I'm incredibly fortunate to spend a very high percentage of my lifetime
*  with her ever since I met her, you know, six years ago.
*  So she's been a help to you through some of the rough moments you described?
*  For sure. I mean I met her at the bottom, which is not a bad place to meet someone if it works out.
*  Is there some degree of yin and yang with the two personalities you have? You have described yourself
*  as emotional and so on, but it does seem the two of you have slightly different styles about how
*  you approach the world. Sure. Well, interestingly, we have a lot of like, you know, we come from very
*  similar places in the world. You know, there are times where you feel like we've known each other
*  for centuries. You know, I met her parents for the first time, you know, a long time ago, almost six
*  years ago as well. And I knew her parents were from Eastern Europe originally. So I asked her
*  father like what, you know, what city did her family come from originally. And I called my father
*  and asked him, you know, dad, what's, you know, grandpa Abraham, where's he, what's the name of
*  the city? And then I put the two cities into Google Maps and they were 52 miles apart.
*  That was pretty cool. Then of course, at some point we did genetic testing,
*  make sure we weren't related, which we were not. But we share incredible commonality on values.
*  We are attracted to the same kind of people. You know, she loves my friends, I love hers.
*  We love doing the same kind of things. We're attracted to, you know, we like spending time
*  the same way. And she has, yes, more emotion, more elegance. She doesn't like battles,
*  but she's very strong. But she's more sensitive than I am.
*  Yeah, you, you are constantly in multiple battles at the same time. And there's often
*  the media, social media, it's just fire everywhere.
*  You know, that hasn't really been the case for a while. I've had relative peace for a long time.
*  Because I, as I stopped being as I haven't had to be the kind of activist I was earlier in my career.
*  I think since October 7th, yes, I do feel like I've been in a war.
*  Can you tell me the saga of the accusations against Nary?
*  So I did not actually surface the plagiarism allegations against President Gay that surface
*  by, you know, Aaron and maybe Christopher Ruffo as well, or maybe Chris helped promote what Aaron
*  and some anonymous person identified. But I certainly it was a point in time with a board
*  had said we're 100% behind her and unanimously, I really felt you had to go. So it didn't bother
*  me at all that they had identified problems with her work. So I shared, I reposted those posts.
*  And then when the board, she ultimately resigned, and she got a $900,000 a year professorship,
*  continuing at Harvard, I said, Look, in light of her limited academic record,
*  and these plagiarism allegations, she had to go. I knew when I did so I assumed I was actually a
*  bit paranoid about that thesis I had written. I only had one academic work. But I hadn't checked
*  it for plagiarism. And I thought, that's gonna that's gonna happen. Actually, I had it. I had
*  someone I did not have a copy on hand. So I got a copy of my thesis. And I, and I remember writing
*  it. Harvard at the time was pretty, they kind of gave you a lecture about making sure you have all
*  your footnotes in quotation marks. I learned later, that apparently that a copy of my thesis at the
*  New York Public Library. And a member of the media told me he was there online with, you know, a
*  dozen other members of the media, all trying to get a copy of my thesis to run it through some AI,
*  they had to first do optical character recognition to convert the paper document into
*  digital. But fortunately, through a miracle, I didn't have an issue. I didn't think about
*  Nary, of course, who has whatever 130 academic works. And so we were just at the end of a vacation
*  for Christmas break. And I was early in the morning for vacation time. And all of a sudden,
*  I hear my phone ringing in the other room, or vibrating in the other room multiple times. I'm
*  like, I pick up the phone. It's our communication guy, Fran McGill. And he's like, Bill,
*  Business Insider has apparently identified a number of instances of plagiarism in Nary's
*  dissertation. Let me send you this email. He sent me the email. And they had identified four
*  paragraphs in her 330 page dissertation, where she had cited the author, but she had used
*  the vast majority of the words and that those paragraphs were from the author. And she should
*  have used quotation marks. And then there was one case where she paraphrased correctly an author,
*  but did not footnote that it was from his work. And so we were presented with this and told they're
*  going to publish in a few hours. And we're like, well, can we get to the next day? We're just
*  on about to head home. And they're like, no, we're publishing by noon. We need an answer by noon.
*  And so we downloaded the copy of her thesis on the slow internet. And Nary checked it out. And
*  she said, you know what? Looks like they're right. And I said, look, you should just admit your
*  mistake. And she wrote a very simple, gracious, yes, I should have used quotation marks. And on
*  the author, I failed to cite. She pointed out that she cited them 80 other times and wrote a
*  several paragraph section of her thesis acknowledging his work. And none of these
*  were like important parts of her thesis. But she acknowledged her mistake. And she said,
*  apologize for my mistake. And I apologize to the author who I failed to cite. And I stand on the
*  shoulders of all the people came before me and looking to advance work. We sort of thought it
*  was over. We head home. In flight on the way home, although we didn't realize this till we got back
*  the following day, Business Insider published another article and said Nary Oxman admits to
*  plagiarism. Plagiarism, of course, is academic fraud. And this thing goes crazy viral. Oh,
*  Bill, the title is Bill Ackman's wife. Celebrity academic Nary Oxman. And they use the term
*  celebrity because there are limits to what legitimate media can go after. But, you know,
*  celebrities, there's a lot more leeway in the media and what they can say. So that's why they
*  call her a celebrity. First time ever she'd been called a celebrity. And they basically she's
*  admitting to academic fraud. And then they said, and then the next day, at 5.19 p.m., I remember
*  the timeline pretty well, an email was sent to Fran McGill saying, you know, we've identified,
*  you know, two dozen other instances of plagiarism in her work, 15 of which are Wikipedia entries
*  where she copied definitions. And the others were mostly software hardware, manuals for various
*  devices or software she used in her work, most of which were in footnotes where she described a
*  nozzle for a 3D printer or something like this. And they said, we're publishing, you know, tonight.
*  The email they sent to us was 6900 words. It was 12 pages. It's practically indecipherable. You
*  couldn't even read it in an hour. And we didn't have some of the documents they were referring to.
*  And I'm like, Nary, you know what I'm going to do? I think it will be useful to provide context here.
*  I'm going to do a review of every MIT professor's dissertations, every published paper,
*  AI has enabled this. And so that was, I put out a tweet basically saying that,
*  and we're doing a test run now because we have to get it right. And I think it will be a useful
*  exercise, provide some context, if you will. And then this thing goes crazy viral. And,
*  you know, Nary is a pretty sensitive person, pretty emotional person, and someone who's a
*  perfectionist and having everyone in the world thinking you committed academic fraud is a pretty
*  damning thing. Now they did say they did a thorough review of all of her work. And this is what they
*  found. I'm like, sweetheart, that's remarkable. I did 130 works, 73 of which were peer reviewed,
*  blah, blah, blah. And she's published in Nature Science and all these different publications.
*  That's actually, it's pretty good batting average. But, you know, they can't, this is wrong.
*  Right? This is not academic fraud. Okay. These are inadvertent mistakes. And the Wikipedia entries,
*  Nary actually used Wikipedia as a dictionary. This is the early days of Wikipedia.
*  And they also referred to the MIT handbook, which has a whole section on plagiarism, academic handbook.
*  And if you read it, which I ultimately did, they make clear a few things. Number one,
*  there's plagiarism, academic fraud. And there's what they call inadvertent plagiarism, which is
*  clerical errors where you make a mistake. And it depends on intent. And there's a link that you
*  can go to, which is a section on if you get investigated at MIT, what happens, what's the
*  procedure, what's the initial stage, what's the investigative stage, what's the procedure,
*  if they identify it. And they make very clear that academic fraud is, and they list plagiarism,
*  you know, research theft, a few other things, but it does not include honest errors. Honest errors
*  are not plagiarism under MIT's own policies. And in the handbook, they also have a big section on
*  what they call common knowledge. And common knowledge depends on who you're writing your
*  thesis for. And so if it's a fact that is known by your audience, you're not required to quote
*  or cite. And so all those Wikipedia entries were for things like sustainable design,
*  computer aided design. She just took a definition from Wikipedia, common knowledge to her readers,
*  no obligation under the handbook, totally exempt. On the, using the same words, she referred to like
*  whatever, some kind of 3D printer, she was the Stratasys 3D printer. And she quoted from the
*  manual right away. Stratasys is a company you consulted for. You don't need to, that's not
*  something, you're not stealing their ideas, you're describing a nozzle for a device you use in your
*  work in a footnote. That's not a theft of idea, right? And so I'm like, this is crazy. And so
*  this has got to stop. And so I reach out to the guy I knew was on the board of business,
*  insider, the chairman, and his name is going to come public shortly. I committed to that time
*  to keep his name confidential. It's now surfaced publicly in the press.
*  Can I just pause real quick here? Just to, I don't know, there's a lot of things I want to say, but
*  you made it pretty clear, but just as a member of the community,
*  there's also like a common sense test. I think you're more precisely like legal and looking at,
*  but there's just like a bullshit test and like nothing that Nary did is plagiarism
*  in the bad meaning of the word. Plagiarism right now is becoming another ism, like racism or so on,
*  using an attack word. I don't care what the meaning of it is, but there's the bad academic
*  fraud, like theft, theft of an idea. And maybe you can say a lot of definitions and this kind of
*  stuff, but then there's just a basic bullshit test where everyone knows this is a thief and this is
*  definitely not a thief. And there's nothing about anything that Nary did, anything in her thesis or
*  in her life, everyone that knows her, she's a rock star, right? I just want to make it clear.
*  It really hurt me that the internet, whatever is happening could go after, could go after
*  a great scientist because I love science and I love celebrating great scientists.
*  And it's just really messed up that whatever the machine, we could talk about business inside or
*  whatever, social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening. We need the great scientists of the
*  world because that's like the future depends on them. And so we need to celebrate them and
*  protect them and let them flourish and let them do their thing and keep them out of this whatever
*  shit storm that we're doing to get clips and advertisements and drama and all this kind of,
*  we need to protect them. So I just want to say there's nobody I know and a million friends
*  that are scientists, world-class scientists, Nobel Prize winners, they all love Nary,
*  they all respect Nary. She did zero wrong. And then the rest of the conversation we're going to have
*  about how broken journalism is and so on. But I just want to say that there's nothing that Nary
*  did wrong. It's not a gray area or so on. I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay
*  is a discussion about plagiarism because he distracts from the fundamentals that is broken.
*  This becomes some weird technical discussion. But in case of Nary, did nothing wrong,
*  great scientist, great engineer at MIT and beyond, she's doing a cool thing now. So anyway.
*  Could not have said it better myself. Now obviously I'm focusing on the technical part.
*  Right. Because you want to be precise here.
*  Well, it's not even that. I mean, yes, I have said that we're going to sue Business Insider.
*  And in 35 years of my career, of someone who is not every article has been a favorable one.
*  Not every article has been an accurate one. I've never threatened to sue the media and I've never
*  sued the media. But this is so egregious. It's not just that she did nothing wrong,
*  but they accused her of academic fraud. They did it knowing they make reference to MIT's own
*  handbook. So they had to read all the same stuff that I read in the handbook. They did that work.
*  Then after I escalated this thing to the Henry Blodgett, the chairman of Business Insider,
*  to the CEO of Axel Springer, I even reached out to Henry Kravis at a certain point in time,
*  one of the controlling shareholders of the company through KKR, laying out the factual errors in the
*  article. Business Insider went public after they said Nary committed academic fraud and plagiarism
*  and said we didn't challenge any of the facts remain undisputed in the article. So it's basically
*  Nary committed plagiarism. That's story one. Nary admits to plagiarism. She admits to plagiarism.
*  She admitted to making a few clerical errors. That's the only thing she admitted to.
*  And she graciously apologized. So they said Nary admits to plagiarism, apologizes for plagiarism.
*  That's incredibly damning. And by the way, we're doing an investigation because we're concerned
*  that there might have been an inappropriate process, but the facts of the story have not
*  been disputed by Nary Oxman or Bill Ackman. And that was totally false. I had done it privately.
*  I'd done it publicly on Twitter, on X. I laid out, I have a whole tech stream, a WhatsApp stream with
*  the CEO of the company and they double down, they double down again. And so I don't sue people lightly.
*  And stay tuned. So you're, at least for now, moving forward with...
*  It's a certainty we're moving forward. There's a step we can take prior to suing them,
*  where we basically send them a letter demanding they make a series of corrections.
*  That if they don't make those corrections, the next step is litigation. I hope we can avoid the
*  next step. And I'm just making sure that when we present the demand to Business Insider and also
*  to Axel Springer, that it's incredibly clear how they defamed her, the factual mistakes in her stories
*  and what they need to do to fix it. And if we can fix it there, we can move on from this episode
*  and hopefully avoid litigation. So that's where we are.
*  I don't know. You're smarter than me. There's technical stuff, there's legal stuff,
*  there's journalistic stuff, but just fuck you, Business Insider, for doing this. I don't know,
*  I don't know much in this world, but journalists aren't supposed to do that.
*  No, look, we're going to surface all this stuff publicly, ultimately. The email was not to nary
*  saying there was plagiarism at work. The email came from a reporter named Catherine Long.
*  And the headline was, Your Wife Committed Plagiarism. Shouldn't She Be Fired from MIT?
*  Just like you caused Claudine Gay to be fired from Harvard. It was a political agenda.
*  She doesn't like me. And she was trying to hurt me. And they couldn't find plagiarism in my thesis.
*  And being the subject of short, being a short seller, the Herbalife battle went on for years.
*  They tried to do everything to destroy my reputation. So they've already gone to my trash.
*  They've already done all that work. So anything they could possibly find, I've always lived a very
*  clean life, thankfully. And if you're going to be an activist short seller, you better because
*  they're going to find out dirt on you if it exists. And so they're like, how can we really hurt Bill?
*  By the way, Nary had left MIT years earlier. When the reporter found out she was no longer
*  a member of the MIT faculty, they were enraged. They didn't believe us. They made us like,
*  prove to us she's no longer on the MIT faculty because they wanted to get her fired. And by the
*  way, malice is one of the important factors in determining whether defamation has taken place.
*  And this was a malice driven, this was not about news. And the unfortunate thing about journalism
*  is Business Insider made a fortune from this. This story was published and republished by
*  thousands of media organizations around the world. It was the number one trending thing on Twitter
*  for like two days. Every newspaper, it was on the front page of every Israeli newspaper,
*  was on the front page of the Financial Times. And she's building a business. And if you're CEO
*  of a science company and you committed academic fraud, that's incredibly damaging. But I ultimately
*  convinced her that this was good. I said, sweetheart, you're amazing. You're incredible.
*  You're incredibly talented, but you're mostly known in the design world. Now, everyone in the
*  universe has heard of Neri Oxman. We're going to get this thing cleared up. You're going to be
*  doing an event in six months where you're going to go out of stealth mode. You can tell the world
*  about all the incredible things that you're building and you're designing and you're creating.
*  And it's going to be like the iPhone launch because everyone's going to be paying attention
*  and they're going to want to see your work. And that's how I try to cheer up. But I think it's
*  true. It is true. And you're doing your job is a good part in seeing the silver lining of all of
*  this. How is, just from observing her, how did she stay strong through all this psychologically?
*  Because at least I know she's pushing ahead with the work. Oh, she's full speed ahead in her work.
*  She's built an amazing team. She's hired 30 scientists, roboticists, people who, biologists,
*  plant specialists, material scientists, engineers, really incredible crew. She's built this 36,000
*  square foot lab in New York City that's one of a kind. They're working out of it. It's still
*  under construction while they're working out of it. And so she's going to do amazing things.
*  But as I said, she's an extremely sensitive person. She's a perfectionist. Imagine thinking
*  that the entire world thinks you committed academic fraud. And so that was very hard for her.
*  She's a very positive person, but I saw her in, I would say her darkest emotional period for sure.
*  She's doing much better now. But you can kill someone. You can kill someone by destroying
*  their reputation. People commit suicide. People go into these deep dark depression.
*  Well, my worry, primarily when I saw what Business Insider was doing is that they might dim the light
*  of a truly special scientist and creator.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  But I also worry about others like young naries that this sends a signal to that might scare them.
*  And journalism shouldn't scare aspiring young scientists.
*  The problem is the defamation law in the US is so favorable to the publisher, to the media,
*  and so unfavorable to the victim. And the incentives are all wrong.
*  When you went from paper version of journalism to digital, and you could track how many people click,
*  and it's a medium that advertising drives the economics. And if you can show an advertiser
*  more clicks, you can make more money. So a journalist is incentivized to write a story
*  that will generate more clicks. How do you write a story that will generate more clicks?
*  You get a billionaire guy, and then you go after his wife, and you make a sensationalist story,
*  and you give them no time to respond. Look at the timing here. On the first story,
*  they gave us three hours. On the second one, the following day, 5.19 p.m., the email comes in,
*  not to Nari, not to her firm, but to my communications person who tracks us down by 5.30,
*  10 minutes later. And they published their story 92 minutes after, and they sent us,
*  we're going to surface all these documents in our demand. Read the email they sent,
*  whether you could even decipher it. And by the way, there's a reason why academic institutions,
*  when professors accused of plagiarism, why they have these very careful processes with multiple
*  stages, and they can take a year or more because it depends on intent. In order to be a crime,
*  an academic crime, you've got to prove that they intentionally stole. Look, in some cases,
*  it's obvious. In some cases, it's very subtle, and they take this stuff super seriously.
*  But they basically accused Nari of academic crime, and then 92 minutes later, they said she
*  committed an academic crime, and that should be a crime, and that should be punishable
*  with litigation. And there should be a real cost. And we're going to make sure there's a real cost,
*  reputationally and otherwise, to Business Insider and to Axel Springer, because ultimately,
*  you've got to look to the controlling owner. They're responsible.
*  I'll just say that you, in this regard, are inspiring to me for facing, basically,
*  an institution that's whole purpose is to write articles. So you're like going into the fire.
*  My kid's school, the epithet for the school or the saying is,
*  go forth unafraid. It's a good way to live. And again, words can't harm me. The power of X,
*  and we do owe Ilan enormous thanks for this, is now, so for example, the Washington Post
*  wrote a story about me a couple days ago. And I didn't think the story was a fair story. So
*  within a few hours of the story being written, I'm able to put out a response to the story
*  and send it to 1,200,000 people, and it gets read and reread. I haven't checked, but it's
*  probably 5 million people saw my response. Now, those are the people on X. It's not everyone in
*  the world. There's a disconnection between the X world and the offline world. But reputation
*  in my business is basically all you have. And as they say, you can take a lifetime to build
*  a reputation and take five minutes to have it disappear, and the media plays a very important
*  role, and they can destroy people. At least we now have a lot of people who are in the media
*  at least we now have some ability to fight back. We have a platform we can surface our views.
*  The typical old days, they write an incredibly damning article and you point out factual errors,
*  and then two months later, they bury a little correction on page whatever. By then, the person
*  was fired or their life was destroyed or the reputation is damaged. I was with Warren Buffett
*  talking about media and it's something he, a business he really loves. And he says, you know
*  what, Bill? He said, a thief with a dagger. The only person who can cause you more harm than a
*  thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen. And those were very powerful words.
*  So you think X, formerly known as Twitter, is a kind of neutralizing force to that,
*  to the power of centralized journalistic institutions?
*  100%. And I think it's a really important one. And it's really been eye opening for me
*  to see how stories get covered in mainstream media. And then you actually, what I do on X is I follow
*  people on multiple sides of an issue. And you can, or I post on a topic and I get to
*  hear the other side. I read the replies. And the truth is something that people have had a lot of
*  question about, particularly in the last, I would say five years, beginning with Trump's
*  talking about fake news. And a lot of what Trump said about fake news is true.
*  The world, a big part of the world hated Trump and did everything they could to discredit him,
*  destroy him. And he did a lot of things, perhaps deserving of being discredited,
*  used by a very imperfect, in some cases harmful leader. But everything from pre-election,
*  the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post that then Twitter made difficult for people
*  to share and to read COVID, the Jai Bhattacharyas of the world questioning the government's response,
*  questioning long-term lockdowns, questioning keeping kids out of school,
*  questions about masks, about vaccines, which are still not definitively answered.
*  No counterbalance to the power of the government when the government can shut down
*  avenues for free speech. And where the mainstream media has kind of towed the line in many extents
*  to the government's actions. So having a independently owned powerful platform is very
*  important for truth, for free speech, for hearing the other side of the story, for counterbalancing
*  the power of the government. Elon is getting a lot of pushback. The SpaceX's and Tesla's of the
*  world are experiencing a lot of government questions and investigations. And even the
*  President of the United States came out and said, look, he needs to be investigated.
*  I'm getting my own version of that in terms of some negative media articles. I don't know what's
*  next. But yeah, if you stick your neck out in today's world and you go against the establishment
*  or at least the existing administration, you can find yourself in a very challenged place.
*  And that discourages people from sharing stuff. And that's why anonymous speech is important,
*  some of what you find on Twitter. You mentioned Trump. I have to talk to you about politics.
*  Sure. Amongst all the other battles, you've also been a part of that one. Maybe you can correct me
*  on this, but you've been a big supporter of various Democratic candidates over the years.
*  But you did say a lot of nice things about Donald Trump in 2016, I believe.
*  So I was interviewed by Andrew Sorkin a week after Trump won the election.
*  And I made my case for why I thought he could be a good president.
*  Yes. So what was the case back then? To which degree did that turn out to be true? And to which
*  degree did it not? To which degree was he a good president? To which degree was he not?
*  I think what I said at the time was the United States is actually a huge business. And it reminds
*  me a bit of the type of activist investments we've taken on over time, where this really,
*  really great business has kind of lost its way. And with the right leadership, we can fix it.
*  And if you think about the business of the United States today, you've got $32 trillion with the
*  debt. So it's over leveraged and it's highly leveraged and the leverage is only increasing.
*  We're losing money, i.e. revenues aren't covering expenses. The cost of our debt is going up,
*  as interest rates have gone up and the debt has to be rolled over. We have enormous administrative
*  bloat in the country. The regulatory regime is incredibly complicated and burdensome
*  and impeding growth. Our relations with our competitor nations and our friendly nations
*  are far from ideal. And those conditions were present in 2020 as well. They're just, I would
*  say, worse now. And I said, look, it's a great thing that we have a businessman as president.
*  And in my lifetime, he's really the first businessman as opposed to, I mean, maybe
*  Bush to some degree was a business person. But I thought, okay, I was one of the CEO to be
*  CEO of America and now we have Trump. Look, he's got some personal qualities that seem less ideal,
*  but he's going to be president of the United States. He's going to rise to the occasion.
*  This is going to be his legacy. And he knows how to make deals. And he's going to recruit some great
*  people into his administration, I hoped. And growth can solve a lot of our problems. So if we can
*  get rid of a bunch of regulations that are holding back the country, we can have a president. Obama
*  was a, I would say, not a pro-business president. He did not love the business community. He did
*  not love successful people. And having a president who just changed the tone on being a pro-business
*  president, I thought would be good for the country. And that's basically what I said.
*  And I would say Trump did a lot of good things. And a lot of people, you can get criticized for
*  acknowledging that. But I think the country's economy accelerated dramatically. And that,
*  by the way, the capitalist system helps the people at the bottom best when the system does well,
*  and when the economy does well. The black unemployment rate was the lowest in history
*  when Trump was president. And that's true for other minority groups. So he was good for the economy.
*  And he recognized some of the challenges and issues and threats of China early.
*  He kind of woke up NATO. Now, again, the way he did all this stuff, you can object to.
*  But NATO actually started spending more money on defense in the early part of Trump's presidency
*  because of his threats, which turned out to be a good thing in light of ultimately the Russia-Ukraine
*  war. And I think if you analyze Trump objectively based on policies, he did a lot of good for the
*  country. I think what's bad is he did some harm as well. I do think civility disappeared in America
*  with Trump as president. A lot of that's his personal style. And how important is civility?
*  I do think he was attacked very aggressively by the left, by the media that made him paranoid.
*  It probably interfered with his ability to be successful. He had the Russian collusion,
*  investigation, overhang. And when someone's attacked, they're not going to be at their best,
*  particularly if they're paranoid. I think there's some degree of that. But I'm giving the best of
*  defense to Trump. Just you look at how he managed his team. Very few people made it through the
*  Trump administration without getting fired or quitting. And who would say they're the
*  greatest person in the world when he hired them and they're a total disaster when he fired them.
*  It's not an inspiring way to be a leader and to attract really talented people. I think the events
*  surrounding the election, I think January 6th, he could have done a lot more to stop
*  a riot. I don't consider it an insurrection, but a riot that takes place in our capital
*  and where police officers are killed or die, commit suicide, because for failure as they
*  sought to do their job, he stepped in way too late to stop that. He could have stopped it early.
*  Many of his words, I think, inspired people, some of whom with mal-intent, to go in there and cause
*  harm and literally to shut down the government. There were some evil people, unfortunately, there.
*  So he's been a very imperfect president and also, I think, contributed to the extreme amount of
*  divisiveness in our country. So I was ultimately disappointed by the note of optimism. And again,
*  I always support the president. I trust the people ultimately to select our next leader.
*  It's a bit like who wants to be a millionaire? When you go to the crowd and the crowd says
*  certain thing, you got to trust the crowd. But usually in who wants to be a millionaire,
*  it's a landslide in one direction. So you know which letter to pick. Here we had an incredibly
*  close election, which itself is a problem. So my dream and what I've tried a little bit,
*  played politics in the last little period, to support some alternatives to Trump so that we
*  have a president. I use the example. Imagine you woke up in the morning, it's election day,
*  whatever it is, November 4th, whatever, 2024, and you still haven't figured out who to vote for
*  because the candidates are so appealing that you don't know which lever to pull because it's a
*  tough call. That's the choice we should be making as Americans. It shouldn't be, I'm a member of
*  this party and I'm only going to vote this way. I'm a member of that party, I'm going to vote the
*  other way and I hate the other side. And that's where it's been, unfortunately, for too long.
*  Or you might be torn because both candidates are not good.
*  Yeah.
*  So you want to, I love a future where I'm torn because the choices are so amazing.
*  The problem is the party system is so screwed up and the parties are self-interested
*  and there's another governance problem, right? An incentive problem. Michael Porter,
*  who was one of my professors at Harvard Business School, wrote a brilliant piece
*  on the American political system and all the incentives and market dynamics and what he
*  called a competitive analysis. And it's a must read. I should dig it up and send it around on X,
*  but it explains how the parties and the incentives of these sort of self-sustaining
*  entities that, you know, where the people involved are not incentivized to do what's
*  best for the country. It's a problem.
*  You've been a supporter of Dean Phillips for the 2024 US presidential race.
*  Yes.
*  What do you like about Dean?
*  I think he's a honest, smart, motivated, capable, proven guy as a business leader. And I think
*  in six, almost, you know, in his three terms in Congress, he ran when Trump was elected,
*  he said, you know, kids cried, his daughters cried, inspired him to run for office.
*  Ran in a Republican district in Minnesota for the last 60 years.
*  Was elected in the landslide, has been reelected twice, moved up the ranks in the Congress,
*  you know, respected by his fellow members of Congress, advanced some important legislation
*  during COVID, you know, senior roles on various foreign policy committees. Centrist, you know,
*  considered, I think, the second most bipartisan member of the Congress. I'd love to have a
*  bipartisan president. That's the only way to get kind of go forward. But we'd enormously benefit
*  if we had a president that chose policies on the basis of what's best for the country, as opposed
*  to what his party wanted. What I like about him is he's financially independent. He's not a
*  billionaire, but he doesn't need the job. The party hates him now because he challenged the king.
*  Right. And so, but he's willing to give up his political career because what he thought was
*  best for the country, he tried to get other people to run who were of higher profile,
*  had more name recognition, none would. No one wants to challenge Biden. You know, if they want
*  to be, have a chance to stay in office or run in the future. But he's very principled. I think he
*  would be a great president. But he needs, his shot is Michigan, but he needs to raise money in order
*  to, he's only got a couple of weeks and he's got to be on TV there. That's expensive. So we'll see.
*  So he has to increase name recognition and all that kind of stuff. Also, as you mentioned,
*  he's young. Yeah, he's 55, but he's a young 55. You see him play hockey. Yeah. I mean, I guess 55,
*  no matter what, is a pretty young age. I'm 57. I feel young. I can do more pull-ups today than I
*  could as a kid. So that's a standard. You're at the top of your tennis game. I'm at the top of my
*  tennis game, for sure. Maybe there's someone that would disagree with that. And by the way, the
*  other thing to point out here is, and I have been pointing this out as have others, Biden is, I think
*  he's done. I mean, it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing for the country having him as a
*  presidential candidate, let alone the president of the country. It's crazy. And it's just going to
*  get worse and worse. And he should, you know, the worst of his legacy is his ego that prevents him
*  from stepping aside. And that's it. It's his ego. And it is so wrong and so bad and so embarrassing.
*  You know, you talk to people, I was in Europe, I was in London a few days ago, and people are like,
*  Bill, how can this guy be a president? And it's a bit like, again, I go back to my business analogy,
*  being a CEO is like a full contact sport. Being president of the United States is like some
*  combination of wrestling, marathon running, you know, being a triathlete. I mean, you've got to be
*  in a serious physical shape and at the top of your game to represent this country. And he is
*  a far cry from that. And it's just getting worse. And it's embarrassing. And he cannot be,
*  and by the way, every day he waits, he's handing the election to Trump, because it's harder and
*  harder for an alternative candidate to surface. Now, Dean is the only candidate left on the
*  Democratic side that can still win delegates. He's on the ballot in 42 states. And the best
*  for Biden to step aside is for Dean to show well in Michigan. And so you think there is a path with
*  the delegates and all that kind of stuff? 100%. So if he, if what has to happen is what New Hampshire,
*  he went from zero to 20% of the vote and 10 weeks with no name recognition. You know,
*  I helped a little bit, Elon helped, we did a spaces for him. We had 350,000 people on the spaces,
*  some originally 40,000 live or something, and then the rest after. And then he was on the ground in
*  New Hampshire. And New Hampshire is one of the states where you don't need to be registered
*  to a party to vote for the candidate. So it's like Jumple. And he got 20%. And that's with a
*  lot of independents and Democrats voting for Haley. Haley, who I like and who I've supported,
*  does not look like she's going to make it. You know, Trump is really kind of running the table.
*  And so vote for Haley as an independent in Michigan, maybe throw away your vote. I think
*  it increases the likelihood that Dean can get those independent votes. If he could theoretically,
*  again, he needs money. He could beat Biden in Michigan. Biden's doing very poorly in Michigan.
*  His polls are terrible. The Muslim community is not happy with him. And he really has spent no
*  time there. And so if he's embarrassed in Michigan, it could be a catalyst for him withdrawing. Then
*  Dean will get funding. If he wins Michigan or shows well in Michigan, and people say he's
*  viable, he's the only choice we have, he'll attract from the center, he'll attract from people,
*  Republicans who won't vote for Trump, which they're a big percentage, could be 60% or more,
*  it could be 70% won't vote for Trump. And also from the Democrats. So I think he's a really
*  interesting candidate. But we got to get the word out. Yeah, I got an chance to chat with Dean. I
*  really like him. I really like him. And I think the next president of the United States is going
*  to have to meet and speak regularly with Zelensky, Putin, and Yahoo with world leaders and have
*  some of the most historic conversations, agreements, negotiations. And I just don't
*  see Biden doing that. No. And not for any reason, but sadly, H.
*  Think about it this way. When Biden's in present now, you saw his recent impromptu press conference,
*  which he did after the special prosecutor report, basically saying the guy was way past his prime.
*  And then he confused the president of Mexico and the president of Egypt. So they're very careful
*  when they roll him out. And he's scripted and he's always reading from a lectern. Imagine the care
*  they have in exposing him. And when they expose him, it's terrible. Okay, imagine how bad it is
*  for real. So not good. No bad, really bad for America. And I'm upset with him and upset with
*  his family. I'm upset with his wife. This is the time where the people closest to you have to put
*  their arms around you and say, you know, dad, you know, honey, you've done your thing. This is going
*  to be your legacy. And it's not going to be a good one. Great leaders should also know what to step
*  down. Yeah. One of the best tests of a leader is succession planning. This is a massive failure
*  of succession planning. Outside of politics. Let me look to the future. First, in terms of
*  the financial world, what are you looking forward to in the next couple of years? You have a new fund.
*  What are you thinking about in terms of investment, your own and the entire economy,
*  and maybe even the economy of the world? Sure. So the SEC doesn't like us to talk about
*  new funds that we're launching that we filed with the SEC. Sure. But I would say I do,
*  and by the way, if anyone's ever interested in a fund, they should always read the prospectus
*  carefully, including the risk factors. That's very, very important. But I like the idea of
*  democratizing access to good investors. And I think that's an interesting trend. So we want to
*  be part of that trend. In terms of financial markets, generally the economy, you know,
*  a lot is going to depend upon the next leader of the country. So we're kind of right back there.
*  You know, the leadership of the United States is important for the US economy. It's important
*  for the global economy. It's important for global peace. And we've gone through a really
*  difficult period and it's time. We need a break. But, you know, look, I think the United States is
*  incredibly resilient country. We have some incredible moats. Among them, we have the
*  Atlantic and the Pacific, and we have, you know, peaceful neighbors to the north and the south.
*  We're an enormously rich country. Capitalism still works effectively here. I get optimistic
*  about the world when I talk to my friends who are either venture capitalists or my hobby of
*  backing these young entrepreneurs. I talk to a founder of a startup if you want to get optimist
*  about the world. So I think technology is going to save us. I think AI, of course, has its frightening
*  Terminator-like scenarios. But I'm going to take the opposite view that this is going to be a huge
*  enabler of productivity, scientific discovery, drug discovery, and it's going to make us healthier,
*  happier, and better. So I do think, you know, the internet revolution had a lot of good,
*  obviously some bad. I think the AI revolution is going to be similar, but we're at this other
*  really interesting juncture in the world, you know, with technology. And we're going to have
*  to use it for our good. On the media front, I'm happy about X. I think Elon's going to be
*  successful here. I think advertisers will realize it's a really good platform. The best way to reach
*  me, if you want to sell something to me, I suppose I've actually bought stuff on some ads in X. I
*  don't remember the last time I responded to direct response advertising. You know, in terms of
*  my business, I have an incredible team. It's tiny. We're one of the smallest firms relative to the
*  assets we manage. It's a bit like, you know, the Navy SEALs, you know, not the US Army.
*  We have only 40 people at Pershing Square. So it's a tight team. I think we'll do great things.
*  I think we're early on. You know, my ambitions, investment wise, I've always wanted to,
*  I've always said I'd like to have a record as good as Warren Buffett's.
*  The problem is each year he adds on another year. He's now in his 93rd year. So I've got 36 more
*  years to just get where he is. And I think he's going to add a lot more years. I'm excited about
*  seeing what Neri is going to produce. You know, she's building an incredible company. They're
*  trying to solve a lot of problems with respect to products and buildings and their impact on
*  the environment. Her vision is how do we design products that by virtue of the product's existence,
*  the world is a better place. You know, today you make, you know, her world is a world where
*  the existence of the new car actually is better for the environment than if the new car hadn't
*  existed. And think about that in every product scale. That's what she's working on. I don't want
*  to give away too much, but you're going to see some early examples of what she's working on.
*  So again, I get excited about the future. And crises are sort of a terrible thing to waste.
*  And we've had a number of these here. I think this disaster in the Middle East,
*  my prediction is the next few months, this war will largely be over in terms of getting rid of
*  Hamas. I think I can envision a world in which Saudi Arabia, some of the other Gulf states come
*  together, take over the governance and reconstruction of Gaza, security guarantees are put in place.
*  The Abraham Accords continue to grow. A deal is made. Terrorists are ostracized.
*  At this October 7th experience on the Harvard, Penn, MIT, Columbia, unfortunately other
*  campuses is a wake-up call for universities. Generally, people see the problems with DEI,
*  but understand the importance of diversity and inclusion, but not as a political movement,
*  but as a way that we return to a meritocratic world where someone's background is relevant in
*  understanding their contribution. But we don't have race quotas and things that were made illegal
*  years ago actually being implemented in organizations on campus. So I think we can
*  go through a corrective phase and I'm an optimist and I hope we get there.
*  So you have hope for the entirety of it, even for Harvard.
*  I have hope even for Harvard. It's generally hard to break 400-year-old things.
*  Well, I share your hope and you're a fascinating mind, a brilliant mind, persistent,
*  as you like to say, and fearless. The fearless part is truly inspiring and this is an incredible
*  conversation. Thank you. Thank you for talking today, Bill. Thank you, Lex.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bill Ackman. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Jonathan Swift. A wise person should have money in their head, but not in their heart.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
