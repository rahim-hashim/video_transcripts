# Brett Johnson: US Most Wanted Cybercriminal | Lex Fridman Podcast #272
**Lex Fridman:** [March 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC1LFC0KFSw)
*  I was on the run for four months stole $600,000.
*  I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.
*  One day I had stolen the night before I had stolen 160 K out of ATMs.
*  When in the next, the next morning I woke up, signed onto Carter's market.com,
*  which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman.
*  And there's my name, U.S.
*  Most Wanted on it.
*  And that gets your attention.
*  That was my real name with the U.S.
*  Most Wanted beside of it.
*  Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.
*  But then they did.
*  And it was talking about me being part of the secret service, Operation
*  Anglerfish, everything else.
*  So of course they're all, they're all like, everybody's after like, Oh yeah,
*  we're, we're going to get this son of a bitch.
*  The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson, a former cyber criminal
*  who built the first organized cyber crime community called Shadow Crew.
*  That is the precursor to today's dark net and dark net markets.
*  He's referred to by the United States Secret Service as quote, the
*  original internet godfather.
*  He has been the central figure in the cyber crime world for almost 20 years,
*  placed on the U.S.
*  Most Wanted list in 2006 before being convicted of 39 felonies for cyber crime,
*  escaped from prison, and then eventually being locked up, served his time.
*  And now is helping people understand and fight cyber crime.
*  This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.
*  Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people, and yet his own story is full
*  of trauma and pain and also redemption and love.
*  This is a good time to say that I have, and I will talk to people who have served
*  time in prison and perhaps people who currently are in prison.
*  I will try to do my best to both empathize with the person across from me
*  and not let them sugarcoat, explain away or dismiss the crimes they committed.
*  This is a tough line to walk because if you close your heart to the other person,
*  you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.
*  But if you open the heart too much, you can be manipulated to where the
*  conversation reveals nothing honest or real.
*  This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.
*  I don't know about the skill part, but I'd like to take the risk.
*  I always wear my heart on my sleeve.
*  If I get hurt for it, that's life.
*  As I've said, I want to understand what makes a person do these crimes.
*  The particular characteristics of their temporary or permanent madness,
*  their justifications, but also their humanity.
*  I believe each of us have the capacity to become both the criminal and the
*  victim, the predator and the prey.
*  It's up to us to avoid these paths or to find the path to redemption.
*  It's on each of us.
*  It's our responsibility and burden of being human in a
*  complicated and dangerous world.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.
*  You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime placed on the
*  U.S. most wanted list in 2006.
*  Escaped from prison.
*  You built the first organized cybercrime community called Shadow Crew.
*  That is the precursor to today's dark net and dark net markets.
*  And for all this, the U.S.
*  intelligence service called you the original internet godfather.
*  So first question, how did your career as a cybercrime criminal begin?
*  My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.
*  10 years old, man.
*  Think about that.
*  I mean, you were probably playing the robots when you were 10.
*  You know, usually kids are doing the Lego bit, getting involved with sports,
*  everything else.
*  And with me, it wasn't like that with me.
*  I'm from Eastern Kentucky.
*  Eastern Kentucky is one of these, it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana
*  that if you're not fortunate enough to have a job, you may be involved in a
*  scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you want to call it, man.
*  I was, my parents, my mom was basically the captain of the entire fraud industry.
*  So this is a, this is a woman that at one point she's stealing a 108,000 pound
*  Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, tramming it down the road.
*  You know, at another point she's taken a slip and fall in a convenience
*  store, trying to sue the owner.
*  We had a neighbor.
*  She acted as a pimp for at one point.
*  That's my mom.
*  My dad.
*  Wait, wait.
*  The neighbor acted as a pimp.
*  My mom prostituted.
*  I mean, she, she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.
*  Um, her name was Debbie and, uh, my mom used to sell her out.
*  You know, Debbie needed money and my mom would find men for her to sleep with for
*  cash and she'd take a part of the cash.
*  So it sounds like she diversified the methodologies by which she, uh,
*  hustled very bad, that entrepreneurial spirit.
*  We see that a lot with, uh, with cyber criminals, you know, that, uh, that
*  sense of being that entrepreneur.
*  So what was the motivation you think for her?
*  Is it, uh, is it money?
*  Is it basically the, uh, the rush of playing with the system of being able to,
*  um, know the rules and break the rules and get away with it?
*  My mom's a complex character.
*  She is, there's no one single motivation.
*  So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.
*  My mom was the individual who tested people.
*  She wanted to know how far she could abuse you and you come back and still love her.
*  So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.
*  Um, she would cheat on the men she was involved with.
*  She would abuse the, uh, her children, me and Denise, she would, uh, um,
*  Psychological, physical.
*  Oh, it was mental, emotional.
*  Physical, um, everything, everything.
*  I mean, she, uh, she used to beat me and Denise with, uh, with belt buckles, you
*  know, and that ended when, uh, she was, I forgot what we had done.
*  It wasn't much.
*  I think that, uh, um, it may have been the part where she, she accused me of
*  stealing her marijuana, but, uh, she was hitting me and Denise.
*  We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.
*  She was hitting me and Denise.
*  We were, we were on the bed trying to get away from it and Denise kicks
*  her through a closet is what happens.
*  And, uh, Denise stands up and she said, uh, you're through hitting me.
*  And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point.
*  But, um, so sorry to take us there.
*  You're, uh, for people who know you and people should definitely watch some of
*  your lectures online, you're extremely charismatic and fun and, uh, jolly and
*  whatever word you want to use.
*  But, you know, if we look at that kind of life, it's there's darkness there.
*  There's a struggle there.
*  There's a lot of darkness.
*  So if you, if you, how did you feel if you go back to the mind of the kid you
*  were with your mom was, um, was there sadness?
*  Was there things like depression, self doubt, all those kinds of things?
*  Or did you see this crime, this chaos as ultimately exciting?
*  You know, I don't think back then I didn't do it as exciting.
*  Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved in cyber cyber crime.
*  All right.
*  But back then it was simply a means to an end was all it was.
*  So you take a 10 year old kid and the way I get involved in crime is like
*  I said, my mom was the fraudster.
*  My dad was, my dad was a good guy.
*  He just forgot he was this good guy.
*  You know, he was always, he always had these principles.
*  But his issue was, is he loved my mom so much.
*  He was scared of her leaving.
*  So if she wanted to do something, commit crime, cheat on him, whatever, he
*  would pretty much just put up with it.
*  Um, the, the one instant.
*  So, I mean, this woman used to, she used to bring men home in front of him.
*  Tell him that, Hey, I'm leaving you.
*  I don't love you anymore.
*  I want you to die.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  This was my mom.
*  Um, there were two instances where the man, where he can't take it anymore.
*  And the first instance I was, I guess I was seven or eight, my sister, Denise
*  is a year younger than I am.
*  My dad actually files for divorce, files for divorce at that point.
*  My mom, um, kind of goes crazy.
*  Uh, my dad, I was with my dad.
*  My, my sister was with my mother because that's that Eastern Kentucky mentality.
*  You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.
*  So, um, he was filing for divorce.
*  Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.
*  My mom was living with, uh, with her grandparents and with her parents
*  bouncing back and forth between the two.
*  And I remember I was sleeping in the bed.
*  We had a single wide bed.
*  My dad slept on the, on the sofa.
*  I woke up one night and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.
*  So I wake up and I walk into the living room and my mom has a knife to my dad's
*  throat and basically you're not going to steal my son from me.
*  My mom was this individual that when she knew she went so far, like I said, she
*  was always this person that tested.
*  Well, can I do this to you?
*  And you'll still come back.
*  She knew she, she was always also this person that if she went too far, she knew
*  it and she would always try to divert that into something else.
*  All right.
*  So she knew at that point she'd went too far.
*  So what does she do?
*  She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom and pretends to slit her wrists so that
*  my dad Ray will respond to that, not respond to what she's just done to him.
*  That was my mom in a nutshell.
*  She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.
*  Um, motivations as far as fraud with her, I think with her, it was, uh, she was an
*  LPN, she had a very good nurse, but she didn't want to work.
*  Was a lot of it.
*  So, so with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.
*  And when I say commit fraud, it was against businesses, against people.
*  I remember at one point she's, uh, she's buying over the counter capsules and
*  emptying the capsules out and putting some other crap in there, in there and
*  selling it at a speed and people are buying it.
*  She did anything she could for money.
*  And of course I get involved with that.
*  What happens is, is my, we were in East, we were in Panama city at that point.
*  And, uh, my mom leaves my dad and the way she left my dad, my great grandfather had
*  died, my mom tells all three of us, Hey, I'm, we're going, I'm taking the kids.
*  And we're going back to Eastern Kentucky to attend the funeral.
*  Well, that was her leaving me and Denise didn't know she didn't pack any of our
*  clothes at all.
*  She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car and she leaves my dad.
*  And I don't get to see my dad again for, I think five, six years, something like
*  that.
*  My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home in front of my dad.
*  She would, uh, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.
*  She'd do it anyway.
*  When she leaves them, she kept up that.
*  So we were, um, we were living at my grandparents house.
*  My grandfather, he had converted the house.
*  He had raised the house up and built apartments underneath of it.
*  So me and my sister and my mom lived in one of the apartments underneath.
*  And, uh, that whole side of the family was just nuts.
*  It was nuts.
*  My, my granddad, Paul, he would, this, this is a man that, uh, he didn't
*  want you to eat any of his food.
*  So, you know, there was no such thing as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.
*  If he found out me and Denise were, was taking a bath, we were allowed to bath
*  and bathe in two inches of water one time a week because he didn't want to have
*  to pay the water bill.
*  There's rules.
*  There are rules.
*  You know, if you couldn't have the TV on when he went to bed at night, you had
*  to have the television, the volume, you could watch it, but without volume,
*  because if he heard it, he would, he would get up in the middle of the night and he
*  would kick the power breaker, turn off all the power on you.
*  This is my, this is my, the family, right?
*  So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home for, uh, for days, man, for
*  days, she'd go out and, you know, party.
*  And, uh, I mean, sometimes she'd take me into these weather.
*  We'd wait in the car.
*  Sometimes we had, uh, wait in the living room and she wouldn't
*  party and everything else.
*  Most of the time she left, left us at home.
*  And, um, my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day she's, she's nine years
*  old, man, she walks in one day and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand.
*  And, uh, looked at her and I said, where'd you get that?
*  And she's like, I stole it.
*  And you know, it's like, show me how you did that.
*  So she takes me over and she shows me how she steals food, how she's
*  stuffing it down her pants.
*  So we start stealing food.
*  I'm like, hell yeah, let's do that shit.
*  So, uh, start stealing food.
*  And we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.
*  Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.
*  So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.
*  I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the, uh, off the rack, take the tags off
*  of it, wear it out, work just fine.
*  And the way you steal bread is you put the hoodie over your shoulder, stuff
*  a loaf of bread down the sleeve and you walk out with it.
*  So we started doing that.
*  How'd you figure that out?
*  Just thought pattern.
*  So you, so there's, there's like strategic thinking here.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you can't wear the hoodie and put the bread down here.
*  Cause you might mash the bread when you zip it up or they have to think through
*  that, you got to think through it, but you got to realize about, by this point,
*  I'm hell, I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.
*  You know, I'm already seeing that kind of puzzle solving was something you
*  already developed in division because you're pretty young.
*  Yeah.
*  10 years old, pretty young, but, but seeing how they act, how they
*  respond to things and, and my mom, I guess you call it a good thing.
*  She, they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there was no, no discussions behind closed doors.
*  All that happened in front of everybody.
*  And from your young minds perspective, seeing that kind of crime, you
*  basically, you know, a lot of us kind of grow up thinking there's rules.
*  You're not supposed to break.
*  If you see other humans breaking those rules, then you realize
*  those rules are just human made.
*  But it gets worse than that.
*  I was in an environment where there were no decent people.
*  I didn't really meet my first decent person until I was 16 years old.
*  Who's that?
*  That was a high school teacher.
*  So what happens is, is, um, you know, we start shoplifting food.
*  My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff and, you know, she joins us.
*  What's that?
*  She joins us.
*  Yeah.
*  She comes in, you know, I've got the Intellivision, I've got the
*  Atari 2600 play the hell out of it.
*  Oh my God.
*  She starts seeing this shit.
*  She's like, where'd this come from?
*  And I'm like, well, we found it.
*  She's like, you didn't find that Denise, Denise stands up.
*  We stole it.
*  My mom show me how you did that.
*  And she gets her mom too, to join in.
*  And she used to run me and Denise as these little shoplifters.
*  We'd take, uh, you know, we'd steal stuff for her.
*  We would distract security and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.
*  Um, they got caught doing that, but that's, that's the entry into crime.
*  And Denise, you know, I'm adamant and I, I kind of mean it, but the truth is I say,
*  and I do, I do mean it that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult.
*  All right.
*  I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that the adults in your
*  environment control what you do.
*  All right.
*  Once you're an adult though, your choices are yours.
*  Now that being said, there, there's some, you can't dismiss that childhood
*  influencing what I did as an adult.
*  You can't do that.
*  I mean, it was kind of written on, on slate that, Hey, this guy's going to
*  beat this guy when he grows up.
*  That said, like sometimes that one person you meet, that decent person
*  can turn the tide.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  So what happens is, is, you know, the abuse, everything continues on.
*  When I'm 15, my dad was in, uh, was in Panama city, Florida.
*  My mom was in, uh, you know, we were in hazard, Kentucky.
*  She, um, she was dating this guy.
*  She, and my mom was a, this woman that, uh, the abuse would, it was, it was
*  crazy abuse, man, just crazy stuff.
*  You, she would tell me and my sister, you know, that, uh, she gave up her life for
*  us, that she was going to leave one day and never come back that we'd find her
*  dead in a ditch someplace.
*  She'd go out and date these men and she'd come back and she'd talk about how
*  these men were abusing her, you know?
*  So she'd be dating this guy and, uh, she'd come back and then she'd start
*  talking about how he had tried to rape her, you know, trying to get me to respond
*  to that and I would respond to that.
*  Make no doubt.
*  I would respond to that.
*  Well, what happens is, and I knew that, uh, I don't know if I knew it
*  was abuse at that age, all right.
*  But I knew things were fucked up.
*  And, uh, I was talking to my dad in Panama city and I really had it in my head that,
*  uh, that I was going to go down and live with my dad.
*  And, uh, I called my dad one day.
*  I was set to go to, uh, me and my cousins were going to go see a return of the
*  Jedi that had came out again in the theaters.
*  So I called my dad.
*  It was a Sunday, called my dad and he told me he had either gotten married or
*  he was about to get married to this woman.
*  And, uh, basically Brett Johnson wasn't going to go down to Florida.
*  You know, I was going to, I was going to stay in a hazard.
*  I had to call my dad from payphone, but the result of that was, I walked
*  into a, uh, into a hospital, got in an elevator and a woman got in the
*  elevator at the same time and I snapped and beat the hell out of her right there.
*  And, uh, I was 15.
*  Didn't really know what the fuck happened.
*  Didn't really know, but, uh, just anger came from someone.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, you know, the, uh, the elevator beat the hell out of this lady.
*  Turned out she looked at shit load like my mom, but, um, the elevator door was
*  open.
*  One of the security guards, I played basketball with, with his son.
*  So he, he saw me immediately.
*  I knocked the hell out of him, took off running, made it back to the house
*  where my granddad grandparents were.
*  They didn't know what had happened.
*  So, um, I didn't say anything about an hour later, Kentucky state police, they
*  pull up in the front yard and, uh, two of them get out and I'm sitting on the front
*  porch and me and my cousins are, and they start walking up, everybody starts
*  walking out of the house.
*  And I'm like, I just remember saying, what do you want?
*  What do you want?
*  Well, you know what they wanted.
*  They wanted to, to arrest Brett Johnson and then they arrested me.
*  I went in and I told them everything.
*  Um, spent three months in a, in a county jail.
*  They didn't have, um, juvenile facilities in that county.
*  So I spent three months in solitary went to trial, uh, pled guilty to
*  assault in the first degree.
*  The, uh, the judge sentenced me to time served and a psychological evaluation
*  where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.
*  And it's been 30 days up there.
*  They cut me loose.
*  They wanted me to, uh, have counseling after that.
*  And, uh, never went to counseling, you know, wanted to, but mom was like,
*  don't need it.
*  Right.
*  And so never went to counseling and, um, I became this pariah in the county.
*  Uh, it's crazy, man.
*  I mean, uh, not a day goes by that.
*  I don't think about that.
*  That that moment in the elevator.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and what happens is, is, uh, you know, you're 15, fuck man, you're 15.
*  So I go back to the, uh, the high school that I was in and, um, I'm this piece of shit.
*  So everybody, everybody outcast.
*  Everybody knows.
*  So I moved, we moved, we were in, we were in Weitzberg at that point.
*  I finished up the year there and moved to, uh, back to Perry County,
*  where we're just where hazard is.
*  So we moved there and they've got three high schools here.
*  They've got MC Napier.
*  They've got hazard high school and then they've got Dill scones high school.
*  So, um, I was within, me and Denise were within half mile of MC Napier.
*  Show up there the first day of school.
*  And I met, uh, me and my mom and my sister were walking into the
*  school and the kids won't let me in.
*  The kids stand out there.
*  He's not coming in.
*  So, uh, my mom starts raising hell and I'm like, no, let's just go.
*  Let's go.
*  So from there it was, uh, we went down to the city school hazard and the principal
*  tells my mom, Denise can come.
*  He can't.
*  He can't.
*  So, uh, my mom was to raise hell and I'm like, no, let's just, uh,
*  just take me to this other school.
*  So this other school was like 15 miles away and, uh, you know, country,
*  country school, country high school.
*  So I go there and they accept me and I walked in the first day and, uh,
*  this English teacher names Carol combs.
*  I walked in and, uh, handed her the paper.
*  She was my homeroom teacher and she heard this voice as, as the way she
*  explains it, she heard this voice and she looks up and she was like, uh, son,
*  have you ever done any drama before?
*  I'm like, no ma'am, but I'm interested in the academic team.
*  I was this quick recall guy, right?
*  And she was like, no, she's like, um, dry.
*  Drama.
*  I'm like, no, I'm not interested in theater.
*  I'm interested in, in academics.
*  Well, she was the head of the drama department and head of the academics
*  department.
*  So the deal was, tell you what, you can get on the academics team if you
*  start with theater too.
*  And I was like, okay.
*  So, uh, what happens is she was the only, she was the first decent person I met
*  my life and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.
*  So under her tutelage, I become the, uh, one of the top academic team guys in
*  the state, um, around there, I was captain of the team.
*  I was this, this, just, just scourge across all the counties in that part of
*  Kentucky, if, you know, we had a, had a meet, it was like, Jesus Christ, that's
*  Brett Johnson.
*  You know, it was like, she used to tell people they would, the, the high school
*  that I came from was Weisberg.
*  And the first time that Weisberg came against us, uh, she told, she told me, I
*  was, I was talking to her about a year ago and, uh, she told me, she's like,
*  Brett, she said that first meet against Weisberg, she said, uh, the captain came
*  in, looked at you and said, oh, you've got that Johnson boy on your team.
*  And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.
*  So, but I did that.
*  And then with, uh, with theater, I ended up, uh, my senior year, I won
*  best actor and actress in the state.
*  Only got ever do that in the state.
*  So, um, did pretty well, man.
*  Did pretty well had, uh, had scholarships coming out of, out of high school and
*  everything else, and I'm the idiot that turned them down.
*  That's a funny question.
*  You'd make a hell of a, I mean, of all the many things you could probably do,
*  you would make a hell of a actor.
*  I'm very good on stage.
*  I'm very good on stage.
*  Have you acted professionally anywhere?
*  No, not, not professionally.
*  We've done the, you know, the college circuit and stuff like that.
*  What happened was, is, uh, so I turned down the, um, Turn down the scholarships,
*  you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was.
*  Start, we started community college and, um, the community college there hires
*  a new theater director out of California.
*  He knew the guy that ran the San Jose state theater program, uh, got him.
*  Edward Emanuel was his name.
*  His claim to fame.
*  He had written the three ninjas movie.
*  Remember that the three little ninja kids back in the eighties, he had
*  written this for Dan Phil and it had made a shitload of money.
*  So, um, he invites Ed Emanuel to come down and see the play and Ed had
*  written this civil war piece.
*  So, um, we put that on.
*  I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.
*  I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.
*  So Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.
*  He said, look, he said, right now you're a big fish in a small pond.
*  We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.
*  And I was like, deal.
*  So I took the scholarship, man.
*  And he was like, I'll be back in two weeks.
*  So he flies out two weeks later.
*  This guy flies back in.
*  He drives down to where we're, where I'm living.
*  I'm out shooting ball with, uh, with my cousins and friends.
*  He pulls up and he gets out of the car and I was like, I'm walk over to him.
*  I was like, Hey man, I'll walk in.
*  You can meet my parents.
*  He's like, no, I got it.
*  I was like, okay.
*  So I keep shooting ball.
*  He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes, walks out.
*  Why does a sheet doesn't say a word to me, gets in the car leaves.
*  I don't hear from him again.
*  Had no idea what went on.
*  It takes me a couple of weeks.
*  What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.
*  My mom pulls a knife on the guy.
*  I will kill you.
*  You are not going to steal my goddamn son from me.
*  Scares the guy to death.
*  He bugs out and, uh, kind of broke my spirit at that point.
*  You know, I was like, okay.
*  So, um, went into just full fledged into scams, crimes, everything else.
*  I had already been, when I was a minor, I'd already been kind of brought up on
*  that side of the family with the crimes that they were doing to my mom was, you
*  know, drug trafficking, the pimp stuff, uh, illegally mining coal, um, charity fraud.
*  Oh, legally mine.
*  Yeah.
*  Wildcatting coal.
*  So you, um, can you explain that?
*  Yeah.
*  So to, to properly mine coal, you have to get a permit.
*  All right.
*  Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't, they can't afford the permits.
*  You know, they can, they can get them a piece of equipment.
*  Uh, you know, you get a doser or a loader or whatever you're going to get
*  or an auger or what have you.
*  So you start mining, but you don't get the permit.
*  So you don't have to find, do the, you don't have to pay back then.
*  It was like $3,500 for a two acre permit or $5,000 for a two acre permit.
*  Let you strip mine the coal on that.
*  Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.
*  So once you uncover the pit, take the coal out, you have to cover back up the pit.
*  So grass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly.
*  Got a silt pond, everything else at that point.
*  So the whole idea is you buy an acre of land or some area of land, and then you
*  can, there's a whole process you're supposed to go through to tire process.
*  How many people are involved in a mining, the smallest number of people
*  required for a mining operation?
*  You can do it with three or four people.
*  Okay.
*  So you've got your loader operator, you've got your dozer operator.
*  You need a, you can, you can farm out the trucking to someone if you need an
*  air or trucking company, if you need to do that, um, then you've got your,
*  whoever owns the business as well.
*  So very few people can run an operation like that and profit fairly well, as long
*  as you don't have to do the reclamation, all that crap on top of that, you can
*  all that crap on top of it.
*  All right.
*  The reclamation gets pretty expensive.
*  So if you're uncovering a pit of coal, you know, a pit, so a ton of coal is
*  basically about 36 cubic inches is what, what are 2000 pounds of coal weighs.
*  If you're in Eastern Kentucky, because it's at the weight of the bituminous coal
*  and everything, the fact that you know, this is awesome.
*  The fact that you know exactly the volume of a ton of coal.
*  I mean, yeah, you learn this shit, right?
*  Can you rattle this shit off?
*  So, uh, so you uncover the pit and then you've got to sell the pit.
*  Well, the thing is, is that where are you going to sell the coal?
*  Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples that knows that they're
*  buying the shit illegally.
*  So back then a ton of coal was, uh, they'd give you like 36 bucks per ton is what
*  that is and you'd have to go out and you'd, you'd test the BTUs on it.
*  You take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs.
*  You take that into the company, uh, British thermal unit.
*  So you'd test how, what the BTU on the coal was, how pure the coal, how
*  pure the coal is, what, what, what BTU it burns at back then a good, a good BTU
*  was around 12, nine was what you'd get.
*  All right.
*  So 12, nine coal, $36 a ton.
*  You'd take that sample over to the, to the coal tipple.
*  They'd say, okay, we'll buy this for you.
*  How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?
*  And you say, this is what we've got.
*  Then you'd hire the trucking company and where you get it out because you know,
*  you've got the agents that are, that are looking for you by this point, because
*  the people that, you know, you've, you've, you've bought the rights to
*  whoever the landowner is.
*  You said you're going to give them, you know, $2 a ton or whatever this is.
*  Well, the other people there, are you paying them off or are you not?
*  Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?
*  They know your ass is mining it illegally.
*  They're going to report you.
*  Well, all of a sudden you've got all these inspectors that are coming around
*  and everything that, Hey, we know what you're doing.
*  So they're looking for you to get the pit out.
*  So when do you get the pit out?
*  Right in dead of night.
*  So, you know, you're loading it up two o'clock in the morning, hollering
*  his ass out is what you're doing.
*  You sell it out from there.
*  So, um, and your mom ran operations like this.
*  Yeah.
*  And you said you worked the mine too.
*  Yeah.
*  I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer, learn how to clean off a pit.
*  Everything like that.
*  So this is, this is the lifestyle you, you grow up in.
*  You know, you learn how to do this stuff.
*  And, uh, so knew how to do charity fraud as well.
*  Um, insurance fraud.
*  So charity fraud.
*  Can we, can we break down some of these are charity fraud?
*  It's, it's much more romantic than what it sounds.
*  It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road with a sign
*  and a bucket, taking up collections for homeless shelters, for abused
*  women, for children, stuff like that.
*  Um, then later on I branched off.
*  I, when I started off on my own, I would set up my own charity company and do
*  some telemarketing and go on by and collect checks and things like that.
*  You know, we're going to talk about that, but actually, can we just
*  step back and talk about your mom and your dad, given all of that, given
*  all the abuse, the complex ways that she played with love to see how far she
*  can push you and the people around her.
*  And they still love her today.
*  Do you love her?
*  You know, I, I'd called my dad yesterday.
*  Uh, my dad, he's, uh, he's dying now.
*  He's got a heart condition.
*  He's not going to get the operation to fix it.
*  So he's like, fuck it.
*  I'm ready to go.
*  And I'm like, I looked at it because hell I'm 52 now.
*  And prior to 52, I'd have been like, no, you need to do this.
*  But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.
*  I understand you're done.
*  And, uh, so he's not going to get the operation.
*  I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me, he's like, have you, have you seen
*  your mom?
*  And I was like, dad, I've not talked to you for about two years.
*  And, uh, I told him, I was like, um, I love my mom, but my mom is not a good person.
*  She's not.
*  And, uh, he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday and he told me
*  that it took him several years to really understand that, you know, he loved her
*  too, but it takes, when you're, when you're getting an abuse like that,
*  especially my dad, my dad came from a good family, everything else and, um,
*  you know, upstanding family.
*  And, uh, I think that when you're that victim of abuse, you know, you've never
*  seen it before, you've never encountered it and then it happens where you're like
*  that frog in water all of a sudden.
*  You know, you get to the point where gradually increases until how do you get
*  out of it?
*  Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.
*  Um, I grew up in that environment though, you know, so it took me a long time to,
*  uh, to come to terms with that.
*  And my sister came to terms with it long before I did, you know, my sister, she,
*  she's been a decade without talking to my mom.
*  Like she had tried to commit suicide.
*  I didn't know that.
*  What got me so bad is she said at one point that she always thought someone
*  was going to come in and save us.
*  And my response, just immediate response, not even thinking about it.
*  My response was, well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.
*  And looking at things now, I think that's the, that's where our paths diverged.
*  Me, it was, if you want to do it, if anybody's going to take care of you, you
*  got to take care of yourself.
*  You're on your own.
*  You're on your own.
*  You know, it's up to you.
*  And Denise has always been that, that, that child that has expected someone
*  to come in and save her.
*  Well, and almost like it's all going to be okay.
*  Somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  And I knew it wasn't.
*  And no, no, you go unless you, unless you make it okay.
*  It ain't going to be okay.
*  Are you able to forgive her?
*  Your mom?
*  My, my boundary with my mom, the reason I've not spoken with her, um, over
*  two years ago, I started, um, this, this legal career of mine.
*  I I've been the guy who has, uh, I spent a lot of time thinking about my past
*  and those choices and what brought brought those choices around.
*  So I'm, I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.
*  I truly am.
*  I think it's really important.
*  You have to do that.
*  Well, my mom, not so much.
*  So I was talking to her, you know, and I would start saying, you know, she was,
*  she would start the conversation talking about, she didn't understand
*  why Denise wouldn't speak to her anymore.
*  That was one of her tropes.
*  So, and my response started to become, well, because you were the abuser and
*  you spent your life doing that to her.
*  So it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.
*  So she's still not able to see the flaws in her ways of the past.
*  No, not at all.
*  So my, my ultimatum to my mom was, look, when you're able to admit that you
*  abuse the people in your life, accept that responsibility and be able to
*  discuss it with me, we'll have a talk.
*  Other than that, I don't want to talk to you anymore.
*  So for the first year it was, you know, calling cussing my wife out, cussing me out.
*  Um, you know, I don't need you out of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And then finally it started to taper off and she's never really contacted
*  me after that point.
*  Your dad is dying.
*  What do you take from the way he's taken on death?
*  Just saying, fuck it.
*  You know, it's the man.
*  And what have you learned from your dad?
*  What do you love about your dad?
*  He's one of these guys that, uh, you know, like I told him, I told my dad about
*  the, about the abuse and everything else.
*  And, uh, there was a point.
*  So, you know, I told you about the elevator stuff, but before that, man, it
*  was, um, it took me 40 years to talk about that, but it also took me 40 years
*  to, um, to talk about, there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the
*  house and I would urinate in the floor.
*  All right.
*  And, uh,
*  is that like, um, out of anger?
*  No, no idea why.
*  All right.
*  But I would piss on the carpet carpet.
*  Pissers like the Lebowski, right?
*  It really tied the room together.
*  I was talking about that and this lady comes up to me after the, uh, after the
*  presentation and she had, she had a career previous to that where she dealt with
*  abused kids and she told me she's like, Brett, she's like, um, it's a control
*  mechanism, the only control you had was that.
*  And she's like, kids do that.
*  And I was like, so I'm not unique.
*  She's like, no, you're not unique in that.
*  So, um, that, you know, this whole history of abuse, Denise dealt with it by
*  drinking, by trying to commit suicide, things like that.
*  And then finally she escapes.
*  I'm the kid that didn't.
*  And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that it's again, it's that Eastern
*  Kentucky mentality stuff, you know, the male is expected to do things.
*  So with, with me, it was, it was almost like I stepped up to, to take part in
*  those crimes so that Denise didn't, didn't have to, and she, she was able to avoid
*  all that other than that one shoplifting stuff, Denise doesn't break the law
*  anymore.
*  She goes off to be a, she's a, she's a good parent.
*  She's an angry parent.
*  She's a good parent.
*  She's a teacher, a good citizen overall.
*  I was just the guy that kept right on going.
*  Kept on going.
*  So let me ask you about that.
*  So, um, your life of cyber crime and describing some of the things you did or
*  knew about, you said, quote, I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins
*  from a family, trying to sell them to put a new roof on their home.
*  Another time I sent a counterfeit cashier's check to a victim and he ended
*  up being arrested for it.
*  I lied to family friends.
*  Everyone.
*  I knew I was a truly despicable person.
*  True.
*  One of my Ukrainian associates script had someone who owed him money,
*  kidnapped and tortured.
*  He posted pictures of it online.
*  Another member, Iceman used to flood his enemies, email addresses with
*  child pornography, then called the police on them.
*  That's some stories.
*  Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you that are particularly
*  despicable or representative or interesting when you look back at that,
*  that defined your approach and who you were at that time.
*  Let me say that I did not care about my victim.
*  All right.
*  I cared about me is what I cared about.
*  Um, it's rough to, it's rough to admit that, you know, that, uh, you don't give
*  a shit what you're doing to anybody else.
*  You only care about you, but that's, that's the truth of the matter.
*  I didn't care about the victims.
*  Um, the lady that was, that wasn't even at the beginning of my, uh, career as
*  a cyber criminal, that was right at the last of it, which lady, the coin lady.
*  I was, uh, by that point, shadow crew had made the front cover of Forbes,
*  August of Oh four, October 26th, though, for secret service had shut us down.
*  33 people arrested six countries in six hours.
*  I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.
*  Um, what happened was, is I was the guy who was, uh, I had kind of invented this
*  crime called tax return identity theft and, um, was stealing a lot of money.
*  I went through all my state side savings and shadow crew gets shut down.
*  I don't have any way to come in with any money.
*  So I start running counterfeit cashier's checks, defrauding people with that,
*  having them send products or bullying collections, what have you, by COD
*  collect on delivery.
*  And I would pay with it with a counterfeit cashier's check.
*  This lady was on eBay.
*  She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.
*  You know, the U S currency used to be the coins used to be silver.
*  So she had a whole collection of these things, uh, like, I don't know, 80,
*  90 pounds of this stuff.
*  And, um, I'm a very good social engineer.
*  So, um, convinced her that I was a legitimate person that, uh, you know,
*  I sent it to COD.
*  You can use, um, my FedEx account to do that or my UPS account to do that.
*  I'll pay with a cashier's check.
*  You can take it in same as cash.
*  She believed that she was, um, even on the ad and we talked on the phone and
*  everything else, she had told me that she would, she was a single parent and it
*  was the only money that she had to, uh, to put a roof on the house for her and
*  her kids.
*  And, uh, I didn't give a damn.
*  I didn't give a damn.
*  It was more important was me at that point.
*  Can I ask you a question about the social engineering asks?
*  So maybe it's specifics like the methodology email, you said phone.
*  Maybe you could discuss this process from a bigger philosophical perspective of
*  what is it about human beings that makes them possible to be socially engineered
*  to be, uh, to be victims of fraud?
*  So first, let me say that, that I became a social engineer as a child.
*  All right.
*  Because the adults in my, in my environment as a child, I had to know
*  exactly what they were thinking and be able to try to manipulate that for
*  survival.
*  So I became a social engineer as, as for survival initially.
*  All right.
*  And one of the things that I've seen with a lot of cyber criminals is the
*  exact same thing, the really expert ones.
*  They become a social engineer as a child.
*  Then later on, they use those tools to victimize others.
*  All right.
*  Which is fascinating because you're in order to understand what others are
*  thinking, you have to be extremely good at empathy.
*  So you have to like really put yourself in the shoes of the other person.
*  And yet in order to do cyber crime, you have to not care about the pain that
*  might cause them once you manipulate them.
*  So you have to empathize and yet not care.
*  Exactly.
*  And I would argue, I would argue that that is not a sociopath because a cyber
*  criminal and I was no different.
*  Most cyber criminals justify those actions.
*  So the justification becomes what's important with me.
*  The justification was why I did it for my family, did it for my wife, did it
*  for my stripper girlfriend.
*  So, and I believe those just, because I care about love a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  So the, the, the big, the big picture of that is trust.
*  How do you establish trust with a potential victim?
*  All right.
*  Now I would argue online that that trust is established through a combination of
*  technology tools, social engineering.
*  All right.
*  So we trust our tech, you know, we trust our cell phones, we trust our laptops.
*  A lot of times we don't understand how they operate, but we trust the
*  news that comes across the line.
*  We trust the phone numbers that show up.
*  We trust IP addresses.
*  If we're advanced enough to look at an IP address or a domain or anything else
*  like that, criminals use tools to manipulate that spoof phone numbers, spoof
*  browser fingerprints, um, whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.
*  Then that lays a base level of trust.
*  At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering and lay whatever story
*  that is in order to manipulate that victim, to act not out of reason, but out
*  of emotion all of a sudden.
*  This is fascinating about the way humans interact with the world, which is you're
*  almost too afraid to not trust the world.
*  You have to find a balance.
*  You have this, uh, you have a lot of sort of conspiracy theories now about distrust
*  in institutions and thinking like everything around us.
*  It's like, I've been listening to people who believe the earth is flat.
*  And you know, that, that conspiracy theory is fascinating to me because it
*  basically says that you can't trust anybody.
*  Right.
*  Like everything you hear is a lie.
*  So that's one, you know, you can live that life or you can live a life where
*  you're just naively trusting everything.
*  And we as humans have to, cause that life is kind of full of happiness.
*  If nobody screws you over, right?
*  Cause you, you know, you meet people with the joyful heart and you get
*  excited and all that kind of stuff.
*  But if you do that too much, you're going to get burned.
*  So you have to find some kind of balance in terms of optimizing happiness
*  where you trust, I mean, but verify and on the internet that
*  becomes really tricky.
*  You're almost too afraid to distrust everything because you'll never
*  get anything done on the internet.
*  But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.
*  And so the social engineering comes in where you're like, I'm not sure
*  if I should trust this, you kind of help them, uh, build the narrative.
*  I was like, it's good.
*  It's good.
*  It's good.
*  So, and a lot of the times that social engineering is just feeding into
*  what the victim wants to believe.
*  All right.
*  It's, it's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.
*  It's just knowing what that victim is, what the motivations of that victim
*  is feeding into it at that point.
*  So you have to, again, that social engineer has to almost immediately
*  know what's driving that person that they're talking about.
*  If I'm so, if I'm working on a phone, talking to someone over the phone, I
*  have to know within seconds what I need to say, how I need to act to interact
*  with that customer service agent or whoever I'm talking to on the other end
*  of the line.
*  So fascinating because you truly are empathizing with the other person.
*  Um, what is it?
*  Uh, this, this business man, Steven Schwartzman, um, uh, I've talked to a
*  few times, he mentioned this thing that, you know, the way you build deep
*  relationships is you really kind of notice the things that people are telling
*  you, like, like what, what they want and, uh, what they're bothered by.
*  What are their big problems in their lives?
*  Cause everybody's saying that all the time.
*  And most of us are just ignoring it.
*  Right.
*  You're really take the time to listen.
*  You know, somebody at that point, absolutely you do.
*  Then you have to be able to dismiss it.
*  If this was it after, you're looking for that just to see how I can manipulate
*  that is what you're trying to do.
*  So that the lady was one story.
*  They, uh, another truly despicable story.
*  We'll get to script in a second, but another truly despicable story.
*  We had, um, we were one of the really first groups that started fishing attacks.
*  What's fishing.
*  So that is a social engineering attack.
*  Ph by the way, ph that's another social engineering attack.
*  That's sending that fake email out.
*  That looks like it's coming from a website or your financial organization or whatever.
*  And saying, Hey, we've got a security problem.
*  We need you to update your account information.
*  Well, back then, no one had ever seen a fishing attack.
*  So you could ask for all the information you were getting, just complete identity
*  profiles on a fishing email nowadays.
*  You can't do that nowadays.
*  You look for basically credentials because everyone is aware of fishing.
*  But back then it was complete information.
*  We had a fished out, I don't know, 200,000 E trade accounts as what we had the login
*  login password, login password, complete, you know, social data, birth, mother's
*  maiden account information, everything else.
*  So we had access to those E trade accounts.
*  E trade initially had no security in place.
*  So you could cash out the account, ACH the money out to whoever, to whatever account
*  you want to do, went through just fine.
*  Ain't them alive on that for four to six months.
*  E trade got to the, to the point where they, you couldn't do any ACH coming out.
*  You know, you, they locked everything down where you're still sitting on thousands of
*  E trade accounts.
*  How do you make money on that?
*  Hmm.
*  It's a good question.
*  Yeah.
*  So what you do is you find some fat cat that's got his retirement, you know,
*  invested in blue chips.
*  Same time you find a penny stock, you open up a brand new account, buy into that
*  penny stock, cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock, bump and dump
*  schemes all of a sudden.
*  So you're destroying people's retirement accounts for just a few thousand dollars.
*  Bam, bam, bam.
*  And of course, E trades responses, not our problem.
*  It's your problem.
*  You shouldn't have given up your password or what have you at that point.
*  And you still see that issue today with the Zelle scams and things like that.
*  Which scam?
*  Zelle.
*  So, you know, the instant payment.
*  Also the same kind of operations with different mechanisms.
*  You find an easy way to exploit a system and typically the financial organization,
*  not our problem, our system secure.
*  It's the humans, it's their errors.
*  Well, not really.
*  You know, you, you've got some culpability in that and you just trying to avoid paying
*  the part of the bill is what's going on.
*  One of the things just to stand fishing for a bit is, um, it really makes me sad
*  because there's been people on all kinds of platforms, like including YouTube
*  comments, but emails too, they figured out emails somehow.
*  So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast where fans,
*  they're finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube and so on.
*  And they are figuring out ways to get to those people by another channel, which I
*  suppose is, it seems more authentic to those people.
*  So they send them an email from what looks like me.
*  And with this kind of like, like loving, it's the interesting thing.
*  The email sound like something I would write.
*  So these aren't even at this stage, it's not even, it doesn't feel automated or if
*  it's automated, it's, um, there's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning it
*  to a specific, or maybe I'm very predictable, but it's very loving.
*  And the way I would write that message.
*  Well, and so, so, so think about that.
*  All right.
*  So, so when fishing first comes out, you could look at the language of the
*  text or the website and say, ah, if you, if you were paying attention, that's so
*  okay, so that's not an English speaker who wrote that typically.
*  All right.
*  But as, as time has went on, as, as the awareness of what a fishing attack looks
*  like, we have people that are sitting down now and making sure that the
*  language is proper.
*  It gets worse than that though.
*  If you look at business email compromise.
*  All right.
*  So the way a business email compromise typically works is the attacker will
*  find a payroll person, find a CEO.
*  He will, he will fashion a spear fishing email, which is that's a fishing
*  attack that's targeting one specific individual.
*  All right.
*  So he'll fashion a spear fishing email.
*  And the way he does that is he pulls all the information he possibly
*  can on that person.
*  All right.
*  That CEO.
*  Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email,
*  just to read the emails and he'll, he'll go in there and he'll start reading all
*  these emails.
*  He'll specifically read the emails to the, to the payroll department.
*  See what that relationship is.
*  Are they talking about their kids?
*  Talk about relationships, talking about vacation.
*  What are they talking about?
*  How are they talking?
*  Are they friendly?
*  Are they sterile?
*  What are they doing?
*  All right.
*  So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead and spear fish this, the
*  payroll department as good.
*  So then he spear fishes him, gets those credentials at the same time.
*  He creates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is.
*  All right.
*  So instead of that English alphabet, I he's got that Russian letter that looks
*  like an eye, but without the dot on top.
*  All right.
*  It comes back into the email, into the payroll email, blocks the real
*  CEO's email, replaces that with the Unicode email that he's got, and then
*  sends out a message using the correct language, the correct relationships,
*  everything else and says, Hey, you know, we're updating our account status.
*  I need you to send this payment instead of the over here.
*  They've set up a new account, send all payments over here now.
*  And that is business email compromise in a nutshell.
*  All right.
*  Works great.
*  Probably the larger the organization, the more, uh, susceptible to that kind
*  of attack, cause there's a, um, like a distribution of responsibility to where
*  you're more likely to believe that, okay, this other person is responsible.
*  I'm sure they, they, uh, secured everything.
*  I'm okay listening to this.
*  So that that's business email compromise and it's those crimes.
*  And that's one thing you see about cybercrime cybercrime is not really sophisticated.
*  It's not the attacks are not sophisticated.
*  The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.
*  It's not the stuff.
*  It's not zero day attacks.
*  Yeah, they're out there, but if you're a criminal waiting on a zero day to profit,
*  you're going to starve to death.
*  The, the, the meat and potatoes are that 90% known exploits.
*  And then the rest is what you're saying.
*  It's, uh, maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated, but it's social
*  engineering sophisticated, very sophisticated on that end.
*  Very sophisticated.
*  It's a fascinating study of that establishment of trust and then using that
*  trust to defraud that victim.
*  That is something.
*  I wish obviously all of these folks are really good at hiding.
*  I wish you could tell their stories in the way, which is why you're fascinating.
*  Is he able to tell these stories now?
*  Cause it is studying human nature by exploiting it, but you get to understand
*  like our weak points are, um, our hope, our desire to trust others.
*  Also sort of the, the weak points and the failures of, of digital systems
*  and at scale humans have to connect.
*  It's fascinating.
*  Is, um, this is a weird question.
*  Um, asking for a friend, uh, is, is spearfishing itself illegal?
*  What's the legality here?
*  Oh, it's all illegal.
*  Absolutely.
*  It is.
*  But is it absolute?
*  So here's what, okay.
*  Let me, let me construct an example.
*  So, uh, if, if my friend were to spearfish like, uh, a CEO, right.
*  And get their information.
*  And after they get control, save their Twitter account, they tweet
*  something loving and positive.
*  What's the crime?
*  Unauthorized access of advice.
*  What will be the punishment?
*  Do you think?
*  That becomes questionable.
*  So, so no monetary loss or was there a monetary loss?
*  Probably not.
*  All right.
*  So you have to figure out who the victim is before charges are pressed.
*  Now the crime would be an off unauthorized access.
*  All right.
*  But no real victim on that unless, you know, the, the person who's
*  account you took over takes, you know, exception to that, um, no monetary loss.
*  So there's not really standard like fines.
*  Probably not gonna happen.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So, I mean, that that's kind of interesting because it's, so when I got
*  the ransomware, um, when I got, uh, with the zero day attack on the QNAP mask,
*  you know, they, they basically say the, the criminal is QNAP, the company for
*  having so many security vulnerabilities.
*  They're, uh, like you are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.
*  That's the way they kind of phrase it.
*  And see, I don't agree with that.
*  I don't agree with that at all.
*  So solar winds.
*  Let's, so I've got 130 page class action lawsuit printed out at the house.
*  I've been going through it that catalogs how solar winds lied for years about
*  their vulnerabilities and they lied to investors, the, uh, the people who came
*  in, the auditors would, who they would hire would, you know, they would, uh,
*  not pay attention to them when they said, you know, you've got these issues.
*  I would say, go away.
*  Shit like that for years until solar winds, you know, the attacks become apparent.
*  Um, my view on that is that the only person responsible for the crime are the
*  criminals who did the attacking the actual criminals, not, not solar winds.
*  Now, does that mean the solar winds isn't, isn't all fucked up?
*  They are.
*  And there needs to be some accounting in place, but the, the, the only individual,
*  the only people responsible for crime are the criminals and that's either online
*  in the physical world, what have you.
*  You could be it's being an idiot is not a crime being, being criminally negligent
*  is, and I think that that solar winds is certainly responsible, not, not
*  responsible.
*  They're culpable for what happened.
*  Can you actually, uh, tell folks about solar winds?
*  What is it?
*  Um, what, what, what was, what are some interesting things that you're aware of?
*  It's solar winds was very, it was, it, it provided a background, a backbone of
*  security for hundreds, thousands of different companies.
*  Um, if you looked at a lot of security companies were using solar winds that
*  would allow you to get a snapshot of the entire system that they were working on.
*  So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in and they basically,
*  they hack into solar winds and get access to it.
*  And it allows them to view every single thing.
*  I mean, every single thing about every single client that solar winds had at
*  that point.
*  So entire snapshots of all the IP that were in, that was going on, all the
*  emails, all the communications, every single secret that was going on with
*  those companies.
*  If company had software like Microsoft, it allowed them to look at the source
*  code of everything that was going on.
*  I mean, it's just a complete and total nightmare.
*  All right.
*  And something that you are not going to recover from.
*  You're not, I mean, it's done at that point.
*  Um, you know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it, but the fact of
*  the matter is, is that's the type of attack that's a catastrophic attack.
*  So there's a huge amount of information that was read, saved elsewhere, probably.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And so now there's people sitting on information.
*  Absolutely.
*  So think about one of the attack vectors has been Microsoft Outlook, 365,
*  things like that.
*  This allowed the attackers to look at the source codes of that.
*  So they have the source code now, so they can go through it line by line or other
*  vulnerabilities.
*  Let's find new vulnerabilities, new zero days.
*  And, you know, I said zero days aren't common, but this opens up an entire new
*  threat surface all of a sudden.
*  So it's a, it's a completely catastrophic attack.
*  Once all the chips are down, everything's tallied up.
*  People are going to be like, yeah, we're done.
*  We're done.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  This whole computer thing, we tried it.
*  We're done.
*  We're walking away.
*  We're done.
*  That's terrifying.
*  Because so you're saying that there's not been obvious, big negative impact from
*  that yet.
*  So, but like, there's been a lot of negative impact, but we're just starting.
*  Right.
*  So the, the capacity for destruction is huge here.
*  How much involvement from nation states do you think there is on this?
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  Um, so you've got Iran, you've got, uh, North Korea, China, Russia.
*  You got the big four.
*  You also got Brazil.
*  You've got all these other countries that are interested in the United States as
*  well.
*  Um, nation states are interesting depending on who the nation state is.
*  All right.
*  So Russia is very good about working with the type of criminal that I used to be.
*  You know, they'll enlist these guys and steal information, what have you.
*  Then Russia will take the information they want to, and they'll basically go off
*  and sell whatever you want to make some money.
*  Um, China's all about IP.
*  Um, North Korea is about stealing money because they really don't know what the
*  hell else to do right now.
*  But, uh, so North Korea is actively involved in cyber crime.
*  Absolutely.
*  They've stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.
*  So absolutely.
*  They're actively involved with that.
*  Um, the very, very skilled attackers, very skilled, but even if you look at, you
*  know, I told you that stat about 90%.
*  All right.
*  So even though solar winds is going to be the number one attack.
*  The, the followup to that is this not petty attack that happened.
*  And so that was the most sophisticated attack launched by the Russian sandworm
*  group using all known exploits throughout.
*  So it's not, again, it's not.
*  You're right in the sophistication is typically not technical sophistication,
*  but it says social engineering sophistication.
*  How do you get these things put together in line to attack and succeed?
*  But when you get access to the source code, that's where technical
*  sophistication could really.
*  Oh yeah.
*  A lot of damage.
*  And that's when you find out real quick.
*  That's what separates the men from the boys in this game.
*  All right.
*  Because all of a sudden it's not, I don't have to worry about social engineering.
*  I've got source codes and I've got professionals that are looking at
*  that and that's your ass, which then enables probably even more powerful
*  social engineering methods too.
*  I mean, it's just the cascade of, um, is this terrifying to you by the way?
*  This, that this world that we're living in, as we put more and more of ourselves
*  on the, the internet into the metaverse, that there's so many more attack
*  vectors on our wellbeing.
*  What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on shadow crew is the idea
*  that the perception of truth is more important than the truth itself.
*  It doesn't matter what the facts are.
*  It matters what I can convince you of.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's terrifying to me.
*  So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news, all the stuff that's going out.
*  That becomes truly terrifying.
*  Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing if nothing is true and you can't trust
*  anything, but you see we as human beings, we want to trust.
*  We do.
*  We, we need human interaction and for that human interaction, you have to
*  have a degree of trust, but it's more like you let go of an idea of absolute
*  truth and it more becomes like a blockchain style consensus.
*  So you let go of like, you know what?
*  Uh, there's this human dream, you know, you get this on the internet, you get
*  like facts as if there's at the bottom, at the bottom, there's one turtle that's
*  holding this like scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.
*  The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that is counterproductive.
*  Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.
*  And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded in, you can call them lies
*  or you can call them inaccuracies or you can call them delusions.
*  It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies and, and, uh, delusions.
*  But our hope is to over time develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus
*  that allows us to live a stable and happy society.
*  Don't call it true.
*  Call it, call it a stable, uh, consensus that creates a high quality of life
*  for the inhabitants of the island.
*  I mean, I like it.
*  We're going to agree.
*  And then don't use out.
*  No, I'm just kidding.
*  So maybe a step back.
*  You mentioned, uh, uh, I'd love to talk to our shadow crew.
*  Maybe this is the right time to actually, yeah, let's go to shadow crew.
*  Cause it's such a fascinating story.
*  So tell me the story of building shadow crew, the precursor to today's
*  dark net and dark net markets.
*  You're this is why you're the original Godfather.
*  This is it.
*  This is it.
*  So I, um, I get married.
*  I faked a car accident to get married.
*  Got the money from that.
*  You're romantic.
*  I remember like my dad, man.
*  I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom, I get the criminal mindset from dad.
*  I get that.
*  Don't want them to leave.
*  To get married.
*  Uh, I met this story.
*  Let's let's dude.
*  I was, uh, how did you fall in love there?
*  My, my first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter and, uh, crazy over her, dated
*  her for five years and, uh, she figured out pretty quickly that, well, not quickly.
*  It took her five years to figure out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.
*  No, I, I could, I could talk it, but you know, more of that agnostic than anything.
*  She breaks up with me.
*  So I was, uh, I was at the community college.
*  You'd make one hell of a preacher by the
*  yeah.
*  I've got that Langston Hughes problem.
*  You know, I'm looking for Jesus to show up and he just doesn't.
*  So I was, I was at the community college and I was, I was a straight asshole.
*  I was arrogant, conceited, everything else.
*  And I had posted an advertisement on one of the billboards looking for an adult
*  babysitter, hot blonde, you know, come, come visit me in the library.
*  Buddy mind shows up and he was like, Brett.
*  I was like, yeah, he's like hottest girl in school right down the hall.
*  And I was like, serious?
*  He's like, yeah.
*  And I was like, let's go see walk over and there's, there's these two
*  guys that are hitting on her.
*  So I'm, I just walk up and, uh, me and Todd, that was my buddy walk up and I'm
*  just sitting there and listening and they're, you know, they're giving the spill
*  and everything and she's just kind of taken down.
*  Finally, I looked over and I was like, uh, you want to get out of here?
*  And, uh, one of the guys looks at me.
*  He's like, Hey, we're talking to it.
*  I was like, well, you're talking at her.
*  You're not talking to her.
*  I'm about to save her ass from you.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a smooth pickup line by the way, if I've ever heard one, that's good.
*  You want to get out of here?
*  So start dating.
*  And, um, she was the girl that screwed my brains out.
*  Um, and I fell head over heels.
*  We got married six months later, six months.
*  That's what love does.
*  That's what it does.
*  And, um, I had, um, I was, she didn't know I was a crook.
*  She had no idea.
*  You know, she knew I was very bright.
*  She knew I would did a lot of theater, stuff like that.
*  Um, got a job at, uh, I was in hazard.
*  There was no jobs to be had.
*  So I got a job in Lexington because we were going to be moving to, uh, to UK.
*  Got a job in Lexington at, uh, Lexmark testing printer boards, um, circuit boards.
*  So I would leave on a Thursday night, work, uh, three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark.
*  Come back home on Monday.
*  Um, got married, faked a car accident to get that.
*  Did the other, the rest of the money that I needed to, uh, to get married.
*  And the, the faking on that man, I had bought a, um, a Chevy spectrum at a car
*  auction, gave like 500 bucks for it.
*  My aunt had previously defrauded usaa insurance on a car accident.
*  And she was telling me all about, she's like, look, go down to this chiropractor,
*  make sure you get the insurance where they'll pay for a rental car.
*  They'll pay lost wages.
*  I was like, they pay lost wages.
*  She's like, yeah, they pay lost wages.
*  I was like, by the way, you work for me.
*  And I was like, I work for you.
*  And you get to define them with the wage and you can also define how
*  long you were unable to work.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.
*  All right.
*  So, uh, my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out that I'm going, he finds out I'm
*  going to fake this car accident.
*  So he comes to him.
*  He's like, Hey man, can I get in on that?
*  I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.
*  So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.
*  This kid, he goes to the dentist the day that we're faking it has a tooth pulled.
*  Tells the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it, just pull it.
*  He shows up the day that we're driving out to fake the accident.
*  He's got blood all over his shirt.
*  He's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.
*  I'm like, are you okay?
*  And he's like, yeah, man, it's going to be good.
*  It's going to be good.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  My mom, by this point, I'm living with my grandparents.
*  My mom is up in the head of a hollow.
*  So we're like, we'll just do it up there.
*  We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out.
*  Ran over a mountain.
*  Okay.
*  So we go visit and everything.
*  Come back out that night, run over the side of the hill.
*  Me and Ronnie walk back up.
*  Of course it totals the car.
*  Walk back to my mom's acting like we've wrecked.
*  She knows what time it is and everything else and follow the claims.
*  So that gets the money to, uh, to get married.
*  And me and my wife moved from hazard to Lexington.
*  And I'm the kid that, uh,
*  my crime usually, if I was a single guy, wouldn't break the law.
*  What now?
*  Be all right, you know, but females involved.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I got to spend the money.
*  You got to show them gifts.
*  Everything else was never enough to show love in some sort of healthy way.
*  Always had to go overboard.
*  And typically it was buying some or stealing some sort of expensive.
*  So that was, that was the thing.
*  That was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts or something overboard
*  back then with, with Susan.
*  Initially it was, don't worry about working.
*  I got it.
*  You just worry about going to school.
*  She was a music major.
*  I was like, you just worry about going to school.
*  So, uh, don't worry about cooking and cleaning.
*  I got it.
*  I got it.
*  So not only was I this, this guy that was going overboard, but it's kind
*  of a control freak too, right?
*  So now I got it.
*  I got it.
*  I got it.
*  So here I am, you know, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load, cooking,
*  cleaning, something had to give.
*  I quit the job.
*  I couldn't do it with the job and start back in fraud and trying to hide that
*  from her at the same time.
*  So it was initially telemarketing fraud.
*  Um, started, uh, I was working at the first job I had was a telemarketer at a
*  cemetery, selling grave sites.
*  And then, uh, that ended, went over to work for the Shriner circus, Shriner's
*  hospital, and, um, it was a third party company that was doing all the
*  telemarketing and made really good money doing that, that job ended.
*  And then they pivoted over to, um, working with Kiwanis clubs, selling
*  food baskets to the, uh, the food banks and everything.
*  So, uh, I stole the, the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis club and
*  would do the telemarketing, go out twice a week and pick up checks.
*  Well, what happened was, is I'm going out, picking up checks, go knock on a door.
*  Turns out one of the persons that I had called was a law enforcement officer.
*  So he was like, who are you?
*  I'm like, I'm with the Kiwanis club.
*  And he's like, no, you're not.
*  Got arrested, spent three months in a county jail for theft by deception.
*  Got out and, um, we had to move from, from, uh, Lexington back to hazard
*  and live with Susan's parents.
*  They had gotten a desktop computer, HP.
*  And, um, I started surfing around online, found eBay and, uh, didn't really
*  know how to make money on eBay.
*  About the same time I'm, um, committing low level frauds online.
*  And I don't really talk about that in the past.
*  The first time I've really talked about that, but I would, uh,
*  uh, pay for it with bad checks.
*  So, so more, uh, person.
*  So not using a platform like eBay and more.
*  I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay, something like
*  that, and I'd pay for it with bad check and, uh, would rely on them not to chase
*  me because they were out of state at that point and the dollar amounts were very low.
*  So, uh, got the money to move to finally did those schemes enough to get the money
*  to move back to Lexington and got to Lexington.
*  And by this point I'm doing this.
*  Like I said, these schemes on eBay and I'm like, there's gotta be a better
*  way to make money on eBay.
*  Gotta be.
*  So didn't really know how well not.
*  I'm watching inside edition with Bill Riley and they're profiling beanie babies.
*  So I'm sitting there watching the one, their profile.
*  And there's this one called peanut, the Royal blue elephant selling for $1,500 on eBay.
*  I'm sitting there going like, shit, I need to find me a peanut.
*  My initial thought was, well, there's gotta be one of these hallmark stores in
*  Kentucky someplace.
*  So I skipped class the next day.
*  What out around all the hallmark stores looking for peanut?
*  No idiot.
*  He's on eBay for $1,500.
*  So after a few hours of that, I'm like, turns out they had a little gray
*  beanie baby elephants for $8.
*  Picked up one of those for $8.
*  Stopped by Kroger on the way home, picked up a pack of blue writ dye, went home,
*  tried to die the little guy.
*  So that was a nightmare.
*  Turns out they're made out of polyester.
*  Get them out of the bath.
*  Looks like they've got the mange.
*  And what happens is I, so I'm trying to die the damn thing.
*  I'm like, well, that's not going to work.
*  That's just not going to work.
*  So I got online, found a picture of a real one posted it on eBay.
*  And I was like, well, what I can do is I can claim that's the one I've got.
*  And then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail and work out like that.
*  So, uh, posted a picture of a real one online.
*  Woman thought I had the real thing.
*  She wins the bid.
*  That social engineering kicks in immediately.
*  I didn't want to, I didn't want to be on the defensive.
*  I wanted to put her on the defensive.
*  So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message.
*  Hey, we've not done any business before.
*  I don't even know if I can trust you.
*  What I need you to do protects us both.
*  Go down the U S postal service, get two money orders, totaling $1,500.
*  Send them to me issued by the U S government.
*  That way we're both protected.
*  Soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.
*  She believed that didn't ask any questions at all.
*  She believed that.
*  Sent me the money orders.
*  I cashed them out.
*  Send her the creature immediately got a phone call.
*  I didn't order this.
*  My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.
*  I sent you a blue fish elephant and she got pissed and she kept calling.
*  What I found out, and that's a really the first lesson of cyber crime that most
*  of these criminals, including self learns.
*  If you delay a victim long enough, just keep putting them off.
*  A lot of them, they get, they get exasperated, throw their hands in the air,
*  walk away, you don't hear from them.
*  And none of them to this day, none of them complained law enforcement.
*  They eat it.
*  So it's a, it's a mixture of like, you're exhausted by the process.
*  So it's just easier to walk away.
*  And second, almost like an embarrassment.
*  So there's, there's a whole slew of reasons.
*  All right.
*  There's, there's exhaustion.
*  Certainly there's the embarrassment.
*  So if you figure out, if you look at it today, where does the embarrassment come
*  from?
*  Well, the media family members were all very good about blaming the victim for
*  crimes.
*  Why would you click on the link?
*  Why would you send money to somebody you don't know?
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  So you've got that's that's going on.
*  You've got the issue of who do you complain to back then?
*  You didn't know.
*  Do you complain to local police because she's in another state.
*  So which local police do you complain to?
*  Do you complain to the feds?
*  Well, it's not the dollar amounts aren't high enough to complain to feds.
*  Fez you're going to tell you to go local.
*  Locals is going to tell you, Hey, it happened in Kentucky.
*  Complained to them.
*  Kentucky is going to tell you, well, shit, you're over there.
*  I, we need you to come in.
*  So there's this whole issue, the jurisdiction of the blame factor,
*  everything else.
*  Um, so I got away with that crime and did it under my own name at that point.
*  I kept going and got better at it.
*  Started to understand how to hide identities, things like that.
*  Started selling pirated software, pirated software led into installing
*  mod chips.
*  It was for the initial pirated software was a Sega Saturn PlayStation one.
*  Well, you had to have a mod chip in those to play the pirated discs.
*  So I started selling and installing mod chips that led into installing
*  mod chips into cable television boxes.
*  So you could watch all the pay-per-view, which in turn led into programming
*  satellite DSS cards, those 18 HRCA satellite systems, pull the card out of it,
*  program it turns on all the channels.
*  Started doing that.
*  Can we just pause?
*  That is very, um, entrepreneurial.
*  So just technically, so there's laws and rules that you're breaking nonstop.
*  So there's also legitimate ways of doing that, which is break the rules
*  of the conventions of the past.
*  That's the first principles thing.
*  That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.
*  That is guts and brilliance, but when it's crossing the lines of the law,
*  actually sometimes the law is outdated.
*  The thing is as a human being, you have to then compute the ethical damage
*  you're doing, like ethically the damage you're doing about other human beings.
*  That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking is you're adding to the
*  suffering in the world in one way or another, and you're justifying it.
*  But in terms of me sort of as an engineer, that is some gutsy thinking.
*  That's how was and Steve Jobs thought it.
*  That's that's innovation.
*  And maybe just think you're, if you can introspect your thinking process here,
*  this is a new, I like how you remember this in a HP, uh, like what, this is a
*  totally new thing to you.
*  Computers is a, is a, is yet another domain.
*  How are you figuring these puzzles out?
*  Presumably mostly alone.
*  Alone.
*  When you were thinking through these problems, is there, this is a strange
*  question to ask, but you know, what, uh, what is your thinking process?
*  What is your approach to solving these problems?
*  So, so the approach is, is, is you do something and you fuck it up and you're
*  like, you think back, okay, how do I fix that?
*  So you fix that aspect.
*  You commit the crime again and it goes a little bit further and it screws up.
*  Okay.
*  How do I fix that?
*  What's the issue on that?
*  How do I fix that?
*  So there's not a deep design thinking like, like later on it becomes that once,
*  once you, once you lay that groundwork of the way these schemes are working,
*  all right, it becomes that and you can apply that to other things in, in
*  cyber crime as a whole.
*  All right.
*  But initially it's, it's basically trial and error.
*  You know, you've got a problem.
*  How do you solve that problem?
*  All right.
*  So how do I, I'm committing these crimes under my name.
*  How do I solve that?
*  Well, one of the first principles that we started to teach on shadow crew is all
*  crime should begin with identity theft.
*  That's one of the main first principles that a lot of people to this day still
*  don't really get, all right.
*  Why would I commit a crime under my name if I can do it under your name?
*  So that's, that's one of the big buffers and that takes trial and error to get
*  to that point where you start to understand that's the way crime should
*  operate if you're a criminal.
*  All right.
*  But with me, it was, I mean, it's, it's trial and error.
*  It's, it's that childhood where that mindset is kind of ingrained in you,
*  where you're, you're looking for ways, non-traditional, let's say non-traditional
*  ways of getting around things or getting through things.
*  I mean, one of the questions probably asked this later is there's also a
*  unique aspect to the outcome of what you were doing, which is you weren't,
*  you know, you didn't get caught for a very long time.
*  We'll talk about why that is.
*  And the thing is, it's so interesting.
*  All, all crime probably should to be effective, should start with identity theft.
*  I like that identity theft because identity theft can take so many forms.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So yes.
*  So shadow crew.
*  So what's so as we're, you started with love, started with love.
*  So now we're, we're, we're, you know, doing these schemes online.
*  I'm selling, I'm selling to these, I'm programming these satellite DSS cards.
*  And you, what are the interesting things?
*  And you still see that to this day is something will happen that will
*  create an industry for criminals.
*  All right.
*  So what happened is Canada, Canadian judge rules about the same time that
*  I'm doing these satellite, satellite cards, Canadian judge comes out and says,
*  Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.
*  And his reasoning was, is since RCA doesn't sell the systems up here,
*  my citizens can pirate it.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens is overnight about the same time PayPal comes into play.
*  So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.
*  Overnight little cottage industry pops up in the United States.
*  You go down the best buy by the system for a hundred dollars,
*  take it out in the parking lot, open system up, pull it open box up,
*  pull the system out, pull the card out, throw the system away, program the card,
*  ship it's asked to Canada, $500 pop started doing that.
*  Business is good.
*  Making, you know, three, $4,000 a week doing that.
*  I'm like, yeah, that's good.
*  I have so many orders.
*  I can't fill all the orders and quickly think to myself, why do I need to fill any of them?
*  They're in Canada.
*  I'm down here.
*  You know, who are they going to complain to?
*  Because I already found out people don't complain.
*  All right.
*  They're not going to complain to anybody.
*  So I start not especially in Canada, especially Canada.
*  And I'm, I'm, I'm having them send money.
*  That's when PayPal is first into play.
*  And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.
*  It's like, you don't even have to really ask.
*  They're like, can we pay by?
*  Yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal and PayPal had no clue what
*  they were doing with security.
*  So it's like, okay, so they're sending money to PayPal.
*  I'm having the PayPal cashed out to, uh, to bank accounts in my name at that point.
*  And I get scared because by that point I'm still in four to $6,000 a week.
*  And I'm like, somebody's going to be looking at money laundering.
*  So get it in my head.
*  I'm like, best thing that I can do is get a fake driver's license, open up a bank
*  account, using that driver's license, cash out of the ATM.
*  Good.
*  No idea where to get a fake ID.
*  Not a clue.
*  So I get online, looked around.
*  It's been a couple of weeks looking around, thought I found a guy.
*  He went by the screen name of fake ID, man.
*  Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, send him my picture.
*  Dude rips me off.
*  Oh, I got played.
*  He had, he had a little website set up with reviews and I'm like, oh, it's all
*  legitimate building that trust that I talked about.
*  So the end result, I got pissed and there was no site that dealt with anything
*  criminal or cyber crime related.
*  The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session, internet relay chat.
*  And that I'm sure you've been on that.
*  This it's, it's this rolling chat board.
*  You don't know who the hell you're talking to.
*  Most of them are full of shit.
*  You can't trust anybody and you're sitting there trying to conduct business.
*  So, you know, if somebody claims they've got a product or service, do they have it?
*  Does it work?
*  Or they just going to rip you off because in those channels,
*  everyone's a criminal.
*  I kept looking around and I've happened upon a website called counterfeit library
*  and counterfeit library only dealt with counterfeit degrees and certificates as
*  on the degree mail type stuff, but they had a forum and no one was using the
*  forum, so I basically get on there and bitch every day.
*  I got ripped off.
*  Don't want to do bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
*  About the same time I started doing that, two other guys show up.
*  One's named Mr.
*  X he's out of Los Angeles.
*  Other guys named BL's above.
*  He's out of Moose, Jaws, Saskatchewan, and we all become buddies.
*  So, you know, a few weeks of me bitching a few weeks of them responding.
*  BL's above gets me on ICQ and he sends me a message.
*  He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum at that point, Gollum fun.
*  And he's like, Gollum, I can make you a fake driver's license.
*  And I was like, well, motherfucker do it.
*  And he's like, well, I'm going to charge you for it.
*  I'm like, yeah, you are.
*  He's like, I am.
*  I was like, no, you're not.
*  And he's like, look, man, he said, uh, this business, if you're going to do
*  this, you have to trust people or you're going to fail.
*  He said, so I want to charge you $200, but I'm going to send you a driver's license.
*  Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people who own counterfeit library.
*  We're emailing chat and everything else.
*  And I tell him, I'm like, okay, I'm going to say you $200.
*  That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you and I don't
*  have to deal with you anymore.
*  And he's like, bet.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.
*  Two weeks later, I get a driver's license.
*  Name is Steven Schwecki out of Ohio and a real guy worked at ADP payroll to
*  this day works at ADP is where the guy works.
*  Um, got the driver's license.
*  And to me at that point in time, it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen.
*  You know, I'd never seen a fake ID before.
*  I thought it was great.
*  Turns out, you know, looking back, it was like,
*  kind of a strong first step in creating a fake identity.
*  Very strong, very strong.
*  So this, so that was like, Gasko just, uh, on the, on the point he made.
*  That if you're going to be successful in this, you should have people you trust.
*  He is he right on that?
*  Oh, he's absolutely right.
*  He's absolutely.
*  So you have to have, this is like mob.
*  You have to, you have to have an inner circle that you trust.
*  You know, I'm sure you've probably heard me say this before successful cyber crime.
*  All right.
*  There are three necessities to being successful online.
*  If you're a criminal, three necessities are gathering data.
*  Committing the crime and then cashing it out.
*  All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.
*  If they don't, the crime fails.
*  The problem, and it's a huge problem, is that one guy can't do all three things.
*  You know, you've got to, you've got the people who gather the data.
*  Basically the, the general store sells people who sell PII credit card logins,
*  um, data tools.
*  They'll sell the spoof phone numbers and the RDP stuff like that.
*  A lot of the times those people don't know how to commit the crime and those
*  people certainly don't know how to launder the money out and put cash in pocket.
*  So you've got either because of a skill level, sometimes a geographic location
*  limits what that individual can do.
*  All right.
*  So you have to rely on people who are good in areas where you are not in
*  order for that crime to succeed.
*  And that means you have to trust those people.
*  So what happens with shadow crew?
*  All right.
*  So counterfeit library is the start.
*  All right.
*  Counterfeit library transitions over to shadow crew right before that transition.
*  There's a Ukrainian guy by the name of Dmitri Golubov.
*  He was a spammer at that point in time.
*  He saw what we were doing with, with counterfeit library and he liked it.
*  He was getting all these credit card details and this kid, I mean, he's a kid.
*  This kid has an idea and his idea was, I wondered if people would buy stolen
*  credit card details.
*  It's pretty good.
*  Uh, Ukrainian accent.
*  So he, uh, he picks up the phone.
*  He calls his buddies.
*  They call their buddies.
*  They have a physical conference in Odessa, 150 of these cyber criminals show up.
*  And they launched this idea.
*  This launches a website called Carter planet, which is the genesis of all modern
*  credit card theft as we know it.
*  All right.
*  So remember I mentioned those three necessities of cyber crime.
*  Dmitri had all the credit data in the world and he partnered with all these
*  other Ukrainians who had all this data as well.
*  The problem was that so much fraud had been committed on that Eastern side of
*  Europe that every card had been shut down.
*  Even if you were a legitimate card holder and tried to cash it out, you
*  weren't doing it at that point.
*  So again, those three necessities, gathering data, committing crime,
*  cashing out, Dmitri had the data.
*  They could commit the crime.
*  They could not put cash in pocket.
*  So we were running counterfeit library.
*  One day I get this message or not a message.
*  One day script shows up and he posts just on the general forum.
*  He posts, Hey, I've got credit card data.
*  Give me an address.
*  Give me a burner phone number.
*  Wait five business days, order, whatever you want to.
*  We had never seen anything like that.
*  We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site is what we were and fake drivers licenses.
*  So then, and we had, I guess we had two, 3000 members at that point.
*  So the response from the members was that can't be real.
*  You've got to be law enforcement.
*  It's got to be in trying to get us arrested and everything else.
*  What let me backtrack a little bit.
*  So the driver's license that I'd got BL's above had an idea.
*  What he wanted to do is he wanted to sell drivers licenses.
*  Mr.
*  X wanted to sell social security cards.
*  He made a very passable social security card.
*  Me, I didn't, I had no skill level on that.
*  I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.
*  So BL's above was like, tell you what, you be the reviewer.
*  That way you get every product or service that comes in.
*  They'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it.
*  You can learn the entire game and because you're not selling anything,
*  it gives you legitimacy on the reviews.
*  All right.
*  So I started out as a reviewer, the only reviewer on counterfeit library.
*  So over the next year, BL's above turns out he was a pot grower.
*  He goes back to growing pot because he wasn't making shit, selling
*  driver's licenses, Mr.
*  X about a year and a half in, he gets arrested, cashing out drivers, credit
*  card, not credit cards, cashing out to casinos, doing some show of that.
*  So I'm the only guy left standing and I'm at the top of the heap.
*  So, and it becomes this thing where if I review somebody, they make a lot of money.
*  If I don't, you don't do business here.
*  So script shows up saying he's got this.
*  I'm the only reviewer on site.
*  People think he's a law enforcement first week.
*  It goes like that after a while.
*  I'm like, okay, I got to do something.
*  And I'm scared, man, cause I'm like, he may be law enforcement.
*  So I get them on ICQ and I'm like, Hey, you have to be reviewed.
*  And he's like, what the hell is that?
*  So I tell him what it is.
*  He's like, you review me.
*  I was like, yeah, that's the idea.
*  So, um, give them a drop address, give them a burner phone number,
*  wait five business days.
*  And I try to hit Dell for $5,000.
*  The order fails.
*  I get back on ICQ.
*  Hey man, it didn't work.
*  He's like, give me one more chance.
*  I was like, look, I'll give you one more chance, but it's your ass after that.
*  And he's like, one more chance.
*  Like, okay, give him another address, another phone number, wait, another
*  five business days, hit Thompson's computer warehouse for $4,000 Dell for $5,000.
*  Order goes through, get the products in.
*  I post that review on counterfeit library and literally overnight we turn from an
*  eBay PayPal fraud site to a credit theft site.
*  And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.
*  So we were doing a, now it's called CMP fraud card, not present fraud.
*  So you hit, you use, hit an online merchant with stolen credit card data.
*  Back then, a, a fairly experienced fraudster could profit $30,000 to $40,000 a month.
*  Okay.
*  Just buying, you know, laptops, what have you and cashing out, you know, put
*  them on eBay for sale and sell them like that.
*  And 30 to 40 K a month was the profit on that script had a lot of buddies.
*  He had people like Roman Vega, these other guys that would sell not just
*  credit card data, but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.
*  We had counterfeit not stolen.
*  So counterfeit, counterfeit.
*  That, that must be tough to do.
*  So the connections must be harder than driver's license.
*  So, you know, on your back.
*  So what's what Boa initially had, and I became the, the United States
*  salesperson for Boa, but what he had was, is he was the first dumps
*  provider in the United States.
*  So on the back of your credit or debit card, there's a magnetic stripe.
*  Three data tracks on the stripe.
*  There was the first data track is customer's name, second data track,
*  is the card number forward slash 16 digit algorithm.
*  Outside of that, that's important.
*  We'll get back to that in a few minutes.
*  Third data track is called indiscriminate data.
*  No one uses it.
*  All right.
*  So what's bought and sold is the second data track.
*  It's called the dump.
*  And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop, you insert the
*  card or you swipe the card, the only information that's sent out for
*  verification is the second data track.
*  The only information that's sent out for verification is the second data track.
*  All right.
*  That goes to the processor bank for verification.
*  The first data track that customer's name shows up on the screen of the
*  cashier in front of you.
*  So what typically happens is, is you buy 10 of these dumps, you get 10
*  counterfeit cards and code track two on all 10 cards, track one, you create
*  one fake driver's license, track one is just the name of that one fake
*  driver's license.
*  That way, when you go in the shop, swipe the card track two sent off a
*  verification track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.
*  If you ever asked for ID, you pull out the fake ID.
*  Everyone's a nice warm fuzzy.
*  You walk out with the cameras, Rolex and track one could be, it doesn't
*  have to be connected.
*  It's not connected to track.
*  Not connected at all.
*  All right.
*  That's, that's one of the big problems.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  So script brought a host of technical people into that type of environment,
*  all committing credit card theft.
*  We had a proxy providers.
*  We had all these people that were doing this stuff.
*  We start making a lot of money, a lot.
*  And the reason that happens is again, script did not have the ability to cash
*  out, so he was reduced to selling things.
*  And at the same time, he's looking for how do I make more money?
*  All right.
*  The Ukrainians happened upon this thing called the CVV one breach or hack.
*  That's what they call it.
*  So what happens is, remember I told you to track two card number.
*  Forward slash 16 digit algorithm.
*  You gotta know the algorithm to encode it so you can swipe the card or take
*  it to the ATM machine.
*  All right.
*  ATM.
*  You gotta know it.
*  Now we were fishing data from hell.
*  I mean, we were, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.
*  We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers, but you can't get that
*  algorithm, so the Ukrainians start testing stuff.
*  What they found out was no bank had implemented the hash on track two.
*  So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits.
*  It would encode, take it to the ATM, pull cash out because you got the pin.
*  All right.
*  Started doing that.
*  Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand.
*  So that means, so if there's no, are they generating random numbers or do
*  they have valid numbers for track two?
*  No numbers needed at all.
*  As long as just the track two was a complete track two.
*  So it's a valid track two that doesn't match.
*  So the pin is the thing that gets you in.
*  So back then, all right, it's back then.
*  What we're talking about is you needed typically today you need a whole track
*  two, you need that valid track two.
*  All right.
*  You need the, you need the 16 digit card number forward slash, and then whatever
*  that algorithm has the opposite of it.
*  All right.
*  Back then, none of the banks had implemented that algorithm.
*  So while the algorithm was there, you didn't need it to encode.
*  Interesting.
*  Interesting.
*  So you can make a lot of money with physical of so much money that card,
*  not present cards, card, not present fraud.
*  Remember I told you was 30 to $40,000 a month.
*  All right.
*  That turned into 30 to $40,000 a month.
*  Turned into 30 to $40,000 a day.
*  The Ukrainians again, they can't cash it out.
*  They've got all the data on the planet, but they can't cash it out.
*  Those three necessities of cyber crime.
*  So the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.
*  Tell you what, we'll give you 40%.
*  So you had all these cashiers that were 40% of $40,000 a day.
*  Yeah, we'll take that.
*  All right.
*  Send the rest of it over to buy Western union or what have you to your Ukrainian
*  contact.
*  That's before cryptocurrency came into play.
*  Now you had a couple of forerunners with e-gold and Liberty reserve, things like
*  that.
*  But back then it starts out with Western union.
*  Then it becomes prepaid cards, sending track information over, loading the
*  card up like that.
*  And then finally you get to e-gold Liberty reserve.
*  And then today it's with crypto.
*  That's, that's used.
*  Um, started stealing a lot of money, a lot, and that got law enforcement attention.
*  So we started to see, I mean, just it's crazy.
*  That story.
*  We started to see, uh, IPs coming in from law enforcement agencies, government
*  agencies, because back then they didn't know how to shield their identity either.
*  So you saw, you saw secret service.
*  You saw DoD, you saw all these like, and you're like, that's interesting.
*  You know, and, uh, at the same time we had, uh, it was called a hack, but it
*  wasn't a hack.
*  We had a guy that worked at T-Mobile in Los Angeles.
*  This is the same guy that back then published Paris Hilton's phone contact
*  list that made a lot of news.
*  Not only did he do that, but it turned out that the Los Angeles secret service
*  agency was using T-Mobile phones.
*  So he's getting text messages of the secret service investigating shadow crew.
*  And he posts those damn things on shadow crew.
*  So I'm sitting there going head of the pile.
*  I'm sitting there going, this is not going to end well.
*  This is not going to end well.
*  So at the same time I had access, I started out with access to the Indiana
*  state sex offenders registry, and I was using that to create bank accounts,
*  lauded the money out and I would sell the bank accounts, stuff like that.
*  They shut that down.
*  The next database I had access to was the Texas driver's license database and
*  started using that to create fake driver's licenses, what have you.
*  And then finally we happened upon the California death index.
*  All right.
*  Complete information, mother's maiden, socials, DOBs, all that.
*  And it's like, gotta be a use for that.
*  Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.
*  My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody that's died and then file for
*  social security death benefit, not death benefits, but social security benefits
*  for that individual and get that recurring paycheck in.
*  So that takes a lot of research to start seeing if you can do that.
*  How does the federal government know if you're dead?
*  Do federal indexes reference state indexes?
*  You got all these questions that pop up.
*  Well, it turns out federal indexes don't reference state indexes.
*  It's against the law.
*  It also turns out the only way the federal government knows you're dead is
*  prior to 1998, the family had to file a social security death benefit for that
*  person.
*  All right.
*  Prior to 98, it took the family.
*  After 98, the hospital can do it.
*  Funeral home can do it, or the family could do it.
*  So a lot more people have it filed after, if they've died.
*  But it's still, there's a lot of people probably sleep with the drugs.
*  Because that death benefit's only like $219.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Nobody's thinking about that shit.
*  So I started to apply for social security benefits.
*  Nope.
*  Number's dormant.
*  So they want you to come in for a physical interview.
*  Here I am, you know, 32.
*  You're not going to pass as a 65 year old.
*  So no.
*  So the next idea I had was, wonder if you could file income tax returns on these
*  people.
*  Turns out you can.
*  All day long.
*  So I started doing that and I started to steal once I got ramped up because you
*  test everything, you know, you're testing, make sure you got to figure out what the
*  deposit instrument is and everything else.
*  And once you get all that lined out, I started to steal $160,000 a week every
*  week for 10 months out of the year.
*  By paying taxes by filing fake.
*  Yeah.
*  Filing returns.
*  So you find a business and the way the system worked is the IRS will issue a
*  refund on somebody before they're able to verify that that person worked for an
*  employer.
*  Still works like that today.
*  All right.
*  So, and you keep any amounts relatively low.
*  Keep them at $3,000.
*  All right.
*  Mounts are very low.
*  You're still able to achieve scale because this large index.
*  I got to where, and I was manual later on, a couple of buddies of mine went
*  automated with it.
*  Wait, you would go and doing this by hand.
*  So there's no code involved.
*  All manual.
*  Wow.
*  I'd file a return once every six minutes, work 10 hours a day, three days a week.
*  So clicking on, typing fast and click one return every six minutes.
*  That's changing IP.
*  That's a change in address.
*  Everything else will return every six minutes for three days a week.
*  Fourth day.
*  I would take a road trip, plot out a map of ATMs and then the next two days cash
*  out, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
*  All right.
*  Come back home, rinse and repeat.
*  Um, turns out that a backpack, I don't see any way it was sitting around here, but
*  a backpack will hold $150,000 of twenties is what it will hold.
*  So I put 150 K and twenties in a backpack.
*  I had a spare bedroom.
*  I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.
*  This is very, very important information.
*  And the fact that, you know, it is, uh, is also very first we started with the
*  volume of coal that weighs a ton and now a backpack holds $150,000 of points.
*  And then you can multiply that by five for hundreds.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I like most of the time it's 20 is coming out ATM, right?
*  Each 20 ways, each 20 ways a gram.
*  So it's actually go by weight, which is what federal authorities do.
*  When they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.
*  Oh, they just, they just weigh it.
*  So 150 K is seven and a half keys of cash.
*  That's pretty light.
*  Not bad.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you get big backpack?
*  Go do a good run with David Goggins with it.
*  I like it.
*  The fact, you know, this is great.
*  So wait, uh, where does that come in with the backpack?
*  So what happens is I didn't know how to launder money.
*  All right.
*  So, you know, I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom.
*  One day you open up the bedroom and you're like, got to do
*  something with those backpacks.
*  And that's when you start learning how to launder money, you know, cash
*  based businesses, things like that.
*  I had a production company, had a couple of detailing company.
*  I was thinking about going into food trucks, things like that.
*  And trust.
*  Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?
*  How does money laundering, uh, work?
*  I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about?
*  This is, uh, by the time the tax return schemes go into play, we're talking,
*  2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.
*  And so what, uh, at that time and what you're aware of now, how it evolved,
*  how does Monday money laundering work?
*  Uh, you know, it's not that much different.
*  It's really not.
*  Um, you, you got a cash based business, start laundering the money or putting the
*  money through that, saying the transactions are legal.
*  You, um, then start depositing into bank accounts from the bank accounts.
*  My, my thing was, is have bank accounts in United States, Mexico, Canada, and
*  then finally bounce over to Estonia was the final destination of all this stuff.
*  And the idea is, is to try to move them to so many places that by the end of the
*  day, it looks legal and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught, which you
*  ultimately are, but, um, so cash based businesses, you know, when you say, sorry
*  to interrupt the cash based businesses, so you have money that needs to be
*  moved to other people.
*  Uh, so how does that work?
*  What's, what's the business?
*  If it's, if it's moved to service and you're giving them money, right.
*  So you, you do the Ozark thing if you want to do that.
*  So you can gamble cash out some like that.
*  So there were trips to whatever casinos you've got, you've got your production
*  company or your detailed company.
*  So how many cars you cleaning a day?
*  How many companies have you got to do that?
*  All right.
*  Um, whatever that company is, it's gotta be cash based.
*  Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.
*  You have to have enough of those cash based businesses where it doesn't look
*  funny.
*  All right.
*  Because if you're a detailed company, make a hundred thousand dollars a month,
*  that's a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So then you start depositing into that.
*  Well, because of the Patriot act as a suspicious activity report, SARS came in
*  at $2,500 instead of the 10 K that it used to be.
*  So all of a sudden you've got multiple bank accounts that you've got to set up.
*  All right.
*  Fortunately, what you also had is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards that were
*  coming into play at the same time.
*  So a combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits that had ACH abilities to attach
*  to those as well.
*  And you start running them all together.
*  Then once it's out of the United States, you don't have to worry as much.
*  You can start funneling that into, uh, fewer bank accounts until finally you've
*  got the one main account that's over at Bank Letico and Estonia at that point.
*  That's what you've got.
*  Um, so much, a bunch of hops that end up in a place that you can't trace.
*  And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.
*  My last seizure was 2010.
*  Got the last seizure notice.
*  So took them.
*  They got it, but it took them that long to get to it.
*  So, so how do stories like with script that come into play here where he, um, had
*  someone who owed him money kidnapped and tortured.
*  So when does it turn darker?
*  It turns darker when the more, the more money you make script was a kid.
*  That, uh, he was stealing enough money that he was able to buy whatever
*  a state he wanted to, and he would brag about touring the countryside.
*  And if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.
*  And that was not just a brag.
*  He was doing that.
*  So this kid is stealing a lot of money at the same time.
*  He's got connections politically because of his family.
*  He's got connections in that family.
*  He's got connections with the Ukrainian mob.
*  All right.
*  So he's got these inroads and people are looking out for him and he's
*  stealing a lot of money at the same time.
*  Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.
*  Somebody doesn't pay him.
*  Now we had never with shadow crew, with Carter planet, with counterfeit library,
*  we were basically the geeks.
*  All right.
*  We were the, just the fraudsters, the social engineers.
*  We had never really considered violence.
*  The rules that I had in play were, Hey, we're not, we don't do child pornography.
*  We don't do counterfeit currency.
*  We don't do drugs.
*  And the only thing we ended up really obeying was the child porn stuff, except
*  for Max Butler, who you mentioned earlier, um, script, someone rips the guy off.
*  And, uh, he comes online on shadow crew at that point, and he posts these pictures
*  one day, and I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures had the
*  guy that rammed in the van, had the door open, rammed in, rammed in the van,
*  had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured.
*  And, uh, the response was, this is what happens when you steal from me.
*  And that's the, that's the first time that violence came into play at that point.
*  And that's one thing he's got.
*  You start realizing things are getting a little serious.
*  How did that make you feel?
*  The first response is can't be real.
*  He's, he's just, that's, he's just doing that.
*  You know, he's just, he's wanting to send a message.
*  Then you're like, no, that's real.
*  That's real.
*  And, uh,
*  were you afraid in your own heart that you might, uh, descend to that too?
*  Like if you see that, or was it pretty clear to you that that's, that's a line
*  that some people can cross and some can, and you're not one of those that can cross it.
*  You know, I got, I got to tell you, I joke with my wife.
*  The joke I give, the joke I tell my wife is, you know, if I knew some guy that had
*  8,000 bitcoins, I might be persuaded to ask him for access to that.
*  And she was like, how?
*  And I was like, well, hammer and toes.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, I say that as a joke, but there's that line where you're like, I remember who
*  I used to be.
*  And if you're looking at that kind of money, I might be persuaded to do that back then.
*  You know, that's, that's, and I think that's what script's issue is.
*  He, it was a lot of money to him.
*  It's the money.
*  And then there's, you know, violence can also be gradual.
*  So over time you do a little more, a little more, a little more, a little more.
*  You get used to what's going on and then I get to sensitize.
*  And you figure, you take somebody like, you know, like, you know, like, you know,
*  and you figure you take somebody like, uh, like Ross Ulbrich, the, the Silk Road guy.
*  All right.
*  Ross was not a violent guy.
*  He's, he was not, but at that point in time, you know, he was sitting on 24, 24 million
*  a Bitcoin, he was the only game in town.
*  And that 24 now is like, I don't know, 22, 24 billion, some crap like that.
*  But, um, he felt in danger.
*  Uh, this guy was going to turn him in, you know, it was a black mountain and everything.
*  So Ross thinks he hires a couple of hit men to kill the guy.
*  So it's, it's, it becomes that thing.
*  And I saw that over and over again.
*  And I'd like to say I wasn't like that, but given the same circumstances, I would
*  have probably done the same thing.
*  And also when you're, it's not just about money.
*  There's a lot of other forces, like if you're threatened, um, for your well-being
*  or for your wealth or for your power, all, all of us, all the different motivations.
*  Plus that, that online aspect with those communities like that, if you're the head
*  guy, you really feel like you're the parent of these guys.
*  So somebody is starting to threaten them.
*  It's like, all right, what do I need to do?
*  So what do you make a Silk Road?
*  See the, uh, shadow crew started something that today you can call dark net and dark
*  net markets.
*  So these markets that operate that trade, uh, trade things, everything from child
*  pornography to drugs, to, I mean, what else?
*  What are the dark things that humans want to do that they don't want anyone to know
*  about all of those things?
*  Um, so can you maybe tell me, you know what, let's just even step back.
*  What is the dark net?
*  How big is it?
*  So what happens there?
*  Let's, let's, let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to this.
*  All right.
*  Um, what shadow crew did other than, you know, dealing in all these stolen wares,
*  what shadow crew did that's really important.
*  Remember those three necessities that I talked about, but the important thing is,
*  is it established trust among criminals.
*  All right.
*  Because that's a necessity.
*  You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with because you have to deal with
*  somebody you have to, all right.
*  So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?
*  How do you know you're dealing with somebody that's skilled?
*  How do you know you're going to deal with somebody that's not going to rip you off?
*  You have to be able to trust that individual.
*  The shadow crew provided that trust mechanism for criminals.
*  You had that communication channel with forums where you could reference
*  conversations, weeks, months old, take part in her famous conversations.
*  You had vouching systems and review systems in place, escrow systems in place.
*  You had, you could knew by looking at someone's screen name, if you could trust
*  the individual network with the individual.
*  All right.
*  And that community of just humans provided that backbone of trust.
*  And that's, that's really interesting.
*  When you think about it, you, you had the trust that was there, but you also had
*  this almost this instantaneous information that was available about the community or
*  about cyber crime at large.
*  And that's, that's still in play today.
*  All right.
*  So when that, that was the way things were until a couple of things happen.
*  And one was cryptocurrency.
*  The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.
*  Now I was working with a secret service, ripping the secret service off when
*  Tor comes into play.
*  All right.
*  So we got a, we got a memo in one day and it was talking about the Tor browser.
*  And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.
*  This is going to be problem.
*  And so we all fired up the Tor browser and it turns out it was, this was 2005,
*  early six, it turns out it was completely unusable.
*  Could not use it at all simply because no one was using it.
*  And it was extremely slow.
*  So people don't know Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous.
*  As long as you properly know how to use it.
*  Right.
*  Huge caveat.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So developed by the United States Navy and they developed this.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It wasn't the hackers that.
*  Interesting.
*  US Navy to this day, the number one funder of Tor military to this day.
*  All right.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, the same, I guess with the internet, the origins are developed so
*  that operatives could communicate with each other without being identified.
*  All right.
*  That then goes open source.
*  They release it.
*  EFF comes in and start sponsoring and everything else like that.
*  The next idea was, well, you know, people can get around their country's firewalls.
*  Whistleblowers can use it, things like that.
*  Well, someone forgot to mention that the first adoptees of tech, if you can use
*  it to launder money or remain anonymous are criminals.
*  And so criminals start to use the damn thing.
*  All right.
*  So along the same time we get, well, a few years later, we get Satoshi
*  Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it.
*  Ross Ulbrich decides he's going to start up Silk Road.
*  So initially the people who were using Tor, which later is the dark web,
*  people were using Tor or just talking with each other, visiting websites,
*  communicating like that, someone figured out, Hey man, we can host websites.
*  On this thing.
*  And they have a lot of trouble finding the box.
*  So that is the advent of Silk Road.
*  All of a sudden, Ross Ulbrich has this idea that he's going to change the world.
*  By becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.
*  So he opens up the Silk Road and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.
*  So if those people out there wondering why Bitcoin is going at what 44 K today.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It starts by the time this is out, it could be a hundred thousand or 10,000.
*  Absolutely.
*  We'll see.
*  Who knows if it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.
*  Which is a hilarious statement to make because that statement would be
*  ridiculously wrong like five years ago.
*  Right?
*  People a hundred years from now will be laughing.
*  Wait, it was that low?
*  So he only accepts Bitcoin and that's of course the, the initial use case of
*  crypto is no one wants to admit it today, but the initial use case is we're
*  going to buy a bunch of pot.
*  We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.
*  So that's, that's what happens.
*  Uh, Ross, it's, it's really interesting to me.
*  If you, um, if you look at motivations of cyber criminals, the motivations are
*  status, cash ideology.
*  All right.
*  My guys, all cash across the board, all cash Ross's ideology.
*  He really believed he was going to change the world.
*  He really didn't.
*  I've been fortunate.
*  I, uh, I actually know the guy who ran a Silk Road too, and, uh, have
*  talked to the kid, everything else.
*  And, uh, I will tell you that those, those guys who are motivated by ideology,
*  they are a completely different breed.
*  They really are.
*  It's not, uh, you know, the cash guy, it's, it's, it's low hanging fruit.
*  The, the ease of, of it's hard to stop committing crime, but it's much easier
*  for a cash motivated individual to stop than it is that ideology guy, uh, that
*  Silk Road two guy, he's still got it.
*  You know, he's not breaking the law, but you can see it's like he wants to,
*  wants to, so it's, it's, um,
*  that's fascinating that I mean, the worst atrocities in human history are committed
*  with people that operate under ideology.
*  All the other motivations are much weaker.
*  But you know, you think about it and you've got it with Ross.
*  I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy, but think about the amount of cognitive
*  dissonance that the guy's got that he thinks he's going to change the world by
*  running a drug site.
*  I mean, it certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?
*  Yeah.
*  Could he have done it like that?
*  Probably not.
*  Well, I can, I can still man those arguments.
*  I say, I listened to quite a few, uh, libertarians and you can push
*  that to anarchists and.
*  The, you know, there's a lot of people that argue, um, so I actually talked to,
*  uh, to faculty, to a professor at Columbia who actually argues that all drugs should
*  be legalized and not at a philosophical level, political level, but the fact that,
*  um, all the negative consequences of drugs that people talk about are actually have
*  to do with other factors in your life.
*  I would agree with that.
*  And so that's a look at the, but that's more like a argument about negative
*  aspects of drugs.
*  I think the ideology comes in where it's like, well, nobody should tell you what
*  to do.
*  You should be, you should have the responsibility of your own actions.
*  Like, uh, um, the government or any other institutions shouldn't be the, uh,
*  the rule setters, the constraints for how you live your life.
*  And so that I could, I could see that argument being made.
*  And ultimately, if you, uh, like create an open market for drugs, how that could
*  build a better society.
*  It might break down the outdated, the corrupt, the bureaucratic institutions.
*  I mean, you can make that, you can make that argument.
*  There's an argument.
*  But let's be fair.
*  I want to be fair with it.
*  I mean, could, did he change the world?
*  We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.
*  Yeah.
*  In the long arc of history, perhaps.
*  Yeah, we do have that.
*  That's a biggie.
*  And that might, might've been for it to take hold in society.
*  Maybe the darker parts of society at first, maybe that was necessary.
*  Right.
*  I mean, maybe we'll see how it pans out.
*  Um, shadow crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez, his kid's name.
*  We had, we were growing so big that, um, I had to start farming things out.
*  So the first thing I started farming, I instituted this review system, kind
*  of establishing that trust mechanism even further for criminals use.
*  We needed somebody to take care of our tech aspects of the forum.
*  So, um, associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor, we're
*  looking for a forum techie.
*  He comes to me one night and he's like, uh, found our forum techie.
*  I was like, who's that?
*  And he's like, uh, it's this kid.
*  And I was like, is he good?
*  He's like, well, he knows the software.
*  And I was like, okay, we just signed his ass on.
*  He went by the screen name of, uh, Cumba Johnny was his screen name.
*  And, um, he starts selling credit cards after a while under a
*  screen name of Scarface.
*  And, uh, that CVB one breach where you're cashing out the track twos at
*  ATMs, you know, $40,000 a day.
*  So Alberts in New Jersey, one day broad daylight and, uh, stands at an
*  ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there, feeding in one ATM card after another.
*  Point out cash, taking the twenties out, stuff them in that backpack.
*  Meanwhile, just across the street, a couple of cops just happened to be there.
*  And they start noticing this kid just standing there.
*  So 40 minutes, they watch this kid 40 minutes.
*  Finally, one cop looks at the other.
*  Let me see what's going on there.
*  Walks over across the street.
*  Albert's wearing a wig.
*  He's got the disguise on everything else like that.
*  Ask him, kid, what are you doing?
*  Albert falls apart.
*  We didn't know Albert had been arrested.
*  So Albert immediately goes in.
*  I want to work with the secret service.
*  At that point in time, secret service, I referred to, and I don't, I want to make
*  sure I don't say that it's not like that anymore, but back then they were
*  fucking idiots.
*  All right.
*  They had no clue what was going on.
*  So there was a competence issue that they were working through.
*  It's one way to put it.
*  That's a nice, that's a nice euphemism.
*  Or fucking idiots is another way to say it.
*  So they're just like not aware of the digital world.
*  They have no clue.
*  No clue.
*  The way that, um, Albert tells them how to catch us because they looked at
*  them, how do we catch them?
*  And Albert's like, I'm serious.
*  I'm serious.
*  So Albert's like, well, you could try a VPN.
*  What's a VPN?
*  So he explains it to them.
*  They're like, that's a good idea.
*  So I quit shadow crew.
*  So I quit shadow crew.
*  I was worried about all the news that was coming in, everything like that.
*  I'm stealing 160 K a week.
*  I didn't know Albert had been arrested.
*  I'm worried about being arrested.
*  I know the writings on the wall and I'm like, I'm quitting.
*  Where did you see the writing?
*  Like the IPs that were coming in, the text messages about the secret service
*  investigators building, building, building, building.
*  This is not going to end well.
*  This is, this is, this is going to be bad.
*  So, uh, I announced my retirement of February 15th, I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004.
*  Is my retirement.
*  I think that's the 2004 and, uh, I quit.
*  I walk away.
*  Well, Albert had been arrested.
*  They cut him loose.
*  No one knows he's been arrested.
*  He comes back into shadow crew.
*  I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.
*  He's kind of on the run, which if you want to know that's right, it's a
*  nightmare story in and of itself.
*  So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy, there was this, uh, guy named David.
*  Oh, what was his name?
*  He was El Mariachi was a, was the guy's name.
*  David Thomas, David.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a film guy.
*  So Scarface.
*  So El Mariachi real name, David Thomas.
*  He's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.
*  He comes to us on shadow crew telling us the sad story.
*  We take up a collection for this guy.
*  Send it to him.
*  All right.
*  I get him a job working with a low level Carter, trying to make him some money.
*  All right.
*  El Mariachi does, or Thomas does this for a few weeks comes to me one day and he's
*  like, man, I'm not making any money.
*  I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.
*  Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of big buyer.
*  He, um, real friend of mine.
*  And I've contacted him.
*  I was like, look, man, I got a guy that wants to do some work.
*  Can you help the guy out?
*  And he's like, I got it.
*  I was like, okay.
*  So he sends Thomas enough money to go.
*  Thomas is in Texas at that point.
*  Since Thomas enough money to go from Texas to Issaquah, Washington
*  and rent an office space.
*  All right.
*  So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space, him and his girlfriend
*  rents an office space.
*  And the plan is, is big buyer is going to place an order, get product sent.
*  Mariachi is going to get the product listed on eBay, cash out 50 50.
*  Easy enough.
*  All right.
*  So big buyer places an order.
*  First order is outpost.com $18,000.
*  The largest order outpost.com had ever received at that point in time.
*  Order goes through.
*  It goes through.
*  It still goes through.
*  He gets the product.
*  All right.
*  Mariachi comes back, tells me, tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor, Kim
*  Taylor at this point he's I'm I'm 33 34.
*  Kim Taylor is 46.
*  He works at the tattered cover bookstore in Denver, Colorado.
*  That's where he works at this point.
*  And he fancies himself Jason Bourne.
*  All right.
*  He's even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.
*  So I'm like, all right.
*  So Mariachi is telling us how much, how much money he's making everything else.
*  I'm like, well, that's good.
*  I'm glad you're all right.
*  Kim contacts me.
*  He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.
*  And I was like, why?
*  He's like to make some money.
*  I'm like, you're making money.
*  He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.
*  I was like, all right, go be careful.
*  So he gets in the car.
*  Saturn is what he's driving.
*  He drives his little piece of pieces, just Saturn all the way up to Issaquah.
*  Gets there, you know, midnight.
*  They party all night long because they've never met each other.
*  They're just celebrating party and drinking everything else like that.
*  Meanwhile, big buyer has placed another order.
*  Without post.com $17,000.
*  The second largest order outpost.com had ever received at that point in time.
*  By this point in time, Outpost knows the first order was fraudulent.
*  Guess where it's going.
*  The exact same address.
*  The first order goes.
*  So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.
*  Hey, we got a fraudster.
*  Issaquah is like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?
*  They had outposts is like, be happy to.
*  So the rule was is on credit card fraud.
*  If you've got full account access, you place the order the morning that's
*  supposed to arrive, you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.
*  If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.
*  If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.
*  All right.
*  Well, big buyer was the guy who placed the order.
*  Mariachi and my second in charge are partying.
*  All right.
*  So they're supposed to contact a big buyer.
*  They don't.
*  Meanwhile, big buyer is raising hell.
*  Getting up with me like, Hey, where are you?
*  Where are the guys?
*  I can't find them.
*  They don't need to pick up this product.
*  So I can't get in touch with them.
*  They go down to pick up the thing.
*  So Mariachi's got a Cadillac old seventies Cadillac.
*  He's got a Cadillac pulls into the complex.
*  Now Mariachi is driving.
*  Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat.
*  David Thomas's girlfriend's in the back seat.
*  As they pull into the complex, going through the parking lot, Mariachi
*  just happens to glance over and he sees a van with a guy sitting sideways in the van.
*  And he looks at Kim Taylor.
*  He's like, that's an undercover.
*  And Kim's like, it's fine.
*  So they pull up to the office complex.
*  Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.
*  So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.
*  I believe you have some packages for us.
*  Guys like one second.
*  So he disappears around the wall out pops this a quad PD arrest Kim.
*  David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.
*  He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate where he has three fake
*  driver's licenses in his wallet, along with his real driver's license, another
*  no-no, but they get him.
*  So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.
*  We couldn't bond him out.
*  Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants, so we bonded him out.
*  My third in charge kid, Seth Sanders was his name.
*  He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account to bond him out.
*  And I get Mariachi, I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah where he, another
*  friend of mine agrees to house him, him and his wife.
*  So I think everything's fine and all that.
*  About three weeks later, this guy in Utah gets me on the phone.
*  Hey, he's got to go.
*  I'm like, what's going on?
*  He's like, well, the only thing he's doing is popping ecstasy
*  tablets every day, all day.
*  And I'm like, seriously?
*  He's like, yeah.
*  I was like, okay, he's got to go.
*  So we got him.
*  Seriously?
*  He's like, yeah.
*  I was like, okay, he's got to go.
*  So we kick him out of there.
*  By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.
*  I mean, I had all these crews running, had another crew that's coming through
*  Denver, send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.
*  Kim gets these guys arrested.
*  So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.
*  I just want to throw my hands up in the air and walk away.
*  So my retirement's coming up at the same time.
*  So I'm like, fuck it.
*  I'm done.
*  So I tell everybody that the rest of the admins and the mods, they're like,
*  this is what's going on.
*  You guys need to watch out for this.
*  We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.
*  Be careful.
*  What's going on?
*  I walk away at the same time.
*  I walk away.
*  Come to Johnny Albert Gonzalez comes back into play.
*  He sees everything that's going on.
*  He uses that to his advantage.
*  He starts banning everyone.
*  That's suspicious of him sets up the VPN at the same time and says, Hey, to make
*  sure we're all secure, I need all transactions.
*  To go through this VPN VPNs ran by the secret service.
*  All right.
*  Secret service ends up, I think they ended up cataloging like $7 million worth of
*  transactions over the next four or five months.
*  Shadow crew makes the front cover of Forbes August 2004 headline.
*  Who's stealing your identity?
*  October 26, 2004 United States secret service arrest 33 people, six countries,
*  six hours.
*  I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen and I'm like,
*  you're, you're, you're the one that got away.
*  I'm the one public.
*  There were a couple other guys that got away that they didn't publicly mention.
*  One, his, his name was Tron.
*  He was a zero.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But, um, he went by the screen name Tron.
*  He had access, almost unfettered access to bank of America.
*  Um, so what happens is they identified the guy, secret services in the air to go
*  get him.
*  They call the Ukrainian police.
*  Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy.
*  Ukrainian cops are like, Oh, come on down.
*  So as soon as they got off the phone, Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down
*  and tell Tron, Hey, they're, they're coming to get you.
*  Yeah.
*  Bugs out down to South America and they don't catch him.
*  I think for six or seven years after that, something caught him eventually.
*  Caught him eventually.
*  Well, let me actually ask you on this point.
*  You said that if you do cyber crime, eventually it's not going to end well.
*  It does not end well.
*  Why is that?
*  So I don't want to say that's because you're going to be arrested because
*  honestly, very few people are arrested.
*  All right.
*  But it doesn't end well because of the type of person that you become.
*  Yeah.
*  I, you, you quoted me earlier.
*  You, you lie to everybody around you.
*  You lie to yourself.
*  You lie to your friends.
*  You lie to your family.
*  Of course you lie to your victims.
*  You don't have any friends.
*  You know, I went 20 years without friends.
*  I had associates.
*  I didn't have friends.
*  You can't truly trust.
*  You don't trust anybody.
*  You don't trust anybody.
*  You know, I had my wife, I was married for nine years.
*  I lied to her every single day of those nine years.
*  And it took her nine years to, to give up on me, to realize that I was
*  that piece of shit and she leaves at that point.
*  Then from there, I started dating a stripper and lied to her.
*  Lied.
*  I thought I had friends.
*  I lied to all those people that I knew that thought they were my friends.
*  I lied to them the entire time.
*  You become that individual.
*  I don't think a lot of people really understand how bad that is.
*  You know, you talked about, you, you pointed out that woman that I ripped off.
*  She was trying to put a roof on her house for frigging kids, man.
*  You're that person.
*  You're that person.
*  So you're also lying to yourself.
*  And that's not a mindset in which you can.
*  Grow as a person.
*  Find happiness, find genuine, simple human affection, which is what love is.
*  Yeah.
*  Simple, real friendship, all of those things.
*  So, you know, I went to prison, of course.
*  One of the things that one of the most important lessons that I've learned in prison
*  because cyber crime, crime as a whole, if you're a criminal, it's an addiction.
*  All right.
*  If you're addicted to something, whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,
*  if you're addicted to something, you cannot love anything else except the addiction.
*  The addiction comes first.
*  All right.
*  And, you know, you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.
*  Script, for example, tortures that guy.
*  You get to the point where it's like, OK, this is the business.
*  And, you know, I tried to convince myself that, you know, I'm a businessman,
*  but I'm a good guy on the other end.
*  And you're not. You're not.
*  So those lies become part of it.
*  Everything else. And, you know, it's yeah, you get the higher ups are usually arrested.
*  They are. But, you know, you've got millions of cyber criminals these days.
*  So most guys are not going to be arrested.
*  So you may be arrested.
*  You may you may be like freaking Jonathan James.
*  He was a minor, a very, very talented individual, very competent.
*  He had as a kid, he had broken into NASA, the Pentagon.
*  He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.
*  This is that kid.
*  Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft.
*  Partners with Albert, he's arrested with Albert.
*  Law enforcement.
*  They were going on. They were going to blame him.
*  He was the only competent individual.
*  So this kid gets up one day. He wasn't in prison yet.
*  He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom, gets out his 45,
*  walks in the bathroom and blows his brains out.
*  You know, you've got you've got things like that.
*  Or you're going to rip somebody off and you're going to end up like scripted
*  with that guy, the the guy who hit who ran Evolution Marketplace.
*  No one knew who two people ran that guy and a girl.
*  And no one knew who they were.
*  He ends up stealing about 24 million dollars, a lot of from Ukrainian mob.
*  And they found him about a year later on a beach without his head and hands.
*  But, you know, it always goes south.
*  But more than anything to me, the
*  the negative thing is, is you really become somebody.
*  That I mean, just truly a despicable human being.
*  When you get to the point
*  when you're you're still you're destroying people's retirement accounts,
*  you're stealing money from a woman that simply wants to do
*  something good for her family.
*  When you when you become that individual and you're OK with that.
*  My God, man.
*  I got to the point I had one guy I ripped off.
*  It's like for nine hundred dollars.
*  And when I first started the cyber crime stuff, it's when I was becoming competent.
*  And I ripped him off for like nine hundred dollars.
*  And he sent me an email and.
*  He was like, I the email said something like,
*  I guess you needed the money and it's OK.
*  You know, you keep it and I'm getting chills right now thinking about it.
*  It's that.
*  Where you become that individual.
*  Yeah. Can I actually backtrack?
*  Listen, I love love, OK?
*  I do. And there's a story
*  that you fell in love with the stripper.
*  I mean, you have to tell the story.
*  So how did you fall in love
*  with somebody?
*  Not there's anything wrong with that profession, but it's it's it's romantic.
*  It's like true romance, by the way. Great movie.
*  It is a great film.
*  It's truly a great film.
*  Even even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance is genius.
*  This was so much good acting there.
*  Anyway, so tell me that love story.
*  All right. So, you know, like I said, I get from my dad,
*  I get that fear of being abandoned.
*  You know, I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.
*  And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  And what happened was
*  I noticed that Susan,
*  she was not coming to bed like, you know, she used to.
*  And she'd stay up all night long.
*  And sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours and everything else.
*  And I'm like, well, something's going on.
*  And I'd pass by her, her computer, and she would minimize the screens.
*  And I'm like, well, got to figure out what the hell is going on.
*  So put a key logger on her system as any
*  anybody should in a relationship.
*  Absolutely. Because you trust them.
*  Yeah. Why not?
*  You should be tracking all their movements, all their.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  I guess that was the control freak, too.
*  It's romantic. So I found out she had been cheating on me.
*  And she was.
*  See, here you go. They had a reason.
*  Bad reason. I justified.
*  So I found out she's cheating on me.
*  She was asleep when I found it out.
*  And I sat there looking at and I was like, well, shit.
*  So got up, walked in the bedroom, opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out,
*  started putting her clothes in it.
*  And she wakes up. She's like, where are you going?
*  I'm like, I'm not. You are.
*  Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly. I.
*  Took about a week of both of us crying and arguing and everything else.
*  And she she finally left.
*  And I went through this depression.
*  I went I was in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  I would just walk around the house, kind of stumbling in a daze.
*  Realized I was getting suicidal and was smart enough to do something about it.
*  And picked up the phone book.
*  And that's where there's always a sense of humor.
*  So I picked up the phone, but I'm going through the yellow pages.
*  I'm like, psychologist, criminal psychologist, because I need that
*  to call the psychologist crying to her and crying on the phone, told her everything.
*  I'm this criminal. This is what's happened.
*  She's like, come in now.
*  So I go in, spill my guts and.
*  Saw her for about four months and I joke about it.
*  It's true she she was trying to get me to stop breaking the law
*  and to go into real estate.
*  And I remember telling her, is there a difference?
*  She was like, yes, there's a difference.
*  So sorry for about four months.
*  I was I was 34.
*  I didn't start drinking until I was 34.
*  I had never done drugs, anything else like that,
*  because my mom was an addict as well.
*  So I was this guy I always wanted to be in control, didn't want to, you know,
*  lose control of myself and had never been to strip club.
*  So one night I was getting lonely.
*  So I walked into the strip club.
*  Actually, I was researched the strip club.
*  It was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  Joe's Roundup, little bitty hole in the wall stuff.
*  I was. Yeah, real classy.
*  So I walked in and I'm literally that guy, man,
*  that fell in love with the first, the first stripper that he sees.
*  She walks by, I'm like, that one.
*  So I didn't know. I didn't know the strip club game.
*  Again, criminal, naive as hell.
*  So belly up at the bar,
*  order the beer. I'm sitting there drinking it.
*  She comes over to me.
*  And we start talking and she's like, would you like to get a bottle of champagne?
*  I was like, does that mean going in back or what?
*  She's like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle going back.
*  I was like, sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.
*  Four hundred dollar bottle of Corbell.
*  Like, all right.
*  That again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.
*  I get back there and we talk for two hours.
*  And nowadays I understand that most men who go to strip clubs,
*  the strippers are their therapist most of the time.
*  All right. So I'm sitting there talking, we're talking.
*  And of course, she's she's sizing me up.
*  She's looking at the watch. She's like, what kind of car you drive?
*  Everything else. And I'm like telling her and talking.
*  And so at the end of the night, I'm like, really nice to meet you.
*  She's like, it's so nice meeting you too.
*  So I leave.
*  You guys just talked and just talked and there's no dancing feeling of love and all that.
*  Yeah. So just talk. Just got along pretty good.
*  I'm like, I like her. I like her.
*  So come back in a week later, walk in and call her over.
*  And I was like, look, I said, I'm not.
*  I said, that was my first time to strip club.
*  I said, don't know. I like you.
*  I'd like to know you more. Would you like to go out to dinner?
*  And she was like, yeah.
*  I was like, where would you like to go?
*  So she says, rude to John.
*  And I was like, don't know what it is.
*  That's where we'll go.
*  So I go back and I was, I had a theater buddy at that point in time,
*  because I was trying to get my life.
*  Yeah. Trying to get my life together.
*  JC was his name.
*  And I was like, I got a date.
*  He's like, he got a date.
*  I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.
*  He's like, okay, where are you going?
*  I was like, rude to John.
*  And he's like, take your wallet.
*  I'm like, yeah.
*  He's like, take your wallet.
*  It's like, all right.
*  So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.
*  And I get to where I really like her.
*  She's, I was 34.
*  She was 23 and got along really well.
*  Listen, had common interest in music and arts and stuff like that.
*  She had, I mean, it's stereotypical.
*  She was, she had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.
*  Yeah. So I was like, all right.
*  So, so yeah, you just fell in love.
*  Yeah. We, we, we got along really well, really well.
*  So I ended up moving her in with me.
*  She hadn't quit her job and what was happening was she was working weekends
*  and, you know, the club would close at three or four.
*  She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.
*  And most of the time it would be a phone call saying, come and pick me up.
*  I can't drive home.
*  And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.
*  My mom, Valium and pod and things like that.
*  But as far as interacting with her, I'd never done anything like that.
*  By this point in time, I'm kind of getting head over heels with her.
*  I've moved her in with me and everything.
*  And I had never, I was 34.
*  I'd never went through a woman's purse in my entire life.
*  And so she comes in, passes out.
*  And I'm like, I got to know what the fuck's going on.
*  And went over and went through a purse, found cocaine and, you know, the straw,
*  cut off straws and all that stuff.
*  And I'm like, broke my heart.
*  I just sat there and started crying, got online and I'm the guy that can find information.
*  So I started looking for forums on strip clubs, found a forum.
*  I found that one, found where it was talking about her prostituting herself to support the habit.
*  And that got me, man.
*  That got me, it's talking about everything she was doing to do that.
*  Pete Slauson And that broke your heart there.
*  John Larkin Oh, man. Yeah.
*  So, I didn't have the heart to tell her that I knew she was a prostitute.
*  But I went to her and I was like, she was waking up and I was like,
*  look, I found this in your purse.
*  I can't have that.
*  And she's like, well, you think I'm prostituting?
*  I was like, no, no, I don't think that.
*  I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.
*  And I was like, I can't have that.
*  Well, I don't do that.
*  It's just a one time thing.
*  I was like, all right.
*  So, she went back to work and continued to do it for a couple more weeks.
*  And then finally, I was like, I can't.
*  So, I picked her up one morning.
*  It was like, she was, she was, couldn't drive home.
*  Before I picked her up, I had written her a note, left it on the pillow.
*  So, I brought her home, tucked her in the bed and
*  told her I'd be back that night.
*  I told her she had a letter when she woke up and woke up and the letter was basically,
*  you know, I love you.
*  If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back.
*  And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night and
*  she had quit her job.
*  She had quit her job.
*  And she quit drugs that night.
*  Really quit.
*  And I got it in my head
*  that I needed to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back to that.
*  That became, to me, because of my background, that meant spending a lot of money.
*  And so, every night was, you know, three to $600 for dinner.
*  It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week, all that.
*  I had most of my money laundered out to, to Estonia.
*  And Elizabeth, at the same time, she had, she quit, but she didn't want me to go anywhere.
*  All right.
*  She wanted me there all the time.
*  I guess that was that connection.
*  You know, she, I guess she was scared.
*  She might go back to something.
*  So, Shadow Crew, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they
*  gets busted.
*  I start, I go through basically all my US funds.
*  Can't get anything from overseas.
*  Shadow Crew gets busted in October.
*  I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.
*  Can't go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew's been busted.
*  I don't know who to trust online.
*  I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks to get money in trying to make it until,
*  you know, I can start back with some other fraud and lying to her the entire time.
*  She knows about none of this.
*  None of it.
*  None of it.
*  And she's got, she thinks I've got a shitload of money and she's got expensive taste.
*  So, and at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.
*  I mean, the girl loved me.
*  That's the first time I've really said that.
*  So there's a deep love there, both ways.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Things we do.
*  So,
*  she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.
*  I mean, just shit, stone cold drunk.
*  And I, you know, I said, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.
*  I'd rather have that than cocaine.
*  So, that was the intimacy there.
*  And I kept, I had this,
*  I kept thinking if I continued to invest, that it would work out.
*  You know, that just keep going.
*  She'll be all right.
*  We'll be all right.
*  And what happens is, is, like I said, she thought I had money.
*  She thought I had money.
*  She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.
*  So I said, we can get married.
*  You know, I figured a marriage.
*  Sure that I love her.
*  Sure.
*  It's going to be all right.
*  So I was like, oh, let's get married.
*  She's like, wow, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.
*  She doesn't have money to buy the Tiffany ring because all my money was overseas.
*  So here I am.
*  I defraud.
*  So it's counterfeit cashiers.
*  I find a, like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand and, uh, pay for it with a
*  counterfeit cashier's check at the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave.
*  She needs me there.
*  Typically, if you're doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.
*  You can't do it in one central area because you're going to be identified pretty quickly.
*  I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.
*  So, uh, start running counterfeit cashier's checks to get the money to, to live and
*  everything and get the, uh, get the engagement ring.
*  We were, uh, scheduled to be married.
*  Our wedding date was February 26th, 2005, February 8th, 2005.
*  I'm, uh, I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of them coming in and I get arrested
*  in Charleston, South Carolina.
*  And she didn't know.
*  I told her, I said, I've got to go pay for it.
*  I said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  She didn't know.
*  I told her, I said, I've got to go pick up those rings.
*  She didn't, she thought I was just having them sent in.
*  So I had to get those rings.
*  I said, we'll go out to dinner after that.
*  And, uh, I left at like eight o'clock in the morning
*  and I was arrested at, uh, I think 1130, something like that.
*  Of course I wanted to call her, you know, and, uh, the FBI got me.
*  It turns out it was, it was controlled delivery.
*  There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.
*  FBI got me in Charleston PD got me within 45 minutes.
*  The secret service comes in, takes over that investigation.
*  They knew exactly who they had.
*  Well, I'm about seven o'clock at night.
*  They're like, we want to search your house.
*  And I was like, look, I'll sign off on the search if you let me go with you
*  so I can see her and, uh, they were like, okay.
*  So I got to see my phone at that point.
*  Had like 140 calls that, uh, she, where she had been trying to call all that time.
*  She has worried.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, so they load me up and hell, I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars,
*  you know, 40 agents, everything else.
*  She's got a dog at that point.
*  I'm scared they want to shoot the dog.
*  And, uh, uh, it was dark and they had me walk up and they're all behind me.
*  I knock on the door and tell her the police are there and she needs to put the dog up.
*  So she does.
*  And, uh, they come in and just start ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me down,
*  start berating her with questions.
*  She had no idea what the hell was going on.
*  Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?
*  Yeah, I was trying to tell her.
*  And at the same time they're there, they take a watch off her wrist.
*  They let her keep the ring.
*  They're telling her that I'm this guy.
*  What's my real name?
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across the cross.
*  So she's probably terrified.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, I tell her, I was like, look, they're going to rain me tomorrow.
*  Don't come.
*  Don't come.
*  I said, uh, see what's going on, but don't show up.
*  Of course she's there.
*  That's more heard her dad.
*  And she's, she's back in the back crying.
*  They're reading off the charges.
*  I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else.
*  And, uh, that's it.
*  I, they throw me in a cell.
*  Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in, you know, and, uh, it's like 10,
*  12 charges a day at that point.
*  And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right.
*  And, uh, does it get through?
*  So I spent three months in jail and during that three months, she visits twice.
*  I get like three or four phone calls to her.
*  Um, I understand looking back now, I understand why, you know, back then it
*  was like, I'm the victim, you know, why doesn't she talk to me?
*  But, uh, you know, now I understand why the girl loved me too.
*  You know, and then she found out I was this piece of shit.
*  And, uh, after a week in county jail, two agents fly in from New Jersey,
*  two secret service guys pulled me out of cell, looked at me and they were like,
*  we've got your laptop.
*  And I was like, yeah.
*  And, uh, he's like, well, if you've got anything on your laptop, I was like,
*  yeah, he's like, you're going to be charged for it.
*  I was like, I figured.
*  And then he looks at me, he's like, uh, can you do anything for us?
*  And I told him my exact words were, look, you let me get back with Elizabeth.
*  I'll do whatever you want me to do.
*  And he looks at me, he's like, we're going to get you out.
*  I was like, all right.
*  So they let me sit there for three months to get a taste of it and, uh, get me out.
*  My sister, they have the bond reduced to a thousand dollars.
*  My sister pays the thousand dollar bond.
*  By this point, she's disowned me and because I'm dating the stripper and, uh,
*  Denise bonds me out.
*  The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.
*  I'm out.
*  And, uh, she's like, I'll be there.
*  I was like, okay.
*  So, uh, this, uh, like 11 o'clock at night, um, I'm in the parking lot of the
*  Charleston police, the Charleston County jail, me and a secret service agent standing there.
*  And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.
*  So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk, gets these two plastic containers out
*  that have my clothes in them, drops off the pavement, comes over, hugs me, call me later,
*  gets in the car, drives off.
*  I'm sitting there crying like a baby agent looks at me.
*  Is that your fiance?
*  I'm like, yeah.
*  And he's like, I am so sorry.
*  And I'm like, yeah.
*  I had, uh, she sounds fascinating.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Pull up in a limo.
*  I had $30 to my name at that point.
*  $30.
*  The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.
*  So he drops me off at for paying for the hotel room, buy me something to eat.
*  Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30, walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card.
*  So I can start back in tax fraud.
*  So as I get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth, beg her to come see me.
*  She comes to see me and we talk most of the night and, uh, convince her to give me a chance.
*  I tell her that I, hey, everything's going to be all right.
*  They're going to hire me.
*  I'm going to be this big consultant.
*  Lies, lies, just so she'd get back with me.
*  And, uh, she's like, okay.
*  And, uh, so we moved from, uh, from Charleston, the field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.
*  And, uh, I'm breaking the law.
*  Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.
*  And, uh, so they've got me in the office, the field office, they got this big war room in there.
*  I'm on a laptop outside line, laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.
*  They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me outside line to secret service offices,
*  officers in the room at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.
*  My job is four to six hours a day surfing the web, picking up targets, Intel, teaching them how
*  cyber crime operates, everything else like that for the first two weeks.
*  They are extremely diligent.
*  They pay attention to everything that's going on, ask questions, everything else.
*  But the problem is, is that that shit gets boring real quick because I'm,
*  I'm very fast online doing that.
*  So they're, they're like, what the hell is he doing?
*  And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.
*  So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored and they start watching porn
*  instead of watching me at the same time, they've got a key logger and they've got,
*  they've got specter pro and Camtasia key loggers and taking snapshots of everything that I'm doing.
*  Every night it goes on a DVD, ROM on a spindle.
*  So I'm like, they're not going to go through that shit.
*  So I'm like, fuck it, start breaking law from inside secret service offices
*  while they're in the room.
*  Why not?
*  That continues for 10 months.
*  At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth fell apart.
*  Completely fell apart.
*  Do you have an understanding of why it's just because of the,
*  her heart got broken because there was lying.
*  It was the trust.
*  Like she did a lot to sacrifice for the, the
*  Relation.
*  You've got, you got a woman there that
*  she had even said it.
*  She was like,
*  she had told one of her friends, we were out having dinner one night.
*  And this is before I got arrested.
*  She told one of her friends that I was the only guy
*  that ever asked her to stop using drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I have to say that that that part of the story is so, it's so powerful
*  and then that she chose to do it and she chose to stop.
*  And she told me that there was one instance, she told me that if she,
*  if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married.
*  And as far as I know, she's never been married.
*  And so it started to fall apart there.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I was that piece of shit.
*  Still, you didn't take a step, by the way, can I just say
*  how just moving it is, how honest you are, but thank you.
*  Thank you for being that person.
*  But at that time, you, there's still that line.
*  Oh man.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's falling apart.
*  She had, she wants to start going to strip clubs and I'm like, fuck it.
*  Why not?
*  Let her, we'll go.
*  So we started going to strip clubs and she's, you know, she'll come back
*  and begin wasting, we'll have sex, what have you.
*  And one night she looks at me and she was like,
*  she was like, I think it'd be funny if you got a blowjob from somebody else.
*  And that got me, that got me.
*  I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.
*  I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore or anything else like that.
*  We've been going to strip clubs.
*  So I started dating another stripper and she knew something was going on.
*  And she looks at me one day and she's like, why don't you just tell me that it's over?
*  And I looked at her and I said, it's over.
*  We're done.
*  And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want, we were renting an apartment.
*  I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.
*  And I said, not only that, but
*  I'll make sure you got money for several months so you're all right.
*  And I was like, just leave me, you know, leave my TV and leave,
*  leave me some, some plates and stuff.
*  So I go to work that day at the secret service, come back that night
*  she's taken everything and left a picture of herself in the bedroom.
*  I'm like, okay, I guess I deserve that.
*  He's got, I like her.
*  She's got
*  I'm giving her a thousand dollars like every two weeks for some shit like this.
*  And it gets to the point because I'm doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.
*  Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.
*  They start to realize that, Hey, some son of a bitch is stealing money
*  using our debit card.
*  So they start to shut down the cards before I can pull cash out.
*  So I start not to have the money to send to her.
*  And I'm like, so she calls and she's like, look, I have to have money.
*  And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can.
*  You promised money.
*  I was like, look, if you knew what I was doing to get this money, you wouldn't be asking that.
*  And she's like, I need money.
*  My rent's behind by a month right now.
*  And I'm like, your rent's behind.
*  She's like, yeah.
*  So I was like, okay.
*  So I pick up the phone, call the rental office.
*  And I was like, just want to make sure that, you know, I'm sorry.
*  I'm behind on the rent for this apartment number.
*  Oh no, that rent's paid up three months.
*  It's like, okay.
*  Hang up, call Elizabeth back.
*  I was like, you're behind on the rent.
*  And she was like, yeah.
*  And I was like, funny.
*  They just said you're up on it three months.
*  And then she gets quiet and she's like, well, you lied to me too.
*  And I was like, you're right.
*  I did.
*  I did that.
*  I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore.
*  And that's the last time I spoke to her.
*  Right there.
*  What happens is, I was breaking law from inside the offices.
*  I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.
*  I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.
*  I told Sean, I go missing, right?
*  I go missing for three months.
*  I told him if I ever went missing, not to contact me.
*  And so I go missing.
*  Then I show back up online.
*  First day he contacts.
*  So he becomes a target.
*  And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.
*  He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.
*  That's when he's said to be arrested.
*  Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.
*  Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.
*  So Secret Service goes and goes and arrest this guy.
*  They search his apartment and don't find anything.
*  The apartment manager comes out and explains to him how Sean has done all kinds of work
*  to the apartment.
*  As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile to put in the apartment
*  that he's renting.
*  And by the way, last night he had a U-Haul out here and took out a whole shitload of stuff.
*  Secret Service comes back in.
*  They look at me and they're like, we need you to take a polygraph.
*  And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.
*  So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail if you don't.
*  I was like, call my lawyer.
*  Lawyer gets me on the phone.
*  He's like, you don't have to take the polygraph.
*  I was like, well, good.
*  I'm not going to.
*  He's like, but they will throw you back in jail.
*  I was like, don't want to do that.
*  He's like, have you done anything?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  I was like, let's take the polygraph.
*  They asked three questions.
*  The questions were, have you talked to anybody?
*  Have you been on computer outside of the offices?
*  Have you talked to the press, which I was interviewing with a New York Times writer
*  the entire time?
*  And then have you contacted or warned anybody about investigations?
*  And I filled polygraph completely.
*  So they revoked the bond.
*  Take me back down to Charleston County, throw me into jail.
*  Three days later, Secret Service shows back up and pull me out of a cell.
*  It's Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.
*  And they were, I mean, honestly, they were good men and they gave me chances upon chances
*  to do the right thing.
*  And I was not ready to do that.
*  And Jim Ramacone and Bobby's in there and Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.
*  I mean, truly was.
*  Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to have lunch with the man and I told him
*  I was sorry for everything I did to him because I got him and him and another agent fired.
*  And I told him I was sorry for what happened.
*  And he told me then he's like, we were your friends, man.
*  We were truly your friends.
*  So they were good.
*  They wanted to help.
*  Yeah.
*  They wanted you to be a good man.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And what got me so damn bad is I told him, I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better
*  guy.
*  And he's like, Brett, you always were a good guy.
*  You just didn't know it.
*  And people like that.
*  We need people like that in this world.
*  Yeah.
*  You need somebody to basically believe that you can be a good man.
*  So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.
*  He's the second in charge in South Carolina.
*  He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?
*  And he looks at me.
*  He's like, I'm playing hard ass.
*  Bobby's over here looking distraught and, you know, like a hurt dog.
*  And Jim's like, here's the way this is going to work.
*  He said, you're going to tell me everything you've done the past six years or I'm going
*  to make it my mission in life to fuck over you and your family.
*  And he said, not just this case.
*  Once you get out of prison, I'll hound you the rest of your life.
*  Then he slides the Miranda waiver over and he's like, now you want to talk.
*  And I looked at him.
*  I was like, nope.
*  It was like he gets up, gets all red in the face storms out as on the way out.
*  He's like, fuck you very much.
*  So I go back to the cell a week later.
*  I was on only under, under a state charges a week later judge rules.
*  They revoke the bond improperly.
*  Wow.
*  Oh, reinstates the bond.
*  Nobody calls the secret service to tell him I walk out.
*  I walk out.
*  I was dating this stripper and I told my mom, I was like, well, if they're going to fuck me,
*  they're going to have to find me.
*  I'll see you soon on the move.
*  Yeah.
*  I called this stripper girl up.
*  I'd given her like 60 K, some bullshit like that.
*  And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.
*  And she was like, what?
*  I was like, look, I said, give me a thousand dollars.
*  I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.
*  She was like, okay.
*  So I met her in Augusta, Georgia and got the thousand from her and started driving west on I-20.
*  No idea where to go to anything else.
*  Got to Dallas.
*  There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.
*  Went in, walked in the office, convinced the guy, social engineering, convinced the guy to
*  give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver's license, without payment, anything else he did.
*  And that started the run.
*  I ended up stealing from that.
*  I stole like 160 K profit, used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.
*  And the idea was to steal enough money to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil and set up shop down there
*  do it again.
*  That was the dream.
*  That was it.
*  That was it.
*  So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.
*  I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.
*  One day I had stolen the night before I had stolen 160 K out of ATMs.
*  Went in the next morning, I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com, which was run by Max Butler,
*  the Iceman.
*  And there's my name, U.S. Most Wanted on it.
*  And that gets your attention.
*  That was my real name with the U.S. Most Wanted beside of it.
*  Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.
*  But then they did.
*  And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service,
*  Operation Anglerfish, everything else.
*  So of course they're all like, they're all like, everybody's after like, oh yeah, we're going to
*  get this son of a bitch.
*  So I sat there looking at it and I was like, said it out loud.
*  I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you've made the United States Most Wanted list.
*  What do you do now?
*  And I was like, I'm going to Disney World.
*  Literally, literally, literally said that out loud.
*  So loaded up the Jeep, drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida.
*  And got the two annual passes, one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios,
*  paid for a timeshare.
*  They were building these new timeshares right off of Universal Drive, building these brand new
*  timeshares, paid for a timeshare, nine months cash.
*  I was like, we take cash.
*  Yeah, we take cash.
*  There's $12,900.
*  Then it wasn't furnished.
*  So I went down to a furniture store, bought $30,000 in furniture.
*  They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth 30 grand, bought that back,
*  and proceeded to go to Disney World every day.
*  And that lasted about six weeks.
*  They used a trigger fish is what they use nowadays.
*  It's called a stingray to find me.
*  So one day I was, it was like 10 30 in the morning on Saturday, September 16th was the day, 2006.
*  Yeah, 2006, September 16th.
*  I was used to the builders coming around knocking, making sure everything was all right.
*  So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door and get up, look through the keyhole.
*  Nobody's there.
*  You know, people, nobody's there.
*  I was like, huh, open the door, step out into the hallway, walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,
*  another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.
*  And they turn around.
*  They're like, Hey, Brett.
*  I'm like, Hey, Bobby, how are you?
*  And it's like, we're good.
*  How are you?
*  And I'm like, I'm fine.
*  Would you like to come in?
*  He was like, let's put you in cuffs first.
*  And I was like, that's probably a good idea.
*  He walks in like those guys.
*  He was like, have you got anything in here?
*  And I was like, yeah, there was $120,000 in the bedroom.
*  And he was like, seriously?
*  I was like, yeah, that and an AK 47.
*  His face goes white.
*  He's like, you've got a rifle.
*  And I was like, no, I'm kidding with you.
*  He was like, he was like, okay.
*  So they throw me in jail in Orange County and they give me diesel therapy.
*  And diesel therapy is it took like two weeks to transport me from Orange County, Orlando
*  to Columbia, South Carolina.
*  And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail you possibly can go through the
*  processing, which is about six hours.
*  Once you get to your bunk, Hey, time to transport you.
*  They, they do that on purpose.
*  On purpose, on purpose.
*  It wears you down mentally and physically and everything.
*  I get to Columbia, South Carolina.
*  Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is this inmate, because we were in federal
*  holding this inmate, he looks at me, his name was Yeti.
*  And he's like, Hey man, you know, the only time you get off in federal prison is the
*  drug program.
*  I was like, well, man, I don't use drugs.
*  And he's like, you can find a drug problem, catch you.
*  And I was like, I can find a drug problem.
*  So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at on the way to Columbia, I tell them
*  I'm alcoholic and cocaine.
*  So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina, they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson
*  requesting help for drugs.
*  I had hired Strom Thurman's son as an attorney.
*  They make me drop him because I paid for him with illegal funds.
*  So they give me a public defender.
*  He gets a psychological evaluation order for me.
*  So psychologist comes into county jail, four hour interview, about halfway through.
*  He looks at me, he's like, using any type of drugs?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He's like, what do you use?
*  Cocaine, smoke or snort?
*  Snort.
*  How much?
*  An eight ball a day.
*  That's a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have any trouble out of that?
*  Yeah.
*  I can't get an erection.
*  And he looks at me and I'm looking at him like,
*  because I had gotten that from boogie nights.
*  Finally, I'm like, is that right?
*  It could happen.
*  I was like, okay.
*  That makes it into my pre-sentence report.
*  So all federal inmates, probation office and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check
*  to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.
*  So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.
*  So day of interview, I mean, day of sentencing, I'd pled guilty, day of sentencing,
*  the prosecutor, he stands up and this dude is screaming at this point.
*  And he's like, Mr. Johnson's manipulated the Secret Service.
*  He's manipulated the prosecutor.
*  Then he points at the judge and he's manipulating you today, your honor.
*  We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.
*  Well, I've been telling everybody in the jail that if they give me any more than 60 months,
*  I am not staying.
*  We're like, okay, sure.
*  So the judge looks at me and she's like, I agree.
*  I'm like, she says 75 months.
*  So I looked at my lawyer and I was like, can you get the drug program for me?
*  He's like, I don't know how I'll ask.
*  So he stands up.
*  Your honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?
*  The judge says no.
*  But I'll recommend he gets evaluated.
*  So the Secret Service had told her, hey, he's full of shit.
*  So she's like, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.
*  I looked at my lawyer and I was like, what does that mean?
*  He was like, you're probably not going to get it.
*  And I was like, how soon can you get me to the camp?
*  And he was like, well, if you don't appeal, I can get you there pretty quick.
*  My exact words were, fuck the appeal, get me to the camp.
*  I'll take it from there.
*  He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.
*  I get sent to, because you can get a camp recommended.
*  I have friends, family members look for camps that don't have a fence around them.
*  And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.
*  Six weeks later, I'm in Ashland, Kentucky and pull up there, 14-foot fence, razor wire on top.
*  And I'm like, I don't climb fences.
*  So I go in.
*  First question I ask is, are there any jobs outside of the fence?
*  And he was like, guards like, well, you can't climb fences.
*  You can work in the national forest.
*  And I'm like, no, I'll die out there.
*  He was like, well, you could do landscaping.
*  I'm like, I could run a weed eater.
*  Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office and the cop, this is this, this genius
*  of some of these people and institutions, the cop behind his desk, the entire wall
*  is a blown up photo of the compound and the outline area.
*  So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.
*  All right.
*  My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years and he shows up at my sentencing
*  and stands up in front of the judge.
*  He's like, your honor, I want to make sure Brett gets a good start.
*  He can live with me when he gets out.
*  Everything else.
*  Looking back, the man meant that.
*  And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.
*  So he starts to visit me in prison.
*  I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.
*  And about the third visit in, he looks at me, he's like, I've been reading about you
*  online.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He's like, yeah.
*  He's like, that's a lot of money you made.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He's like, you think you can teach somebody how to do that?
*  And I'm like, so what I used to say, and again, that it's this thing of, you know,
*  really coming to terms with things.
*  What I used to say was, is I thought my dad was back in my life.
*  And he was just trying to use me.
*  All right.
*  The truth of the matter was, is that my dad hadn't really seen me, except in that frame
*  of crime.
*  You know, being that criminal with my mom, everything else.
*  I really think that's how the man was trying to communicate with me.
*  He wanted to connect with you in the places where you know, where you love, where you're
*  interested in, where your addiction is, essentially.
*  And what I did is I manipulated the man in helping me escape.
*  So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.
*  And in return, he had the only money he had to his name.
*  He had $4,000 cash.
*  So I manipulated him and he given me that and to drop me off a change of clothes, a
*  cell phone, and a driver's license.
*  The only driver's license he had was my driver's license, Brett Johnson.
*  So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks.
*  And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.
*  At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside with a broom, sweeping off the
*  mountain.
*  I'm like, yeah, we'll do that.
*  Absolutely.
*  So building trust with the guys there.
*  Working my ass off.
*  Yeah.
*  And then six weeks, I take off and I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something
*  like that.
*  US Marshals, I made it a hundred.
*  Take off, you escaped.
*  Yes, escaped, escaped.
*  US Marshals, they're canvassing a three state area.
*  They find me, I think 250 miles away.
*  It's like Lexington, Kentucky.
*  They found me in Lexington because I had to use my real driver's license.
*  I had a laptop.
*  I had prepaid debit cards and I had stolen identity information.
*  And kind of what the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.
*  You know, I had this deep tan.
*  I didn't look anything like myself.
*  And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.
*  I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.
*  He walks by the window and he stops and then he backs up.
*  He looks inside.
*  He knocks on the window.
*  I look up at him.
*  He's like, you.
*  I was like, me?
*  He's like, you.
*  Then he pulls out this badge and he points at, he's like, and then he points at the door
*  now.
*  So I was like, oh, okay.
*  So I opened up the door.
*  He's like US Marshals Service.
*  So they arrest me.
*  How did they track you down?
*  They canvassed that area.
*  They talked to every hotel, everything else.
*  It's like a traditional like there was a track.
*  Please.
*  That's what it was.
*  So it wasn't like from the internet.
*  They kind of got something.
*  Just straight.
*  The US Marshals are outstanding.
*  Everything they do.
*  So they arrest me.
*  I go to a, I'm initially held at a county jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.
*  And that was one hell of an experience there.
*  But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.
*  So sentencing, here's the weird thing.
*  So I spent like, I think two or three months at the county jail in Moorhead, Kentucky,
*  get sentenced at my sentencing.
*  It happened so quickly after the initial sentencing that they use the exact same
*  pre-sentence report.
*  The report that's got all that drug shit in there.
*  So I'm a sentencing prosecutors, air secret services, air judge me and my attorney
*  prosecutor stands up.
*  Prosecutor stands up.
*  He's like, your honor, we would like it if you would consider that when Mr.
*  Johnson was arrested, he had a laptop.
*  He had all this information with him.
*  Looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again.
*  Judge looks at the prosecutor says, no, says, hey, if you were going to charge him with
*  it, you should have charged him with it.
*  I'm only considering the escape.
*  Then he looks at me and he's like, Mr.
*  Johnson, he said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right now,
*  you're really saving yourself a pretty serious charge.
*  And my response was, yes, your honor.
*  And he was like, then he opens up the pre-sentence report.
*  He's fingering through it.
*  He's like, it also looks like before you got involved with all these drugs,
*  you were a pretty good citizen.
*  I was like, yes, your honor.
*  And he's like, so here's what I'm going to do.
*  He said, I'm going to give you 18 months on the escape.
*  I was like, okay.
*  He said, I'm also going to give you 15 months on the escape.
*  I'm going to give you 15 months on the escape.
*  He said, and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.
*  I was like, yes, your honor.
*  So the drug program gives you a year off and it gives you six months and halfway house.
*  So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier than what I should have gotten out of.
*  So the original thing about drugs worked in the long-term.
*  Now, the interesting thing with that, and this was the best lie I ever told.
*  Honestly, the best lie I ever told.
*  I spent eight months in solitary confinement.
*  Eight months.
*  And that's an experience.
*  Because you ain't got no books for the first month or so.
*  Then they give you a King James Bible.
*  Yeah.
*  And then-
*  For a month, no books.
*  This is a pretty small-
*  Six by nine room.
*  Six by nine.
*  No books.
*  No books, no paper, no pen.
*  No pencils.
*  You're alone with your mind.
*  You got a mat, a toilet.
*  What's that like?
*  You sleep as much as you can.
*  You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.
*  What about, were you thinking about even just going back to like Elizabeth?
*  You go through all that.
*  The whole thing?
*  All that.
*  Every bit.
*  Your mom too?
*  Yeah.
*  Going through every single bit of that.
*  So you're supposed to get out an hour a day.
*  Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.
*  That's the law.
*  That's not the way things actually happen.
*  What actually happens is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.
*  You take a shower twice a week and that's it.
*  You got a phone call once a month.
*  Oh, so you don't get to see nature.
*  Don't see anything.
*  You're getting solitary.
*  All right.
*  And it takes about a week.
*  The first week is the roughest.
*  You're bouncing off the walls that first week because you can't sleep,
*  can't do anything else.
*  Then you start to adapt to it after a while.
*  When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.
*  I'm well versed in the King James Bible.
*  So you're happy to have it.
*  Then finally, you get other books that come in from that point.
*  Spent eight months of that and they send me out to a real prison.
*  Big Spring, Texas.
*  West Texas.
*  Where…
*  Have you been out there?
*  No.
*  Man.
*  But I can tell.
*  Prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.
*  No kidding.
*  It gets so hot that warnings come on the radio telling you not to drive on certain
*  streets because they're melted.
*  That's Big Spring.
*  So if you've seen the movie From Dusk Till Dawn, the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.
*  That was hot.
*  Yeah, very hot.
*  So and that's where I find out what a real prison is.
*  And it's not ran by guards.
*  Prisons are ran by inmates.
*  That's a fact.
*  You're met at the door by whatever race you are is what happens.
*  So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.
*  It's a disciplinary prison.
*  So you get the bad guys are in there.
*  I go through processing and I'm walking up to the unit and I'm met at the door
*  by a guy named Nick Sandifer.
*  He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.
*  And first question out of his mouth is any more white guys come in and I didn't know.
*  I was like, I don't know, four or five.
*  Next question is what are you in here for?
*  My answer was because I got no worries.
*  My answer was computer crime.
*  Smiled at him.
*  It turns out wrong thing to say because computer crime is not credit card theft or hacking or any
*  bullshit like that.
*  Computer crime in prison is child pornography.
*  So tell him that he looks at me like I'm a piece of shit goes and gets his buddies.
*  They circle around.
*  What are you in here for?
*  I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has like lines.
*  They're like, oh yeah, this is this child porn.
*  That's it.
*  That's the bad guy.
*  They circle rather like what'd you say you're in here for?
*  So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to them.
*  They're like, you know, you tell a good story.
*  You still said this.
*  Now computer crime basically really does mean usually child pornography.
*  In prison.
*  Yeah.
*  And what you see and that's one of the things you find out that the guys that are going in
*  there for child porn, they will tell them it's credit card theft.
*  So yeah.
*  Right.
*  They've learned.
*  So I'm that guy.
*  You also don't, I mean, for people who are just listening to this, you don't exactly
*  look like a typical computer hacker.
*  That's true.
*  That's true.
*  That's very true.
*  But I don't look like the pedophile either.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  But it's like, it doesn't make it seem like you're, I mean, I guess you're not wearing
*  a hoodie and you're, you're not like emo dark.
*  The way it actually works in prison, they won't attack you until they know.
*  All right.
*  So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison, you don't get transported
*  with paperwork because of that.
*  So they have to see paperwork or a guard will tell them what you're in there for.
*  Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.
*  So none of the guards told them that was anything.
*  So for the first month, they think I am, but they're not doing anything because they
*  don't know for sure.
*  At the end of the first month, I'd been talking to Kevin Poulsen over at Wired Magazine about
*  Max Butler.
*  He does an article about that shows up in Wired Magazine.
*  So at the end of the first month, Wired Magazine hits compound front cover, all the
*  story you would think you would think it saved me.
*  So I'm reading the article really happy about it.
*  That's so what happens is, is four o'clock is mail call four clocks of standup count
*  nationwide after four o'clock is your mail call.
*  They hand out all the mail for the day.
*  So the mail comes, I get the magazine.
*  I'm like reading through it.
*  I'm like, well, shit, I'm good to go.
*  Then it says Brett Johnson secret service informant in the article.
*  So you're now a snitch.
*  Which is right up there with the pedophiles.
*  We go to dinner after that at dinner.
*  You can hear it.
*  You can hear the chat.
*  We got a snitch.
*  Warden next day shuts down the entire compound calls me into his office.
*  They got security there.
*  You got the counselors there and everything else.
*  Warden looks at me.
*  He's like, did you give an interview to Wired Magazine?
*  I'm like, yeah.
*  He's like, do you not know they will kill you in here?
*  I was like, he was like, do you feel safe?
*  Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe, they transport you.
*  Transport you means another eight months in solitary confinement.
*  You start to see shit in solitary after a while.
*  So I'm like, no, not going to do that.
*  So I'm like, completely safe.
*  He was like, look, he's like, if anybody says anything to you,
*  immediately come to us because they'll fucking kill you.
*  So they do a locker search, try to confiscate the magazines.
*  They can't.
*  The next day I walk into the unit.
*  There's Nick Sander for laying on his bunk magazine, wide open reading it.
*  I'm like, oh shit.
*  Walked up to him.
*  I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?
*  He's like, oh, doing some reading.
*  I was like, anything interesting?
*  He's like, it's getting there.
*  I was like, let me save you the trouble.
*  Take the magazine, turn over the page.
*  I was like, right there is what you're looking for.
*  He was like, man, I already knew.
*  I was like, do we have a problem?
*  And he looks at me.
*  He's like, is anyone on the compound you told on?
*  I was like, no.
*  He's like, until someone gets here, you snitched on.
*  We're okay.
*  I was like, okay.
*  He's like, but I need you to do something for me.
*  All right.
*  So in federal prison, you got to have a job.
*  Everybody works.
*  Doesn't matter what you do, but you got to work.
*  I got a job in education teaching a lit class.
*  Every Wednesday, six to eight, 30 PM lit and had all every area on the compound
*  signs up for the lit class, had a couple of guards every now and then popped in.
*  And did we teach lit?
*  No, we taught fraud every Wednesday, six to eight, 30 PM.
*  That's how I didn't get my ass beaten.
*  And my other job, I had two jobs with them.
*  The other job you get to the point.
*  It's weird, man.
*  You get to the point.
*  People walking off the bus.
*  You know, immediately two groups of people, you know, who the bank robbers are immediately
*  just by them walking off the bus.
*  You're like that motherfuckers are bank robber and you know, who the pedophiles are immediately.
*  So my job as the, as the white guy was to approach the white pedophiles and have a conversation.
*  And the conversation was basically, Hey, don't know what you're in here for.
*  Don't care what you're in here for.
*  But if you got some sort of fucked up charge, you need to tell me.
*  If you tell me everything's going to be all right.
*  If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there.
*  If you start to associate with them or they start to talk to you and then they find out
*  you're in here on something, they're going to kill you.
*  And what are the things pedophile?
*  Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children, harms women, anything like that.
*  There, there, there are, it's like the mob, there's rules, there's, there's an ethical code.
*  Even if you have the division between races on all that, you still have this, these lines drawn.
*  And what that looks hierarchy to very, very much.
*  So what that looks like in prison, depending on the, uh, it depends on the security
*  class that you're in, what, what, what level prison, but at that prison, what that looked like
*  was, you're not allowed to talk to anybody.
*  You're not allowed to watch television.
*  You can go to the library.
*  You don't associate with anyone except your own type.
*  If you do anything like this, we will kill you.
*  If we, if someone wants to extort you, we will do that too.
*  And you won't tell on us or we'll kill you.
*  So that's, that's the way that works at that point.
*  And everybody quickly lowers this.
*  Quickly, quickly.
*  And, uh, so typically the guys would say, I just want to do my own time.
*  That would be the line.
*  And it's like, okay, don't mess with him.
*  All right.
*  Um, every now and then you'd have somebody lie and that would come with those types of
*  consequences.
*  Uh, I got to see, uh, while I was there, I saw two people murdered, saw, went through
*  three prison riots and through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.
*  The people who got killed, it was, uh, so we had an outside, you had this track, a
*  third of a mile track.
*  You walk it counterclockwise and inside of the track, you got two handball courts.
*  So of an evening that happened both times, you would all of us would be walking, you
*  know, doing our exercises.
*  And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds, you'd see all the inmates start to
*  migrate down toward the gate.
*  So the first time you see that, you see that migration, you look up in the distance
*  and this other one inmates got another inmate down and he's just hammering his head
*  right into the pavement like that right there.
*  Well, guards don't stop that because the guard may get hurt.
*  So a guard is 15 minutes coming out to stop that until everything's over.
*  By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.
*  They shut the compound down and this is what happens.
*  So you shut the entire compound down.
*  They make two lines of the inmates and what happens is the inmate walks into a room.
*  They shut the door behind the inmate guard, ask him two questions.
*  First question is, did you see anything?
*  The answer is no.
*  Second question is, if you had seen anything, would you say anything?
*  Answer is no.
*  Guard then says, get the fuck out.
*  And that's it.
*  Anybody that stays in any longer than that is automatically suspect.
*  So there was one incident.
*  I remember this Hispanic guy, he's in there for a few minutes and everybody's like,
*  what's going on?
*  So his people then call him over, explain to us what went on.
*  Yeah.
*  And it happens like that.
*  It's fascinating that because you talked about the network of trust
*  in the cyber crime community and here's a network of trust.
*  Absolutely.
*  In the prison crime community.
*  Absolutely.
*  Trust.
*  Trust matters.
*  Trust drives everything at the end of the day.
*  The riots that I went through, the first riot, man, you're scared to death.
*  Scared to death.
*  You know, you've got the cops dressed up in the Ninja Turtle outfits.
*  You've got the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters, all that crap.
*  You got the inmates that are raising hell scared to death.
*  The second riot, you calm down.
*  Second riot, you start to notice this is a racial riot.
*  This is typically, and almost always, it's Hispanics and African-Americans.
*  So you get to detect what is the motivation for the riot, what is the reason,
*  and that gives you some calm.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So the second riot, you start to notice this.
*  Hey, man, this ain't me.
*  This ain't our group.
*  Third riot, no shit.
*  Third riot, you lay in your bunk.
*  You let them wage war all around you.
*  And every now and then you have an inmate that will run up to you
*  and they'll point to a locker and say, is that your locker?
*  And if you tell them yes, they leave it alone.
*  If you say it's not my locker, they'll break into it,
*  steal everything out of it and go from there.
*  And that's what happens.
*  So you did your time for five years.
*  Five and a half.
*  You made it out.
*  Made it out.
*  I went through, I told you it was a good lie that I told.
*  I went through the residential drug abuse program.
*  It's a nine-month intensive therapy.
*  And the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring, he bought this.
*  He wanted inmates to be educated.
*  He was a really good guy.
*  So he wanted inmates to be educated.
*  He got a discount on a game theory class set.
*  So he gets all these discs and everything.
*  And he's, he's asking, does anybody on the compound know anything about game theory?
*  And somebody says, if anybody does, it'll be Brett Johnson.
*  He comes up to me one day at my buggy.
*  He's like, are you Brett Johnson?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He was like, do you know anything about game theory?
*  And I was like, yes, I do.
*  So I start rattling off prisoners dilemma and everything else.
*  He's like, will you teach a class?
*  So I start teaching that.
*  I start teaching inmates public speaking and to make friends with this counselor.
*  So I get, it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out to this drug program
*  that they only had in Fort Worth.
*  And the transfers are taking like four or five months.
*  That's four or five months.
*  I could be out free.
*  So I walked, I went up to him one day and I was like, look, his name was Keely.
*  I was like, look, man, I said, is there any way that I can get transferred out any sooner?
*  And he looks at me, he's like, Brett, I cannot help you.
*  And I was like, I appreciate that.
*  Thank you so much for even trying.
*  So he said that a week later, I'm on a bus by going to Fort Worth.
*  So he got to Fort Worth.
*  I got it.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  So it was a nine month program, 24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.
*  Had nothing to do with drugs.
*  It was all pure, pure study stuff and CBT training.
*  And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen.
*  Truly is.
*  That part, what was the thing that changed you as a man?
*  Is it the solitary confinement?
*  Was it the years?
*  Was it losing the people you loved?
*  Or was it that behavioral therapy?
*  It's a combination, man.
*  It's a combination.
*  It was, so my sister disowns me.
*  The only person I had in my life.
*  Me and my sister, that's it.
*  I loved Elizabeth.
*  I love my wife now.
*  But it's me and my sister, we went through all that shit together.
*  So Denise disowns me.
*  She doesn't talk to me for an entire year when all this stuff happens.
*  And after I get arrested on the escape, she ends up driving seven hours to come see me
*  to tell me she loves me.
*  And I don't see her again for five and a half years.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's really the first turnaround.
*  Took me two and a half years in prison to accept responsibility.
*  That was amazing that she did that.
*  Yeah.
*  She drove down.
*  Yeah.
*  She did that.
*  She's something.
*  She's something.
*  She saw me for 10 minutes, tell me she loves me, and then I don't see her again.
*  Lanted the seed.
*  But yeah, you had time to think over those years.
*  It took two and a half years to realize that I didn't commit crime because of stripper
*  girlfriends or wives or family.
*  I committed it because I wanted to, chose to.
*  And that's the first turnaround.
*  Second turnaround is like the CBT training.
*  You know that it didn't, it didn't really hit while I was in prison.
*  You know, I went through it and they ingrained it in you, but until you choose to make it
*  work, it doesn't work.
*  So I got out in 2011, didn't want to break the law, did not.
*  And I was under three years probation, couldn't touch a computer.
*  I had a job offer from Deloitte to run a cyber crime office in the UK, which that was a no.
*  You're not moving and that's a computer idiot.
*  So then had a job offer from Know Before, a fishing company.
*  Couldn't take that.
*  Got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.
*  That's a computer.
*  Can't touch that.
*  Okay.
*  Then what about a waiter's position?
*  Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards.
*  Idiot.
*  Can't touch that either.
*  So literally could not get a job.
*  Could not.
*  Doing food stamps.
*  I had a roommate that, uh, paying half the rent.
*  They tell you when you leave prison to, uh, to get a job and something you care about
*  and you won't recidivate.
*  Couldn't get a job.
*  And what I had was a cat and monster the cat.
*  That was a cat's name.
*  And, uh, I had to have enough money to feed that little guy and didn't have money to buy
*  toilet paper for the apartment.
*  So, uh, there's a, I was on Panama city beach.
*  How long were you living like this?
*  It was a steady decline because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.
*  So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.
*  And then from there, it's like, what the fuck do you do?
*  So I didn't want to go into computer crime at all.
*  And, um, I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.
*  Shoplifting toilet paper.
*  Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.
*  So about the same time I had a friend that, uh, this guy, I, I've been dating the same
*  type of women I had been dating, you know, these unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.
*  Yes.
*  Love.
*  Yeah.
*  That's how that works.
*  So I had a friend post, uh, an ad for me on plenty of fish and, uh, this woman responds,
*  my wife, she responds and the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures,
*  you know, the serious like, yeah, right there.
*  She sends me a message of why aren't you smiling?
*  And my response was that is my happy face.
*  So we start talking and, uh, we started dating and she ends up, she's that second saving thing,
*  man.
*  She, uh, I ended up moving in with her.
*  I was going broke.
*  I was about to get kicked out of the apartment, everything else.
*  And she didn't say it, but I think she knew it and, uh,
*  moved in with her.
*  And I got a job and the job I got my probation officer and let me have a cell phone.
*  I was going through Craig's list.
*  This guy was advertising for landscaping, called him up.
*  His name was Dustin Doremus, called him up and he was like, come on down and talk to me.
*  So he was running this business.
*  Him and his brother were out of his house.
*  So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.
*  He looks at me.
*  He's like, can I ask you a question?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He was like, are you on the run or something?
*  So I'm like, no, why?
*  And he was like, well, you just don't look like the kind of guy that do this.
*  So I told him, I was like, this is who I am.
*  I'm done.
*  And, uh, he looks at me.
*  He's like, man, I got to think about that.
*  So he, um, he tells me to go on home.
*  That was a Friday, Sunday evening.
*  He gives me a call and he was like, Brett, he's like, if I hire you, will you actually work?
*  And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you'll give me a job, I promise I'll work my ass off.
*  And he's like, show up six o'clock.
*  I was like, all right.
*  So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day,
*  five days a week for $400 a week.
*  And, uh, busted my ass.
*  I hit it so hard.
*  I would, uh, I'd come in of a night and pass out, wake up the next morning and hit it again.
*  And, uh, it got to the point.
*  He ended up, uh, this dude ended up offering me to come in a partner with his business.
*  His brother dropped out and he, uh, by that point I've not learned everything on the business
*  and everything.
*  He was like, uh, you know, if you'd like to come in, I'll cut you in half.
*  And I was like, Dustin, I, I can't do it man.
*  Cause I wasn't making any money.
*  He didn't want to pay me anymore until he was able to do more.
*  And, uh, I thought I found another job doing something else.
*  And in a speech, I say it got cold in the grass, started to stop growing.
*  The truth of the matter was, is I thought I found another job.
*  Uh, guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week doing the, uh, sales for, uh, uh, oil rig training
*  was what it was.
*  And, uh, I accepted the job.
*  I quit working for Dustin and the guy, uh, I told him before he even offered me the job,
*  I told him what, you know, my criminal history, cause I was required to do that.
*  So I was supposed to start work.
*  Well, he calls me and tells me he can't hire me.
*  So I'm out of work and Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point.
*  So I can't go back with him.
*  And, uh, I'm that guy again, man.
*  I, it's important for me to, uh, to show value in a relationship.
*  All right.
*  So, uh, Michelle was only one working.
*  I'm like, I gotta do something.
*  And, uh, I get it in my head.
*  I was like, you know, if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house.
*  She was only making that.
*  I think she was, she was, I mean, we were had it hard, you know, it was just her, her working.
*  And, uh, I was like, nothing else, I can bring food in the house
*  and get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards, start ordering food.
*  Well, it gets worse than that.
*  It, uh, you know, she's got two sons there.
*  So I'm like, well, they need clothes.
*  So he started stealing clothes and it continues like that.
*  I get arrested.
*  I get arrested, uh, on a food order and, um, Michelle didn't know what I was doing.
*  So she, uh, she had been to work and she was coming back from work.
*  I get arrested and I'm like, uh, they let me make a phone call and I call her and I
*  said, I come to the police station.
*  I've been arrested and, uh, she shows up and, uh, she didn't know I'd been doing that.
*  My probation officer, of course, he didn't know or anything else.
*  Um, at my sentencing for that probation officer was there, prosecutor, the judge,
*  U S marshals, Michelle and me, Michelle stands up and she tells the judge that
*  I'm a better dad to her kids than their actual father is.
*  And, uh, but at point I'm crying.
*  Probation officer stands up and he was like, uh, we think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.
*  We think this is a one-time thing.
*  Prosecutor says the same thing.
*  Judge sentences, sentences me to one year.
*  Probation officer stands back up and he was like, uh, Mr. Johnson, the judge, if you
*  can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day, he can get the good time and get back to his
*  family center.
*  So the judge amends a sentence to a year and a day.
*  So I served 10 months.
*  They sent me back to Texas and that's when I find out that, uh, Michelle didn't need
*  me for what I could give her.
*  She just wanted me for me that entire time.
*  She stands by me the entire time.
*  I do my 10 months, get out.
*  We get married after that and they kill probation so I can touch a computer and they
*  tell you, they tell you, they were like, you know, inmates, a felon, if nothing else,
*  he can sell cars.
*  Well, it turns out you can't.
*  You can sell cars.
*  If you're a drug dealer, if you're the guy that steals all the money and people's
*  information, no, no, you can't get a job selling cars.
*  So can't get a job.
*  Cannot.
*  And, uh, to this day, like, I know what my, what my triggers are.
*  I know what it would take to get me back into committing crime.
*  And I knew I'd go so far at that point.
*  So I looked at Michelle and I was like, let me see what I can do.
*  Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop named Keith Milar,
*  out of the Pittsburgh office.
*  He was involved with my arrest and some associates and everything else and, uh,
*  sent him a message and message was, you know, Hey, I respect everything you did.
*  I'd like to be legal and, uh, dude responded within two hours, two hours.
*  He, uh, gives me references, advice, takes me in under his wing, everything else
*  like that.
*  And from that point, man, it was the head of the identity theft council did
*  the same thing.
*  Um, Cardinal present group hires me to speak.
*  Microsoft hires me to, uh, consult with them and they're like, Hey, I'm
*  going to get you a job.
*  I'm going to get you a job.
*  Microsoft hires me to, uh, consult with them and the Microsoft hire established
*  enough trust in the industry that, uh, I was all right from that point.
*  So now you're helping in many ways fight the very guy that you used to be.
*  So big picture advice.
*  What, given that you were that guy, how do we fight cyber crime today?
*  And then the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, what advice do you
*  have to individuals, the companies, to governments of what, and also to, uh,
*  Elizabeth, like the humans, human beings that love that live that are friends
*  with cyber criminals.
*  There's so many lessons to really be had.
*  From that, you know, to me, the lesson, what the, one of the big lessons to me is,
*  is, uh, you can't serve two masters.
*  You know, if you're, uh, if you're that guy that is committing crime or that
*  person that's addicted or you're, um, you're in love with somebody that's
*  addicted or has that, they don't love you.
*  They love that addiction that comes first.
*  It's always going to come first.
*  So you have to realize that you have to know when to, uh,
*  got to know when to cut somebody off, when to end something, that, that knowing
*  that they're not going to change until they decide to change.
*  At the same time, you got to realize that the only reason I was able to turn my
*  life around is because people took that chance on me.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that's really the only reason.
*  They believe that there's a good person in there.
*  Yeah.
*  If, if, if Milarzki hadn't responded, if I hadn't had my sister, my wife, these
*  companies that, that initially gave me that chance, my ass would be back in
*  prison for 20 years.
*  I have no doubt about that at all.
*  All right.
*  So you have to realize that, um, you know, cyber crime, a lot of companies
*  that I've talked to, they don't really understand the, or appreciate the, uh,
*  that networking aspect, that, that trust aspect of how criminals establish
*  trust with each other, how they work together.
*  A lot of companies think that it's a single player that's out victimizing
*  them. And when you really break down how cyber crime operates, that you've got a
*  group of individuals that are working together to hit you, but not only hit you,
*  but they share and exchange information freely.
*  You know, companies don't do that.
*  You've got privacy concerns, you've got competitive edge concerns, everything
*  else. Companies don't share information across the board like, like criminals do.
*  Criminals do that.
*  Um, you have to appreciate that.
*  You have to understand that, that big statistic that 90% of their
*  tax use known exploits.
*  It's not the stuff we don't know about.
*  It's the shit we do know about.
*  We're not doing anything about.
*  So the way to defend against cyber crime is like, there's a lot of low hanging
*  fruit they should fix.
*  A lot of that.
*  So a lot of basic stuff that's already vulnerabilities, update the system, security.
*  Now that doesn't take care of solar winds or CNAP or anything like that.
*  It doesn't.
*  But those instances, I mean, okay, that's a big instance, but I mean, it is.
*  But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future,
*  because there's more and more companies are coming online, becoming digital.
*  And it's just more and more and more and those vulnerabilities in terms of human
*  nature.
*  So the first social engineering and the actual outdated systems, all of it.
*  Some of it, I guess, is the, I mean, you're exceptionally good at this is
*  educating on the social engineering side is educating people and companies that
*  like you've got to do that.
*  You've got, and companies have to, you know, I made that point that they never
*  report to law enforcement.
*  That's companies and individuals.
*  You know, I've worked with fortune 50 companies that will not press charges.
*  Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal sign an NDA.
*  They'll pay them off.
*  And we won't mention this shit anymore.
*  You have to be, you have to press charges.
*  You have to report.
*  You have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group.
*  You have to be, it's that, it's that idea.
*  And I've talked about that before of understanding your place in that cyber
*  crime spectrum, the way a criminal will victimize you depends on who you are and
*  what you do as a person and as a business.
*  So you have to understand that design security around that.
*  You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there.
*  A whole lot of them are snake oil salesmen.
*  A lot of them is going to tell you that we're the one stop solution, but you're
*  not, you're not, you're a tool.
*  All right.
*  And you may have a very good tool, but it's not the only tool that's needed to
*  protect against the attacks that are out there.
*  We have to be open and honest about that kind of stuff.
*  If we're not.
*  So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.
*  It's, it's a process of just like a diversity and just constantly educating people.
*  Absolutely.
*  So it's the social side.
*  It's constantly because there's so many probably attack vectors and
*  it's the software that you have.
*  If you look at it, that's that attack surface.
*  You can't plug everything.
*  It's too damn large to plug everything, but you can do the best job you can
*  possibly do, but it takes a variety of tools to do that.
*  All right.
*  The idea and Arcos is big about that, but the idea is to take the cost of fraud to
*  the fraudster so high that they basically try to pick another target.
*  All right.
*  And that's, that's the idea that you want.
*  You want it to be not worth the criminal's time to hit your company.
*  What about white hat hacking?
*  So like, you know, hacking for good sort of testing systems and then giving
*  companies the vulnerabilities as you find them.
*  I think it's outstanding.
*  I do.
*  I think that I think pen testing white hat stuff is outstanding.
*  I truly do.
*  I think that that you have to, it has to be tempered with what is reality.
*  Well, though, all right, you know, we've got a whole industry of people who try
*  to sell our fed wallets that I don't know of many are fed hackers out there
*  on the criminal side, be honest with you.
*  Yeah.
*  So some of it is just like a psychological safety blanket.
*  That's not actually providing any protection, by the way, you wrote on
*  LinkedIn something about ID me.
*  What is it?
*  Why is it a problem?
*  I was going down a rabbit hole.
*  I was wondering if you were going to mention them.
*  You know, they lost.
*  I guess I was partially responsible for them losing an 86 million dollar contract.
*  What was the contract with the IRS?
*  So what is it?
*  So ID me is an identity.
*  Okay.
*  Backtrack.
*  I'd be me as a marketing company that wants to say they're an identity
*  verification company.
*  I just want to bring this up to see you get angry.
*  I'll tell you what my issue is.
*  Yeah.
*  My issue is.
*  It's a company that's used for authentication by the IRS, I guess.
*  Well, IRS, social security administration, VA, at one point, 23
*  state unemployment offices, a few other services.
*  So I guess the idea is that you would be able to unlock your account or get,
*  get, you know, authenticate yourself as a human being by using your face or
*  something like private information.
*  They've got a tiered system for the verification.
*  They've got, you can do, they've got a free system, which is questionable where
*  you submit an ID and it's been shown several bypasses been shown.
*  And I don't want to talk about their security horribly bad because I want to be honest,
*  there are bypasses for a lot of security systems out there.
*  The issue that I have with ID me is that their policies are somewhat questionable.
*  I don't care if you're a private company that has those policies in place, but if
*  you're a government agency and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit or a
*  service of that government agency, and then the government agency forces you to give up
*  your complete identity profile to a private company.
*  And then that private company uses that profile for marketing purposes to further
*  profit, things like that.
*  I have a huge issue with that.
*  I don't care if you're a private company that does that.
*  I just don't think the citizens need to be forced into doing that in order to get a
*  benefit or service that they're entitled to.
*  So that's, that's my big issue.
*  So that, I mean, given how much value, how much we talked about the value of identity,
*  you don't think that should be handed over lightly?
*  No, absolutely not.
*  And who would have thought that Brett Johnson would ever become a privacy advocate.
*  But here I am.
*  I mean, it's just, people don't understand or appreciate the value of who they are.
*  You know, and certainly you've got a host of companies, ID means not the only one,
*  but you've got some of these companies that say, well, we strip out the PII of the individual.
*  We're just using the biometrics and the sites they're visiting and things like that.
*  That's identity.
*  That is, you can still ping that one unique individual out of all, using that information,
*  stripping out the PII, you can still ping who that individual is.
*  So having lived a life of crime for many years, I'm sure you've connected indirectly
*  to a large number of very dangerous people.
*  Indirectly and directly.
*  Yeah.
*  But the network indirectly is even larger, right?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Are you, and I apologize for this question.
*  Are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?
*  Like having seen a world that's really dangerous in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows.
*  You know, like I said, when I, when we started Shadow Crew and started that initial
*  cyber crime business, that world, violence wasn't there.
*  It came in later.
*  Now violence is inherent in the system to do the Monty Python bit.
*  It's, it's part of it.
*  But, um, you know, the mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.
*  Cartels are part of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Drugs are inherently intertwined in cyber crime marketplaces because of the profit potential.
*  And with that comes a lot of violence as well.
*  The cartels have already brought the violence that they're good at from the 20th century.
*  Absolutely.
*  Into the technology of the 21st century.
*  Now, do I worry about that?
*  It's interesting that, that my family worries about that.
*  All right.
*  I think I may be just too involved in it to, to appreciate that type of, of danger, but,
*  my family worries about that.
*  They do.
*  Do I think it's a possibility?
*  I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.
*  I've made, I've built my trust in this industry by not being scared of calling out companies
*  and individuals and not being scared of targeting criminals or criminal groups.
*  Your honesty as a human being emotionally and intellectually is really refreshing.
*  It's a gift.
*  And thank you.
*  Thank you for doing that.
*  Is there a device you can give to young people today about life?
*  You broke many rules, all the rules.
*  Some rules should be broken.
*  So if you look at somebody young today in high school and college,
*  thinking how they can break the rules legally and live a life that's something they could
*  be really proud of, what would you say?
*  Biggest lesson I've learned.
*  You want your life to be one where you're helping people and not hurting people.
*  And that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.
*  You see the brightest minds in the United States who give up a lot of money,
*  the opportunities, a lot of money because they believe in helping people.
*  Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals, that's a hell of a lesson.
*  And I'm glad I'm there, but I would tell people out there,
*  it's fine to want money.
*  It's fine to do that.
*  It's fine to test systems.
*  It's fine to circumvent the rules if you're not breaking the law.
*  It's fine to do all that.
*  I like doing that.
*  All right.
*  But if you've got the mindset, if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people
*  and not hurting people, I think you'll be all right at the end of the day.
*  What gives you, again, given the dark web, given all the dangers out there,
*  what gives you hope about the future?
*  Looking into five, 10 years, 50 years, I mean, hope for human civilization.
*  If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,
*  what do you think would be the reason?
*  What would be the...
*  That's a damn good question.
*  Because we got a lot of bad stuff going on.
*  We've got a lot of reasons.
*  If I asked you the other question of how do you think human civilization will destroy itself,
*  I'm sure you have a lot of answers.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What gives me hope is you see people working together.
*  COVID's been a little bit different because I think too many people wanted to play politics with it.
*  That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID is it's in many ways pulled people apart.
*  I mean, because a virus involves kind of being afraid of each other because,
*  I mean, that was a scary thing.
*  People talk about pandemics in that way.
*  That you're afraid of other humans.
*  That is the most terrifying thing.
*  It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.
*  It's just that it pulls people apart.
*  And then you realize how fundamental that human connection is to human civilization.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  But you know, as human beings, we do...
*  When things really get bad, we do tend to respond and group together.
*  We do that.
*  And there's injustice.
*  Yeah.
*  We see it.
*  We rise up.
*  I wake up in the morning and I watch Fox News and CNN so I can be pissed off at everyone.
*  All right.
*  The division, the outrage, they're really feeding.
*  They want you to be angry.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what causes me to despair and what I think that we just need to...
*  Elizabeth was very good.
*  She taught me one hell of a lesson because before I met her, I was a news hound.
*  News would be on all the time, a couple channels of it.
*  And she was the woman who didn't watch the news at all.
*  And I didn't understand that back then, man.
*  But now I do.
*  You know, now I'm like, pretty smart, you know?
*  Don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is.
*  That's why I love reading history books.
*  I feel like that's the right perspective on take on modern times.
*  How will this time be written about in the history books?
*  And react to that.
*  The daily ups and downs of the outrages,
*  which is getting worse and worse in terms of how quick the turnaround is in terms of the news.
*  I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here.
*  I appreciate you talking to me.
*  I do.
*  Because I'm talking about that relationship and everything.
*  It's really been this kind of realization for me on a lot of things.
*  I really appreciate you asking those questions and everything.
*  Maybe I will talk about that.
*  I love it that you value, first of all, you're self-aware how important love is in a human
*  being's life.
*  It can make you do some of the best and some of the worst things in this world.
*  And it's good to think about that.
*  It's good to think about that.
*  That is what makes us human, is that connection and that love for each other.
*  What do you think is the meaning of life?
*  This big ridiculous question.
*  What are we all here for?
*  I don't think it is ridiculous, man.
*  To me, that meaning of life is finding out that lesson that we need to help each other.
*  You asked about security.
*  I didn't get to say that, but everybody's worried about themselves.
*  The way you solve that security problem is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.
*  That's how you solve that problem.
*  And however you take whatever journey you take to discovering that point.
*  Yeah.
*  With me, I've been asked a few times, do you regret anything?
*  Would you change anything?
*  Now, I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life, but I'm at a point in my life where
*  I like who I am and I know that I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing in my life.
*  So when I change anything, as bad as a lot of that shit has been,
*  I wouldn't.
*  It made you who you are.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole of it.
*  I mean, that's trite to say that, but it's true.
*  That's the weird thing.
*  It's true.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show.
*  What's it going to be called?
*  Because you've done a couple of podcasts.
*  You're incredibly good at this.
*  You're so good at this.
*  I've done a couple.
*  I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.
*  I had the fraud cast with a friend of mine, Carice Hendrick, and that was the first time
*  that ended because of a difference of opinion.
*  Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.
*  Yes.
*  It may have been me.
*  Then I did the Anglerfish podcast, which that was, I got to be honest with you,
*  Lex, it was completely directionless and it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.
*  So I ended that.
*  The Brett Johnson show is launching.
*  That's the new one.
*  That's the new one.
*  That's what the new one is called.
*  And you know, I-
*  What are you thinking of doing with it?
*  Making a difference for one thing, but it's going to be talking about cyber crime security,
*  helping people.
*  Interviews, solos.
*  A lot of it's going to be solo.
*  Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson show.
*  I mean, because it's going to handle crime, talk to criminals and how they turn their
*  lives around to degree as well.
*  But there's some shit I want to bitch about too.
*  Yeah.
*  So figure it out.
*  I can tell you're good at this.
*  I'm a fan already.
*  I want to listen.
*  I want to subscribe.
*  You should too.
*  You're launching it soon.
*  Soon.
*  Next week.
*  Brett, you're an incredible human being.
*  The honesty, the love.
*  I could just see how much of yourself you put out there.
*  One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.
*  Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film about cyber crime.
*  100%.
*  I could tell you're a good actor.
*  It makes perfect sense.
*  Anyway, I really, I'm deeply honored that you spent your time with me today.
*  I am too.
*  Thank you.
*  It was amazing.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brett Johnson.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from George R.R. Martin from A Clash of Kings.
*  A good act does not wash out the bad nor bad act the good.
*  Each should have its own reward.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
*  Bye.
