# Neal Stephenson: Sci-Fi, Space, Aliens, AI, VR & the Future of Humanity | Lex Fridman Podcast #240
**Lex Fridman:** [November 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAfdSak2fs8)
*  The following is a conversation with Neil Stevenson, a legendary science fiction writer
*  exploring ideas in mathematics, science, cryptography, money, linguistics, philosophy,
*  and virtual reality, from his early book, Snow Crash, to his new one called Termination Shock.
*  He doesn't just write novels. He worked at the space company Blue Origin for many years,
*  including technically being Blue Origin's first employee. He also was the chief futurist at the
*  virtual reality company Magic Leap. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check
*  out our sponsors in the description. And now here's my conversation with Neil Stevenson.
*  You write both historical fiction like World War II in Cryptonomicon and science fiction,
*  looking both into the past and the future. So let me ask, does history repeat itself?
*  In which way does it repeat itself? In which way does it not?
*  I'm afraid it repeats itself a lot. So I think human nature kind of is what it is. And so
*  we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging again and again. And so it's kind of the
*  exception rather than the rule when something new happens.
*  What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human nature?
*  Well, the standards of living life expectancy, all that have gotten incredibly better within
*  the last, particularly the last hundred years. I mean, just antibiotics, modern vaccines,
*  electrification, the internet. These are all improvements in most people's standard of living
*  and health and longevity that exceed anything that was seen before in human history. So people
*  are living longer, they're generally healthier and so on. But again, we still see a lot of the same
*  behavior patterns, some of which are not very attractive.
*  So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources. Presumably with technology,
*  you have less and less constraints on resources. So we get to maybe emphasize the better angels of
*  our nature. And in so doing, does that not potentially fundamentally alter the experience
*  that we have of life on earth? You know, until the last 10 or so years, I would have taken that view,
*  I think. But, you know, people will find ways to be divisive and angry
*  if it scratches a kind of psychological itch that they have got. And we used to look at
*  the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic collapse of Germany prior to
*  the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler, at least partially by
*  just the misery that people were living in at that time.
*  The economic collapse.
*  Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living. And that sounds
*  like a plausible explanation. But there are economic troubles now for sure. We had the bank
*  collapse in 2008. And there's stagnation in some people's standards of living. But it's hard to
*  explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years, just strictly on the basis of
*  people are poor and angry and sad. I think they want to be angry.
*  So, without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons you can draw
*  off from World War II? This singular event in human history, it seems like. And yet, as you say,
*  history rhymes at the very least.
*  Yeah. Being who I am, I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened
*  in conjunction with that war, which may not be where you want to go.
*  There are several things inside to interrupt. So one in cryptonomicon is more like the Alan
*  Turing side of things. And then there's the outside of technology. First of all, there's the tools of
*  war, which is a kind of technology. But then there's just the human nature, the nature of good and evil.
*  Yeah. Well, so one of the things that emerges from the war and from the extermination camps is
*  that we were never allowed to have illusions anymore about human nature. So you have to learn
*  that lesson to be an educated person. And you have to know that even in a supposedly enlightened,
*  civilized society, people can become monsters quite easily. So that is for sure the big takeaway.
*  So do you agree with Solzhenitsyn about the, what is it, the line between good and evil runs
*  through the heart of every man? That all of us are capable of evil?
*  Great line. Yeah. I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager,
*  because my grandfather had it in his house, because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed
*  with the Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what had
*  happened. And so he had those books lying around and I would read them. And it's a similar
*  kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war, this creation of this system of
*  camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior. To me, it's a story of how fear and
*  desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead to evil, but it's also a story of
*  bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and basically survival. You have like a man's
*  search for meaning, which is the story of a man in a concentration camp basically finding beauty
*  in life even under most extreme conditions. So to me, World War II is not necessarily
*  a bleak view of human nature. It's a little moment of evil that revealed a much bigger
*  good in humanity. So I'm not so sure that it leads me to the pessimistic view of the world,
*  the fact that somebody like Hitler could happen, the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler
*  and get excited and maybe even love the hate of the other for some moment of time.
*  I think that's, all of us are capable of that, but I think all of us also have a capacity
*  for good. And I think, I don't know what you think, but I think we have a greater desire for good
*  than evil. And it seems like that's where technology is very useful as a guide,
*  as a helping hand. Okay. Can you give me an example maybe?
*  So I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current
*  technologies. Current technologies, knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like
*  Wikipedia, and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success,
*  which is making the world's information accessible at your fingertips. That kind of technology
*  enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people want to do good is true, then letting
*  them discover all of the information out there, false information and true information, all of it,
*  and let them explore that's going to lead to a better world, to better people.
*  Futuristic technologies is, I personally, I'm actually too offline, sort of love artificial
*  intelligence. And so AI, that's an assistant, that's a guide, like a mentor to you, that you can,
*  in the way that Google search is, but smarter, where you can help send it out and say,
*  this is the direction in which I want to grow. Not authoritarian lecturing down from the algorithm
*  of telling you this is how you should grow, but almost the opposite, where you use it as
*  an assistant, a servant in your journey towards knowledge. That sounds like an easy thing,
*  but it's actually, from an AI perspective, very difficult.
*  This is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about a book that
*  essentially does that. And I've been sort of watching people try to come at the problem of
*  building that thing from different directions ever since the book came out, basically.
*  Although I haven't worked on it myself, I do get a sense of the level of difficulty
*  in realizing that goal. So that book is in the 90s, so as Google is coming to be,
*  it's essentially, not Google, but the search engine, the initial search engines,
*  which gave birth to Google, essentially, in contrast.
*  Right. Yeah, that was still in the era of AltaVista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different
*  search engines. And yeah, I'm pretty sure I had not heard of Google at that point. That would have
*  been 95, 96. I think the book came out in 94. And then, of course, the social networks followed,
*  which is another form of guidance through the space of information.
*  Yeah. Well, what happens is that these things come along and then people find ways to game them.
*  And so I saw an interesting thread the other day pointing out that 20 years ago, if you had Googled
*  Pythagorean Theorem, chances are you would have been taken directly to a page explaining
*  the Pythagorean Theorem. If you do it now, the top hits are going to be from somebody who's
*  got an angle, who's got a scheme. They're trying to sell you math tutoring or they're
*  working some kind of marketing plan on you. So the traditional engines become actually less
*  useful over time for their original educational purpose. That doesn't mean that they can't,
*  it shouldn't be replaced by newer and better ones.
*  First of all, to defend the people with the angle. Right. They're trying to find business models.
*  Yeah.
*  They're trying to find business models. Yeah.
*  Fund oftentimes, which is funny you went with Pythagorean, like you went at math,
*  those greedy bastards.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  But it's great.
*  How can we monetize the Pythagorean Theorem?
*  Well, I mean, education, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Just to figure out like people who love math education, for example, love it purely, not purely,
*  but very often love it for itself, for just teaching math. But then they start,
*  when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm, they start to try to figure
*  out, okay, how can I make money off of this? The primary goal is still that love of education,
*  but they also want to make that love of education their full-time job. But I see that sort of that
*  dance of humanity with the algorithms as it finds this kind of local pocket of optimality,
*  or sub-optimality, whatever. It gets stuck in it.
*  It's a pocket of some sort. But I see that pocket is way better than what we had before
*  in the 80s, right? Or 90s before the internet. But like, and now we're now,
*  this is also human nature. We start writing very eloquent articles about how this pocket is clearly
*  pocket is not very good. And we can imagine much better lands far beyond. But the reality is,
*  it's better than before. And now we're waiting for-
*  We have to escape from the local minimum.
*  And you have to wait either for lone geniuses or for some kind of momentum of a group of geniuses
*  that just say, enough is enough. I have an idea. This is how we get out. And it's too easy to be
*  sort of, I think, partially because you can get a lot of clicks in your articles, being cynical
*  about being in this pocket. And we are forever stuck in this pocket. And then coming up with this
*  grandiose theory that humanity has finally, it's collapsing, stuck forever like a prison in this
*  pocket. But reality, it's just clickbait articles and books until one curious ant comes up with the
*  next pocket. Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier.
*  And eventually we'll be, as you've talked about, we'll colonize the solar system and then we'll be
*  stuck in the solar system. And then people will say, well, we're screwed because when the sun
*  energy runs out, there's no way to get to the next solar system. And so on. It goes on until
*  we colonize the entirety of the observable universe. Yeah. I think getting out of the
*  solar system is going to be a hard one. So can you mention this? Can you elaborate
*  why you think back to sort of a serious question? Why do you think it's hard to get outside of our
*  solar system? It's just an energy calculus. I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want.
*  But the idea of getting there in one lifetime or multiple, a few lifetimes requires huge amounts of
*  energy to accelerate. And then as soon as you get halfway there, you need to expend an equal
*  amount of energy to decelerate or you'll just go shooting by. And so that means carrying a lot
*  of energy. And there's ideas like Uri Milner, I think is still funding the idea to use laser
*  propulsion to send something to another star system, a small object. But it'll have no way
*  to slow down as far as I know. They never talk about that part. Yeah. How do we slow down? Yeah.
*  So the quick fly by, you take a good picture, I guess. Yeah. You better take some good pictures
*  on your way by. So, and that's great if it happens, I'm not knocking it. But the amount of energy is
*  that's needed is just staggering. And there's other issues like just how do you maintain
*  an ecosystem for that long in isolation? How do you prevent people from going crazy?
*  What happens if you hit something while traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light?
*  What about sort of some combination of expanding human lifespan, but also just
*  good old fashioned stable society on a spaceship? Yeah. Yeah. The generation ship. Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, I think that's the only way it would have to keep going for a long time.
*  And they might get to where they're going and find a shitty solar system. Like we can try to
*  do some advanced survey, but I mean, if you get there and all the planets in that solar system are
*  just garbage planets, then it's kind of a big letdown for this like thousand year voyage that
*  you've just been on. So I mean, we have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay
*  between in order to survive in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with.
*  So that's such a set of bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature
*  and atmosphere and so on. So when you look at all those complications, then basically building
*  sort of exactly the environment we want out of available materials in this solar system starts
*  to look a hell of a lot better. It's hard to make an economic argument, let's say, for making that
*  journey. One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that the people who are trying to
*  build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for religious reasons.
*  I think that's the only reason that you would do it because economically it just makes more sense
*  to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect.
*  Well, isn't everything done for religious reasons? Like why do we exploration? Why do we go to the
*  moon again and do the other things? What is JFK said is because not because they're easy,
*  but because they're hard. Isn't that kind of a religious reason?
*  I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were
*  communism's greatest achievement.
*  Yeah, so the conflict between nations is a kind of...
*  Not exactly a religion, but it's what you're talking about.
*  Well, it's a struggle for meaning. I mean, and that meaning isn't found in some kind of...
*  It's hard to find meaning in mathematics. It's found in some kind of
*  in music and religion, whatever art.
*  I mean, some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to...
*  People that find meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines.
*  Nevertheless, not in the actual form of like the proving, proving some kind of thing.
*  Fair enough.
*  So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we're building
*  these kind of generation ships and just why not launch them one a year out,
*  like wandering ants out into the galaxy?
*  I have nothing against it. It's just, like I said, it's got the motivation to do it has to
*  come from some kind of spiritual or kind of non-tangible calculus.
*  So from a business model perspective, you don't think there's a business model there?
*  No, no way.
*  One of the many fascinating things you've done in your life, you were at the very beginning,
*  you were the person that convinced Jeff Bezos to start a spaceship company, a space company.
*  You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the beginning,
*  working on alternate proportional systems and at least according to Wikipedia,
*  alternate business models.
*  Yeah, I mean, to go back to the first thing you said,
*  Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required a lot of convincing.
*  He'd been thinking about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability.
*  But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work,
*  explore the corners of the space of possibilities.
*  So that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin.
*  And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years.
*  And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction
*  it's been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace
*  technologies and models to make chemical-fueled rockets for space tourism.
*  I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just an accident
*  of history. It comes out of World War II.
*  So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard.
*  But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't quite reach it and the
*  Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized. So he decides he's going to lob warheads into it with
*  rockets, which is a terrible misallocation of resources. It's a terrible idea.
*  So it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic.
*  But that's the situation that existed. So they built these rockets. That's the V2.
*  And then it's just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic bombs being developed
*  in a completely separate superweapon program. And so suddenly the existence of the bombs
*  creates a demand for rockets that didn't exist before. Because if you've got atomic bombs,
*  you need a way to deliver them. You can do it with bombers, but it's a lot better to just
*  hurl them to the other side of the world on the top of a rocket.
*  So suddenly rockets, which had gotten a boost because of Hitler's V2 program,
*  got a much bigger boost during the 50s and 60s.
*  And it is a complete, you're right, for some reason never thought of this.
*  It is an accident of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time.
*  First of all, nuclear weapons didn't have to be developed at the same time as World War II.
*  That's an accident in history. And then the fact that, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets.
*  That's an accident. Okay, that's fascinating. That's a fascinating set of coincidences.
*  Yeah. And which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way.
*  By the time these rockets are kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and so
*  devastating that nobody really wants to use them. But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a
*  couple of people in it into the socket on the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb.
*  So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war.
*  I'd love to be in a meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea.
*  It's probably a Russian. Why don't we strap a person to the rocket?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it probably was because they did it first, right? The Russians did it.
*  And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols.
*  Could be.
*  They're a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life of an
*  astronaut. Could be. Yeah. Yeah. This is basically the story of how through all of this competition
*  and because of these historical accidents, trillions of R&D dollars and rubles were put into
*  development of chemical rocket technology, which is now advanced to an incredibly high degree.
*  But there's other ways to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do.
*  That's all orbit is. It's just going really fast. And because so many nerds are obsessed with space,
*  people have been thinking about alternate schemes for as long as they've been thinking about rockets.
*  And so one of the first things that I learned, kind of trying to explore new possibilities,
*  was that I could put all of my brain power to work and be creative as I could and invent some
*  idea that I thought was new for making things go fast. And I would always find out that some guy
*  in Russia or somewhere had thought the same idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math.
*  Yeah. And so at a certain point, you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and just go
*  poking around trying to find those guys. So there's a number of ideas that we looked at.
*  Some are crazier, some are less crazy. But the direction that that company eventually took was
*  chemical rockets. Is there something you can comment on possible ideas? So first of all,
*  you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion. Yeah. So that's, I mean, you've probably heard
*  of Project Orion, which was the Freeman Dyson and some of his collaborators
*  had a scheme to power a large space vehicle by detonating atomic bombs behind it.
*  And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time was George
*  Dyson, the son of Freeman. And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old
*  film that they'd shot on a beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by
*  lumps of C4. So that was an idea. But for a private company, obtaining a large number of
*  atomic bombs was probably out of scope. So there's more of a theoretical thing. There's a
*  conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur Kantrowitz and some
*  others where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle that has a block of ice on the back
*  and the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma. And plasma is opaque
*  because it conducts. And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the laser pulse
*  and gets really hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice. And then you wait a moment
*  for that to dissipate and then you do it again. So it would just vibrate its way.
*  It sounds really violent, but Freeman said that if you were wearing rubber-soled tennis shoes
*  standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a mild vibration. So there your source of energy
*  is on the ground and you're getting higher specific impulse than you could get by burning chemicals.
*  Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr,
*  that just would heat up a heat exchanger by converging, many converging solid state lasers
*  from the ground. And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves to do that.
*  We looked at tall towers. I spent a while looking semi-seriously at giant
*  bullwhips. What's a bullwhip? Just a whip. You have them here in Texas, right?
*  Yeah, I understand. But how does that have to do with propulsion?
*  If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object
*  that can break the speed of sound. So it's unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years,
*  people with no technology have been able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound
*  just through an architectural trick. Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium
*  can do this. So that's the thing I still think about from time to time. You can use the same
*  physics to make freestanding loops of chain or other flexible materials that just kind of
*  stand up under their own physics. It's kind of awesome to imagine. So imagine using the same
*  physics of a whip but have at the end of it a spaceship.
*  Yeah, that would detach at the moment of maximum velocity.
*  Why not? Why wouldn't it?
*  So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question. It was more almost a
*  symbolic way of saying, look, there's all kinds of physics we haven't explored yet.
*  It's no more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets. It's just that more money has gone into
*  chemical rockets.
*  Can I ask you a question on propulsion that's a little bit more out there? So I don't know if
*  you've seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about UFOs, like the Tic Tac
*  aircraft.
*  I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it, but I haven't gone deep into it.
*  So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots and there's a lot of reports about objects that
*  moved in ways they haven't seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics if we consider the
*  aircraft that we have today. And so the reason I asked you that is because it kind of, to me,
*  whatever the heck it is, it's inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion.
*  If it's like secret projects from foreign nations or it's physical phenomena that we don't yet
*  understand, like ball lightning, all those kinds of things, or if it is aliens or objects from an
*  alien civilization, I most likely believe if it's an object from an alien civilization, it's got to
*  be like a really dumb drone that just got lost. It's definitely not like the pinnacle of
*  intelligence. It's like some teenagers.
*  Science fair experiment.
*  Yeah, it just flew for a few centuries out and just landed and then we humans are all really
*  excited about this wild thing. I mean, what do you think about those, first of all, the millions of
*  reports of UFOs, right? There's some psychology there that's deeply cultural, but also the
*  possibility of aliens having visited Earth.
*  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see some better pictures. For the reason I mentioned earlier,
*  having to do with the difficulty of traveling between star systems, it's really hard for me to
*  believe it's aliens. I just can't understand why you would go to all that trouble to travel
*  to transport something across light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing.
*  How is that interesting? How does that justify the trip?
*  So if you travel across those kinds of distances, you'd make a bigger splash.
*  First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be something we'd notice.
*  It's got to decelerate into our solar system unless it got here really, really, really slowly.
*  So I guess that's a possibility and just kind of snuck in.
*  So at the end, we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy.
*  You would think. So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad,
*  you know, it makes more sense in that it would explain why
*  if these things are alien technologies, they're just kind of hanging around our aircraft carriers
*  for no particular reason, like not trying to communicate.
*  Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth or are visiting Earth and we
*  wouldn't notice it at all? Oh, sure. I mean, if they've got
*  technology to get here, they've probably got technology to conceal the fact that they're
*  trying to conceal themselves. I meant more like they're not trying to conceal themselves,
*  but we're just our cognitive capabilities are like too limited and we are not thinking big enough.
*  We're looking for little green men. We're looking for things that operate at a timescale that's
*  human like, you know, it's. Yeah, no, I love thinking about ideas like that.
*  That's great science fiction novel fodder, you know, that the aliens are so different
*  that we simply don't see them. I mean, is there, you know, in terms of language,
*  do you think it would be difficult, not aliens visiting us, but traveling to other places to
*  find a common language? You've written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations.
*  How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans in terms of language
*  so we're not lost in translation? Yeah, I mean, there's different takes on
*  that depending on how biologically similar they are to us. You know, I mean, there's a school of
*  thought that says basically advanced life has to be carbon based for just reasons of chemistry.
*  So right away, if you impose that limitation, then you're kind of assuming something that's
*  starting to be biologically similar to us. So if they're about as big as we are and, you know,
*  they kind of move around in space, you know, in a physical body the way we do, then there's probably
*  a way to solve that communication problem. If they're, you know, like beings of pure energy
*  from Star Trek or something like that, then it's a different story. Well, I love thinking about that
*  kind of stuff too. I mean, this, you know, consciousness itself may be alien. I mean, it could be,
*  like you said, beings of pure energy. I think of life as just complex systems and the kind of forms
*  those complex systems can take seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we
*  see here on Earth. I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens. You're ready? This is for Twitter.
*  I'm ready. What would you expect from Twitter? Can humans have sex with aliens?
*  Nils Dielsen. You can pass. I asked the language question. Can they communicate?
*  Yeah. Can they fall in love before sex? That's how it works.
*  So which question am I answering? The sex or the love?
*  I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligence species.
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, sex can mean a lot of things. So I mean, if you're-
*  Reproduction, right?
*  In Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to really suspend your disbelief to think that
*  Spock was half Vulcan and half human, right? Because that's just not going to work DNA-wise.
*  So if by sex you mean reproductive sex, then I would say no, unless you go to a panspermia
*  kind of theory, which is that humans were seeded onto the planet as part of a galactic
*  program of some sort.
*  And then we're just returning home and hanging out with our old relatives.
*  Distant cousins, yeah. But that doesn't seem plausible. We know that humans had sex with
*  Neanderthals, with Denisovans. So you could think of them as aliens that came from our planet.
*  So that's a kind of data point, I guess. But if you broaden your definition of sex to mean any kind of
*  gratifying physical interaction, then sure.
*  Right. Dancing. And that's how we get to love. And love can take many forms.
*  Love can certainly take many forms.
*  I have to ask you, in terms of space, just looking at where Blue Origin is,
*  looking at where SpaceX is today, and maybe looking out 10, 20 years out from now,
*  are you impressed with what's happening? We just saw William Shatner go up to space.
*  Yeah, I was just watching his video this morning before I came here.
*  Are you impressed with where things stand today?
*  Yeah. I mean, SpaceX, in particular, has done things that are just unbelievable.
*  And I don't think anyone was anticipating 20 years ago, let's say, when this all started,
*  just the speed with which they'd be able to rack up these incredible achievements.
*  If you've kind of even seen a little bit of how the sausage is made and so the difficulty of
*  doing any kind of space travel, what they've achieved is just unbelievable.
*  What about maybe a question about Elon Musk, even more than Jeff Bezos? He has a very kind of
*  ambitious vision of this project that we're on as a species, of becoming a
*  multiplanetary species and becoming that quickly, as soon as possible, landing on Mars, colonizing
*  Mars. What do you think of that project? There's two questions to ask. First, the question is,
*  what do you think about the project of colonizing Mars? And second, what do you think about a human
*  being who is so unapologetically ambitious at achieving the impossible,
*  at what a lot of people would say is impossible? I think that colonizing Mars is the kind of
*  goal that's easily stated. It's catchy. It's the kind of thing that can inspire people to get
*  involved in a way that some other programs might not. So I think it's well chosen in that way.
*  I have technical questions about, there's a problem of perchlorates on the surface of Mars
*  that's going to be big trouble. And there's radiation. This is known.
*  And what about business questions? You mentioned going outside of the solar system
*  would best be done for religious reasons. What about colonizing Mars? Can you spin it into a
*  business proposition? It's hard to think of a resource that's on Mars that could be brought
*  back here cheaply enough to compete with stuff we could just dig out of the ground here or grow here.
*  So I don't know if there is a business plan for that or if it's just strictly,
*  we're going to go there and see what happens.
*  Maybe again, we need communism to get us going, to give us a reason, a little bit of the competition.
*  Well, there's plenty of people who are sufficiently excited by the colonized Mars
*  vision that they're willing to just go all in on it, even if there's not a business plan behind it.
*  So I think it's well chosen. I think it's probably the only approach to take.
*  Again, a lot of the when white people came to this continent and started colonizing it,
*  there was not a lot of coherent planning. What plans they did have turned out to be terrible
*  plans. Trying to come up with plans that extend decades into the future is a waste of time.
*  So do it for the unexplainable love of the unknown, the journey towards
*  exploring the unknown and just keep going.
*  Yeah. Well, you saw it with Shatner and his reaction to the flight yesterday.
*  He, for him, that trip was more than worth it just for these intangible reasons.
*  What did he say? I haven't watched the video yet.
*  He was trying to express the, talking a lot about the moment where suddenly you kind of
*  rise above the thin blue blanket of the atmosphere and you're up into the blackness.
*  And that had a huge impact on him. So he was kind of, I wouldn't say groping for words
*  because he was pretty eloquent, but he was trying to express his feelings about that
*  in a way that is pretty gripping to watch.
*  So you've worked on this kind of stuff. We can go back to 10 years ago. You wrote an essay
*  called innovation starvation. You worked on this kind of idea since then
*  kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically about our age today and our unwillingness to take
*  on big risky projects. So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk?
*  Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of
*  a more kind of pessimistic perspective of our age.
*  Yeah. Well, he's clearly willing to tackle big ambitious projects without a lot of
*  soul searching or trying to make up his mind. Right? It's like,
*  just go and do it.
*  Let's dig tunnels under cities. Go.
*  Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter. Step two, actually do it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, things have slowed down quite our ability to build things
*  at pace is a lot less than it was. And there's reasons for that. We're more concerned with
*  safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building some of the great
*  public's works projects of the mid 20th century. But even we're at the point now, we're even just
*  maintaining the stuff that we've got is such a huge project that we need to put big resources
*  into it and good minds into it. Or else we're going to be losing things that we take for granted.
*  Do you think that there's a lot to be done in the digital space? That's,
*  we'll mention instead of Wikipedia and knowledge. Don't you think there could be a lot of flourishing
*  in the space of innovation in terms of innovation in the digital space?
*  Yeah. I mean, I'd like to see that. I think it's where a lot of the brain power went during the
*  last couple of generations. Because people who might previously have been building rockets or
*  other kinds of sort of hard technologies ended up instead going into programming computer science,
*  which is understandable and great. We've got structural problems right now in the way social
*  media works. They're pretty severe. And so I certainly hope that we're not, 10 years from now,
*  that we're not exactly where we are today when it comes to that stuff. We need to move on.
*  The beautiful thing about problems is they show you how not to do things. And they give you
*  give opportunity to new ideas to flourish and to beat out the ideas of the old, which is a
*  dream for me in this to see new social media that beats out the ways they go. So I tend to,
*  you perhaps agree that it's impossible to do social media well.
*  Oh, not at all. I mean, I listened to your interview with Jaren a couple of weeks ago,
*  and I know Jaren and we've talked about this.
*  He went hard on me. He basically said, it's impossible.
*  It is very nice. Well, the last time I kind of paid attention to Jaren's thoughts on it,
*  he was thinking in terms of that basically there should be, you know, micro payments such that if
*  I, by clicking the like button on something, I'm essentially giving valuable intellectual property
*  to Facebook or Twitter or whatever. It's not a very large amount of IP, but it's definitely a
*  transfer of information that when they aggregate it is beneficial to them. So,
*  and now I do remember that he on his interview with you was talking about what data unions or.
*  Yeah, those are a lot of interesting ideas. But for me, the biggest disagreement
*  was in the level of cynicism. He has a distrust and cynicism towards people in Silicon Valley
*  being able to do these kinds of things. And I'm really.
*  Okay, when you have a large crowd of people that are doing things the wrong way,
*  you should nevertheless maintain optimism because what's important is to find the one person in
*  that room that's going to do things the right way. Cynicism is going to completely silence out the
*  whole room. So he was saying, I've been here a long time. I've known, you know, I just like how
*  these folks work. They think they're gods and they know the right way to do things and they will
*  tell you how to do those things. And that kind of hubris is going to always lead you astray
*  when you are the one who's engineering the algorithms. And there's a lot of deep truth to
*  that because algorithms are powerful and many people when given power do not do the best of
*  things. I mean, most, what is it, the old Lincoln line, if you want to test the man's character,
*  give him power. Yeah. Yes. But that doesn't mean that some people are not able to handle the power
*  and that some people are not able to come up with good ideas that create better social media.
*  Yeah, I didn't interpret Jaren's statements as being entirely cynical and hopeless. I mean,
*  he's definitely raising issues of concern, but he wouldn't be out writing the books that he's written
*  and talking about this stuff if he didn't think there was a way. If he didn't think there was hope.
*  Yeah. And part of it, as you probably know with Jaren, he just loves a good argument.
*  Yeah. He just loves to have a little bit of fun. Well, I have to ask you about,
*  I mean, we talked about taking all big, bold, risky ideas. So in your new book, Termination Shock,
*  it's set here in Texas. Part of it is, yeah. Yeah. Most of it. Yeah. It's a great place to set it.
*  So in it, the main character, TR, McCooligan, a Texas billionaire, oil man, and truck stop magnate
*  decides to solve climate change, to take on climate change by himself. So this is
*  an interesting philosophical exploration of how to solve climate change from a perspective
*  that's perhaps different than we've been thinking about. I wouldn't use the word solve, but let's
*  say ameliorate the temporary effects, but please. Take on. Yeah. Take on the challenge. So it's very
*  interesting, but as there's a gradual nature to this process. And I mean, just like in your book,
*  the power of innovation is something that has saved us quite a few times in history.
*  So what role does that play in this gradual process? Right. So ultimately we don't solve
*  the problem until we get the CO2 out of the atmosphere. But that is going to take a while.
*  We're still adding more. We haven't even started to reduce the amount. So there's two possibilities
*  inside to introduce the amount that we're putting in the atmosphere. And two is removing what we got
*  in the atmosphere. We have to do both. Right. And those are two different kind of
*  efforts in terms of like what's involved. Because it stays up there. So I think just last week,
*  China announced that they're going to try to level off their CO2 emissions in like 2030. So
*  2031, they'll only put as much CO2 into the atmosphere as they did in 2030,
*  which is still a lot of CO2. In 2060, they're saying will be net zero. So if everyone in the
*  world does that and the PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere by then is say 450 parts per million,
*  it'll stay at 450 parts per million until we take it out. And taking it out
*  is hard. It took us a long time. We had to empty out huge coal mines and oil reservoirs and burn
*  all that stuff. We had to chop down forests and dig up peat bogs in order to create all of that
*  CO2. And so we have to reverse all of those processes somehow in order to remove the CO2
*  and get it back down hopefully into the 200 and some parts per million range where it used to be.
*  LW So how about you get a single Texas billionaire to have a massive gun that blasts huge quantities
*  of sulfur into the upper atmosphere. That's idea number one.
*  BD This is called solar geoengineering. And we know that it's a possibility on a technical level
*  because volcanoes have been doing it forever. So many times in human history, we've seen
*  a volcanic eruption that was followed by a global cooling trend that lasted for a couple of years.
*  And one of these things happened, I think in the 60s or 70s in Indonesia. And the Australian sent
*  a plane up into the stratosphere to take some samples of the plume. And when it came back down,
*  the windscreen of the plane had sort of a deposit on it. So one of the Australian scientists licked
*  it and reported that it was painfully acid. So that was our first kind of clue that what was
*  being injected into the stratosphere was sulfur dioxide. And so we know, then Pinatubo came along
*  in the 90s and did this experiment for us. So we know that sulfur in the stratosphere, it forms
*  little spherical droplets of sulfuric acid after it combines with water. And those bounce back,
*  some of the sun's rays and reduce the amount of solar energy entering the troposphere,
*  which is where we live. So we know that it works and we also know that the stuff goes away
*  after a couple of years. So it gradually washes out. And so it's not a permanent thing. The good
*  news, bad news is, it's not permanent. So if you don't like what's happening, you can just stop
*  and wait a couple of years and you'll get back to where you started. And the bad news, if you're in
*  favor of this kind of thing, is that you have to keep doing it forever. So this guy is one of those,
*  he's read these papers, the TR, the character in the book, he knows all this. And all people who
*  are familiar with climate science kind of know this. It's a pretty well established fact. And so
*  he just decides he's going to take action unilaterally and do this. And so there's
*  different ways to get the sulfur up there, but because it's Texas, he builds the biggest gun in
*  the world. It's just six barrels pointed straight up and he begins firing shells loaded with sulfur
*  into the stratosphere. And so the book is about not so much that as how people react to his doing
*  that, what the political ramifications are around the world, because this is an extremely
*  controversial idea and not everyone's on board with it. And even if you are willing to consider
*  using a technological intervention, the fact is that it's going to have different effects on
*  different parts of the world. So some areas may suffer more negatives than positives,
*  and they're not going to be happy.
*  RG So what do you think? So in his case, in TR's case, he can get around,
*  you know, getting permission from governments. If we were to look at our,
*  us facing outside of the story, us facing climate change, where do you think the solution will come
*  from? Governments working together or from bold billionaire Texans?
*  AC I'm pretty sure that this kind of intervention is never going to emerge from Western democracies.
*  RG This kind of, sorry, government coordinate, which option one?
*  AC Solar geoengineering.
*  RG Solar geoengineering. From a government, from our, like those are, I want to sort of
*  the distinction. One is the idea, the technological idea you're talking about, but
*  two is like, who comes up with the idea and agrees on it? Governments or individuals?
*  AC Yeah, if this were to happen, I think it would be either an individual or more likely just
*  some government somewhere that just decides it's in their interests to unilaterally do this.
*  AC And you know, that's not me advocating it. It's just,
*  it's so, it would be comparatively so cheap and easy to implement the solar geoengineering scheme
*  that someone is probably going to do it once things get bad enough. But I don't think that
*  governments will, or Western governments, just because they're not, well, we've seen what happened
*  with vaccines, right? So, you know, getting people to take vaccinations or wear masks,
*  you know, has turned out to be incredibly hard, even though it might save those people's lives.
*  RG See, I blame, that's not Western. That's, I blame failure of leadership there,
*  of leaders being not coming off as authentic, not being inspiring, uniting, all those kinds of things.
*  I think that's possible. I think it's just that we've gotten, the leaders we have right now,
*  AC Aren't the right people.
*  RG Aren't the right people because we've lived through kind of a long stretch of relatively
*  comfortable times. And it feels like, unfortunate, if you just look at history, that hard times make
*  great leaders and easy times make, like, bureaucrats that are egotistical and greedy and not very
*  interesting and not very bold. AC Yeah. No, I think that's
*  fair. So, you know, we may be entering one of those interesting times, you know,
*  RG Of hardship.
*  AC In the Chinese curse sense. Yeah. So, I could be wrong, but I mean, there have been some efforts
*  to explore solar geoengineering. There was a plan to send up some balloons, high altitude balloons,
*  to take some measurements in Scandinavia that got squashed by objections from people who lived up
*  there who were just opposed to the whole program on principle. So, we'll see a lot more of that.
*  And it's going to be a hard program to advocate for just because I think people don't quite
*  understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and how far we are from even slowing
*  down the rate that we're adding more to say nothing of bringing that number down.
*  We're a long way out from that.
*  AC Do you see, in terms of portfolio of solutions, us becoming a multi-planetary species as part of
*  that? Is this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming a
*  multi-planetary species? And what percent should that be, you think?
*  RG You know, in an indirect way, maybe. I mean, you know what people will say, which is the same
*  argument that has been leveled against space exploration since the Apollo program, which is,
*  why don't we solve our problems here on Earth before we spend money going into space?
*  So, I've never been a believer in that argument. I think there could be a sense in which the new
*  perspective that could be obtained by thinking about, like if we're thinking about terraforming
*  Mars, changing its atmosphere, making it more amenable to life and survival,
*  you could see that maybe changing people's opinions about terraforming the Earth.
*  AC Yeah. There are some dangerous consequences to this particular idea of blasting software,
*  of geoengineering. What do you make of big bold ideas that are a double-edged sword?
*  Are all ideas like this, all big ideas like this, they have the potential to have
*  highly beneficial consequences and a potential to have highly destructive consequences?
*  RG I wouldn't say all. I think, you know, going back to what we were talking about earlier,
*  how technology developed in the 50s and 60s, there was a period of time there when
*  people maybe had unrealistic ideas about new technology and weren't sufficiently attentive to
*  possible downsides. There's a reason why. In the mid-20th century, we saw antibiotics,
*  we saw the polio vaccine, we saw just simple things like refrigerators in the home.
*  AC My grandmother, to her dying day, called the refrigerator the ice box
*  because when she grew up, it was a box with ice in it. So you see all that change and it's largely
*  for the benefit of people. And so if somebody comes along and says, hey, we're going to build
*  nuclear reactors to make energy or here's a new chemical called DDT that's going to kill
*  mosquitoes, then it's easy to just buy into that and not be alert to the possible downsides.
*  And of course, we know that the way that those early reactors were built and the way that the
*  supply chain was built to create the fuel and deal with the waste was poorly thought out.
*  And we're still dealing with the resulting problems at places like Hanford in the state
*  of Washington. And we know that DDT, although it did kill a lot of insects, also had terrible
*  effects on bird populations. So the kind of backlash that happened in the 70s that is still
*  kind of going on is to sort of assume that everything is a double edged sword and always
*  to look for, you know, we have to absolutely convince ourselves that the downside isn't going
*  to come back and bite us before we can adopt any new technology. And I think the people are overly
*  sensitized to that now. Yeah, it's funny, depending on the technology, people are a little bit
*  too terrified of certain technologies, like artificial intelligence is one. My sense is
*  that the things that they're afraid of aren't the things that are likely going to happen in
*  terms of negative things. It's probably impossible to predict exactly the unintended negative
*  consequences. But what's also interesting is for AI as an example, not people don't think enough
*  about the positive things. I mean, the same is true with social media is very popular now for some
*  reason, to talk about all the negative effects of social media, we've immediately forgotten
*  how incredible it is to connect across the world. There's a deep loneliness within all of us,
*  we long to connect and social media, at least in part, enables that even in its current state.
*  And all the negative things we see with social media currently are also in part just revealing
*  the basics of human nature. It didn't make us worse, it's bringing it to the surface.
*  And step one of solving a problem is bringing it to the surface. The fact that there's a division,
*  the fact that they're were easily angered and upset and all of that, the witch hunts,
*  all those kinds of things, that's human nature. And it just reveals that allowing us to now work on it,
*  it's therapy. And so that's another example of a technology that's just,
*  we're not considering the positive effects now and in the future enough of.
*  I have to ask you about, there's a million things I can ask you about, but virtual reality,
*  I got to ask you. You've thought about virtual reality, mixed reality
*  quite a bit. What are the interesting trajectories you see for the proliferation of virtual reality
*  or mixed reality in the next few years?
*  Yeah, so I was a magic leap for what, five years.
*  Five years.
*  With the best title of all time.
*  Oh, thanks. Chief Futurist?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. And so I've had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content R&D.
*  So we're trying to make content for AR, but because it's such a new medium,
*  it's more of an engineering R&D project almost than a creative.
*  Project. So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into making an AR system that runs.
*  So an AR device, if it's really going to do AR, needs to be running slam in real time.
*  And that alone is a big.
*  So for people who don't know, first of all, virtual reality is creating almost fully artificial world
*  and putting you inside it. Augmented reality AR is taking the real world and putting stuff on top
*  of that real world. And when you say slam, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to
*  sense accurately, detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct
*  the 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it. And doing that in real time,
*  presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates a pleasant experience for the human
*  perception system is, yeah, that's an engineering project.
*  Right. Yeah. Well said. And it's just one of the things that the system has to do. It's also
*  tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're looking at is.
*  It's performing all those functions and it's got to keep doing that without burning up the
*  CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast. And that's just table stakes. It's just the basic
*  functions of the operating system. And then any content that you want to add has to sit on top of
*  that. It's got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real and
*  you don't get sick. So it's an amazing thing and a magically shipped device that can do that in
*  2019. And they're about to ship the ML2, but I don't know any more about that than anyone else
*  because I don't work there anymore. Does it still, does some degree boil down to a killer app,
*  a content question? Like you said, it's kind of a wide open space. Nobody knows exactly what's
*  going to be the compelling thing. So doesn't a super compelling experience of some sort
*  alleviate some of the need for engineering perfection?
*  Well, there's a base layer of engineering that you have to have no matter what. But you're
*  certainly right that people like in the early days of video games put up with kind of low frame
*  rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having so much fun playing Doom
*  or whatever. Even Tetris. Yeah. Yeah. So for sure that's true. And so I was
*  working on consumer facing content. There was a great team in Wellington, New Zealand that made a
*  game called Dr. Groidbrod's Invaders that realized the potential of AR gaming in a way that I don't
*  think anything else has before or since. And so that was definitely the strategy until April 2020,
*  which is when the company decided to pivot to commercial industrial applications instead.
*  And I haven't seen their financial projections, but I assume they had good reasons for
*  for making that strategic decision. It just means that it's no longer necessarily targeted at
*  just end users who want to play a game or be entertained. But it's, you know.
*  That to me from a sort of a dreamer futures perspective is heartbreaking because I don't
*  know necessarily from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics, where to me,
*  the future of robotics is consumer facing. And a lot of great roboticists, Boston Dynamics and
*  companies like that are focused on sort of industrial applications.
*  Yeah.
*  Because for financial business reasons.
*  Yeah. Now I can see the parallels for sure. You know, we'll see. It was a fun project. You know,
*  we worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats, which just populated your room with
*  Baby Goats.
*  That seems like a killer app right there.
*  Well, we thought highly of the idea for sure. But because of the slam, the system knew, for example,
*  here's a table, here's a little end table. We know the heights. We know how high our animated
*  Baby Goat can jump. And so our engineers had to build a system for converting the slam
*  primitives into game engine objects that the AIs in the game could navigate around.
*  So, and that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how-to, a sample app,
*  than as a finished consumer facing.
*  You mean the Baby Goat AI? Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That seems to me like a world I could entertain myself for hours, just every day coming home to
*  see Baby Goats.
*  Yeah. I mean, it was an ambient kind of, it's not a thing that you would sit there and play like a
*  video.
*  Just life.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But now there's Baby Goats. I mean, what's the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life?
*  Exactly. It's kind of ambient.
*  They're not really helping you do anything, but it's enriching your life.
*  You can go and play fetch or something for a while if you want, but you don't have to.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling in a fictional
*  universe. The hardware is worth a look. There's still a belief, I just saw it this morning,
*  looking at Twitter, that the Magic Leap never shipped anything. But they've been, since 2019,
*  you can go to their website and buy one of these devices anytime you want to spend the money.
*  Yeah. And the new one is coming out, I think in 2022, so in a few months.
*  What do you think, looking out 50 years from now, what wins?
*  Virtual reality, augmented reality, or physical reality?
*  What wins?
*  Meaning like, what do people that have financial resources enjoy spending most of their time in?
*  Mm-hmm. I've always been a fan of AR, and it's kind of an easy answer because if you're
*  wearing an AR device and you put a bag over your head, it becomes a VR device. If you block out
*  what's really there, then all you're seeing is a VR.
*  But you are, with AR, constrained to kind of operate in something that's similar to physical
*  reality. With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds.
*  True, true. So there are still issues in those fantastical worlds with motion sickness.
*  Right? So if your body is experiencing acceleration, your inner ear,
*  that differs from what your eye thinks it's seeing, then you'll get sick,
*  unless you're a very unusual person. So it doesn't mean you can't do it. It's a constraint that
*  VR designers have to learn to work with.
*  So do you think it's possible that in the future, we're living mostly in a virtual reality world?
*  We become more and more detached from physical reality?
*  For entertainment, maybe, for certain applications. I'm personally more,
*  I mean, we have to make a distinction between what I would personally find interesting and
*  what might win in the market. So maybe some people, maybe lots of people would like to spend a huge
*  amount of time in VR. I'm personally more interested in enhancing the experience that I have
*  of the physical world, because the physical world's pretty cool. Right? There's a lot
*  to be said for moving around in the real world. Can I ask you for you personally,
*  to try to play devil's advocate or to try to construct, to imagine a VR world where you and
*  Neil Stephens wouldn't want to stay? Not because the physical world all of a sudden became really
*  bad. For some reason, you're trying to escape it. But literally, it's just more enriching. In the
*  same way, there's a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical world. Double up on
*  that glimmer for the virtual reality. Can you imagine such a world?
*  I'll give maybe an example that's a bridge, which is that I like making things. So I like
*  working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever. And
*  so I've had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program. There's many to choose from.
*  I use one called Fusion 360. And I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and create the
*  things I want to create. And it's not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time, my whole
*  field of view is occupied by this monitor that's showing me a window into a three-dimensional
*  space. I'm rotating things around. I'm imagining things. I'm making things. And so that is pretty
*  close to being in virtual reality. Does that thing have to exist for you to experience true joy? Can
*  you stay in Fusion 360 the whole time? Do you have to 3D print it and touch it?
*  Yeah. I mean, that's my game. That's what I'm up to. But it happens that if you're building
*  a virtual environment, if you're making a game level or creating a virtual set for a film or TV
*  production, the thing that you're designing in the program may never physically exist.
*  And in fact, it's preferable that it doesn't because the whole point of that is to make
*  imaginary things that you couldn't build otherwise. So I think lots of people spend a good chunk of
*  their working hours in something that's pretty close to VR. It's just that currently the output
*  device happens to be a rectangular object in front of them. You could replace that with a VR
*  headset and they'd be doing the same stuff. There's all kinds of interfaces. For example,
*  I enjoy listening to podcasts or audiobooks. Let's say actually podcasts because there's
*  intimate human connection in a podcast. It's one way, but you get to learn about the person
*  you're listening to and that's a real connection. And that's just audio. For a lot of people,
*  that's just audio. And for me, that's just audio as a fan of people. And you kind of a little bit
*  are friends with those people. Yeah. They're in your life. You're listening to them. Yeah.
*  And I mean, they're as far away from real as it gets. There's not even a visual component.
*  It's just audio, but they're as real. If I was on a desert island, my imagination,
*  this thing works pretty good in terms of imagination. It creates a very beautiful world
*  with just audio. Or even just reading books. Exactly. Reading books. Even more so with reading
*  books. Because there's certain mediums which stimulate the imagination more.
*  When you present less, the imagination works more and that can create really enriching experiences.
*  So I mean, to me, the question is, can you do some of the amazing things that make life amazing
*  in virtual worlds? It seems to me the answer there is obviously yes. Even if I, like you,
*  am attached to a lot of stuff in the physical world, I think I can very readily imagine
*  coming up with some of the same magical experiences in the virtual world where you
*  make friends and you can fall in love. Where the source of love in your life
*  is to a much greater degree inside of a virtual world. And then love means fulfillment. That
*  means happiness. That's the thing you look forward to. And not some kind of dopamine rush type of
*  love, but like long lasting friendship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just depends on what is there in
*  the way of applications, the content. And can it feed you those things? Can it give you,
*  like in my example of using the CAD program, it gives me the ability to do something I enjoy,
*  which is imagining things and making things in a particular way.
*  Can we psychoanalyze you for a second? Sure.
*  What exactly do you enjoy? Is there some component of you building the thing where you get to at
*  least a little bit share with others? Like is there a human in the loop outside of you in that picture?
*  Will anyone ever see it?
*  Right. There's a source of your enjoyment because I would argue that perhaps like the turtles all
*  the way down, when you get to the bottom turtle, it has to do with other sharing with other humans.
*  Yeah. And if you can then put those humans inside the VR world, then you start to,
*  then you can, okay, for example, you could do it in the physical world,
*  the 3D printing, but you share it in the virtual world and that's where the source of happiness is.
*  I think at least speaking for myself, I'm always thinking in terms of an audience and at some
*  level I feel like I'm doing this for someone or communicating to someone, even if there's not a
*  specific someone in mind. It could just be an abstract theoretical someone. And it's like
*  another app I spend a lot of time in is Mathematica. Okay. And when I do a Mathematica
*  notebook, if I'm trying to figure something out, I spend a lot of time typing just, my stuff is just
*  a huge blocks of text, just me thinking out loud and then some graphs and calculations and stuff.
*  Um, because to me, um, that act of, of explaining things and commenting, um,
*  helps me understand what I'm doing. And there's kind of an audience, uh, amorphous audience in
*  mind. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, most of this stuff, nobody will ever see. And yet I'm creating it as
*  if there were an audience that might read this stuff because that I have to, that's a necessary
*  constraint that helps me, um, do a better job. What's the, uh, this might be tricky question
*  to answer. What's, uh, comes to mind as a particularly beautiful thing that you're proud
*  of that you created inside Mathematica visualization wise or, uh, something that just comes to memory,
*  if it's possible to retrieve. So the, the thing I've spent the most amount of time on
*  is I got obsessed, um, a long time ago was trying to tile the globe with hexagons. Yes. And, um,
*  actual globe. Well, any spherical object. Yeah. But, but with an eye towards, uh, putting it on the
*  earth and so, uh, and have it be recursive. So you can have hexagons within hexagons,
*  which is hard because it probably a bad idea because you can't tile a hexagon with smaller
*  hexagons. They don't, they stick out. Got it. So they're, oh, they stick out. So there's a,
*  can you do some kind of fractal hexagon situation? Yeah. Yeah. So, so it's that and people who, who
*  know me, um, are always, uh, uh, now, now make fun of me for this. So they'll send me if they,
*  if they see a picture with hexagons in it, they'll like send me a link to, to, to make fun of me.
*  So as some, some of those people, Roger Pena, or I think Roger's a little above my, my level.
*  Um, it's using to put hexagons as well and tiling. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, so I did a lot of that and I
*  thought, you know, it was pretty cool, but, um, if there's some like surprisingly intractable
*  problems that keep coming up, like you, you've always got to have some pentagons. Like if you
*  start with the icosahedron, which is equilateral triangles, which is a logical place to start,
*  you can cover those with hexagons, but every vertex where, uh, where the,
*  the triangles come together is a pentagon, has to be a pentagon.
*  Oh, so it's all hexagons and then there's a pentagon at the intersections. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
*  How did you figure that out? Is that a known fact? Well, it's just, if you look at a, like,
*  just by insinuation. Yeah. So, so you can, you can't make that go away. So any system that you come
*  up with to do this has got to have this exceptions built into it for, for those 12, you could have
*  quintillions of hexagons, but you still got to have 12 pentagons somewhere. Um, so, um,
*  so I, I've blown a hell of a lot of time on, on that over the years. By the way, a lot of those
*  kind of, uh, problems are very difficult to prove something about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I think Uber did it because someone, one of my friends who, uh, uh, who, who knows of my,
*  my interest in this and who likes to, to give me a hard time, sent me a link. This is a couple
*  years ago to some code base that I think came out of Uber where they had done this.
*  You know, you break, break down the whole surface of the earth into, into little hexagons. So, um,
*  that was a real knife through the heart. Um, but I'll probably come back to it someday.
*  Is there something special about hexagons or are you interested in all kinds of tiling?
*  Uh, well, uh, I'm interested in all kinds of tiling, but I'm not,
*  I know my limitations like as a, as a math guy. Um, so hexagons are about my speed.
*  You know, just a sufficient amount of complexity. Yeah. Yeah. So, but no,
*  tiling is a really interesting problem, both two and three dimensional tiling problems are fascinating
*  and they're one of those ancient puzzles that has, um, uh, attracted brainiacs for, for centuries.
*  Let me ask you a little bit about AI. Uh, what are some likely interesting trajectories for the
*  proliferation of AI in society over the next couple of decades? Do you think about this kind of stuff?
*  I do not think about it a lot because it's a deep topic and I'm not, I don't consider myself
*  super well informed about it. And AI seems to be a term that is applied to a lot of different
*  things. So I've messed around just a tiny little bit with, with neural nets with, uh,
*  what's it called? PCA principal component analysis. So I guess I tend to think in terms of
*  granular bottom up, um, ideas rather than big picture top down. Oh God. So like very specific
*  algorithms, like how are they going to, what problem are they, are they going to solve in
*  society such date that has like a lot of big ripple effects? See, I mean, we could talk a
*  particular successful AI systems and success defined in different ways of recent years. So
*  one is language models with GPT three. Uh, most importantly, they're self supervised, meaning
*  they don't require much supervision from humans, which means they can learn by just reading a huge
*  amount of content created by humans. So read the internet and from that be able to generate text
*  and do all kinds of things like that. It's possible they have a big enough neural network. It's going
*  to be able to have conversations with humans based on just reading human language. That's an
*  interesting idea. To me, the very interesting idea that people don't think about it as AI,
*  because they're kind of dumb currently is actual embodied robots. So robotics, like Boston Dynamics,
*  I have downstairs and upstairs, uh, legged robots. Uh, you know, uh, the currently Boston Dynamics
*  robots and most legged robots, most robots period are pretty dumb. This is most of the challenges
*  have to do with the actual, first of all, the engineering of making the thing work, getting a
*  sensor suite that allows you to do it's the same thing as with magic leap, that base layer of like,
*  where is it stuff? Where am I? And, uh, what, what am I looking at? Yeah. I don't need to deeply
*  understand, uh, my surroundings at a level of like, like, uh, at a level beyond of what will hurt
*  if I run into it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But even that is hard. That's, that's hard. But the thing that
*  I think people don't, uh, in the robotics space explore enough is the human robot interaction
*  part of the, of the picture, which is how it makes humans feel, how robots make humans feel.
*  And I think that's going to have a very significant impact in, uh, in the near future in society,
*  which is the more you integrate AI systems of whatever form into society where humans are,
*  uh, in contact with them regularly. So that could be embodied robotics or that could be social media
*  algorithms. I think that has a very significant impact. And people often think like AI needs to
*  be super smart to have an impact. I think it needs to be super integrated with society to have an
*  impact and more and more that's happening, even if they're dumb. Yeah. Yeah. No, the, um, I mean,
*  I mean, a lot of my exposure to robots is, is that, uh, I'm, uh, associated with a,
*  uh, combat robotics team and I've been to a few battle bots competitions and that's not like,
*  in a lot of ways that's pretty far from the kind of robotics you're talking about. Um,
*  because the, these robots are remote controlled, they're, they're not autonomous. Um, and so,
*  um, they're, they're pretty simple, but, um, it's interesting to watch people's emotional reactions
*  to different robots. So there was one that was in the last year's season, the 2020 season called
*  rusty that, uh, was just, uh, like put together out of spare parts and it looked kind of cute
*  and it became this huge crowd favorite because you could see it was made of like salad bowls and,
*  you know, random pieces of hardware that this guy had like scavenged from his farm.
*  And so immediately people kind of fell in love with this one particular robot,
*  whereas they might, uh, other robots might be like the bad guy in a,
*  you know, if you think of professional wrestling, you know, the heel and the baby face. So people do
*  for reasons that are hard to understand, form these emotional reactions.
*  It was formed narratives in the same way we do when we meet human beings would tell stories
*  about these objects and they can be intelligent and they can be biological or they can be
*  in almost, almost close to inanimate objects. And that to me is kind of fascinating. And, um,
*  if robots choose to lean into that, it creates an interesting world.
*  If they start using feedback loops to make themselves cuter,
*  not just cuter, but everything that humans do. Let's not, let's, let's, let's, let's,
*  let's not speak harshly robots. Humans do the same thing.
*  No, I didn't. It wasn't, wasn't meaning it in a, but you're right. Humans based on feedback
*  will change their appearance. Yes. They're dressed on Instagram all the time. How do I look cuter?
*  That's the fundamental question I asked myself. Yeah. So why wouldn't, why wouldn't a robot want
*  to, it's like, Oh wow. People, people really don't like the, you know, quad mount machine gun,
*  you know, on top of my turret. Maybe I should get rid of that. And that would, you know,
*  people would feel more at ease or lean into it. Yeah. Proud of it. Yeah. Uh, like, uh,
*  you won't take my gun, whatever the saying is from my, uh, dead cold hands. Um, I mean,
*  their, their personality, adding personality such that you can start to heal. You can start to weave
*  narratives. I think that's a fascinating place where there's this feedback loop. Like you said,
*  where AI, when it's, especially when it's embodied puts a mirror to ourselves,
*  just like other humans are our close friends. They kind of teach us about ourselves.
*  And we teach each other and through that process grow close. And to me, it's so fascinating to,
*  to expand the space of deep meaningful interactions beyond just humans
*  that, um, that's the opportunity I see with, uh, with robots and with AI systems.
*  And that's why I don't like my biggest problem. Social media algorithms is the lack of transparency
*  is not the existence of the algorithms. It's, uh, well, there's this many things. One is the data,
*  data should be controlled by the individual, by people themselves. So, uh, but also the lack of
*  transparency and how the algorithms work and change your perception of what's real. Yeah.
*  In hidden ways. Yeah. In hidden ways. Yeah. Like you should be aware, just like when you take,
*  I don't know, if you take psychedelics, you should be aware that you took the psychedelics.
*  It shouldn't be a surprise. Yeah. And second, you should, I mean, uh, become a student and a scholar
*  and there should be research done. There should be open conversation about how your perception is
*  changed and you, and then you are become your own guide in this world of altered perception
*  because arguably none of it is real. You get to choose the flavor of real. Um, I mean,
*  this is something you explore, uh, quite a bit. Do you, um, yourself think that there is
*  a bottom to it where there is reality, there's a base layer of reality that physics can explore
*  and our human perception sort of layer stuff. Is there, is there, let's go to Plato. Is there such
*  a thing as truth? I lean towards the platonic view of things. So I believe that mathematical objects
*  haven't a reality that it's not all made up by, by human minds. Um, and I don't know where that
*  reality comes from. I can't explain it, but, but I do think that mathematical objects are discovered
*  and not invented. Um, the, um, I, I, I did a lot of, not a lot, but I did some,
*  some reading of Husserl, uh, when I was writing anathem. Um, and he's a,
*  you know, 20th century phenomenologist and he's writing in the, he's writing at the same time as,
*  as scientists are starting to understand atoms and, and becoming aware that, um,
*  that when we look at this table, it's really just a slab of almost entirely vacuum.
*  And there's a very sparse, uh, arrangement of tiny, tiny little particles there, um,
*  occupying that space that interact with each other in such a way that, uh, our brains
*  perceive this object. Um, so that's kind of, kind of the beginnings of phenomenology. Um, and, um,
*  and his stuff is pretty hard to, um, hard to read. Uh, it, you really have to take it in small bites,
*  and go a little bit at a time. Uh, but he's trying to come to grips with these,
*  with these kinds of questions. How did you come to grips with it? Like why, why does this table
*  feel solid? Well, I mean, we're an evolved system that there's, we have biological advantages in,
*  in knowing where solid objects are. So we've got this system in our head that, um,
*  that integrates our perceptions into this coherent view of things. Um,
*  that one of the take homes that I, I like from Husserl is the idea of intersubjectivity and the
*  idea that the fundamental requirement for us to stay sane is for us to share our perceptions
*  and have them ratified by other, they don't even have to be people, but, um, that, you know,
*  that, you know, a prisoner in solitary confinement might, um, domesticate a mouse or even
*  insects, uh, because they perceive the same things that the prisoner perceives. Um, and, uh, and so
*  convince, convince him that he's not just hallucinating. Yeah. There's a, the,
*  establish a consensus. Yeah. But see, that doesn't mean it's any of it is real. You just establish a
*  consensus. It, uh, it could be very, uh, very distant from something that, um,
*  something that's real in, in, um, engineering sense of real, like that you could build it
*  using physics. Well, I think that, uh, you know, a valuable application for an AI robot would be just
*  to do nothing except that. It just, um, so, um, consensus, it just sits there. Yeah. And if,
*  if you hear a door slam, you might turn to, to see what it is. If the robot at the same time turns
*  to look at the door slam, it's ratifying your perception. But isn't that the basis of love
*  is when the door slams, you both look, but for deeper things?
*  You both hear the same music and others don't. I mean, isn't that what they mean? Yeah. That's
*  by love. I mean, depth of human connection. Yeah. Like that's or not. You, you, you, you
*  arrive at similar reactions, uh, without having to, to explicitly communicate it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But we could start with a, uh, a robot that listens explicitly for the slam doors. Yeah.
*  But no, I've, I've, uh, I can think of, so an example of this is, you know, uh,
*  when I, when I went to college, you know, we'd be sitting at the cafeteria, uh, you know, a bunch of
*  people, you know, eating our dinner together that, uh, we had just met, let's say, you know, um, so,
*  um, a bunch of new people in your life. And, um, and someone might make a funny remark or a not so
*  funny remark or, um, something would happen. And you might then at that moment make eye contact
*  with someone you didn't know at the other end of the table. And in that moment you would realize
*  this person is reacting, this person heard what I heard. They're reacting the way I reacted. Yeah.
*  Nobody else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened, but random stranger
*  down there and I, we have this connection. Yeah. And then you build on that. So then
*  the next time something happens, you automatically look at your new friend and they look back at you
*  and before you know it, you know, you're, you're hanging out together because you know, you've
*  already established without even talking to each other that, uh, you're on the same wavelength.
*  Yeah. It's seemingly so simple, but so powerful that it's establishing that you're on the same
*  wavelength at some level. There's no reason why you and a toaster can't have that. I'm just saying.
*  Does this smell burned to you?
*  Exactly. I think it's burnt. If a toaster could just say that to you. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Cryptonomicon published in 1999 set in the late nineties and involves hackers who build
*  essentially cryptocurrency Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008.
*  So I have to kind of ask, uh, from you looking at this
*  layout of what's been happening in cryptocurrency, uh, the evolution of this technology, how has it
*  rolled out differently than you could have imagined in two ways. One, the technology itself
*  and two, the human side of things, the human stories of the hackers and the financial folks
*  and the powerful and the powerless, the human side of things. Yeah. Well, Cryptonomicon is pre
*  Bitcoin. It's pre Satoshi. It's pre blockchain, as you point out. So, um, at that point, uh, I was
*  kind of reacting to what I was seeing among people like the Bay area, cipher punks in Berkeley.
*  There was some, some, there was a branch here in Austin as well. Um, and a lot of their
*  thinking was so based on the idea that you would have to have a physical, uh, region of the earth
*  that was free of government interference. You couldn't achieve that freedom by purely mathematical
*  means on the network. You actually had to have, you know, a room somewhere with servers in it,
*  servers in it, um, that, uh, that government couldn't come in and meddle with. And so a lot
*  of ideation happened around that view of things that there were efforts to figure out jurisdictions
*  where this might work. There was a lot of interest for a while in Anguilla, which is a Caribbean
*  Island that had some unusual jurisdictional properties. Um, there was sea land, sea land,
*  which is a platform in the North sea. Um, and so there was a lot of effort that went into finding
*  these physical locations that, that were deemed kind of safe. Um, and that all goes away with
*  blockchain. It's no longer necessary. Um, and so that really changes the picture in a lot of ways
*  because, um, uh, you no longer have, I mean, from a novelist point of view, the old system was a
*  lot more fun to work with because it gives you a situation where hackers are wandering around in
*  strange parts of the world, you know, trying to set up server rooms. So that's a great storytelling
*  thing. There's still a little bit of that, right? In the modern world, but it's just,
*  there's several server rooms as opposed to one centralized one. Yeah. Yeah. And there's the,
*  like the new wrinkle is the need to do a lot of computation and to keep your, your, uh, your,
*  your GPUs from melting down. So people building things in Iceland or, or in shipping containers
*  on the bottom of the ocean or whatever. Um, so, um, but there's still governments evolved and
*  there's still from a novelist perspective, interesting dynamics with as big governments
*  like, uh, China and more sort of renegade governments from all over the world, trying
*  to contend with this idea of what to do in terms of control and power over these kinds of centers
*  that do the mining of the cryptocurrency. Yeah. So we're in a stage now that kind of goes beyond
*  the initial, like there's the stuff I was describing in CryptoNomicon had a little bit of,
*  of air about it, of the underpants gnomes, uh, in that, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna build
*  this system and then we'll make money somehow. Uh, but the, the intermediate step was, was left out.
*  Um, and that is, uh, uh, I think we're now sort of into that phase of the thing where the,
*  where Bitcoin, you know, blockchain exists, people know how it works. Uh, Bitcoin and other
*  cryptocurrencies exist, people are using them. And it's sort of like, okay, what now, you know,
*  where does this all lead? Um, so, um, do you have a sense of where it all leads? Like, is it,
*  is it possible that the set of technology kind of continues to have, uh, transformational effects
*  on not just sort of finance, but who gets to have power in this world? So the decentralization of
*  power. Yeah. Big questions, right? So I guess there's a little bit of the cynic in me thinking
*  that as soon as it becomes important enough, the existing banks and people in power are gonna
*  sort of control it. I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won't be a big change in the end. Um,
*  there's a utopian strain sometimes in, in the way people think about this that I'm not so sure about.
*  Hey, there, there's a, there is a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
*  that make it a little easier to, uh, pull along the utopian thread. Yeah. Because it's harder
*  for governments to control Bitcoin. I mean, they, they have much fewer options.
*  The, they can ban, they can make it illegal is it's more difficult. Yeah. So technology here is on
*  the side of the powerless, the voiceless, which is a very interesting idea. Of course, yes,
*  it does have a utopian feel to it, but we have been making progress throughout human history.
*  Maybe this is what progress looks like. There will be the powerful and the greedy and the
*  bureaucrats that take advantage of it, skim off the top kind of thing. But maybe this does give,
*  more power to people that haven't had power before in a good way, like distributing power.
*  And enabling sort of more, um, greater resistance to sort of dictatorships and
*  authoritarian regimes, that kind of thing. Um, and also enabling all kinds of technologies built,
*  built on top of it. Ultimately, when you digitize money, uh, you know, money is a kind of speech or
*  it's a kind of like, um, mechanism of how humans interact. And if you make that digital,
*  more and more of the world moves to the digital space and then you could have the,
*  then you can finally fully live in that virtual reality with the toaster.
*  Yeah. Yeah. In a lot of ways, I think in that realm of technology that the money per se is one
*  of the less interesting things you can do with it. So I think, you know, cryptographically
*  enforceable contracts and, um, and organizations built on those, that seems to me like it's got
*  more potential for change just because we do already have money. And although it's an old system,
*  it's been digitized to a large extent by, you know, the, the stripes and the credit card companies
*  of the world. And I also love the idea of like, uh, connecting to, to connect to smart contracts,
*  connecting data, sort of, uh, making it more formal. It's like Mathematica more structured,
*  the integration of data of weather data, of, uh, all kinds of data about the, the,
*  the stuff in the world. So they can make contracts between people that in that's
*  grounded in data. And that's actually getting closer to something like truth, because then
*  you can make agreements based on actual data versus kind of perceptions of data. And if you can
*  formalize, like distribute the power of who gets to tell the story. Yeah. That that's an interesting
*  kind of, um, resistance. Yeah. Again, the powerful in the space of narrative. Yeah. David Brin has
*  been saying for a while that, um, the only way to settle arguments with, you know, across the
*  political divide is to make bets. So people can say, you know, the election was stolen or, you know,
*  whatever controversial position they're taking. Um, and they'll keep saying it until you,
*  you, uh, you wager real money on it. Um, so, um, so maybe there's something there. Um, if you could,
*  uh, kind of turn that into a, put a user interface on that, you know. Yeah. I have a stake in your,
*  uh, in your divisiveness, in your arguments. Right.
*  Will, uh, dogecoin take over the world Twitter question? You know, I don't, I don't follow the,
*  the different coins that much. So I don't, I mean, I hear about Dogecoin and I, you know, I,
*  I've kind of followed the story of it. So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in
*  contrast to like, uh, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are these serious implementations of
*  cryptocurrency that seek to solve some of the problems that we're talking about with smart
*  contracts and, and, uh, resist the, the, the banks and all those kinds of things. Dogecoin
*  operates more in the space of memes and humor while still doing some of the similar things.
*  And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether, um, memes, whether humor, whether
*  narrative will go a long way in the future, like much farther than some kind of boring old, uh,
*  grounded technologies, whether we'll be playing in the space of fun. Like once we built a base
*  of comfort and stability and like a robust system where everyone has shelter, everyone has, uh,
*  food and the basic needs covered, are we going to then operate in the space of fun?
*  That's, that's what I think about Dogecoin because it seems like fun spreads faster than anything
*  else. Fun of different kinds. And that could be bad fun and that could be good fun. Yeah.
*  And so it's a battle of, of good fun. It goes viral very, very quickly when you, when you,
*  if you post something that people find fun to. Yeah. And that's what Dogecoin represents.
*  So there's like, so Bitcoin represents like financial, uh, like serious financial instruments.
*  Yeah. And then Dogecoin represents fun. And it's interesting to watch the battle
*  go on on the internet to see which wins. This is also like open question to me of what is the
*  internet because, um, fun seems to prevail on the internet. And that's that a fundamental property
*  of the internet moving forward when you look a hundred years out, or is this a temporary thing
*  that was true at the birth of the internet? And this just true for a couple of decades
*  until it fades away and the adults take over and become serious again.
*  Well, I think the adults took over initially and then it was later on that people started using it
*  for fun, frivolous things like memes. Um, and that's, I think that's pretty much unstoppable.
*  Yeah. Cause even people who are very serious, uh, you know, enjoy, um,
*  um, sending around a funny picture or, uh, something that amuses them.
*  Yeah. I personally think we spoke about world war two. I think memes will save the world and
*  prevent all future wars. You've been handwriting your work for the past 20 years since writing the
*  Baroque cycle. What are the pros and cons of handwriting versus typing?
*  For me, I started it as an experiment when I started the Baroque cycle, because I had noticed
*  that if I, sometimes if I was stuck having a hard time getting started, if I just picked up a pen
*  and started writing, it was easy to, to go. So I just decided to keep with that. If it got in my
*  way, I didn't like it. I could always just go back to the word processor and be fine. So, but I never,
*  that never happened. So there's a certain security that comes from knowing that it's ink on paper
*  and there's no, uh, operating system crash or software failure that can obliterate it. Um,
*  there's, um, um, I, it's a slower output technique. And so, um, a sentence or a paragraph
*  spends a longer time in the buffer up here before it gets committed to paper, whereas I can type
*  really fast. And so I can slam things out before I've really thought them through.
*  So I think the first draft quality ends up being higher. Um, and then editing first draft of editing
*  is just faster because, um, instead of like trying to move the cursor around or whatever, uh,
*  or, you know, hitting the backspace key, I can just draw a line through a word or a sentence or
*  just around a whole paragraph and exit out. Um, and in doing so I've very quickly created an edit,
*  but I've also left behind a record of what the text was prior to the edit.
*  Of course, you know, all the digital versions have those quote unquote features, but their
*  experience is different. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a romance to just the physical,
*  you know, the touch of the pen to the paper, doing what has been done for centuries?
*  I think there is. I think there is a, uh, just the simplicity of it
*  and not having any intermediary technology beyond the pen and the paper, uh, is just very simple
*  and clean. Um, and, um, um, so I've got a bunch of fountain pens. I, I started by writing a book
*  and I, I started buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago because, uh, I thought I would be
*  more conservative with it, you know, but it still doesn't, it's still a trivial expenditure. So it
*  doesn't really alter my, my habits very much. So all that said, you, once you do type stuff up,
*  you use Emacs. I use Emacs, obviously the superior editor. Of course. You, uh, let me just ask the
*  ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around forever. Do you think in 100 years
*  we will still have Emacs and Vim? Or like pick a, pick a, let's say 50, 100 years. Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, I mean, whenever you're doing anything in Linux, you, you're spending a lot of time
*  editing little config files and scripts and stuff, and, uh, you need to be able to pop in and out of,
*  of editing those things. And it needs to work. Like even if the, the windowing GUI is dead
*  and all you've got is like a command line, you, you to get out of that problem, you might need to,
*  to enter an editor and, uh, and alter a file. So I think on that level, there will always have to be
*  sort of, uh, very simple. Well, Emacs isn't very simple, but you know what I mean. There,
*  there have to be basic editors that you can use, um, from either the command line or a GUI,
*  just for administering systems. Now how widespread they'll be, um,
*  you know, there's a certain amount of, um, what's the story of the,
*  the, there's the, the American folk tale of the, the, the guy who, the hammer guy who drives the
*  railroad spikes, John Henry, trying to keep up with the steam hammer. And eventually this,
*  the steam hammer wins because he can't drive the spikes fast enough. So there's, there's a sense in
*  which, you know, Microsoft, like who knows how much they've invested in code, you know,
*  visual studio to, to, you know, or, or Apple with X code. So they've put huge amounts of money into,
*  um, enhancing their IDEs and Emacs in theory can duplicate all of those features, um, by, you know,
*  if you just have enough Linux hackers writing Emacs list macros. Um, but you know,
*  at some point, um, it's going to be hard to, to maintain that level of, uh, of,
*  to keep up feature for feature.
*  The, the, the interesting thing about Emacs just is lasted a long time.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you've talked about that. There's a certain, like there's certain fads,
*  certainly in the, in the, um, software engineering space. And it's interesting to
*  think about technologies that sort of last for a very long time and just kind of being in them.
*  What is it? How do they get by? It's like the, the, uh,
*  the cockroaches of software or the bacteria software or something. They like this base
*  thing that nobody, everybody's just became reliant on. Uh, and they just outlast everything else and
*  slowly, slowly adjust with the times with a little bit of a delay with a little bit of
*  customization by individuals kind of that, but they're always there in the shadows and they
*  outlast everybody else. And I wonder if that's that, that might be the story for a lot of
*  technologies, especially in the software space. You know, shell scripts, you know, all that stuff.
*  You, you, you can't run the modern world without a bunch of shell scripts, you know, booting up
*  machines and, and, and running things. So, um, it's, yeah, that is going to be a hard thing to,
*  to replace. And then tech for typesetting that you use, you said. For when I, when I want to print
*  it out, yeah, I just have some simple, uh, macros that I use, but then I have to, um,
*  the publisher put their foot down and they, they want an inward format now. So, um,
*  years ago I wrote some macros to convert and this time, what did I do?
*  Copy paste.
*  No, I, um, I use sort of a regular expressions. So I was to do italics in, uh, you know, you,
*  you put it in curly brackets and you do backslash IT and then you type what you want to type. And
*  that's how you get italics in tech. So you can create a regular expression that'll look for
*  some text between curly brackets preceded by backslash IT. And then, uh, instead, uh,
*  convert that to italics and word will do that. Um, word, if you go deep enough into its search and
*  replace UI, is just reg ups. Yeah. I was funny that you did that. I mean, I'm sure there's tools
*  that help you with that kind of thing, but, but the task is sufficiently simple to where you can
*  do a much better job than anyone, anybody else's tool can. Yeah. So that's a fascinating process.
*  Works fine for me. Yeah. Um, and it keeps you from messing around with formatting.
*  Yeah. Like, Oh, what if I put this chapter heading, you know, in, you know, a sans serif font,
*  it's just classic wanking. Um, and so you, the, those options are closed off in what I'm doing.
*  Is there advice you could say, what does it take to write a great story?
*  The power of, of good yarns, good narratives to, um, pull people in is, is an incredible.
*  And I think my sort of amateur theory is that it's an evolutionary
*  development that if you're, um, you know, uh, uh, cave person sitting around a fire
*  in the rift valley a million years ago, um, if you can tell the story of how you escaped from the
*  hyenas, um, or how uncle Bob, you know, didn't escape from the hyenas. And if, if the people
*  listening to you can take that in and they can build that scenario in their heads, like a kind
*  of virtual reality and see what you're describing, then you've just conferred an incredibly important
*  advantage on the people who've heard that story. Yeah. Right. And so they know a bunch of stuff
*  now about how to stay alive that they could not have learned in any other way. Um, I mean,
*  animals who don't have speech though, they might warn each other. They might make a sound that
*  says danger, danger. Um, but, uh, but as far as we know, they can't tell more complicated stories.
*  So it's a part of us. Yeah. The, the, the collective intelligence seems to be one of the,
*  the key characteristics of the, of homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold ideas together
*  in our minds. And storytelling is the fundamental aspect of that. Maybe even
*  language itself is more fundamental. Yeah. Cause the language is required to do the storytelling
*  or maybe they evolve together. Maybe they co-evolve. Yeah. So I think that you've got
*  to work with that. And I think, uh, sometimes it seems like in kind of, um, literary circles that
*  having a lot of plot is a little bit frowned upon as it's pulpy or it's exploitative. But
*  for me, I don't have any compunctions whatsoever about that. I like stories that, um, are grabby
*  and fun and exciting to read. And once you've got one of those going, once you've got a good yarn
*  going that people will enjoy reading, then you're free to do whatever you want, uh, in the frame of
*  that story. But if you don't have that, um, then you got nothing. What about having like, uh,
*  which you do a technological scientific rigor, like to the, to the accuracy and as much as
*  possible, how does that add to the, to, to Bob telling the story or telling the story about Bob
*  or on the campfire? Well, the main thing that it does is, um, present, um, little details that you
*  might not have come up with on your own. So if you're just sitting there freely imagining things,
*  you, uh, you, your, your brain probably isn't going to serve up the wealth of details and the
*  resulting complications and surprises that real, that the real world is constantly presenting us
*  with. And so, um, in my case, if I'm, um, trying to write a story about, you know, some,
*  that involves some technology, like a rocket or a orbital maneuvers or whatever, then delving into
*  those details eventually is going to turn up some weird unexpected, you know, thing that, uh,
*  gives me material to work with, but also subliminally readers who see that are, are going to
*  be drawn in more, uh, because they're going to, uh, to, to find that, um, oh, I didn't see that
*  coming, you know, you know, it's got some of the complexity and surprise value of the real world.
*  Yeah. It does something. Um, uh, Alex Garland, director who did, uh, who wrote, uh, directed
*  X Machina. I think about AI movies and the more care you take in making it accurate,
*  the more compelling the story becomes smile. I'm not, I'm not sure what that is.
*  Uh, maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story,
*  maybe it just makes you a better writer. The key to any storytelling is getting the,
*  the readers to suspend their, their disbelief. And there's all kinds of triggers and little
*  tells that can break that. Right. Um, and once it's broken, it's really hard to get it back.
*  Uh, you know, a lot of times that's the end. Somebody will just close the book and not
*  pick it up. Um, I got to ask you, you've answered this question, but I got to ask you
*  the most impossible question for an author to answer, but
*  which Neil Stevenson book should one read first?
*  So when people ask me that, I usually ask them what they like to read, right? Cause, uh, I mean,
*  there's the best known one is probably snow crash, but that's a, a cyberpunk novel. That's at the
*  same time making fun of cyberpunk. Um, so it's kind of got some layers to it that, uh, might not
*  seem so funny if you don't have that, if you don't get the joke, right. So, um, there's, uh,
*  I've written, as you point out, I've written historical novels. Some people like those,
*  some people prefer those. So if that's what you like, then Kryptonomicon or the Baroque cycle
*  is where you would start. If you like sort of techno thrillers that are set in a modern day
*  setting, but aren't science fictiony per se, then, uh, Reamdy, um, is one of those and termination
*  shock, um, is, is, is definitely one of those. Um, so it just depends on, on, uh, what people like.
*  What, what, uh, when people a long time ago recommend that reads no crash, I said, uh,
*  it's the, it's Neil Stevenson light. It's, it's the, uh, like if you don't want to be overwhelmed
*  by the depth, like the rigor book, like that's a good, that's a good introduction to the man.
*  Okay. So, so essentially you broke it down by topics, but if you wanted to read all of them,
*  what's a good introduction to the, to the man? Because obviously these worlds are very different.
*  Yeah. The philosophy is a very different. Yeah. What's a good introduction to the human?
*  Um, hmm. People ask the same thing with the Staski people. It's a, it's a hard one to answer.
*  Maybe seven eaves because it's got big themes. Um, it's, you know, it's about heavy,
*  heavy things happening to the human race. Um, uh, but hopefully the story is told through a cast of
*  characters that, uh, people can relate to, you know, and it moves along. Uh, so, uh, it, it does
*  go kind of deep eventually on how rockets work and orbital mechanics and all that stuff, but, um,
*  people were able to get through it anyway, or some people just skip over that. It's fine, you know.
*  As an author, let me ask you what books had a big impact on your life
*  that you've read? Is there any that jumped to mind that you learned from as a writer,
*  as a philosopher, as a mathematician, as an engineer? This is one of these questions where
*  I always blank out and then when I'm walking out the door, I'll, I'll remember 12. So this is a
*  random selection that doesn't represent the top, the top ones. Um, well, I mentioned, you know,
*  Gulag Archipelago, that's kind of a hefty and dark, but, and then it has a personal connection
*  as well. Yeah, just, yeah. Cause it's like where you found the book to the part, the time in your
*  life, where you found it, who recommended it. That's also part of the story. Yeah. So there's
*  definitely that there's, you know, I, I circled back to Moby Dick a lot, um, because we read it in a,
*  a really great English class I had in high school. And I came in with an oppositional stance because
*  I thought that the teacher was going to try to talk me into having all kinds of highfalutin
*  ideas about allegory and what does this mean? What's the symbolism? And it turned out that,
*  it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying than that. Um,
*  what was the first powerful book you remember reading that like convinced you that this form
*  could have depth? Was it Moby Dick? Was it like in high school? I'm trying to remember,
*  well, Moby Dick was definitely a big one. Um, I mean, I used to read a lot of classics comics
*  when I was, I don't know if you've seen these, it's a whole series of comic books that, um,
*  uh, it was viral. You could, uh, in the, in the back of each comic book was an order form.
*  You could check some boxes and fill out your address and mail it in and more would show up.
*  But it was like, they would do the count of Monte Cristo, you know, Moby Dick, you know,
*  Robert Louis Stevenson, Robinson Crusoe, you know, all this sort of classic books, uh, were,
*  they had put into comic book form. Um, it's amazing. Yeah. Reading Moby Dick,
*  if you're nine years old, is a tall order. There's some very complicated sentences in there.
*  Yeah. Um, and a lot of digressions, but if you're just looking at the comic books, like,
*  holy shit, look at that whale, you know, um, and, um, and ultimately the power of the story
*  doesn't need the complicated words. It's, it's, it's all about the man and the, and the whale.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So you could get kind of a grounding in a lot of classic works of literature without
*  actually reading them, which is, you know, it's great when you're nine years old. So,
*  so I read a lot of that stuff, uh, for sure. The annotated Sherlock Holmes, um,
*  Hmm.
*  You, you mentioned David Deutsch too as inspiration for some of the work. I mean,
*  you've, you've obviously didn't like really a lot of research for the books you do. Roger
*  Penrose. What, uh, do you remember a book that made you want to become a writer or a moment that
*  made you become a writer? I think like the, you know, the answer I usually give is that when I
*  was in like fifth grade, one of my friends came to school one day, he was wearing leather shoes,
*  like dress shoes. And I hated dress shoes because mine never fit. And so they were uncomfortable.
*  I couldn't run, you know, they were cold. It was Iowa. So I kind of said,
*  I remember very clearly thinking, okay, I don't like where this is going.
*  Like, does this mean that next year, all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes?
*  So I need to find a job where I don't have to do that.
*  So that was like the first time I thought about trying to find such a job, you know, being a
*  writer. And then, and then I just read a lot of, uh, just classic science fiction short stories
*  and started, you know, trying to write some of my own. And, uh, there were just classic young adult
*  stories like by Heinlein and, um, the other classic names that you think of, but the Heinlein ones
*  stuck, have stuck with me in a way that the others didn't. What's the greatest science fiction book
*  ever written? Just removing your, uh, work from consideration. Uh,
*  he just, I'm loving torturing you right now. Greatest ever non Stevenson. Do we include fantasy
*  or does it have to be science fiction? Oh, interesting fantasy. Hmm.
*  I did not expect that twist. Uh, well, in a weird way, they're lumped together and people
*  are like, yeah, they are, but there, but there's also a boundary somehow. Yeah.
*  I'm not sure what that is exactly. Nobody is. It's a mystery. Um, so I mean, if we do include it,
*  then it's easily the Lord of the Rings. Um, but, uh, I mean, greatness is a interesting quality to,
*  to try to define. Um, and for me, uh, a lot of the, the fun and the joy of,
*  of such books is, is not in what you'd call greatness, but just storytelling. So I was
*  always a big fan of has have space suit will travel, which is a Heinlein young adult book.
*  It's just, uh, it's just a fun, good read. Um, so, so, so fun is a big component.
*  Greatness is overrated. Well, I don't know. It's overrated, but it's just,
*  you know, it's, it might be under defined, but that way, so have space suit will travel. Now I
*  definitely have to read that one. Yeah. You mentioned Iowa. I was, uh, there a couple of times
*  that got to spend, uh, quite a bit of time with Dan Gable, with Tom Brands, who are wrestlers was,
*  uh, is it now wrestling, martial arts part of your life, any part of your form,
*  formation of who you are as a human being? I think so in a, it was a late, it was a late
*  thing for me, but growing up in Ames, um, Dan Gable was, uh, a few years older than me. And so
*  sometimes we would go to the arena at the university and watch wrestling meets. And, uh,
*  and this was before his Olympic career. So everyone knew he was the star of that team
*  and that he was the best, but people didn't yet know that he was the greatest of all time.
*  Gee, you saw Gable. So that was part, it's, it's funny. Uh, it feels like a small world that you
*  would be in the same space as Dan Gable. Well, from a hundred feet away, a little dot on the
*  mat, frouncing his opponents, him and, him and Chris Taylor. So the other star was this 400 pound
*  plus guy named Chris Taylor, who, uh, also went to the Olympics. So yeah, people, you know, he was,
*  he was a no, he was a, uh, an athletic hero and wrestling is, there's certain states like Oklahoma
*  Pennsylvania, Iowa, where wrestling is the sport because those are states of small towns. And so
*  if you're a small town, if you're like Dan Gable, uh, and you have to be on a football team with
*  20 other guys who are not Dan Gable, then no matter how good you are, your team might,
*  might suck. Uh, but if in a solo thing, you can, you can go to the Olympics.
*  So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes in school and I didn't like it.
*  And I think partly it's just that it was so, so competitive and the people who were,
*  who cared about it really cared about it a lot, you know? And so it was, it was pretty tough.
*  And I didn't think I had the right body type. But then when I was, uh, after college, I was in Iowa
*  City for a few years when he was coaching the, the wrestling team there. And he won like nine
*  championships out of 10 years, you know, during that, during that time. So he was both the greatest
*  individual wrestler of all time and like the greatest team coach. Um, so I've never met him,
*  but we've, uh, he's kind of been like in my sphere of awareness since I was, you know,
*  kind of my whole life and people would always tell stories about him. Like,
*  I think he got arrested once for some kind of, I don't know, minor offense in Ames.
*  And so he just basically stayed up all night. He was in this cage in the jail. He just stayed
*  up all night doing pull ups. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, uh, so yeah. So has that been, I mean,
*  Iowa is such an interesting place in the world. I mean, wrestling is just part of that story.
*  I, does, is that somewhere in there? Does that resonate deeply with who you are?
*  It was a formative thing for me growing up there for sure. It's just a, uh, you know,
*  at least used to be a very orderly place, high social capital, very minimal class differences.
*  So like you'd have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy, but, uh, that was it.
*  That was, you know, those were the rich people, right? So, um, and a college town is always a
*  different environment. Like, uh, you know, Austin has some of this. Um, so it was a pretty kind of
*  utopian, uh, other than the weather and a few other things, uh, environment to grow up in.
*  The martial art I ended up doing is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different
*  feedback loop. So when you're, if you're grappling, everything is through sense of touch and your sense
*  of touch is very old and simple, right? Like earthworms don't have, don't even have eyes,
*  but they can tell when they're being touched. Right. So it's very fast. Um,
*  and, uh, with, um, with a standoff art, like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting, you're,
*  you're not touching the other person most of the time. Your, your, your visual system is doing
*  something way more, it's doing slam, uh, and trying to figure out what the other person is up to.
*  And so, um, that always felt more my speed. So in, in Olympic style fencing,
*  you're, it doesn't start really until you're crossing blades with the other person. And
*  now you're back to wrestling. You're feeling what they're doing. And it's all about that. But
*  some of the older sword arts, um, don't engage the blade that way. You stand off at range and
*  then you make cutting attacks. And, um, and, uh, and so, so those are all processed visually.
*  And I think I'm more of a slow thinker. So it works for me better. I mean, the same,
*  it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing, I suppose, just like you said,
*  is like, there's no, there's no contact and it's all processed visually. And I'm sure there's a
*  dance of its own. That, that depends on the characteristic of a sword involved.
*  Yeah. There's a set of, of stances and, and, uh, basic reactions that you try to learn that
*  are thought to be defensible, um, and, and safe or safer. And so it tends to be a series of short
*  engagements where you'll, you'll close in, you'll try out your, your idea and it works or it doesn't.
*  Then you, you back off again. It's interesting to think about like human history because martial
*  arts. Okay. That's a thing. But in terms of sword fighting, just the full range of humans that
*  existed who mastered sword fighting or sought the master fighting, just to imagine the thousands of
*  people who the heights they have achieved. Cause the stakes are so incredibly high to be good.
*  And it's the richest, most powerful people in those societies spending it, whatever it takes
*  to get the best gear and the best training. Cause you're right. Everything depends on it.
*  And it's still life and death. I mean, that, that's fascinating. Um,
*  that, that's fascinating. We perhaps have lost that forever with greater weapons. I mean,
*  the artistry of sword fighting when it's life and death and you go into war,
*  you have the Miyamoto Masashi's of the world, right? The, I don't know, there's, there's a poetry to
*  that, that there's a mastery to that, that I don't know if we could achieve with any other kind of
*  martial art. Well, the, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the, the good effects of
*  the internet, social media that we sometimes overlook. And, and one of those is that, um,
*  there were all these isolated people around the world who were interested in this, who found each
*  other and kind of created a network of, of people who help each other learn these things. So that
*  doesn't mean that anyone is, is up to the level of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of,
*  that you're talking about yet. But, um, but it is happening. And, um, and so, um, there's a, a, a
*  large number of old treatises, old written documents, uh, that have been dug up from
*  libraries and people have been going over these and translating them from old dialects of Italian
*  and German, um, to make sense of them and, and, uh, learning how to, to do these techniques
*  with different, uh, different weapons. Um, actually there's a guy here in Austin named
*  Daman Stith who does African, historical African martial arts. Um, also martial arts of, uh,
*  of enslaved Africans who would learn machete fighting techniques in the Caribbean,
*  South America. Yeah. He's probably within a mile of us. He's an amazing guy.
*  That's awesome. I'm going to look him up. Yeah.
*  Can I ask you for advice? Can you give advice for young people, high school, college,
*  you know, undergrads, thinking about, uh, their career, thinking about life, how to live a life
*  that you'd be proud of. You think quite a bit about like what it's required to be innovative in this
*  world. You think quite a bit about the future. So somebody wanting to be a person that makes a big
*  impact from the future. What advice would you give them? I think a big part of it is finding the
*  thing that you will do happily. And, um, I don't want to say obsessively because that sounds like
*  maybe it's pathological, but, but if you can find a thing that you'll, you know, you'll sit down,
*  you'll start doing it and hours later, you kind of snap out of it. Where did the time go? Um,
*  then, um, that's a really key discovery for anyone to make about themselves when they're young.
*  Because if you don't have that, um, it's hard to, uh, to figure out where you should put your
*  energies, you know, and as you might have the best intentions, you might say, you know, I want
*  world peace or whatever. Uh, but, um, uh, at the end of the day, what really matters is how do you
*  spend your time and are you spending it in a way that's productive? Uh, and, um, uh,
*  because it doesn't matter how smart you are or well-intentioned you are unless you've
*  figured that out. And so finding the thing in which you can sort of, you naturally lose yourself in
*  the thing is, um, at least for me, there's a lot of things like that, but I first have to overcome
*  the initial hump of really sucking at that thing. Like the fun starts a little bit
*  after the first hump of really sucking and then you could suck just regularly. Yeah. So often
*  people oftentimes people can give up too early. I think, I mean, that's true with mathematics for me.
*  It's for a lot of people is if you just give it a chance and struggle, if you give yourself
*  time to struggle, you'll find a way you'll find the thing within that thing that you can lose track
*  of time with. Yeah, that's a key detail that, um, that there's an important thing to add to,
*  to what I said, which is that, uh, this might not happen the first time you do a thing,
*  maybe it will, but, um, uh, you might have to climb that learning curve. And, um,
*  if there's pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about that,
*  then, um, it might prevent you from, from getting where you need to be. Um,
*  so there's some complexity there, uh, that may can make this kind of non-obvious. Um, but, uh,
*  that's what that's why we need, you know, good teachers. Um, you know, another
*  beneficial thing, uh, of the internet is YouTube and being able to learn things,
*  how to do things on YouTube. The, the, the dude who made the YouTube video doesn't care how many
*  times you hit pause and rewind. Um, they're never going to like roll their eyes and,
*  and be impatient with you. Um,
*  and sometimes, uh, spending a huge amount of time on one video or one book, like making that
*  the thing you just spent a huge amount of time on rereading, rereading, or rewatching, rewatching
*  that, that somehow really, um, solidifies your love for that thing. And like the depth of
*  understanding you start to gain and it's okay to stay with that. I used to think like there's all
*  these books out there. So like, I need to keep reading or keep reading. But then I realized,
*  um, I think it was somewhere in college, uh, uh, where you could just spend your whole life with
*  a single textbook. There's nothing in that textbook to really, really stay. Measner, Thorn and Wheeler
*  gravitation, you know, is, is one of those, or another one is, um, the road to reality by Roger
*  Penrose, which is just incredibly deep. And it starts with like two plus two equals four. And at
*  the end you're at the boundaries of, of physics. Uh, it's an amazing, amazing book. Let me ask you
*  the big ridiculous question. Okay. Since you've pondered some big ridiculous questions in your work,
*  what's the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? Wow. Human life.
*  Well, as far as I know, we're unique in the universe. There's no evidence that
*  there's anything else in the universe that's as complicated as what's between our ears.
*  Might be, you can't rule it out, but, um, so we appear to be pretty special. And, um, so it's
*  got to have something to do with that. And one of the reasons I like David Deutsch,
*  in particular, his book, The Beginning of Infinity, um, is that he talks about the power of explanations
*  and the fact that, um, most civilizations are static, that they've got a set of dogmas that
*  they arrive at somehow. And they just pass those on from one, uh, generation to the next and nothing
*  changes. But that huge changes have happened when people sort of follow whatever you want to call
*  it, the scientific method or enlightenment. Uh, there's different ways of thinking about it,
*  but basically explanatory, it's, it's about the power of, of explanations and being able to figure
*  out why things are the way they are. And that has created changes in our, um, thinking in our way
*  of life over the last few centuries that are explosive compared to anything that came before.
*  And David sort of verges on classifying this as like a force of nature in its potential
*  transformative power. If we keep going, um, you know, we could, uh, you know, if we figure out
*  how to colonize the universe, like you were talking about earlier, how to spread to others,
*  star systems, um, then it is effectively a force of nature. This kind of drive to understand
*  more and more and more deeper and deeper and deeper and to engineer stuff so that we can
*  understand you more. Yeah. Yeah. It's the, well, it's the old, the, the universe created us to
*  understand itself. Maybe that's the, uh, the whole purpose. Yeah. It's, it is an interesting,
*  peculiar side effect of the way we've been created is we seem to be conscious beings.
*  We seem to have little egos. We seem to, uh, be born and die pretty quickly. There's a bunch of
*  drama. We're all within ourselves, pretty unique and we fall in love and start wars and there's
*  hate and all the, the full interesting dynamic of it. So it's not just about the individual people.
*  Yeah. Somehow like the concert that we played together.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of interesting. There's a lot of peculiar aspects of that, that,
*  um, I wonder if they're fundamental or just quirks of evolution, whether it's, whether it's death,
*  whether it's love, whether all those things, I wonder if they're, um, from an engineering
*  perspective, when we're trying to create that intelligent toaster that listens for the,
*  for the slam door and this, and the smell of burning toast,
*  whether, uh, that toaster should be afraid of death and should fall in love just like we do.
*  Neil, you're a fascinating human being. You've impacted the lives of millions of people.
*  Thank you. It's a huge honor that you would spend your valuable time with me today. Thank you so
*  much. Thank you for coming down to beautiful, hot Texas. And thank you for talking today.
*  It was a pleasure. I'm glad I came and did it.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Neil Stephenson. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Neil
*  Stephenson himself in his novel Snow Crash. The world is full of things more powerful than us,
*  but if you know how to catch a ride, you can go places. Thanks for listening and hope to see you
*  next time.
