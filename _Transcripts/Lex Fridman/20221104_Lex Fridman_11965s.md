# Fiona Hill: Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump | Lex Fridman Podcast #335
**Lex Fridman:** [November 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNhSCF9i8Qs)
*  We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well.
*  We've got to understand how the guy thinks
*  and why he thinks like he does.
*  You know, he has got his own context and his own frame
*  and his own rationale.
*  And he is rational.
*  He is a rational actor in his own context.
*  We've got to understand that.
*  We've got to understand that he would take offense at something
*  and he would take action over something.
*  It doesn't mean to say that, you know,
*  we are necessary to blame by taking actions,
*  but we are to blame when we don't understand
*  the consequences of things that we do and act accordingly,
*  or, you know, take preventative action
*  or recognize that something might happen
*  as a result of something.
*  What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine
*  with a tactical nuclear weapon?
*  The following is a conversation with Fiona Hill,
*  a presidential advisor and foreign policy expert
*  specializing in Russia.
*  She has served the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations,
*  including being a top advisor on Russia to Donald Trump.
*  She has made it to the White House from Humboldt beginnings
*  in the North of England, a story she tells in her book,
*  There's Nothing for You Here.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Fiona Hill.
*  You came from Humboldt beginning in a coal mining town
*  in Northeast England.
*  So what were some formative moments in your young life
*  that made you the woman you are today?
*  I was born in 1965, and it was the period where
*  the whole coal sector in Britain was in decline already.
*  And, you know, basically, my father, by the time I came along,
*  had lost his job multiple times.
*  Every coal mine he worked in was closing down.
*  He was looking constantly for other work,
*  and he had no qualifications because at age 14,
*  he'd gone down the mines.
*  His father had gone down the mines at 13.
*  His great-grandfather, you know, around the same kind of age.
*  I mean, you had a lot of people, you know,
*  at different points going down coal mines at 12, 13, you know, 14.
*  They didn't get educated beyond that period
*  because the expectation was,
*  are you going to go down the mine like everybody else in your family?
*  And then he didn't really have any other qualifications
*  to, you know, basically find another job
*  beyond something in manual labor.
*  So he worked in a steelworks.
*  That didn't work out.
*  A brickworks.
*  That closed down.
*  And then he went to work in the local hospital,
*  part of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom as a porter,
*  an orderly.
*  Basically somebody's just pushing people around.
*  There was no opportunity to retrain.
*  So the big issue in my family was education.
*  You've got to have one.
*  You know, you've got to have some qualifications.
*  The world is changing.
*  It's changing really quickly.
*  And for you to kind of keep up with it,
*  you're going to have to get educated and find a way out of this.
*  And very early on, my father had basically said to me,
*  there's nothing for you here.
*  You're going to have to, if you want to get ahead.
*  And he didn't have any kind of idea that as a girl I wouldn't.
*  I mean, actually, in many respects, I think I benefited
*  from being a girl rather than a boy.
*  There was no expectation that I would go into industry.
*  There was, you know, some kind of idea that maybe I,
*  you know, if I got qualifications, I could be a nurse.
*  My mother was a midwife.
*  And so she'd at age 16 left school and gone to train
*  as a nurse and then as a midwife.
*  I had other relatives who'd gone to teach, you know,
*  in local schools.
*  And so there was an idea that, you know,
*  women could get educated.
*  And there was a kind of a range of things that you could do.
*  But the expectation then was go out there,
*  do something with your life,
*  but also a sense that you'd probably have to leave.
*  So all of that was circling around me,
*  particularly in my teenage years,
*  as I was trying to sort of find my way through life
*  and looking forward.
*  First of all, what does that even look like,
*  getting educated, given the context of that place?
*  You don't know.
*  There's a whole world of mystery out there.
*  So how do you figure out what to actually do out there?
*  But was there moments, formative moments,
*  either challenging or just inspiring
*  where you wondered about what you want to be,
*  where you want to go?
*  Yeah, there were, I mean, there were a number of things.
*  I mean, I think like a lot of kids, you know,
*  you talk to people and particularly from blue collar
*  backgrounds said, what did you want to do?
*  Boys might say, I wanted to be a fireman,
*  you know, or you got, you know, kind of,
*  at one point as a little girl,
*  I wanted to be a nurse and I had a little nurse's uniform
*  like my mother.
*  I didn't really know what that meant,
*  but you know, I used to go around pretending to be a nurse.
*  I even had a little magazine called Nurse Nancy
*  and I used to read this.
*  And, you know, kind of that was one of the formative ideas.
*  We also, it was a rural area, semi-rural area.
*  And, you know, I'd be out in the fields all the time
*  and I'd watch farmers, you know, with their animals
*  and I'd see vets coming along and, you know,
*  watching people deal with the livestock.
*  And there was a kind of a famous story at the time
*  about a vet called James Herriot.
*  It became here in the United States as well
*  and was a sort of a TV mini series.
*  He'd written a book and he was the vet for my,
*  one of my great aunt's dogs.
*  And people were always talking about him.
*  I thought, oh, I could be a vet.
*  And then one day I saw one of the local vets
*  with his hand up the backside of a cow in a field
*  and he got his hand stuck and the cow was kicking him.
*  And I thought, yeah, maybe, maybe not actually.
*  No, I don't think I want to be a vet.
*  So I cycled through all of these things about,
*  okay, I could get an education.
*  But the whole sense was you have to apply your education.
*  It wasn't an education for education's sake.
*  It was an education to do something.
*  And when I was about 14 or 15,
*  my local member of parliament came to the school
*  and it was one of these, you know,
*  pep talks for kids in these, you know, deprived areas.
*  He had been quite prominent in local education
*  and now he was a member of parliament.
*  He himself had come from a really hard scrabble background
*  and had risen up through education.
*  He'd even gone to Oxford and done philosophy, politics,
*  and economics.
*  And he basically told my class,
*  even though it was highly unlikely any of us
*  were really going to get ahead and go to elite institutions,
*  look, you can get an education.
*  You don't have to be held back by your circumstances.
*  But if you do get an education, it's a privilege
*  and you need to do something with it.
*  So then I'm thinking, well, what could I do?
*  Okay, an education is a qualification.
*  It's to do something.
*  Most people around me I didn't, I knew didn't have careers.
*  I mean, my dad didn't really have a career.
*  He had jobs.
*  My mom, you know, thought of her nursing as a career though,
*  and it genuinely was.
*  And she was out there trying to help women survive childbirth.
*  My mother had these horrific stories, you know,
*  basically over the dining room table.
*  I wish she'd stop.
*  She'd leave out her nursing books.
*  And I tell you, if everyone had had my mom as a mother,
*  there'd be no, there'd be no reproduction on the planet.
*  It was just these grim, horrific stories of breached births
*  and fistulas and all kinds of horrors
*  that my sister and I would just go, oh my God, you know,
*  what, please stop.
*  So I thought, well, you know,
*  I don't necessarily want to go in that, in that direction,
*  but it was the timing that really cinched things for me.
*  I was very lucky that the region that I grew up, County Durham,
*  despite the massive decline, deindustrialization,
*  and the complete collapse of the local government system around me
*  still maintained money for education.
*  And they also paid for exchanges.
*  And we had exchange programs with cities in Germany and France,
*  also in Russia, in Kostroma, near Yaroslavl,
*  for example, an old textile town, similar, you know,
*  down in its sort of kind of region,
*  but quite historic in the Russian context.
*  In fact, the original birthplace of the Romanov dynasty in Kostroma,
*  just as County Durham, you know,
*  was quite a distinguished historic area in the British context.
*  And so there was an idea that I could go on exchanges.
*  I could learn languages.
*  I studied German.
*  I studied French.
*  And then in 1983, there was the war scare,
*  basically provoked by the Euro missile crisis.
*  So the stationing of new categories of strategic nuclear weapons
*  and intermediate nuclear weapons in Western Europe
*  and in Eastern Europe during the height of the Cold War.
*  And this Euro missile crisis over SS-20 and Pershing missiles
*  went on from 1977, so when I was about 11 or 12,
*  all the way through into the later part of the 1980s.
*  And in 1983, we came extraordinarily close to a nuclear conflict.
*  It was very much another rerun of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.
*  So 20 years on, same kind of thing.
*  The Soviets misread, although I didn't know this at the time.
*  I know a lot of this, you know, after the fact,
*  but the tension was palpable.
*  But what happened was the Soviets misread the intentions of a series of exercises
*  Operation Able Archer that the United States was conducting
*  and actually thought that the United States might be preparing for first nuclear strike.
*  And that then set up a whole set of literal chain reactions in the Soviet Union.
*  Eventually, it was recognized that, you know,
*  all of this was really based on misperceptions.
*  And of course, you know, that later led to negotiations between Gorbachev and Reagan
*  for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, the INF Treaty.
*  But in 1983, that tension was just acute.
*  And for as a teenager, we were basically being prepped the whole time
*  for the inevitability of nuclear Armageddon.
*  There were TV series, films in the United States and the UK threads the day after.
*  We had all these public service announcements telling us to seek sanctuary or cover
*  in the inevitability of a nuclear blast.
*  And, you know, my house was so small, they said, look for a room without a window.
*  There were no rooms without windows.
*  My dad put on these really thick curtains over the window, you know,
*  instead of there was a nuclear flash, you know, we'd have to, you know,
*  get down on the floor, not look up, but the curtains would help.
*  And we were like, this is ridiculous, dad.
*  And we would all try to see if we could squeeze in the space under the stairs,
*  a cupboard under the stairs like Harry Potter.
*  I mean, it's all just, you know, totally nuts.
*  Or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside.
*  And I thought, well, this isn't going to work.
*  And one of my great uncles who had fought in World War II said,
*  well, look, you're good at languages, Fiona.
*  Why don't you go and study Russian?
*  Try to figure it out.
*  Figure out why the Russians are trying to blow us up.
*  Because, you know, during the...
*  Go talk to them.
*  Exactly. During World War II, the United Kingdom, the United States,
*  and the Soviet Union had all been wartime allies.
*  And my uncle Charlie thought, well, there's something going wrong here.
*  Maybe you can figure it out.
*  And as you said, go talk to them.
*  So I thought, okay, I'll study Russian.
*  So that's really how this came about.
*  I thought, well, it's applying education.
*  I'll just do my very best to understand everything I possibly can
*  about the Russian language and the Soviet Union.
*  And I'll see what I can do.
*  And I thought, well, maybe I could become a translator.
*  So I had visions of myself sitting around, you know,
*  listening to things in a big headset
*  and in a best view translating perhaps at some, you know,
*  future arms control summits.
*  So how did the journey continue with learning Russian?
*  I mean, this early dream of being a translator
*  and thinking how can I actually help understand
*  or maybe help even deeper away with this conflict
*  that threatens the existence of the human species?
*  How did it actually continue?
*  Well, I mean, I read everything I possibly could about,
*  you know, nuclear weapons and nuclear war.
*  And, you know, I started to try to teach myself Russian a little bit.
*  So it was always in context of nuclear war.
*  It was very much in the context of nuclear war at this particular point,
*  but also in historical context,
*  because I knew that the United States and the United Kingdom
*  and the Soviet Union had been wartime allies in World War II.
*  So I tried to understand all of that.
*  And also, you know, like many other people,
*  I read Russian literature in translation.
*  I'd read War and Peace and I'd loved the book, actually.
*  I mean, particularly the story parts of it.
*  I wasn't one really at that time when I was a teenager.
*  I thought Tolstoy went on a bit, you know,
*  in terms of his series of the great man and of history
*  and, you know, kind of social change.
*  Though now I appreciate it more.
*  But when I was about 14, I was like, this man needed an editor.
*  You know, could he have just gone on with the story?
*  Amazing story.
*  What an incredible, you know, kind of book this is.
*  I still think he needs an editor.
*  But yeah, well, I think his wife tried, didn't she?
*  But he got quite upset with her.
*  And then I kind of thought to myself, well, how do I study Russian?
*  Because there were very few schools in my region,
*  you know, given the impoverishment of the region,
*  where you could study Russian.
*  So I would have to take Russian from scratch.
*  And this is where things get really quite interesting.
*  Because there were opportunities to study Russian at universities.
*  But I would need to have, first of all,
*  an intensive Russian language course in the summer.
*  And I didn't have the money for that.
*  And the period is around the miners' strike in the United Kingdom in 1984.
*  Now, the miners of County Durham had very interestingly had
*  exchanges and ties with the miners of Donbas going back to the 1920s.
*  And as I studied Russian history, I discovered there was lots of contacts
*  between Bolshevik, Soviet Union in the early period after the Russian Revolution.
*  But even before that, during the imperial period in Russia,
*  between the Northern England and the Russian Empire in the old industrial areas.
*  Basically, big industrial areas like the northeast of England
*  and places like Donbas were built up at the same time,
*  often by the same sets of industrialists.
*  And Donetsk in the Donbas region used to be called Husevka,
*  because it was established by a Welsh industrialist who brought in miners from Wales
*  to help develop the coal mines there.
*  And also the steelworks and others that we're hearing about all the time.
*  And so I got very fascinated in all these linkages.
*  And famous writers from the early parts of the Soviet Union like Yvgeny Zamyatin
*  worked in the shipyards in Newcastle, Pontine.
*  And there was just this whole set of connections.
*  And in 1984, when the miners' strike took place, the miners of Donbas,
*  along with other miners from famous coal regions like the Ruhr Valley, for example,
*  in Germany or miners in Poland, sent money in solidarity to the miners of County Durham.
*  And there'd been these exchanges, as I said, going back and forth since the 1920s,
*  formal exchanges between miners, you know, the region of miners' unions.
*  And I heard, again from the same great uncle who told me to study Russian,
*  that there were actually scholarships for the children of miners,
*  and it could be former miners as well, for their education.
*  And I should go along to the miners' hall, a place called Red Hills,
*  where the miners of County Durham had actually pooled all of their resources
*  and built up their own parliament and their own, you know, kind of place that they could
*  talk among themselves to figure out how to enhance the welfare and wellbeing of their communities.
*  And they'd put money aside for education for miners.
*  There was all kinds of lecture series from the miners and all kinds of other activities
*  supporting soccer teams and artistic circles and writing circles, for example.
*  People like George Orwell, you know, were involved in some of these writer's circles
*  in other parts of Britain and mining communities, for example.
*  And so they told me I could, you know, go along and basically apply for a grant to go to study
*  Russian. So I show up and it was the easiest, you know, application I've ever come across.
*  They just asked me to, my dad came along with me. They asked me to verify, you know, that my
*  dad had been a miner and they looked up his employment record on little cards, you know,
*  kind of a little tray somewhere. And then they asked me how much I needed, you know,
*  to basically pay for the travel and some of the basic expenses for the study.
*  And they wrote me a check. And so thanks to the miners of Donbass and this money that was
*  deposited with the miners of County Durham with the Durham Miners Association, I got the money to
*  study Russian for the first time before I embarked on my studies at university.
*  As you're speaking now, it's reminding me that there's a different way to look both at history
*  and geography and at different places is, you know, this is an industrial region.
*  That's right.
*  And it echoes in the experience of living there is more captured, not by Moscow or Kiev,
*  but by at least historically, but by just being a mining town and industrial.
*  That's right. In the place itself. Yeah. I mean, there are places in the United States and Appalachia
*  and West Virginia and in Pennsylvania, like the Lehigh Valley that have the same sense of place.
*  And the Northeast of England, you know, was the cradle of the industrial revolution.
*  It was the industrial version of the Silicon Valley, which has its own,
*  I would say contours and frames. And when you come to those industrial areas,
*  your previous identities get submerged in that larger framework. I've always looked at the world
*  through that lens of being someone from the working class, the blue collar communities,
*  from a very specific place with lots of historical and economic connotations.
*  And it's also a melting pot, which is the problems that the Donbass has experienced
*  over the last 30 years. People came from all over the place to work there. Of course, there was a
*  population that one might say is indigenous, might have gone back centuries there, but they would have
*  been in the smaller rural farming communities, just like it was the same in the Northeast of
*  England. And people in the case of the Northeast of England came from Wales, they came from further
*  in the South of England, the Midlands, they came from Scotland, they came from Ireland.
*  I have all of that heritage in my own personal background. And you've got a different identity.
*  And it's when somebody else tries to impose an identity on you from the outside that things go
*  awry. And I think that that's kind of what we've really seen in the case of Donbass. It's a place,
*  it's a part in many respects historically, and in terms of its evolution and development over time.
*  Particularly in the case of Russia, the Russians have tried to say, well, look, because most people
*  speak Russian, there is the lingua franca. I mean, in the Northeast of England, of course,
*  everyone spoke English, but lots of people were Irish speakers, you know, Gaelic Irish speakers,
*  or some of them might have certainly been Welsh speakers. There was lots of Welsh miners who spoke
*  Welsh as their first language who came there. But they created an identity. It's the same in
*  Belfast, in Ulster, the Northern province of the whole of the Irish island, the part of
*  Ireland that is still part of the United Kingdom. That was also a heavily industrialized area,
*  high manufacturing, mass manufacturing, shipbuilding, for example, people came from
*  all over there too, which is why when Ireland got its independence from the United Kingdom,
*  Ulster, Belfast and that whole region kind of clung on because it was again that melting pot.
*  It was kind of intertwined with the larger industrial economy and had a very different
*  identity. And so that, you know, for me growing up in such a specific place with such a special in
*  many respects, heritage, gave me a different perspective on things. When I first went to the
*  Soviet Union in 1987 to study there, I actually went to a translators institute, what was then
*  called the Maurice Serez, which is now the Institute of Foreign Languages. I was immediately struck by
*  how similar everything was to the North of England, because it was just like one big working class
*  culture that sort of broken out onto the national stage. Everything in Northern England was
*  nationalized. We had British steel, British coal, British rail, British shipbuilding,
*  because after World War II, the private sector had been devastated and the state had to step in.
*  And of course, the Soviet Union is one big giant nationalized economy when I get there. And it's
*  just the people's attitudes and outlooks are the same. People didn't work for themselves,
*  they always worked for somebody else. And it had a quite a distortion on the way that people looked
*  at the world. Do you still speak Russian? I do. Yeah.
*  It would be a big mystery for everybody. And you have an advantage on me because it's your native
*  language as well. For people wondering the English speakers in the audience, you're really missing a
*  lot from the few sentences we said there. Yeah, it's a fascinating language that stretches
*  actually geographically across a very large part of this world. So there you are in 1987,
*  exchange student in the Soviet Union. What was that world like?
*  Well, that was absolutely fascinating in that period, because it's the period that's just around
*  the time at the peak of Perestroika Mikhail Gorbachev's role as president. Well, he wasn't
*  quite president at that point. It's the secretary general of the communist party of the Soviet
*  Union trying to transform the whole place. So I arrived there in September of 1987, just as
*  Gorbachev and Reagan sign the INF Treaty. It was just within weeks of them about to sign that,
*  which really ends that whole period that had shaped my entire teenage years of the end of
*  the Euro Missile Crisis by finally having an agreement on basically the rejection and
*  constraints on intermediate nuclear forces. And also at this point, Gorbachev is opening the
*  Soviet Union up. So we got all kinds of opportunities to travel in ways that we wouldn't have done before.
*  Not just in Moscow, which is where I was studying its transits into the Caucasus, to Central Asia,
*  went all the way to Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East, all the way around Moscow. And there was,
*  at this point, it was also the Kreshin-e Rus, which has become very important now. This is the
*  anniversary, the thousandth anniversary of the Christianization of Russia, which of course has
*  become a massive obsession of Vladimir Putin's, but you know, 988, because I was there 87 to 88.
*  At this point, the Russian Orthodox Church is undergoing a revival from being repressed during
*  the Soviet period. You suddenly have the church stepping out as a non-governmental organization,
*  and engaging in discussions with people about the future of religion. So that was something that I
*  wasn't expecting to witness. Also, I mean, being in Moscow, this is the cultural capital of a vast
*  empire at this point. I'd never lived in a major city before. It's the first big city I lived in.
*  I'd never been to the opera. The first time I got an opera, it's at the Bolshoi. I'd never seen a
*  ballet. I mean, I was not exactly steeped in high classical culture. When you're growing up in a
*  mining region, there's very limited opportunities for this kind of thing. I'd been in a youth
*  orchestra and a youth choir. My parents signed me up to see everything they possibly could,
*  education-wise, but it wasn't exactly any exposure to this. So I was kind of astounded by the sort of
*  wealth of the cultural experience that one could have in Moscow. But the main thing was I was really
*  struck by how the Soviet Union was on its last legs, because this was Moscow. I got this image
*  about what it would look like. I was quite, to be honest, terrified at first about what I would see
*  there, even at the big nuclear superpower. And since I got there, it was just this like as if a
*  huge weight that I'd been carrying around for years and my teenage years just disappeared,
*  because it's just ordinary people in an ordinary place, not doing great. This is the period of what
*  they call deficitne vremya, the period of deficits. But there was no food in the shops. There was very
*  little in terms of commodities, because the supply and demand parts of the economic equation were out
*  of whack, because this was total central planning. You'd go into a shop that was supposed to sell
*  boots, and there'd be just one pile of boots, all in the same size and the same color. I actually looked
*  out, because once I was in this Hungarian boot shop that was right next to where my Hall of Residence
*  was, and I was looking for a new pair of boots, and every single pair of boots in the shop were my
*  size. And they were all women's boots, they weren't men's boots at all, because there had been an
*  oversupply of boots and that size production. But you could really see here that there was something
*  wrong. In the north of England, everything was closed down. The shops were shuttered because
*  there was no demand, because everybody lost their jobs. There was massive unemployment. When I went
*  off to university in 1984, 90% youth unemployment in the UK, meaning that when kids left school,
*  they didn't have something else to go on to unless they got to university or vocational training or
*  an apprenticeship. Most people were still looking months out of leaving school. Shops were closing
*  because people didn't have any money. I had 50% male unemployment in some of the towns as the
*  steelworks closed down and the wagon works for the railways, for example, in my area. But in Moscow,
*  people in theory did have money, but there was nothing to buy. Also, the place was falling apart,
*  literally. I saw massive sinkholes open up in the street, balconies fall off buildings, one accident
*  after another. Then there was this real sense, even though the vibrancy and excitement and hope
*  of the Gorbachev period, a real sense that the Soviet Union had lost its way. Of course, it was
*  only a year or so after I left from that exchange program and I'd already started with my degree
*  program in Soviet studies at Harvard, that the Soviet Union basically unraveled. It really did
*  unravel. It wasn't like it collapsed. It was basically that there were so many debates that
*  Gorbachev had sparked off about how to reform the country, how to put it on a different path,
*  that no one was in agreement. It was basically all these fights and
*  debates and disputes among the elites at the center, as well as basically a loss of faith in
*  the system in the periphery and among the general population that in fact pulled it apart.
*  Of course, in 1991, you get Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Federation, then a constituent
*  part of the Soviet Union, together with the presidents of Ukraine and Belarus, all of these
*  being individual parts of the Soviet Union getting together and agreeing and essentially ending it.
*  And Gorbachev, basically I'm there at the peak of this whole period of experimentation and
*  thinking about the future. And within a couple of years, it's all gone and it's on a different
*  track entirely. Well, I wonder if we reran the 20th century a thousand times, how many times
*  the Soviet Union will collapse. Yeah, I wonder about that too. And I also wonder about what would
*  have happened if it didn't collapse and Gorbachev had found a different direction. We see a very
*  divisive time now in American history, the United States of America has very different cultures,
*  very different beliefs, ideologies within those states, but that's kind of the strength of
*  America. There's these little laboratories of ideas. Until though, that they don't keep
*  together. I mean, I've had colleagues who have described what's happening in the West right now
*  as a kind of soft secession with states going off in their own direction. In which states?
*  Well, these kinds of conceptions that we have now are divisions between red and blue states because
*  of the fracturing of our politics. And I'd always thought that that wouldn't be possible in somewhere
*  like the United States or many other countries as well, because there wasn't that ethnic
*  dimension. But in fact, many of the way that people talk about politics has given it that
*  kind of appearance in many respects. Because look, I mean, we know from the Soviet Union and the
*  Soviet period and from where you're from, you know, originally in Ukraine, that language
*  is not the main signifier of identity and that identity can take all kinds of other forms.
*  That's really interesting. I mean, but there has to be a deep grievance of some kind.
*  If you took a poll in any of the states in the United States, I think a very small minority
*  people would want to actually secede. Even in Texas, where I spend a lot of my time. I just,
*  I think that there is a common kind of pride of nation. You know, there's a lot of people complain
*  about government and about how the country is going. The way people complain about the
*  weather when it's raining, they say, oh, this stupid weather is raining again. But really,
*  what they mean is we're in the smock together. There's a together there that I-
*  I also feel that when I go around, because I mean, I've spent a lot of time since I wrote
*  my book in last October, in this last year going around, I find the same feeling. But you know,
*  when I traveled around the Soviet Union back in the late 1980s, I didn't get any kind of sense
*  that people wanted to see the end of the Soviet Union either. It was an elite project. There's a
*  really great book called Collapse by Vladislav Zubok, who is a professor at London School of
*  Economics at LSE. Zubok is pretty much my age and he's from the former Soviet Union, he's Russian.
*  He describes it very quite aptly about how it was kind of the elites that basically decided to pull
*  the Soviet Union apart. There is a risk of that here as well when you get partisan politics and
*  people forgetting that they're Americans and they are all in this together like a lot of the
*  population thing. But they think that their own narrow partisan or ideological precepts account
*  for more. In the Soviet case, of course, it was also a power play in a way that actually can't
*  quite play out in the United States because it was the equivalent of governors in many respects
*  who got together three of them in the case of the heads of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus,
*  who then got rid of basically the central figure of Mikhail Gorbachev. It would be a little
*  difficult to do that. The dynamic is not the same. But it does worry me of having seen all of that
*  close up in the late 1980s and the early 90s. I spent a lot of time in Russia as well as in Ukraine
*  and the Caucasus, Central Asia and other places after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But you
*  kind of see the same elite divisions here in the United States pulling in different directions and
*  straining the overall body politic and the way that national politics gets imposed on local politics
*  in ways that it certainly wasn't when I first came to the US in 1989. I didn't honestly in 1989
*  when I first came here. I didn't know anybody's political affiliation. I rarely knew their
*  religious affiliation. Obviously, race was a major phenomenon here that was a shock to me when I first
*  came. But many of the kind of the class, regional, geographic, you know, kind of political
*  dimensions that I've seen in other places, I didn't see them at play in the same way then as I do now.
*  And you take a lot of pride to this day of being nonpartisan. That said, so you served
*  for the George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations, always specializing in
*  Eurasia and Russia. You were the top presidential advisor to President, former President Donald
*  Trump on Russia and Europe and famously testified in his first impeachment trial in 2019 saying,
*  I take great pride in the fact that I'm nonpartisan foreign policy expert. So given that context,
*  what does nonpartisan mean to you? Well, I mean, it's been very careful about not putting any kind
*  of ideological lens on anything that I'm analyzing or looking out or saying about foreign policy,
*  for one thing, but also not taking kind of one stance of one party over another either.
*  To be honest, I've always found American politics somewhat confounding because both the Democratic
*  and the Republican Party are pretty big tents. I mean, they're coalitions. In Europe, it's actually
*  in some respects easier to navigate the parameters of political parties because you have quite clear
*  platforms. There's also a longer history in many respects, obviously. I mean, there's a long history
*  here in the United States of the development of the parties going back to the late 18th century.
*  But in the United Kingdom, for example, in the 20th century, the development of the mass parties,
*  it was quite easy to get a handle on. At one point in the UK, for example, the parties were real,
*  genuine mass parties with people who were properly members and took part in regular meetings and paid
*  dues. It was easy to just kind of see what they stood for. The same in Europe, when you look at
*  France and in Germany and Western Germany, of course, Italy and elsewhere. Here in the United
*  States, it's kind of pretty amorphous. The fact that you could kind of register randomly, it seems
*  to be a Democrat or Republican, like Trump did. At one point, he's a Democrat. Next thing, he's
*  Republican. Then you kind of usurp a party apparatus. But you're not vetted in any way.
*  They don't check you out to see if you have ideological coherence. You could have someone
*  like Bernie Sanders on the other side, on the left, basically calling himself a socialist and
*  running for the Democratic presidential nomination. In many respects, parties in the United States are
*  much more loose movements. It's almost like an ala carte menu of different things that people
*  can pick out. It's more over time, as I've noticed, become more like an affiliation even with the
*  sporting team. I get very shocked, by the way, that people say, well, I couldn't do this because
*  that's my side and I couldn't do anything and I couldn't support someone for the other side. I
*  have a relative in my extended family here who died in the war Republican. On a family holiday,
*  there was a book on their table that said, 100 reasons for voting for a Democrat. I said, hey,
*  are you thinking of shifting party affiliation? Then I opened the book and it's blank. It was
*  pretty funny. I had to laugh. I thought, well, there you go then. There's no way that people
*  can pull themselves out of these frames. For me, it's very important to have that independence of
*  thought. I think you can be politically engaged on the issues, but basically without taking a
*  stance that's defined by some ideology or some sense of parties on affiliation.
*  I think I tweeted about this, maybe not eloquently. The statement, if I remember correctly,
*  was something like, if you honestly can't find a good thing that Donald Trump did or a good thing
*  that Joe Biden did, you're not thinking about ideas. You just pick the tribe. It was more
*  eloquent than that, but it was basically, this is a really good test to see, are you actually thinking
*  about how to solve problems versus your red team or blue team, a sporting team? Can you
*  find a good idea of Donald Trump that you like, if you're somebody who is against Donald Trump,
*  and acknowledge it to yourself privately? Oh, that's a good idea. I'm glad he said that.
*  Or he's even asking the right kinds of questions, which he often did actually. Obviously, he put
*  them in a way that most of us wouldn't have done, but there was often questions about why is this
*  happening? Why are we doing this? We have to challenge ourselves all the time. Yeah, actually,
*  why are we doing that? Then you have to really inspect it and say whether it's actually worth
*  continuing that way or they should be doing something differently. Now, he had a more
*  destructive quality to those kinds of questions. Maybe it's the real estate developer in him that
*  was taking a big wrecking ball to all of these kinds of sacred edifices and things like that.
*  But often, if you really pay attention, he was asking a valid set of questions about why do we
*  continue to do things like this? Now, we didn't often have answers about what he was going to
*  do in response, but those questions still had to be asked and we shouldn't be just rejecting them
*  out of turn. And then another strength, the thing that people often that criticize Donald Trump will
*  say is a weakness is his lack of civility can be a strength because I feel like sometimes bureaucracy
*  functions on excessive civility. Actually, I've seen this, it's not just, it's bureaucracy in all
*  forms like in tech companies as they grow, everybody kind of, you're getting pretty good
*  salary, everyone's comfortable and there's a meeting and you discuss how to move stuff forward
*  and you don't want to be the asshole in the room that says why are we doing this this way?
*  This could be unethical, this is hurting the world, this is totally a dumb idea.
*  I could give specific examples that I have on my mind currently that are technical,
*  but the point is oftentimes the person that's needed in that room is an asshole. That's why
*  Steve Jobs worked, Elon Musk works, you have to roll in, that's what first principles thinking
*  looks like. The one bit when it doesn't work is when they start name calling, inciting violence
*  against the people they disagree with. That was kind of a problem because often when I was in the
*  administration, I had all of Europe in my portfolio as well as Russia and there were many times when
*  we were dealing with our European colleagues where he was asking some pretty valid questions about
*  well why should we do this if you're doing that? For example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the
*  United States has been opposed to Europe's reliance on gas and oil exports from Russia,
*  the Soviet Union since the 70s and 80s. Trump kept pushing this idea about why are we spending
*  so much money on NATO and NATO defense and we're all talking about this. If you're then basically
*  paying billions to Russia for gas, isn't this contradictory? Of course it was, but it was the
*  way that he did it. I actually, one instance had a discussion with a European defense minister who
*  said to me, look he's saying exactly the same things as people said before him including
*  former defense secretary Gates, it's just the way he says it. So they took offense and then as a
*  result of that they wouldn't take action because they took offense at what he said. So it was a
*  kind of then a way of could you find some other means of massaging this communication to make it
*  effective which we would always try to focus on because it's the delivery. But the actual message
*  was often spot on in those kinds of issues. I mean he was actually highlighting these ridiculous
*  discrepancies between what people said and what they actually did. And it's the delivery, the
*  charisma in the room too. I'm also understanding the power of that of a leader. It's not just about
*  what you do at a podium, but in a room with advisors, how you talk about stuff, how you
*  convince other leaders. Yeah, you don't do it through gratuitous insults and incitement
*  divinence. That's one of the things you just don't get anywhere on that front. Well, it is possible.
*  Tough measures and maximum pressure often though does work because there were often times where
*  that kind of relentless nagging about something or constantly raising it actually did have
*  results but it hadn't previously. So there's the maximum pressure if it kept on it in the right way
*  and often when we were coming in behind on pushing on issues related to NATO or other
*  things in this same sphere, it would actually have an effect. It just doesn't get talked about because
*  it gets overshadowed by all of the other kind of stuff around this and the way that he interacted
*  with people and that treated people. What was the heart, the key insights to your testimony in that
*  impeachment? Look, I think there is a straight line between that whole series of episodes
*  and the current war in Ukraine because Vladimir Putin and the people around him in the Kremlin
*  concluded that the US did not care one little bit about Ukraine and it was just a game.
*  For Trump, it was a personal game. He was basically trying to get
*  Vladimir Zelensky to do him a personal favor related to his desire to stay on in power.
*  In the 2020 election and generally they just thought that we were using Ukraine as some kind
*  of proxy or some kind of instrument within our own domestic politics as that's what it looked like.
*  I think that as a result of that, Putin took the idea away that he could do whatever he wanted.
*  We were constantly being asked even prior to this by people around Putin like Nikolai Patrushev,
*  the head of the National Security Council equivalent in Russia who we met with frequently,
*  what's Ukraine to you? We don't get it. Why do you even care? They thought that we weren't serious.
*  We weren't serious about Ukraine's territorial integrity and its independence
*  or it is a national security player. Putin also thought that he could just manipulate
*  the political space in the United States. Actually, he could because what he was doing was seeding
*  all this dissent and fueling already debates inside of US politics, the kinds of things that
*  we see just coming out now. This kind of idea that Ukraine was a burden, that Ukraine was
*  basically just trying to extract things from the United States. The Ukraine had somehow played
*  inside of US politics. Trump was convinced that the Ukrainians had done something against him,
*  that they had intervened in the elections. That was a combination of people around him trying to
*  find an excuse as to what had happened in the election to divert attention away from Russia's
*  interference in 2016 and the Russians themselves poisoning the world against Ukraine. You had a
*  confluence of circumstances there. What I was trying to get across in that testimony was the
*  national security imperative of basically getting our act together here and separating out what was
*  going on in our domestic politics from what was happening in our national security and foreign
*  policy. I think we contributed in that whole mess around the impeachment, but just the whole
*  parallel policies around Ukraine to the war that we now have that we're confronting.
*  Signaling the value we place in peace and stability in that part of the world or the
*  reverse by saying we don't care. Yeah, we seem to not care. It was just a game.
*  But the US role in that war is a very complicated one. That's one of the variables. Just on that
*  testimony, did it in part break your heart that you had to testify essentially against the
*  president of the United States? Or is that not how you saw it?
*  I don't think I would describe it in that way. I think what I was was deeply disappointed by
*  what I saw happening in the American political space. I didn't expect it. Look, I was a starry
*  eyed immigrant. I came to the United States with all of these expectations of what the place would
*  be. I'd already been disabused of some of the rosy perspectives I held in the United States.
*  I'd been shocked by the depths of racial problems. It doesn't even sum up the problems we have in
*  the United States. I couldn't get my head around it when I first came. I'd read about slavery in
*  American history, but I hadn't fully fathomed really the way that it was ripping apart the
*  United States. I mean, I'd read Alex de Tocqueville and he'd commented on this. It obviously
*  changed the way that one would have expected all this time from the 18th century onwards.
*  That was one thing that I realized that the civil rights movement and all of these acts of
*  expansion of suffrage and everything else were imperfect at best. I was born in 1965, the same
*  time as the Civil Rights Act. It was a heck of a long way still to go. I wasn't, let's just say,
*  as starry-eyed about everything as I'd been before, but I really saw an incredible competence
*  and professionalism in the US government and the election system and the integrity of it.
*  I really saw that. The United States was the gold standard for some of its institutions. I worked
*  in the National Intelligence Council and I'd seen the way that the United States had tried to address
*  the problems that it had faced in this whole botched analysis of Iraq and this terrible
*  strategic blunder of, honestly, a crime in my view of invading Iraq. The way that people were
*  trying to deal with that in the aftermath. I went into the National Intelligence Council and the DNI,
*  the Office of the Director of National Intelligence when they were coming to terms with what had gone
*  wrong in the whole analysis about Iraq in 2003, in the whole wake of people trying to pull together
*  after 9-11 and to learn all of the lessons from all of this. I saw just really genuine striving
*  and deliberation about what had gone wrong, what lessons could we learn from this? Then suddenly,
*  I found myself in this, I couldn't really describe it in any words, totally crazy looking glass,
*  thinking of Alice in Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass version of American politics.
*  I mean, I'd seen everything starting to unravel over a period of time before I'd been asked to
*  be in the administration, but I did not expect it to be that bad. I honestly didn't. I mean,
*  I'd been warned by people that this was really a very serious turn that the United States had
*  taken, but I really thought that national security would still be uppermost in people's minds. It
*  was in a lot of the people that I work with. But what I found, if you want to use that term
*  of heartbreaking, was the way in which all of these principles that I'd really bought into and
*  tried to uphold in the United States government and in the things that we were trying to do with me
*  and my colleagues was just being thrown out the window. I would have to step up in defense of them
*  and in defense of my colleagues who were being lambasted and criticized and given death threats
*  for actually standing up and doing their own jobs. In particular on the topic of Ukraine?
*  Not just on Ukraine, but on national security overall. So I mean, I'd gone through this whole
*  period even before we got to that point. I'm seeing non-partisan government officials being
*  attacked from all sides, left and right, but especially the right, and being basically accused
*  of being partisan hacks in a deep state, coup plotters, you name it. Their patriotism being
*  questioned as well. And a lot of people I work with in government, like myself,
*  naturalized Americans, a lot of them are immigrants, many were refugees, and many people
*  had fought in wars on behalf of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, being blown up. And
*  they'd put their lives on the line. They'd put their family lives on the line because they
*  believed in America. And they were just reflections of Americans from all kinds of walks of life.
*  It's what really made that cliche of America great. It wasn't whatever it was that was being
*  bandied around in these crude, crass political terms. It was just the strength of an incredible
*  set of people who've come together from all kinds of places and decided that they're going to make
*  a go of it, and that they're going to try to work towards the whole idea of the preamble of the
*  constitution towards a more perfect union. And I saw people doing that every single day, despite
*  all of the things that they could criticize about the United States, still believing in what they
*  were doing and believing in the promise of the country, which is what I felt like. And then here
*  we were, people were just treating it like a game, and they were treating people like dirt.
*  And they were just playing games with people's lives. I mean, we all had death threats.
*  People's whole careers, which were not just careers for their own self-aggrandizement,
*  but careers of public service, trying to give something back, were being shattered.
*  And I just thought to myself, I'm not going to let that happen. Because I've come from a...
*  What, are they going to send me back to Bishop Auckland in County Durham? Fine. I'm totally fine
*  to go back, because I could do something back there. But I'm not going to let this happen.
*  I've made this choice to come to America. I'm all in. And these guys are just behaving like
*  a bunch of idiots. And they're ruining it. They're ruining it for everybody.
*  So the personal attacks on competent, hardworking, passionate people who have
*  love for what they do in their heart. Similar stuff I've seen for virologists and biologists,
*  so colleagues, basically scientists in the time of COVID when there's a bunch of cynicism.
*  And there was just personal attacks, including death threats on people that work on viruses, work on
*  vaccines. Yeah. And they're going around basically with protective gear on in case somebody shoots
*  them in the street. That's just absurd. But let me zoom out from the individual people
*  Yeah.
*  And actually look at the situations that we saw in
*  George W. Bush, Obama, and Donald Trump presidencies. And I'd like to sort of criticize
*  each by not the treatment of individual people, but by the results.
*  Right. Yeah, I think that's fair. Yeah.
*  So if we look at George W. Bush, and maybe you can give me insights,
*  this is what's fascinating to me when you have extremely competent, smart, hardworking,
*  well-intentioned people, how do we as a system make mistakes in foreign policy?
*  So the big mistake you can characterize in different ways, but in George W. Bush is
*  invading Iraq, or maybe how it was invaded, or maybe how the decision process was made to invade it.
*  Again, Afghanistan, maybe not the invasion, but details around like having a plan
*  about how to withdraw all that kind of stuff. Then Barack Obama, to me, similarly, is a man who came
*  to fame early on for being somebody who was against, a rare voice against the invasion
*  of Iraq, which was actually a brave thing to do at that time. And nevertheless,
*  I don't know the numbers, but I think he was the president for years over increased drone attacks,
*  increased everything from a foreign policy perspective, the military industrial complex,
*  that machine grew in power under him, not shrunk, and did not withdraw from Afghanistan.
*  And then with Donald Trump, the criticisms that you're presenting, the personal attacks,
*  the chaos, the partisanship of people that are supposed to be nonpartisan. So if you do
*  sort of the steel man, the chaos, to make the case for chaos, maybe we need to shake up the machine,
*  throw a wrench into the engine, into the gears. And then every individual gear is going to be
*  very upset with that, because it's the wrench. It's an inefficient process, but maybe it leads
*  for government. It forces the system as a whole, not the individuals, but the system to reconsider
*  how things are done. So obviously, all of those things, the actual results are not that impressive.
*  You could have done that on the latter, shaking things up, because I'm all one for questioning
*  and trying to shake things up as well and do things differently. But the question is, if you
*  bring the whole system down with nothing, ideas of putting it to play, it's like many people,
*  I've studied the Bolshevik Revolution and many others as well. What's the pattern here that
*  actually fits into what you're talking about here is a kind of rigidity of thought on the part of
*  revolutionaries in many cases as well, and also narcissism. In fact, I think it takes a pretty
*  strong sense of yourself, kind of an own yourself to want to be president of the United States,
*  for example. We see that in many of our presidents have been narcissists to different kind of degrees.
*  You think about Lenin, for example, and people can go back and read about Lenin.
*  He formed his views when he was about 18 and he never shook them off. He never evolved. He didn't
*  have any kind of diversity of thought. And when systems go awry, it's when they don't bring in
*  different perspectives. And so, Trump, if you brought in different perspectives and actually
*  listened to them and not just believe that he himself knew better than anyone else and then
*  tried to divide everybody against each other, it would have been a different matter. It's a tragedy
*  of a completely and utterly lost set of opportunities because of the flaws in his own nature. Because,
*  I mean, again, there was all kinds of things that he could have done to shake things up. And so many
*  people around him remained completely disappointed. And of course, he divided and pitted people
*  against each other, creating so much factionalism in American politics that people have forgotten
*  they're Americans. They think that they're red or blue parts of teams. And if you go back over
*  history, that's a kind of a recipe for war and internal conflict. You go back to the Byzantine
*  Empire, for example, there's the famous episode of the Nikkei riots in Constantinople, where the
*  whole city gets trashed because the greens, the reds, the blues, and these various sporting teams
*  in the hippodrome get whipped up by political forces and they pull the place apart. And that's
*  where we've been heading on some of these trajectories. But the other point is when you
*  look back at Bush and Obama as well, there's a very narrow circle of decision-making. In Bush period,
*  it's the focus on the executive branch with Dick Cheney as the vice president being very fixated
*  on it. In Obama, it's he and the bright young things around him. He himself is intellectually,
*  one might say, arrogant in many respects. He was a very smart guy. And he's convinced that he has
*  and he ruminates over a lot of things, but he's the person who makes a lot of decisions.
*  And basically, George W. Bush used to call himself the decider as well. I mean, they're all the people
*  who make the decisions. It's not always as consultative as you might think it is. And for
*  Trump, it's like, I'm not listening to anybody at all. It's just me and whatever it is that I've
*  woken up today and I've decided to do. So I think the problem with all of our systems,
*  why we don't get results, because we don't draw upon the diversity of opinion and all the ideas
*  of people out there. You do that in science. I mean, all of my friends and relatives are
*  in science. They've got these incredible collaborations with people across the world.
*  I mean, how did we get to these vaccines for the COVID virus? Because of this incredible
*  years of collaboration and of sharing results and sharing ideas. And our whole system has become
*  ossified. We think about the congressional system, for example, as well. And there's this kind of
*  rapid turnover that you have in Congress every two years. There's no incentive for people,
*  basically, to work with others. They're constantly campaigning. They're constantly trying to appeal
*  to whatever their base is and they don't really care about, some do, of their constituents,
*  but a lot of people don't. And the Senate, it's all kind of focused on the game of legislation
*  for so many people as well. Not focusing again on that kind of sense about what are we doing
*  like scientists to kind of work together for the good of the country to push things along.
*  And also, our government also is siloed. There's not a lot of mechanisms for bringing people
*  together. There ought to be in things like the National Security Council. The National
*  Intelligence Council actually did that quite successfully at times for analysis that I saw.
*  But we don't have, you know, we have it within the National Institutes of Health, but we saw
*  the CDC break down on this, you know, kind of front. We don't have sufficient of those
*  institutions that bring people together from all kinds of different backgrounds. You know,
*  one of the other problems that we've had with government, with the federal government,
*  over, you know, state and local government, is it's actually quite small. People think that
*  the federal government's huge because we've got postal service and the military that are part of
*  it. But your actual federal government employees is a very small number. And, you know, the senior
*  executive service part of that is the older white guys, you know, who kind of come up all the way
*  over the last, you know, several decades. We have a really hard time bringing in younger people
*  into that kind of government service unless they're political hacks, you know, and they want to,
*  you know, kind of, or they're kind of looking for power and, you know, sort of influence.
*  We have a hard time getting people like yourself and other, you know, younger people kind of coming
*  in to make a career out of public service and also retaining them because, you know, people
*  with incredible skills often get poached away into the private sector. And, you know, one of
*  the people that I work with on the national security side are now at all kinds of, you know,
*  high-end political consultancies or they've gone to Silicon Valley and they've gone to this place
*  and that place because after a time as a younger person, they're not, you know, rising up particularly
*  quickly because there's a pretty rigid way of looking at the hierarchies and the promotion
*  schemes. And they're also getting lambasted by everybody. People are like, you know, public
*  servants. They're not really public servants. There's this whole lack and loss of a kind of
*  a faith in public service. And, you know, the last few years have really done a lot of damage.
*  We need to revitalize our government system to get better results. We need to bring more people
*  in even if it's, you know, for a period of time, not just through expensive contracts for, you know,
*  the big consulting companies and, you know, other entities that do government work out there,
*  but getting, you know, people in for a period of time, expanding some of these management
*  fellowships and the White House fellows and, you know, bringing in, you know, scientists,
*  you know, from the outside, giving, you know, that kind of opportunity for collaboration
*  that we see in other spheres. I think that's actually one of the biggest roles
*  for a president that for some reason during the election that's never talked about is how good
*  are you at hiring and creating a culture of, like, attracting the right, I mean, basically,
*  chief hire. When you think of a CEO, like, the great CEOs are, I mean, maybe people don't talk
*  about it that often, but they do more often for CEOs than they do for presidents is like, how good
*  are you at building a team? Well, we make it really difficult because of the political process. I
*  mean, and also because we have so many political appointments, we ought to have less, to be honest.
*  I mean, if you look at other governments around the world, you know, that are smaller, it's much
*  easier for them to hire people in. You know, some of the most successful governments are much smaller
*  and it's not that I say that they're, you know, the government is necessarily too big, but it's
*  just thinking about each unit in a different way. We shouldn't be having so many political appointments.
*  We should kind of find more professional appointments, more non-parties on appointments
*  because, you know, every single administration that we've had over the last,
*  let's say span of presidencies, they have jobs that are unfulfilled because they can't get their
*  candidates through Congress and the Senate because of all the kind of political games that are being
*  played. I know loads of people have just been held up because it's just on the whim of, you know,
*  some member of Congress, even though the actual position that they want is really technical
*  and doesn't really care about what, you know, what political preference they particularly have.
*  So I think we have to try to look at the whole system of governments in the way that we would
*  over, you know, other professional sectors and to try to think about this as just as you said there,
*  that this is a government that's actually running our country. This is an operating system and you
*  wouldn't operate it like that if you were, you know, looking at in any kind of rational way.
*  It shouldn't be so ideologically or partisan tainted. So you're at every level anyway. So I
*  would actually just say make a bid for a more non-partisan approach to a lot of the parts of
*  government. You can still kind of bring in, you know, the political and premature, but also you
*  have to explain to people writ large in America as well that this is your government and that
*  actually you could also be part of this. You know, things like the Small Business Administration,
*  the US Department of Agriculture, you know, all these kinds of things that actually people
*  interact with, but they don't even know it, the postal service, you know, all of these things.
*  I mean, people actually, when you ask them about different functions of government, they have a
*  lot of support for it, the National Park Service, you know, for example, it's just when you talk
*  about government in an abstract way, like, oh, too much bloated, you know, not efficient and
*  effective. But if you kind of bring it down more to the kind of local and federal levels, that's
*  kind of, you know, when people really see it. If people could see kind of themselves reflected,
*  and many of the people have gone into public service, I think that they would have a lot
*  more support for it. More like superstars, like individuals that are like big on social media,
*  big in the public eye and having fun with it and showing cool stuff that it's not.
*  Right now, a lot of people see government as basically partisan warfare. And then
*  it just, it makes it unpleasant to do the job. It makes it uninspiring for people looking in
*  from outside about what's going on inside government, all of it, the whole thing. But you
*  are, you know, just with all due respect, you're a pretty rare individual in terms of nonpartisanship.
*  Like, it's just actually your whole life story, the humbling aspect of your upbringing and
*  everything like that. Do you think it's possible to have a lot of nonpartisan experts in government?
*  Like, can you be a top presidential advisor on Russia for 10 years, for 15 years, and remain
*  nonpartisan? I think you can. I don't think that's advisable, though, by the way, because I mean,
*  I don't think anybody should be there. So your first advice is to fire yourself after 10 years.
*  Well, you should definitely have a terminal, but it's just like you should in everything,
*  right? I mean, it's just like tenure in university. Well, we all have term limits.
*  Yeah, you kind of, you know, we do, we have natural term limits, but you know, you're kind of,
*  you know, basically bottling it up for other people. I mean, you know, what I'm trying to do
*  now, I'm not 57 now, and I always try to work with, you know, people from different generations to me,
*  just like, you know, I've really benefited from these, you know, kind of mentorships of people
*  are older, you can, you know, mentor up and well and mentor down. I mean, I would, you know, try to
*  get people from different backgrounds and different generations to work together in teams.
*  Honestly, I'd like to more team networked kind of approach to things, the kind of things that you
*  get again in science, right? I mean, all these ideas are going to come from all kinds of different
*  perspectives. Age and experience does count for something. But you know, fresh ideas and coming
*  in and looking at a problem from a different perspective, and seeing something that somebody
*  else hasn't seen before. I mean, I just, you know, kind of love working in an environment with
*  all kinds of different people and people who don't agree with you, you need people
*  to take you on and say, absolute, that's crap. Kind of, where did you come up with that from?
*  And they go, hang on, well, explain to me why you think so. And then, you know, you have this kind
*  of iterative process back and forth. I mean, I would always encourage my colleagues to tell me
*  when they thought I was wrong. I mean, sometimes I didn't agree because I didn't see the, you know,
*  the reasoning. But other times I'd be like, they're right. You know, that was a complete mistake. I
*  need to admit that. And, you know, kind of, we need to figure out a different way of doing things.
*  But the one point I do want to get across is there were a lot of people who were non-partisan that
*  I worked with. I mean, honestly, in most of the jobs that I had up until more recently, I had no
*  idea about people's political affiliation. It's just when you get into this kind of highly charged
*  partisan environment, they kind of force people, you know, to make decisions. And when you have,
*  you know, one political party or political faction that's trying to usurp power, it does make it
*  quite difficult. I mean, that's the situation that we're in right now. And, you know, we're
*  seeing some of the things happening in the United States. I've seen and studied in other settings,
*  or seen for myself happening. You know, when you have a president who wants to cling onto power,
*  you know, you've got to call that out. You know, is that a partisan act or is that a kind of,
*  you know, defense of that larger political system that you're part of? You know, so I think we've
*  got to recognize that even if you're not partisan, you can be politically engaged. And, you know,
*  sometimes you just have to stand up there and speak out, which is, you know, what I did and
*  what others did as well. None of those people who spoke out, you know, can initially saw that as a
*  partisan act, even if some of them since then have decided to make political choices they hadn't made
*  before. Because, you know, the situation actually forced people into, you know, taking sides. It's
*  very hard to still stay above the fray when you've got, you know, someone who's trying to perpetrate
*  a coup. Yeah, just to linger on that. I think it's hard and it's the courageous thing to do
*  to criticize a president and not fall into partisanship after. Because the whole world
*  will assume if you criticize Donald Trump, that you're clearly a Democrat. And so they will just,
*  everybody will criticize you for being a Democrat. And then so you're now stuck in that. So you're
*  going to just embrace that role. But to still walk the nonpartisan route after the criticism,
*  that's the hard road. So not let the criticisms break you into, you know, into a certain kind of
*  ideological set of positions. I mean, our political system needs revitalization. We need to be taking
*  a long hard look at ourselves here. And I think what people are calling out for, look, there's a
*  vast wave of population like me who are unaffiliated. You know, maybe some lean in one direction over
*  another. And unaffiliated doesn't mean you don't have views about things and political opinions.
*  And you know, you may sound quite extreme on some of those, you know, either from a left or
*  right perspective. What people are looking for is kind of an articulation, you know, things in a kind
*  of a clear way that they can get a handle on. And they're also looking for a representation.
*  Somebody is going to be there for you. You know, not part of a kind of a rigid team that you're
*  excluded from. You're the ins and the outs. But what people are looking at now, they're looking
*  at that in the workplace because they're not finding that in politics. You're actually getting
*  workers, you know, pushing the people talk about the rise of the workers, people just saying,
*  hang on a sec, you know, the most important space that I'm in right now is my workplace,
*  because that's where my benefits are from. They're not coming from the state. I mean,
*  that's a peculiarity of the United States system. You know, the Britain, you've got the National
*  Health Service, and you've got all the kind of national wide benefits. You know, you're not
*  tethered to your employer like you are in the United States. But here now we're asking people,
*  you know, people are pushing for more representation, they're asking to be
*  represented within their workplace. Be it Starbucks, where baristas are, you know,
*  and other Starbucks employees are trying to unionize. We have unions among our research
*  assistants, the Brookings Institution, where I am, you know, kind of teaching assistants in
*  big universities doing the same kind of thing as well, because they want to have their voice heard.
*  They want to kind of play a larger role and they want to have change. And they're often pushing
*  companies or the institutions they work for to make that change because they don't see it happening
*  in the political sphere. It's not just enough to go out there and protest in the street,
*  but if you want something to happen, that's why you're seeing big corporations playing
*  a bigger role as well. Yeah, and of course, there's, you know, this is a longer discussion.
*  There's also criticisms of that mechanisms of unions to achieve the giving of a voice to people.
*  This goes back to my own experience growing up in northern England. The Durham miners that I was
*  part of for generations, you know, first person in my family not in the mines on my dad's side,
*  they created their own association. It wasn't a union per se at the very beginning.
*  Later, they became part of the National Miners Union. They lost their autonomy and independence
*  as a result of that. But what they did was they pooled their resources. They set up their own
*  parliament so they could all get together. Literally, they built a parliament, you know,
*  opened in the same time as World War I and where they all got together because they didn't have the
*  vote. They didn't have suffrage at the time because they didn't have any money, you know,
*  so they couldn't pay the tax and they couldn't run for parliament. And this is, you know,
*  the origins of the organized labor parties later. But they create this association so they could
*  talk about how they could deal with things of their own communities and have a voice in the
*  things that mattered. You know, education, improving their work conditions. It wasn't like
*  what you think about some kind of like big political trade union with, you know, left-wing,
*  you know, kind of ideas. In fact, they actually tried to root out later after the Bolshevik
*  Revolution in the Soviet Union, even when they were still having ties with places like the miners of
*  Donbass in the 1920s, Trotskyites and, you know, kind of Leninists and, you know, communists.
*  They were more focused on how to improve their own well-being, you know, what they called the
*  welfare. They had some welfare societies where they were kind of trying to think, and that's kind of
*  what baristas in Starbucks want or workers in Amazon. They're looking about their own
*  well-being. It's not just about pay and work conditions. It's about what it means to be part
*  of this larger entity because you're not feeling that same kind of connection to politics, you know,
*  at the moment because, you know, you're being told by a representative, sorry, I don't represent you
*  because you didn't vote for me. You know, if you're not a Democrat, you're not a Republican,
*  you're not red, you know, you're not blue, you're not mine. And so people are saying,
*  well, I'm in this workplace. This is kind of my collective. You know, this is, you know, therefore,
*  this is where I'm going to have to try to push to make change. So, I mean, this is kind of happening
*  here and we have to, you know, realize that, you know, we've kind of gone in a way full circle back
*  to that, you know, kind of period of the early emergence of sort of mass labor and, you know,
*  the way that that's where the political parties that we know today and, you know, the kind of
*  early unions came out of as well. This sort of feeling of a mass society but where people weren't
*  really able to get together and implement or push for change. You know, with unions on a small scale
*  and a local scale, it's like every good idea on a small scale can become a bad idea on a large scale.
*  So like, marriage is a beautiful thing, but at a large scale, it becomes the marriage industrial
*  complex that tries to make money off of it, combined with the lawyers that try to make money
*  off the divorce. It just becomes this caricature of a thing or like Christmas and the holidays.
*  It's like, it's just... I don't disagree, but what I'm saying is there's people are basically
*  looking for something here and, you know, kind of, this is why, I mean, I myself am starting to think
*  about much more local, you know, kind of solutions to a lot of these, you know, kind of problems.
*  It's again, the team networked approach. On the impeachment, looking back, because you're
*  part of it, you get to experience it. Do you think they strengthened or weakened this nation?
*  I think it weakened in many respects just the way that it was conducted. I mean, there's a new book
*  coming out by a couple of journalists in the Washington Post. I haven't actually seen it yet,
*  but I really did, you know, kind of worry that myself that it became a spectacle.
*  And although it actually, I think, in many respects was important in terms of an exercise
*  of civic responsibility and, you know, give people a big massive lesson in civics. Everyone's kind of
*  running out and looking up the whole process of impeachment and what that meant and congressional
*  prerogatives. I was as well, I was, you know, running off myself and, you know, trying to learn
*  an enormous amount about it because I was in the middle of all of this. That it didn't ultimately
*  show responsibility and accountability. And that in itself was kind of was weakened because
*  on both sides, there was a lot of partisan politics. I mean, I think that there was a
*  dereliction of duty in many respects. I mean, especially, I have to say on the part of
*  Republican members of Congress who were, you know, kind of, they should have been embracing,
*  you know, Congress's prerogatives. You could have, you know, kind of basically done this in
*  something of a different way. But the whole thing is because it was this larger atmosphere
*  of polarized, not even polarized, but fractured politics. And I was deeply disappointed,
*  I have to say, in many of the members of Congress on the Republican side. I mean,
*  there's a lot of grandstanding that I really didn't like a bit on the Democratic side either.
*  And not admitting to mistakes and, you know, not kind of addressing head on, you know, the fact that
*  they'd, you know, kind of been pushing for Trump to be impeached and talking about being an
*  illegitimate president, you know, kind of right from the very beginning. And that, you know,
*  as a result of that, a lot of people just saw this as kind of a continuation of political games,
*  coming out of the 2016 election. But on the Republican side, it was just a game.
*  There was people I knew who were, you know, basically, you know, one point one of them
*  winked at me, you know, in the middle of this, you know, kind of impeachment. It's just like,
*  don't take this personally, you know, this is a game. And I just thought this isn't a game.
*  And that's why I think that it, you know, kind of weakened because, I mean, again, on the outside,
*  it weakened us, the whole process weakened us in the eyes of the world, because again,
*  the United States was the gold standard. And I do think, I mean, again, in the terms of the larger
*  population, although a lot of people, they did actually see the system, you know, standing up,
*  trying to do something to help people account, but there still was that element of circus and a big
*  political game and people being careless with the country. But I do think that the Democrats
*  were the instigators of the circus. So as it's perhaps subtle, but there's a different way you
*  talk about issues or concerns about accountability when you care about your country, when you love
*  your country, when you love the ideals and when you versus when you just want to win.
*  And stick it to the other side. No, I agree. I mean, there were people who I actually thought
*  managed that, that made it about the country rather than about themselves.
*  But I guess there's no incentive to do that.
*  Yeah, there were others who did a lot of grandstanding. Yeah. And that's another
*  problem of our political incentive structures, that the kind of sense of accountability and
*  responsibility tends to be personal, you know, people, whether people decide to do it or not,
*  it's not institutional, if that makes sense. We've had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of
*  that sense. Now I took an oath of office, and I'm assuming that most of them did too.
*  You know, I had to be sworn in, you know, when I took those positions, I took that seriously,
*  but I already took an oath of citizenship. There's, you know, presumably you did too,
*  you know, you kind of started to become an American citizen. It's not something you take
*  on lightly. And, you know, that's why I felt this deep sense of responsibility all the time,
*  which is why I went into the administration in the first place. I mean, I got a lot of flak for it
*  because, you know, I thought, well, look, I've been asked, and there's a real issue here after
*  the Russian interference and the whole influence operation in the 2016 elections. And I knew what
*  was going on, and I should do something. You know, if not me, then, you know, okay, someone else will
*  go and do it, but can I live with myself just sitting on the sidelines and criticizing what
*  people are doing, you know, and kind of worrying about this? Or am I actually going to muck in
*  there and, you know, just go and do something? It's like seeing your house on fire and you see
*  that, you know, okay, this is pretty awful and dangerous, but I could go in there and do something.
*  To clarify, the house on fire meaning the cyber war that's going on or cyber attacks, the cyber
*  security? Well, in 2016, you know, when the Russians had interfered in the election,
*  you know, I mean, basically, this was a huge national security crisis. And our politics,
*  we'd gone mad as a result of it. And we, in fact, we were making the situation worse.
*  And I felt that I could, you know, kind of at the time, maybe I could do something here. I could try
*  to clarify. I could, you know, work with others who I knew in the government from previous stints in
*  the government to push back against this and try to make sure it didn't happen again. And look,
*  and I also didn't have this, you know, mad, you know, kind of crazy ideological view of Russia
*  either. I mean, I knew the place. I knew the people had been sitting a long time and quite
*  calm about it. I don't take it personally. It's not kind of an extension of self. It's, you know,
*  something I've spent a long time trying to understand for myself going back to that very
*  beginning of why were the Russians trying to blow us up? There must be an explanation. There was.
*  It was a very complicated and complex explanation. It wasn't as simple as how it sounded. And also,
*  there's a long tail to 2016, you know, Putin's perceptions, the kind of things that he thought
*  were going on, you know, the whole way that what they did was actually fairly straightforward.
*  They'd done this before in the Soviet period during the Cold War, classic influence operation.
*  It just had gone beyond the bounds of anything they could have anticipated because of social
*  media and just a confluence of circumstances in the United States as well. We were very fragile
*  and vulnerable. And I remember at one point having a discussion with the Russian ambassador
*  where, you know, we were complaining about the Russian intervention. He said,
*  are you telling me that the United States is a banana republic that it's so vulnerable to
*  these kinds of efforts? He actually looked genuinely mystified, although obviously he was
*  probably part of a kind of political schtick there. But he had a point. The United States had never
*  been that vulnerable as it suddenly was in 2016. And in the time that I was in government, and
*  going back to what you asked about the whole impeachment and the whole exercise in Congress,
*  that vulnerability was as stark as it ever could be. Our domestic politics were as much a part of
*  the problem as anything else. They were the kindling to all of the kind of the fires.
*  Putin didn't start any of this other kind of problems domestically, he just took advantage
*  of them and, you know, basically added a bit of an accelerant here and there.
*  Yeah, the interference, I mean, that's a much longer discussion
*  because it's also for me, technically fascinating. I've been playing with the idea of just launching
*  like a million bots, but they're doing just positive stuff and just being kind.
*  Yeah, I always kind of wonder if it is possible to do something on this scale that's positive,
*  because, you know, a lot of people seem to be able to use all of this for pretty negative
*  effect. You've got to kind of hope that you could do this, use the same networks for positive effect.
*  I think that's actually where a lot of the war, I think from the original hackers to today,
*  what gives people like me and I think a lot of people that in the hacking community pleasure
*  is to do something difficult, break through the systems and do the ethical thing.
*  Right. So do the, because if there's something broken about the system, you want to break through
*  all the rules and do something that you know in your heart is the right thing to do. I mean,
*  that's what Aaron Schwartz did with releasing journals and publications that were behind pay
*  walls to the public and the rest of foreign that committed. But to me, it's fascinating because I,
*  I maybe you can actually educate me, but I felt that the Russian interference
*  in terms of social engineering, in terms of bots, all that kind of stuff, I feel like that was more
*  used for political bickering than to actually understand the national security problem.
*  Because I would like to know the actual numbers involved in the influence. I would like to,
*  I mean, obviously, hopefully people now understand that better than are trying to defend the national
*  security of this country. But it's just, it felt like, like, for example, if I launch one bot
*  and then, and then just contact somebody at the New York Times saying, I launched this one bot,
*  they'll just say, uh, MIT scientists hacks, you know, and then that
*  will spread. But that's exactly what happened. It was, you know, kind of, I think that, you know,
*  Putin and some of the people around him understood because, again, propaganda state, they spend an
*  awful lot of time thinking about how you, you know, basically put out your own content and how you
*  get maximum effect through performance. Putin himself is a, you know, political pop performance
*  artist. I mean, Trump understood exactly the same thing. They were actually operating in parallel,
*  not in collusion, but in parallel. You know, basically Trump understood how to get lots of
*  free air time, you know, how to get himself at the center of attention. Putin, you know, did that
*  through a kind of, I think, a less organic kind of way. You know, a lot of people working around him.
*  That's the old, you know, Bolshevik, agitprop, and, you know, kind of then the whole Soviet
*  propaganda machine. And, you know, Putin kind of growing up in that kind of environment and having,
*  you know, the kind of the Kremlin press office and all the kind of people around him got kind of a
*  massive machine, knew how that worked. I mean, they haven't done what the Chinese did in Russia
*  of like, you know, blocking everything and having a big firewall. It was kind of putting out lots
*  of content, getting into the, you know, the sort of center of attention. Trump's doing the same kind
*  of thing. And the Russians understood that, you know, if you put a bit of things out there and
*  then you call up the New York Times and people are going to run with it. And what they wanted was the
*  perception that they had actually swayed the election. They loved it. This was the huge
*  mistake of the Democrats and everything. I kept trying to push against this. No, they did not
*  elect Donald Trump. Americans elected Donald Trump and, you know, the Electoral College was a key
*  part. Vladimir Putin didn't make that up. You know, and basically I also remember, you know, at one
*  point the Russian ambassador, you know, talking to me about when we were doing the standard, you know,
*  here we are, we're lodging our complaint about the interference. You know, he didn't, he basically
*  said, well, we didn't, you know, kind of invent Comey and, you know, basically the, you know,
*  the decision to reopen, you know, Hillary Clinton's emails or, you know, kind of Anthony Weiner and,
*  you know, kind of his, you know, emails on his computer. And I was like, yeah, he's right. I
*  mean, you know, there were plenty of things in our own system that created chaos and tipped the
*  election. Not, you know, kind of what the Russians did, but, you know, it's obviously easier to blame
*  the Russians and blame yourself when, you know, things are kind of, or those random forces and
*  those random factors, because people couldn't understand what had happened in 2016. There was
*  no hanging chads like 2000 where there was, you know, kind of a technical problem that actually,
*  you know, ended with the intervention of the Supreme Court. There was, you know, pure and simple,
*  the Electoral College at work and a candidate that nobody expected, including the Republicans in the
*  primaries, you know, to end up getting kind of elected or put forward, you know, different 2016,
*  suddenly becoming the president. And they needed a meta explanation. It was much better to say
*  Vladimir Putin had done it and Vladimir Putin and, you know, the Kremlin guys were like, oh my god,
*  yeah, fantastic. Champagne, cocks popping, this is great, our chaos agent. They knew they hadn't
*  done it, but they'd love to take credit for it. And so, you know, the very fact that other people
*  couldn't explain these complex dynamics to themselves basically dovetails beautifully with
*  Vladimir Putin's attempts to be the kind of the Kremlin gremlin in the system. And he's, you know,
*  basically was taking advantage of that forevermore. And I wanted, you know, to basically try to
*  work with others to cut through that. And the thing is then, you know, people lost
*  faith in the integrity of the election system because people were out there, you know, suggesting
*  that the Russians had actually distorted the elections. People wrote books about that. They
*  said, you know, that they hacked the system when, you know, they were trying to hack our minds.
*  But again, we were the fertile sole for this. I mean, we know this from Russian history,
*  the role of the Bolsheviks, you know, the whole 1920s and 1930s with Stalin, the fellow travelers,
*  and the, you know, socialist, you know, international. I mean, the Russians and the
*  Soviets, I mean, we've been at this for years about kind of pulling, you know, kind of people
*  along and into kind of a broader frame. But it didn't mean that they were influencing, you know,
*  directly the politics of countries, you know, writ large, that plenty of interventions. It's
*  just that we were somehow, it was a confluence of events, a perfect storm. We were somehow
*  exquisitely vulnerable because of things that we had done to ourselves. It was what Americans
*  were doing to themselves that was the issue. You think that's the bigger threat than large scale
*  bot armies? Those can be a threat. Obviously they do have an impact, but it's how people process
*  information. It's kind of like the lack of critical thinking. I'm just not on the internet to that
*  extent. I had to go looking for information. I'm not on social media. I'm into social media,
*  but not by myself. You know, I don't put myself out there. I'm not, I haven't got a Twitter feed.
*  You don't have a Twitter one. Yeah. But there's a, you have a fan club. I have all kinds of strange
*  things. It's Fiona Hills cat, which I kind of like, you know, occasionally have people send things to
*  me. You have so many fans. It's hilarious. What I try to do is just be really critical. I mean,
*  my mom sends me stuff and I'm like, what is this? It's just, you know, your own mother can be as
*  much of an agent of misinformation as, you know, kind of Vladimir Putin. I mean, we're all, you know,
*  kind of, we all have to really think about what it is we're reading. There's one thing from my
*  childhood that was really important. I mean, I always think every kid in school should have this.
*  My next door neighbor, who was, he was actually very active in the, in the labor party. And he was,
*  you know, kind of really interested in the way that opinion, you know, shape people's political
*  views. And he was Welsh. He was a native Welsh speaker. So, you know, he was always trying to
*  explore English and how, you know, there was kind of the reach of, you know, the English culture and,
*  you know, kind of, and how it was kind of shaping the way that people thought. And he used to read
*  every single newspaper, you know, from all the different spectrums, which was quite easy to do,
*  you know, back in the 70s and 80s, because there weren't that many in the UK context. And every
*  Sunday, he would get all the different Sunday papers from all the different kind of ideological
*  vantage points. And then when I got to be a teenager, he'd invite me to look at them with him.
*  Because he was my godfather and he was just an incredible guy. And he was just super interesting
*  and, you know, kind of culturally, you know, an outsider always kind of looking in. And he basically
*  ran through, you know, what the Guardian looked at, the Observer, the Daily Mail, the Sun, you know,
*  kind of all of these, you know, the Telegraph, all of these newspapers and how you could tell,
*  you know, their different vantage points. And of course, it's complicated to do that now. I mean,
*  in this, you know, incredibly extensive media space, I look at what it is that they're saying.
*  And then I try to, you know, read around it and then, you know, look at what other people are
*  saying and why they're saying it and who are they, what's their context. And that was kind of basically
*  what I was taught to look at. And I think everybody should have that. And certainly that's something
*  that people in politics that are in charge of directing policy should be doing. They should be.
*  Not getting lost in the, in the sort of the hysteria that can be created.
*  Like, it does seem that the American system somehow, not the political system, just humans
*  love drama. Very good. Like the Hunter Biden laptop story. There's always like
*  one, two, three stories somehow that we just pick that we're just going to, this is the stuff we're
*  going to fight about for this election. And everyone's got an opinion on it. Everybody.
*  Yeah. And it's the most important, like Hillary Clinton's emails, the Russians hacked the election.
*  Yeah. We had John Podesta's pasta recipes for a while, you know, that we were kind of all
*  obsessing over. I don't know, people running out and trying them out, you know, or something like
*  that. And there's fun. I mean, there's all the best conspiracy theories about Giuliani.
*  I just love it. We just pick a random story. Sometimes it's ridiculous. And it detracts from
*  what the larger question should be, which is about the family members of, you know, senior
*  officials and whether they should be anywhere near any of the issues that they're, you know,
*  there's ethics, there's government ethics and things that, you know, kind of across the board,
*  but there's a bigger story in there, but that becomes a distraction. It's a look over there.
*  You know, the oldest trick in the book, you know, kind of idea.
*  Yes. And politicians are really good at that because it detracts from the larger question
*  because every single member of Congress and, you know, government officials, their family should
*  be nowhere near anything they're doing. Well, that I could push back and disagree on. I mean,
*  Well, it depends on what they do if they're making money out of it, you know, and kind of basically
*  being in business is what I mean, you know, kind of this is a, this is an issue. So it's not, you
*  know, Hunter Biden on his own. It's, you know, kind of basically the kids have, you know, the Trump
*  family that, you know, you name it. Yeah. In general like that. I just think it's funny. Like
*  there's a lot of families that, you know, they work very closely together, do business together.
*  It's very successful. I get very weird about that. It, it just feels like you're not. In fact,
*  I don't even like hiring or working with friends. Initially you make friends with the people you
*  work with, but that's right. No, I have the same worries as well because it kind of clouds, you
*  know, I would encourage, you know, my daughter to do something completely different, right? Not going
*  to the same field. No, look, it's different if you're, you know, in science or, you know, mathematics
*  or something like this and, you know, maybe, you know, kind of, you've got a family member, you're
*  kind of building on some of their theories and ideas, you know, if Albert Einstein had a, you know,
*  kind of an offspring who was in mathematics and took, you know, as far as thinking, you know,
*  further, that would be very different. But if it's, you know, kind of you're in business and other
*  things and it's just, you know, it's the nepotism problem that, you know, one has there. Well,
*  science says that too. In a space of ideas. Yeah, that's what they do. If they're not, people aren't
*  coming in and building on the ideas in a constructive way. Right. But even for son,
*  daughter of Einstein, you want to think outside the box of the previous. Yeah, well, that's what I'm
*  meaning, but I mean, it's just, but they shouldn't be sort of told, no, sorry, you can't go and study
*  math because, you know, whatever physics, you know, because of. But a lot of that, you can't
*  actually make it into law. Well, you could, I suppose, but honestly, if you do that kind of
*  thing, you should be transparent. There should be just an honesty about it. It gets back to what I
*  was talking about before we need diversity of views and diversity of thinking, and you can't
*  have other things. It's like being partisan or, you know, rooting just for a team. You know,
*  if something is going to cloud your judgment or constrain the way you think about things and become,
*  you know, kind of a barrier to moving on out. Look, that's what we see in the system around
*  Putin. It's kind of kleptocratic and it's, you know, it's filled with nepotism. Although they're
*  kind of like the people who you kind of see out there in prominent positions that the sons or
*  daughters of, including Putin himself. I mean, that's when a system has degenerated. And that's,
*  you know, kind of, and I suppose in a way, this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system. But
*  again, it's just a diversion from, you know, kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications of
*  things that we're discussing. So critics on the left often use the straw man of TDS, Trump
*  Derangement Syndrome. Why does Donald Trump arouse so much emotion in people? It's just the nature of
*  the person. I mean, I don't feel particularly emotional about him. I mean, he's kind of a,
*  he's a very flawed guy, to be honest. And this may seem bizarre. I felt sorry for him
*  because this guy is so vulnerable, so wrapped up in himself that, I mean, he's just exquisitely
*  open to manipulation. And I saw people taking advantage of him all the time. He has zero
*  self-awareness. I mean, I kept thinking to myself, my God, if this guy didn't have this entourage
*  around him, how would he function? I mean, I felt sorry for us as well. I mean, that he ended up
*  being our president because that should not have happened. I mean, in terms of character and in
*  terms of fit for the job. Although I saw this kind of over a period of time, but I didn't feel
*  any sense of derangement around him. It didn't drive me nuts in that way. I just became,
*  I was just very worried about the impact that he was having on many particular issues.
*  Here's the important thing. So what I noticed with people that criticize Donald Trump
*  is they get caught up in the momentum of it and they're unable to see,
*  first of all, let's start with some ground truth, which is
*  approximately half the country voted for the guy. Right?
*  Yep. And more voted in 2020 than voted in 2016 for him.
*  Yep.
*  And I just feel like people don't load that in when they're honestly criticizing-
*  A lot of those people didn't vote for him and his personality and often could, because I know a lot
*  of people who voted for him, first time and second time. And they could disassociate
*  all of the features of Donald Trump that drives other people nuts from what they thought that an
*  actual fact he could achieve in terms of, and it wasn't just this kind of sense about, well,
*  I couldn't possibly vote for a Democrat. Sometimes it's just like, well, look, he shakes things up
*  and we need things to be shaken up.
*  And some people might have voted for him personally.
*  See, this one-
*  Yeah, some of them did as well, but I'm just saying that not all of them did either.
*  Or we don't know that data. That's the thing.
*  But yeah, I can't say how much it is. I'm just saying anecdotally, I know people who voted for
*  him because he's him from the charisma and others who voted because he's shaking things up and he's
*  keeping people on their toes and we need that idea.
*  But the way to avoid Trump derangement syndrome, to me, me as a doctor, I'm sort of prescribing to
*  the patients on this syndrome, this issue, is I feel like you have to empathize with the people.
*  You have to imagine in your mind all the different strengths that the people who have voted for
*  Donald Trump see and really understand it, really feel it, walk around with it, and then criticize.
*  I just feel like people get lost in this bubble of criticism in their own head.
*  I forget the tribe you're in or whatever. In their own head, they're not able to see
*  half this country that we're a part of voted for the person.
*  Same with Biden. Half the country voted for the guy.
*  The people that are criticizing Biden and they're doing this.
*  The way Biden is currently criticized is not based on policy.
*  It's based on personal stuff similar like to Trump.
*  Yeah, I know it is. I mean, that's what people do.
*  Look, I think part of that is, I mean, first of all, I want to say I completely agree with you about
*  understanding where people are coming from.
*  And I think it's very important for people to listen to other people and their views.
*  I try to do that all the time, try to learn from that.
*  I mean, everybody's got a perspective and a context. We all live in a certain context.
*  We're all living in history, our own personal histories matter a lot, and also the larger
*  context and environment in which we're living in and where we live and who we live with.
*  And the kinds of lives that we lead as well, those are all extraordinarily important.
*  I mean, I know that from myself. Everything that I've done in my life has been shaped by
*  where I came from, who I was, my family, and the way that we looked at things.
*  You can't take yourself out of that.
*  You can do it in some, like a science or something else, but it's still your own views and maybe
*  some of the ideas that you have in pursuing an experiment might have been shaped by your larger
*  context, depending on what it is that you work on.
*  But the other thing is the nature of the political system.
*  The presidential election is like a personality contest, a beauty contest.
*  It's like a kind of a referendum on one person or another.
*  It's kind of like what we see in Russia, honestly, with Putin or not Putin or
*  Putin and Putin before. It's all about Putin and what do you think about Putin?
*  It's all about what the president should be doing and what their policies are.
*  That's kind of the bizarreness of the US political system.
*  We've just seen this happening in the United Kingdom.
*  You've got this core of a couple of hundred thousand people in the Conservative Party.
*  You've just voted for three leaders in a row, the rest of the country.
*  And then they're just looking at whether they like that personality and what they say to
*  them rather than what they're necessarily going to do for the country, which is pretty absurd.
*  And again, the presidency is a weird hybrid in the United States.
*  We were talking before about the person who should be running the country,
*  so the chief executive or the prime minister in another setting.
*  But we don't think of it like that.
*  We often think about whether we like the guy or not, or we'd like to hang out with him.
*  One of my younger relatives, when I said, so why did you vote for Trump?
*  He said, well, he was great. He was funny.
*  I went to his rallies. I got kind of charged up.
*  And I said, could you see yourself voting for Biden?
*  No, he's too old.
*  And I simply know he's only just a little bit older than Trump.
*  Or he's the same age as your grandma.
*  Do you think your grandma's older?
*  No, not at all.
*  But it's just this kind of perception he's boring.
*  People are actually sometimes basically being kind of motivated by just a feeling,
*  you know, kind of that kind of sense, because that's the sort of nature of the presidency.
*  It's this kind of how you feel about yourself as an American,
*  or how you feel about the country writ large,
*  the kind of symbol of the state.
*  Look, you know, in Britain, you had Queen Elizabeth II, and everybody,
*  you know, seemed to, for the most part, not everyone, I guess,
*  but most people respected her as a person, as a personality,
*  as a kind of symbol of the state.
*  Even if they actually didn't really like the institution of the monarchy,
*  there was something, you know, kind of about that particular personality
*  that you were able to, you know, kind of relate to in that context.
*  But in the United States, we've got all of that rolled into one,
*  the head of state, the symbol of the state, the kind of queen, the king, the kind of idea.
*  The chief executive, the kind of prime ministerial role,
*  and then the commander in chief of the military.
*  It's all things, you know, kind of at once.
*  But ultimately, for a lot of people, it's just how you feel about that person.
*  Oh, I couldn't go vote for them because of this, or I couldn't vote for them because of that.
*  And in 2016, you know, Hillary Clinton actually did win the election
*  in terms of the popular vote.
*  So it wasn't that, you know, kind of people wouldn't vote for a woman.
*  I mean, more people voted for her on the popular level,
*  not obviously, you know, through the electoral college and the electoral college vote.
*  It wasn't just, you know, gender or something like that,
*  but it was an awful lot of things for people who found Trump attractive
*  because he was sticking up the big middle finger to the establishment.
*  He's an anti-establishment change character.
*  There was a lot of people voted for Barack Obama for the same reason and voted for Trump.
*  We know that phenomenon.
*  What was it, 11, you know, 12% of people, you know,
*  so they could vote for some completely totally different, radically different people
*  because that sort of sense of change and charisma.
*  I mean, I had people who I knew voted for Trump,
*  but would have voted for Obama again if he'd run again
*  because they just liked the way that he spoke.
*  They liked the way that, you know, because they said,
*  I mean, this is all my own anecdotal things,
*  doing about one of my relatives said I could listen to Obama all day every day.
*  I just love the way he sounded.
*  I love the way he looked, you know, I just like the whole thing about him.
*  And then say about Trump, well, he was exciting.
*  He was interesting.
*  You know, he was kind of like, you know, whipping it up there, you know,
*  so there's this just this kind of feeling, you know, we always say about, you know,
*  could you have a beer with this person?
*  People, people decide they couldn't have one with Hillary Clinton.
*  And, you know, maybe they could go off and have one with Barack Obama
*  and with Donald Trump.
*  They didn't want to have one with Joe Biden, you know, for example.
*  And remember, George W. Bush didn't drink, so he wouldn't have had a beer with him.
*  He'd have gone out and got a soda or something with him.
*  But, you know, there's this there's that kind of element
*  of just that sort of personal connection in the way that the whole presidential election is set up.
*  It's less about the parties.
*  It's less about the platforms.
*  It's more about the person.
*  Yeah.
*  And picking one side and like sticking with your person.
*  It really like a sport team.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think about Vladimir Putin, the man and the leader?
*  Let's actually look at the full.
*  You've written a lot about him, the recent Vladimir Putin and the full context of his life.
*  Let's zoom out and look at the last 20 plus years of his rule.
*  In what ways has he been good for Russia?
*  In what ways bad?
*  Well, if you looked at the first couple of terms of his presidency, I think, you know, on the
*  overall ledger, you would have actually said that he made a lot of achievements from Russia.
*  Now, there was, of course, the pretty black period of the war in Chechnya, but, you know,
*  he didn't start that.
*  That was Boris Yeltsin.
*  That was obviously a pretty catastrophic event.
*  But if you look at then other parts of the ledger of what Putin was doing, you know,
*  from the 2000s, you know, onwards, he stabilized the Russian economy by, you know, confidence
*  and the Russian economy and financial system.
*  He built up a pretty impressive team of technocrats for everything, the central
*  bank and the economics and finance ministries, who, you know, really got the country back into
*  shape again and solvent, paid off all of the debts and, you know, really started to build
*  the country back up again domestically.
*  And, you know, the first couple of terms, again, putting Chechnya, you know, to one side,
*  which is a little hard because, I mean, there was a lot of atrocities and,
*  I have to say that, you know, he was pretty involved in all of that because the FSB,
*  which he'd headed previously, you know, was in charge of wrapping up Chechnya and it created,
*  you know, kind of a very strange sort of system of fealty, almost a feudal system
*  and the kind of relationship between Putin at the top and Kadirov in Chechnya.
*  There was quite a lot of distortions, you know, kind of as a result of that in the way
*  that the Russian Federation was run, you know, a lot more of an emphasis on the security services,
*  for example.
*  But there was a lot of pragmatism, you know, opening up the country for business,
*  you know, basically extending relationships.
*  I would say that, you know, by the end of those first couple of terms of Putin,
*  Russians were living their best lives.
*  You know, there was a lot of opportunity for people.
*  People's labor, you know, was being paid for, they weren't being taxed.
*  The taxes were coming out of the extractive industries.
*  There was, you know, kind of a, I guess, a sense of much more political pluralism.
*  It wasn't the kind of the chaos of the Eltsin period.
*  And then you see a shift.
*  And it's pretty much when he comes back into power again in 2011, 2012.
*  And that's when we see a kind of a different phase emerging.
*  And, you know, part of it is the larger international environment,
*  where Putin himself has become kind of convinced that the United States is out to get him.
*  And part of it goes back to the decision on the part of the United States to invade Iraq in 2003.
*  There's also, you know, the recognition of Kosovo in 2008, and, you know, the whole kind of
*  machinations around all kinds of, you know, other issues of NATO expansion and elsewhere.
*  But Iraq in 2003, and this kind of whole idea after that, that the United States is in the
*  business of regime change, and perhaps, you know, has him in his crosshairs as well.
*  But there's also then kind of, I think, a sense of building crisis
*  after the financial crisis and the Great Recession, 2008, 2009, because I think Putin,
*  up until then, believed in, you know, the whole idea of the global financial system,
*  and that Russia was prospering, and that Russia, you know, part of the G8 and actually could be
*  genuinely one of the, you know, the major economic and financial powers.
*  And then suddenly, he realizes that the West is incompetent, that, you know, we totally mismanaged
*  the economy of our own, the financial crash in the United States, the kind of blowing up of the
*  housing bubble, and that we were feckless, and that had global reverberations.
*  And he's prime minister, of course, you know, in this kind of period. But then, you know,
*  I think that that kind of compels him to kind of come back into the presidency and try to kind of
*  take things under control again in 2007, 2012. And after that, he goes into kind of a much more
*  sort of focused role, where he sees the United States as a bigger problem. And he also, you know,
*  starts to, you know, kind of focus on also the domestic environment, because his return to the
*  presidency is met by protests. And he genuinely seems to believe, because again, this is very
*  similar to belief here in the United States that Donald Trump couldn't possibly be elected by
*  Americans, there somehow was some kind of external interference, because the Russians
*  interfered and had an impact. Putin himself thinks at that time, that's one of the reasons
*  why he interferes in our elections later, that the United States or another said interfere,
*  because he knew that people weren't that thrilled about him coming back. They kind of liked the
*  Medvedev period. And the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg and other major cities,
*  he starts to believe are instigated by the West, by the outside, because of, you know, funding for
*  transparency in elections and, you know, all of the NGOs and others, you know, they're operating
*  State Department, embassy funding, you know, the whole attitude of, oh, God, he's back, you know,
*  kind of thing. And so after that, we see Putin going on a very different footing. It's also
*  somewhere in that period, 2011, 2012, we start to kind of obsess about Ukraine. And he's always,
*  you know, I think, been kind of steeped in that whole view of Russian history. I mean, I heard at
*  that time I was in, I've written about this and many of the things that, you know, I've written
*  about Putin, that in that same timeframe, I'm going to all these conferences in Russia where Putin is
*  and Peskov, his press secretary, and they talk about him reading Russian history. I think it's
*  this in this kind of period that he formulates this idea of the necessity of reconstituting
*  the Russian world, the Russian Empire. He's obviously been very interested in this. He's
*  always said, of course, that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the great catastrophe of the 20th
*  century, but also the collapse of the Russian Empire before it. And he starts to be critical
*  about Lenin and the Bolsheviks. And he starts to do all this talking about Ukraine as the same
*  country, Ukrainians and Russians being one and the same. And this is where the ledger flips,
*  because I mean, the initial question you asked me is about, has Putin been good for Russia or not?
*  And this is where we get into the focal point of, or the point where he's not focusing on
*  the prosperity and stability and future of Russia, but he starts to obsess about the past
*  and start to take things in a very different direction. He starts to clamp down at home
*  because of the rise of opposition and the fact that he knows that his brand is not the same as
*  it was before and his popularity is not the same as it was before because he's already gone over that
*  period in anybody's professional and political life that if you stay around long enough, people
*  get a bit sick of you. We talked about that before. Should you stay in any job for a long period of
*  time, you need refreshing. And Putin is starting to look like he's going to be there forever and
*  people are not happy about that and would like their chance as well to move on and move up.
*  And with him in some place, that's not going to be particularly possible. And that's around the time
*  when he starts to make the decision of annexing Crimea. And that's when the whole thing flips,
*  in my view. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 is the beginning of the end of Vladimir Putin
*  being a positive force within Russia. Because if you pay very close attention to his speech
*  on the annexation of Crimea in March of 2014, you see all of the foreshadowing of where we are now.
*  It's already his view of his obsessions, his historical obsessions. His view of himself has
*  been fused with the state of a modern czar and his idea that the West is up to get him. And it
*  becomes after that almost a messianic mission to turn things in a different direction.
*  And who are the key people to you in this evolution of the human being, of the leader?
*  Is it Petr Shchev? Is it Shoigu, the Minister of Defense? Is it, like you mentioned,
*  Peskov, the press secretary? What role does some of the others like Lavrov play?
*  I think it's more rooted in the larger context. I mean, individuals matter in that context,
*  but it's kind of like this shared worldview. And if you go back to the early 1990s, immediately
*  after the dissolution of the Soviet Union when Yeltsin and his counterparts from Ukraine,
*  Belarus pull it apart, there was an awful lot of people who wanted to maintain the Soviet Union,
*  not just Putin. I mean, you remember after Gorbachev tried to have the new union treaty
*  in 1991 and there was the emergency committee set up the coup against Gorbachev. It was because they
*  were worried he was going too far and unraveling the union then as well. They were opposed to his
*  reforms. There's always been a kind of a very strong nationalist contingent that become Russian
*  nationalists over time rather than Soviet hardliners who basically want to maintain the
*  empire, the union in some form. And in the very early part of the 1990s, there was a lot of
*  pressure put on Ukraine and all the other former Soviet republics, now independent states, by people
*  around, you know, Mayor Lushkov, for example, in Moscow, by other forces in the Russian Duma,
*  not just Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others, but really serious, kind of what we would call here
*  right-wing nationalist forces. But it's pervasive in the system and it's especially pervasive in
*  the KGB and in the security sector. And that's where Putin comes out of. Remember, Putin also
*  was of the opinion that one of the biggest mistakes the Bolsheviks made was getting rid of
*  the Orthodox Church as an instrument of the state. And so there's this kind of restorationist wing
*  within the security services and the state apparatus, the one to kind of bring back
*  Russian orthodoxy as a state instrument, an instrument of state power. And they were kind
*  of, you know, looking all the time about strengthening the state, the executive, the presidency.
*  And so it's everybody who takes part in that. And it's also others who want power, honestly,
*  and they see Putin as their vehicle for power. I think people like Sergey Kirienko, I knew Kirienko
*  back in the 90s. I mean, my God, that guy's all in. Or like Dmitry Medvedev, you know, who was,
*  you know, a warmer, fuzzier version of Putin. Certainly had a totally different perspective,
*  wasn't it, in the KGB? Did you say warmer, fuzzier version?
*  A warmer, fuzzier version, yeah. I mean, he's kind of like, he was literally a warm personality.
*  I don't know if you watched him during the September 30th annexation, the guy had all kinds
*  of facial twitches and looked so rigid and stiff that he looks like he might implode. I mean,
*  that wasn't how he was earlier in his career. And he had a different view of Perestroika.
*  We always have to remember that Putin was not in Russia during Perestroika. He was in Dresden,
*  watching the East German state fall apart and dealing with the Dostoevsky and in a kind of
*  place where you weren't getting a lot of information about what was happening in West Germany or even
*  what was happening back home in Perestroika. And he has that kind of group of people around him,
*  the Patrushevs and Votnikovs and others, and Sergei Ivanov and others from the different
*  configurations of his administration who have come out of that same kind of mindset and are kind of
*  wanting to put everything back together again. So there's a lot of enablers, there's a lot of
*  power seekers, and there are a lot of people who think the same as him as well. He is a man of
*  his times, a man of his context. You as a top advisor yourself and a scholar of Putin, do you
*  think actually now in his inner circle, are there people he trusts? There are people who trust for
*  some things, but I don't think there's people who trust for everything. I don't think he's the kind
*  of person who tells anyone everything at all. I don't think he's got something deeply confined.
*  No, I think he compartmentalizes things. He's often said that the only person he trusts is himself.
*  And I think that's probably true. He's the kind of person who keeps his own counsel.
*  I mean, people talk about Kovalchuk, for example, or some of the other people who were friends with
*  him that go back to his time in St. Petersburg. At various points, he seemed to spend a lot of
*  time way back when talking to people who were people thinking of kind of more moderating forces
*  like Alexei Kudrin, but it doesn't seem to be interacting with them. There are obviously
*  aspects of his personal life. Does he speak to his daughters? Does he speak to
*  lovers, kind of in a way people speculate about who might he confide in? But I would greatly doubt
*  that he would have deep political discussions with them. He's a very guarded, very careful person.
*  What about sources of information then? So trust, a deep understanding about military strategies
*  with for certain conflicts like the war in Ukraine or even special subsets of the war in Ukraine
*  or any kind of military operations, getting clear information.
*  I think he's deeply suspicious of people and of information. And I think part of the problems
*  that we see with Putin now, I mean, I've come from isolation during COVID. I'm really confident
*  like many of us, a lot of Putin's views have hardened and the way that he looks at the world
*  have been shadowed in very dark ways by the experience of this pandemic. Obviously, he was
*  in a bubble, different kind of bubble from most of us. I mean, most of us are not in bubbles with
*  multiple kind of palaces and kind of the Kremlin. But we've seen so much, obviously a lot of this
*  stage, that isolation, kind of making it very clear that he's the Tsar, the guy who is in charge,
*  making all the decisions, one end of the table and everybody else is at the other end. But it's very
*  difficult then to bring information to him in that way. He used to have a lot of information bundled
*  for him in the old days by the presidential administration. I mean, I know that because it
*  was a lot more open in the past. And I've had a lot of meetings with people in the presidential
*  administration who brought outside, it's all source information for him and kind of
*  funneled in information from different think tanks and different viewpoints and maybe a kind
*  of more eclectic diversified set of information. He would meet with people. You've heard all the
*  stories about where he had once called up Masha Gessen and had to come in, obviously a very
*  different character as a journalist and a critic. We've heard about Venedicta from Echo Moscovy,
*  the radio program, the editor, who Putin would talk to and consult with. He'd reach out. People
*  like Lyudmila Alexeeva, for example, the head of Memorial, he had some respect for her and would
*  sometimes just talk to her, for example. All of that seems to have come to a halt.
*  Can you explain why?
*  I think a lot of us worry, I mean, as to, you know, watch Putin about what kind of information is he
*  getting? You know, is it just information that he's seeking and gathering himself that fits into his
*  worldview and his framework? We're all guilty of that, of looking for things. It gets to our social
*  media preferences. Our people just bring into him things that they think he wants to hear, like the
*  algorithm, you know, kind of like the Kremlin working in that regard. Or is he himself, you know,
*  tapping into sources of information that he absolutely wants? And remember, he is not a
*  military guy. He's an operative and he was sort of trained in operations and, you know, contingency
*  planning. Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, as a civil engineer, was the former minister of
*  emergencies. He wasn't a military planner. You know, somebody like Gerasimov, the head of the
*  chiefs of staff, may be a military guy, you know, in this case from the army, but he's also somebody
*  who's in a different part, the chain of command. He's not somebody who would spontaneously start,
*  you know, telling Putin things. And Putin, you know, comes out of the FSB, out of the KGB,
*  of the Soviet era, and he knows the way that, you know, intelligence gets filtered and works. He's
*  probably somebody who wants to consume raw intelligence. He doesn't probably want to
*  hear anybody else's analysis. And he's thrived in the past of, you know, picking things up from
*  people. You know, I've taken part in all of these meetings with him, gone for hours, because he's
*  just collecting. He's collecting information. He's sussing people out. He wants to know the
*  questions they ask. He learns something about the questions that people ask, the way that they ask
*  them. You know, so he's kind of soliciting information himself. And if he's cut off from
*  that information, you know, because of circumstances, then, you know, how is he formulating things in his
*  head? And again, getting into, you can't get into his head, but you can understand the context in
*  which he's operating. And that's where you worry, because he clearly made this decision to invade
*  Ukraine behind the back of most of his security establishment.
*  You think so?
*  Oh, I think it's pretty apparent.
*  What would the security establishment, what would be the-
*  Well, that would be the larger, you know, thinking the funneling in information from the
*  presidential administration, from the National Security Council. It looks like, you know,
*  he made that decision with a handful of people. And then, you know, having worked in these kinds
*  of environments, and it's not that dissimilar, you filter information up. So think about, you know,
*  you and I are talking for hours here. If you were my, you know, basically, you know, senior official,
*  and I'm your briefer, I might only get 20 minutes with you. And you might be just like, you know,
*  looking at your watch the whole time and thinking, hang on a second, I've got to go, and I've got this
*  meeting, and I've got that meeting, and yeah, your point. You're not going to wait there. So I give
*  this long explanation. I've got to get to the point. And then I've got to then choose for myself,
*  what's the information I'm going to impart to you? Out of the 20 things that I think are important,
*  you know, okay, I've got 20 minutes. Maybe I only suddenly get two minutes. Maybe, you know,
*  you get called out and somebody, you know, kind of interrupts. Something happens. I'm going to get
*  one minute, two minutes. I mean, I want to remember, I had to give a presentation when I was in
*  government, you know, to Henry Kissinger, you know, for that defense policy board. And we planned
*  bloody weeks on this thing. You know, PowerPoints were created, teams of people were brought
*  together. And, you know, people were practicing this. We had all these, you know, different
*  people there. And I said, look, Henry Kissinger is an academic and a former professor. And,
*  you know, I haven't, you know, I've got to watch him in action. He's going to like,
*  you know, five seconds in, if we look, if we look, if we get that far, ask us a question and just
*  throw off our entire presentation. What is it that we want to convey? And that's exactly what happened.
*  And then, you know, people aren't really prepared what they wanted to convey. And they'd, you know,
*  they'd prepared a, you know, a nice sort of fulsome, you know, PowerPoint-like approach.
*  We never even got there. And so God knows what, you know, he took away from it at the end of it.
*  And that's, you know, think about Putin. He's going to be kind of impatient. He's, you know,
*  we see the televised things where he, you know, kind of sits at a table a bit like, you know,
*  people won't necessarily see us here. And he puts his hands on the table and he looks across
*  at the person and he says, so tell me, you know, what's the main things I need to know?
*  And of course the person's mind probably goes blank, you know, with the kind of the thought of
*  like, oh God, what's the main thing? And they go and they start, well, Vladimir Vladimirovich,
*  and, you know, they start the kind of, you know, they're revving up, you know, to get to the point
*  and then he cuts them off. So you think about that and then you think about, well, what information
*  has he got? And then how does he process it? And is he suspicious of it? Does he not believe it?
*  And what, on what inside of his own history then, you know, leads him to make one judgment over
*  another? He clearly thought the Ukrainians would fall apart in five seconds.
*  We don't know if he clearly thought that, but that there was a high probability maybe. I mean,
*  you could guess.
*  I think he pretty much thought it because I think he thought that, you know, kind of his
*  identity wasn't very popular. There was an awful lot of, you know, pro-Russian sentiment in whatever
*  way he thinks that is because people have Russian speakers and that, you know, they're kind of,
*  you know, in polling, they, you know, they expressed affinity with Russia. I mean, certainly
*  in Crimea, that worked out because a majority of the population had, you know, higher sentiments
*  or feelings of affinity with Russia. And, you know, obviously, you know, that kind of, they got
*  traction there, but it's more complicated. We talked about Donbass before about being a kind of
*  melting pot when, you know, they tried the same thing in Donbass, Donetsk and Luhansk, because
*  they tried in Crimea in 2014, didn't kind of pan out. In fact, you know, a whole wall broke out.
*  They tried, you know, to kind of in, you know, many of the major cities that are now under attack,
*  including Odessa, to kind of ferment, you know, pro-Russian movements and they completely and
*  utterly fell apart. So Putin was thinking, you know, I'm pretty sure based on polling and the
*  FSB having infiltrated, you know, an awful lot of the Ukrainian hierarchies we now seeing is quite
*  apparent with some of the dismissals in Ukraine, he was pretty sure that, you know, kind of he
*  would get traction and that it would be like 1956 in Hungary or 1968 in Czechoslovakia. Remember,
*  he comes out of the Andropov levy, as it's called, a kind of cohort of people who come
*  into the KGB under Yuri Andropov. And Yuri Andropov has presided over a lot of these
*  anti-dissident, you know, kind of movements inside of Russia itself and how you suppress
*  opposition, but also over, you know, how you deal with, you know, kind of the uprisings in,
*  you know, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. And there's all these lessons from this that, you know,
*  you can put everything back in the box. And yeah, there might be a bit of violence and a bit of
*  fighting, but ultimately, you think you've got the political figures and you decapitate the opposition.
*  So they thought you've let, you know, Zelensky would run away, Yadakovich run away, but, you know,
*  that was kind of a bit, you know, sort of a different set of circumstances. And they thought
*  that all of the local governments would, you know, kind of capitulate because they had enough
*  Russians and inverted commas in there. Again, mistaking language and, you know, kind of positive
*  affinity towards Russia for identity or how people would react in the time and not understanding
*  people's, you know, linkages and, you know, kind of importance of place, the way that people feel
*  about who they are in a certain set of circumstances in place. But the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is
*  unlike anything that he was ever involved with. I don't think he thought it would be, you know,
*  because it's this kind of, if he looks back into the past, you're right though, he wasn't involved
*  in what 68 or 56 or what happened in the 1980s in Poland. But there's a very wide front and it's the
*  capital. And I mean, this isn't going for this isn't Chichniel. This isn't, you know, kind of
*  Syria or for example, this is a major nation. Exactly. Like a large, it's large to the side.
*  It was more like Afghanistan, but they didn't realize that because again, Ukrainians are us.
*  There's this kind of inability to think that people might think differently and might want
*  something different. And that 30 years of independence actually has an impact on people
*  and their psyches. And if I look back to the 1990s, I mean, I remember being in seminars in
*  the Talmud at the time, and we were doing a lot of research on, you know, what was happening in,
*  you know, the former Soviet Union at the time, because the early 1990s, just after the, you know,
*  the whole place fell apart. And there was already under yeltsin this kind of idea of
*  Russians abroad, Russians in the near abroad, Russian speakers and the need to bring them back
*  in. And I remember, you know, we had seminars at the time where we talked about at some point,
*  there'd be some people in Russia that would actually believe that those Russian speakers
*  needed to be brought back into Russia, but that the people who spoke Russian might have moved on,
*  because they suddenly had other opportunities and other windows on the world. I mean, look,
*  what's happened in Scotland, you know, for example, most people in Scotland speak English.
*  The Scottish language is not the standard bearer of Scottish identity. It's almost a civic identity,
*  different identity than not just national identity, just like you see in Ukraine.
*  And there's lots of English people that have moved to Scotland and now think of themselves as
*  Scottish or Brazilians or Italians and, you know, all kinds of people who've moved in there. I mean,
*  it's a smaller population, obviously, in the scale of Ukraine, but, you know, people feel differently.
*  And there's been a devolution of power. And when Brexit happened, you know, Scotland didn't want
*  to go along with that at all. They wanted to kind of still be, you know, having a window on Europe.
*  And that's kind of historic. And lots of people in Ukraine have looked west, not east. You know,
*  it depends on where you are, not just in Lviv, you know, or somewhere like that, but also in Kiev.
*  And Kharkiv, you know, was kind of predominantly a Russian speaking city. But Kharkiv was also the
*  center of Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian literature, you know, at different points.
*  People have different views. I grew up in the north of England. We don't feel like the south
*  of England. There's been a massive divide between north and south in England for millennia, not just
*  centuries. So, you know, people feel differently depending on where they live and, you know, kind
*  of where they grew up. And Putin just didn't see that. He didn't see that.
*  Well, hold on a second. Let me sort of push back at the fact that I don't think any of this is
*  obvious. So first of all, Zelensky before the war was unpopular. Oh, he was. What was it? 38%,
*  something like that, but best in the popularity. Let me sort of make the case that the calculation
*  here is very difficult. If you were to poll every citizen of Ukraine and ask them, what do you think
*  happens if Russia invades? Just like actually each put each individual Ukrainian in a one-on-one
*  meeting with Putin and say, what do you think happens? I honestly think most of them will say
*  they will agree with a prediction that the government will flee, it would collapse,
*  and the country won't unite around the cause because of the factions, because of all the
*  different parties involved, because of the unpopularity. You might have said the same thing
*  about the Soviet Union when Hitler invaded in 1941. You see, the problem is Putin always reads
*  history from one perspective over another. I think most countries basically rise to their own defense.
*  So this is actually one of the first times that Russia has been on the offensive rather than on
*  the defensive. So there's kind of a bit of a flip there. I mean, obviously Afghanistan, but that was
*  more complicated because it was also supposed to be an intervention, right? I mean, it wasn't
*  supposed to be to annex Afghanistan. It was to try to prop up, kind of reinstall a leader there.
*  Syria, you were in there to help your guy Bashar al-Assad turn away the opposition.
*  Chechnya was a debacle. The Chechens fought back big time, and it was only by dint of
*  horrible, violent persistence and ruthlessness and nasty, dirty tricks that Putin prevailed there.
*  But then you wonder, did he prevail? Because what happened? Chechnya sometimes describes
*  the most independent part of the Russian Federation, and Ramzan Khedirov plays power
*  games in Moscow. His predecessors, even his father and others wouldn't have done that.
*  Akhmed Khedirov and before that, Dadaev and Maskhadov, they were willing to make a compromise,
*  but they wouldn't have had the same position that Khedirov has had. So I think that again,
*  it's your perspective and where you stand and which bit of history you start to read. And that's why
*  I say that I think Putin, it's again, it's the information, the way that he processes it. I think
*  most Russians also can't believe that they've done something wrong in Ukraine. I mean, maybe at this
*  point, things are changing a bit. But that's why there was so much support for this. I have Russian
*  friends again who said, but look what was happening in Donetsk. Look what the Ukrainians were doing to
*  our guys. Look what was happening to Russian speakers. We were defenders. We were not invaders.
*  I think again, the special military operation idea now, I think it's flipping, obviously,
*  with the war going on there. But Putin wasn't looking at what would happen.
*  I mean, most of the glory parts of Russian history when you go in, you chase Napoleon back to Paris,
*  or you chase the Germans back to Berlin, you put the flag above the Reichstag. That's a very
*  different set of affairs. When you've been fighting a defensive one, you've been invaded
*  from a war where you invade someone else.
*  And even the most fractured populations like you had in the Soviet Union at the point,
*  rally around and World War I fell apart. I mean, the Tsar didn't manage to rally everybody around.
*  I mean, the whole thing fell apart. And World War II, Stalin had to revive nationalism,
*  including in the republics in Central Asia and elsewhere to revive nationalism.
*  And Ukraine suddenly found nationalism in a sense of sovereignty.
*  That's really interesting because it's not obvious, especially what Ukrainians
*  went through in the 1930s. It's not obvious that that... I mean, my grandfather was Ukrainian,
*  and he was proud to fight a Ukrainian Jew. He was proud to fight and willing to die for
*  his country. It wasn't like...
*  His country then was the Soviet Union.
*  The Soviet Union, right. Sorry, to clarify.
*  But he might fight now for his country, Ukraine.
*  Yes. But I'm just lingering on the point you made. It was not obvious
*  that that united feeling would be there.
*  No. And again, it wouldn't have been obvious for the Soviet Union.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  Sorry. I was referring to my grandfather, the Soviet Union. We're both saying the exact same
*  thing. And you're saying it's a really powerful thing because you take history as it happened.
*  You don't realize it could have happened differently. It's kind of...
*  It's fascinating.
*  It's that whole counterfactual, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Because if you've kind of... That's why we all need in the United States to really examine
*  our own history. Because there's a lot of lessons from that, that we should treat very cautiously.
*  It doesn't mean that history repeats or even rhymes. It's the old axiom all the time. But
*  there are a lot of things that you can take away differently from...
*  I'm putting a different perspective and a different slant on the same set of events.
*  I was used to wonder how many books can be written on the French Revolution
*  or even on the Russian Revolution? I studied with Richard Pipes. I remember he was really offended
*  after he'd written his great microsurface on the Russian Revolution, two volumes, that other people
*  would write about the Russian Revolution. He said, I've written it all. And I thought, well,
*  actually, maybe you haven't. There might be some completely different angle there that you haven't
*  really thought of. And that's Putin. I remember Peskov saying, Putin reads history all the time,
*  Russian history. And I thought, well, maybe he should read some world history. Maybe he should
*  read some European authors on Russian history, not just reading Lamanosa for
*  Russian historians on Russian history. Because you might see something from a very different
*  perspective. And look, the United States made a massive mistake in Vietnam. They saw Vietnam as
*  weak, manipulated by external forces, China, Soviet Union. But the Vietnamese fought for
*  their own country. They suddenly became Vietnamese. And Ho Chi Minh became basically a wartime
*  fighter and leader in a way that perhaps people wouldn't have understood either.
*  You said the United States made a massive mistake in Vietnam, and that for some reason
*  sprung a thought in my head. Has the United States since World War II had anything that's
*  not a mistake in terms of military operations abroad? I suppose all the ones that are successes
*  we don't even know about probably. So it's like very fast military operations.
*  I mean, Korea is divided. I mean, I don't know what's successful, but there was a solution
*  found that some people are promoting in this case as well of a sort of division in the DMZ
*  and one side over the other and kind of perpetuating a division, which I think is
*  particularly successful. But if you think about World War I and World War II, the United States
*  came in under some very specific sets of circumstances. In World War I, they did kind
*  of come in to help kind of liberate parts of Europe, France, and kind of the UK and
*  everything else, Great Britain, and the war towards the end of it. World War II, there was
*  that whole debate about whether the United States should even be part of the war. I mean, we know
*  it wasn't fought to overturn the Holocaust and all of the kind of things you kind of wish it
*  would have been fought for, but it was because of Pearl Harbor and the Japanese pulling in.
*  But ultimately, it was easy to explain why you were there, particularly after Pearl Harbor and
*  what had happened. It was hard to explain Vietnam and Korea and many of the other wars. That's kind
*  of going to be a problem for Putin. That's why there is a problem for Putin. All of his explanations
*  have been questioned, sort of off on NATO or this or that or the other, and kind of all liberating
*  Ukraine from Nazis or kind of basically stopping the persecution of Russian speakers. And all of
*  this has now got lost in just this horrific destruction. And that's what happened in Vietnam
*  as well. It became a great degradation of the Russian military with atrocities and people
*  wondering why on earth the United States was in Vietnam. I mean, that kind of happened in Britain
*  in the colonial period as well. Why was the United Kingdom committing atrocities and kind of basically
*  fighting these colonial wars? Northern Ireland, why was the United Kingdom still kind of militarily
*  occupying Ireland? Cyprus, there's all kinds of instances where we look at this thing.
*  What Russia is doing now, Putin is trying to occupy another country, irrespective of the
*  historical linkages and the larger meta narratives that he's trying to put forward there.
*  What role did the United States play in the lead up and the actual invasion of Ukraine by Russia?
*  A lot of people say that, I mean, obviously Vladimir Putin says that part of the reason
*  the invasion had to happen is because of security concerns over the expansion of NATO.
*  There is a lot of people that say that this was provoked by NATO. Do you think there's some
*  legitimacy to that case? Look, I think the whole situation here is very complicated and you have
*  to take a much longer view than what happened in 2008 with the open door for Ukraine and Georgia,
*  which actually, by the way, I thought was a strategic blunder, just to be very clear,
*  because it wasn't any kind of thinking through about what the implications of that would be
*  and what it actually would mean for Ukraine. And I think that's a very important point.
*  What it actually would mean for Ukraine's security and also bearing in mind what Putin had already
*  said about NATO expansion, they came on the wake of the recognition by the United States pretty
*  unilaterally of Kosovo. And it also comes in the wake of what I mentioned before, the invasion of
*  Iraq, which really is very important for understanding Putin's psyche. So I think we have to go back
*  much further than it's not just talking about NATO and what that means. NATO is part of the whole
*  package of Ukraine going in a different direction from Russia, just as so is the European Union.
*  Remember, the annexation of Crimea comes after Ukraine has sought an association agreement with
*  the European Union, not with NATO at that particular point, even though the EU on the common
*  security defense policy basically has all kinds of connections with NATO at various different
*  levels in the European security front. It was all about Europe and going on a different economic
*  and political and ultimately legal path, because if you have an association agreement, eventually
*  you get into the AKI communitern and it just transforms the country completely and Ukraine is
*  no longer the Ukraine of the Soviet period or the Russian Empire period. It becomes on a different
*  trajectory like Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, another country. It becomes a different place. It
*  moves into a different space and that's part of it. But if you go back again to the period at the
*  very beginning of the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, where there's no discussion
*  about NATO at that point and NATO enlargement, there is a lot of pressure, again, as I've said
*  before, by nationalist elements on Ukraine trying to bring it back in the fold. And wanting to make
*  what was then this mechanism for divorce more of a mechanism for remanagement of the Commonwealth
*  of Independent States. And in the early 1990s, when Ukraine became an independent state, it inherited
*  that nuclear arsenal from the Soviet Union. Basically, whatever was stationed or positioned
*  in Ukrainian territory at the time became Ukraine's strategic and kind of basically
*  intermediate and tactical nuclear weapons. And in the United States at the time, we had all this
*  panic about what was going to happen with all of that. I think it was a scientist and kind of
*  technically it would have been difficult for Ukraine to actually use this. The targeting was
*  done centrally. They were actually stationed there. But nonetheless, Ukraine, like Belarus and
*  Kazakhstan, suddenly became nuclear powers. And Ash Carter, the former US defense equity who just
*  died tragically and Dave was talking about, talking together today, was part of a whole team
*  of Americans and others who tried to work with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to get them to
*  give up the nuclear weapons. And back in the early period of that, 1993, 1994, you go back, and I
*  was writing about this at the time. I wrote a report called Back in the USSR, which is kind of
*  on the website of the Kennedy School with some other colleagues. And we were monitoring how
*  there was all these accusations coming out of Moscow, the defense ministry and the Duma,
*  the parliament and others, that Ukraine was trying to find a way of making a dirty bomb,
*  using its nuclear weapons, becoming a menace. And Ukraine might have to be brought to order.
*  So a lot of the dynamics we're seeing now were happening then, irrespective of NATO.
*  Basically, the problem was always Ukraine getting away. Yeltsin himself, when he unraveled the
*  Soviet Union, didn't really want it to unravel, but he didn't have the wherewithal to bring
*  the countries back again. Russia was weak after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its economy
*  imploded. It had to give sovereignty to all of these constituent parts of the Russian Federation
*  in terms of a sort of devolution of authority. It had the war in Chechnya, which Yeltsin stupidly
*  sparked off in 1994. You had Tatarstan, one of the regions, the all-rich regions,
*  basically resting out a kind of a bilateral treaty with Moscow. The whole place seemed like
*  it was falling apart so that you couldn't do anything on Ukraine because you didn't have the
*  wherewithal to do it. And then when basically Russia starts to get its act back together again,
*  all of these security nationalist types who had never wanted Ukraine or Belarus or Moldova or
*  anywhere else to kind of move away, they didn't worry that much about Central Asia, to be frank,
*  but they did want the core states, in their view, to come back. Moldova was part of that,
*  even if it's not Slavic. But they wanted Belarus and northern Kazakhstan and probably Kazakhstan
*  as well, which wasn't really thought about being part of Central Asia, back in the fold
*  as close as possible. So anything that gave those countries an alternative was seen as negative.
*  It could have been an association with China, them joining kind of an association with Latin
*  America or Africa or something else like that. But of course, NATO has all of those larger
*  connotations of it being the Cold War opposing entity. And Putin has always seen NATO as being
*  the direct correlation of the Warsaw Pact, which is, in other words, just something dominated
*  completely by the United States. Now, that, of course, is why getting back to Trump again,
*  Trump was always going to the Europeans, if this is really supposed to be collective security in
*  a mutual defense pact, why are you guys not paying? Why does the US and the States pay for everything?
*  But NATO was actually conceived as collective defense, mutual security. And it was set up by
*  the United States along with the UK and France and Germany and Turkey and other countries.
*  And we see that now with the entry of Finland and Sweden. They didn't have to join NATO. They didn't
*  want to join NATO for a long time. They wanted to partner with it, just like Israel and other
*  countries partner with NATO. But once they thought that their security was really at risk, they wanted
*  to be part of it. And so you're now really seeing that NATO is something other than just being
*  a creature or an instrument of the United States. But that's how Putin always saw it. So what this
*  debate about NATO is all about, of Russia being provoked, is wanting to kind of return to an old
*  superpower bipolar relationship where everything is negotiated with the United States. It's to try
*  to deny that Ukraine or Belarus, well, Belarus has kind of been absorbed by this point, by Russia,
*  or Moldova, or Kazakhstan, or any of the other countries have any kind of agency,
*  like Poland or Hungary or France and Britain. For years and years and years, senior people like
*  Putin and people around the Kremlin have demanded a return to the kind of what they call the old
*  concert of Europe or the concert of Vienna where the big guys, which now means the United States
*  and Russia, just sit down and thrash everything out. And so, I mean, Putin by saying, look,
*  it was provoked. It's the United States. It's NATO. It's a proxy war or it's this or it's that or
*  this is going to be a nuclear confrontation. It's like the Cuban Missile Crisis or it's the Euro
*  Missile Crisis. It's basically just saying, you know, I want to go back to when the Soviet
*  Union and the United States worked things out. I want to go back to the whole period of the 1980s
*  when Gorbachev and Reagan just kind of got together and figured things out. Or even better,
*  back to Yalta, Potsdam and Tehran and the big meetings at the end of World War II where we
*  resolved the whole future security. We've had a war. We've had the Cold War. Now we've got another
*  war. We've got a real war, a hot war. We've got a war in Ukraine. It should be the United States
*  and Russia that sort this out. So this is where we see the United States waffling about as well,
*  trying to kind of like figure out how to handle this because it has to be handled in a way that
*  Ukraine has agency because if Ukraine doesn't have agency, nobody else has agency either.
*  Nobody else has any kind of decision-making power. And, you know, we have an environment
*  in which Putin thinks that there's only really three players. There's the United States and Russia
*  and China. And maybe occasionally it might be India and perhaps Brazil or some other,
*  South Africa or some other country, like maybe the Bricks at some point. But, you know, ultimately
*  it's like the old days, big powers resolve everything. And so this war is also about
*  Russia's right, Putin's right, you know, to determine things, you know, strong man to strong
*  man, big country to big country, and, you know, determine, you know, where things happen next.
*  That's why he's talking about things being provoked and it's being the United States' fault.
*  But aren't there parts of the United States establishment that likes that kind of
*  three-party view of the world?
*  Oh, there's always going to be people who like that part, that approach. Of course there is.
*  But then they don't necessarily dominate. That's the kind of thing that people kind of think
*  about. I mean, you know, Putin can, you know, read, you know, all the various articles and hear the
*  kind of pronouncements of people. But, you know, this gets back to, you know, the way that the
*  United States operates. You know, Putin saw that, you know, Trump wanted to have a, you know, top
*  down, you know, vertical of power. And other presidents have wanted to have that. But the
*  United States is a pretty messy place. And we have all kinds of different viewpoints. Now, of course,
*  we know that in Russia, everything, even criticism of the Kremlin is usually fairly
*  orchestrated, usually to kind of flesh out, you know, what people think about things. When we had
*  these hardliners saying, you know, we needed more destruction of Ukraine, not less, and that, you
*  know, the army wasn't doing enough. It was in many respects, you know, kind of encouraged by the
*  Kremlin to see how people would react to that, you know, to kind of actually create a constituency for,
*  you know, being more ruthless than you had before because, you know, they wanted to clamp down.
*  In the United States, I mean, I can say whatever I want. It doesn't mean that I'm speaking on
*  behalf of the White House. And, you know, even if I have been an advisor to this president,
*  that president, and the other, it doesn't mean I'm, you know, basically speaking on behalf
*  of the U.S. government. But there's kind of always an assumption from the Russians that,
*  you know, when people, you know, say this and people do advocate one thing over another, that
*  they're, you know, it's operating. There's a lot of mirror imaging thinking that, you know,
*  we're operating in the same kind of way. So yes, there are, of course, constituencies who think
*  like that and would love it. You know, to be back to that. And there are many people out there with
*  their own peace plans, all kinds of people, you know, out there trying to push this.
*  There does seem to be the engine of the military industrial complex seems to give some fuel to the
*  hawks. And they seem to create momentum in government. Yeah, but other people do too. I
*  mean, there's always, you know, kind of a check. You believe in the tension of ideas.
*  I think there was a lot of tension. I mean, I've seen it. I've seen it inside of the government now,
*  you know, and people can push back. And that's why I speak out. And I try to lay it out so that
*  everybody can, you know, kind of figure it out for themselves. I say the same to you as I say to
*  everybody. This is how I see the situation. And, you know, this is, you know, how we can analyze it
*  here. Now, look, do I think that we've handled, you know, the whole Russia account, you know, for
*  years? Well, no, we haven't. I mean, we've taken our eyes off the ball many times. We've failed to
*  understand the way that people like Putin think. You know, you talked earlier about, you know,
*  we need to have empathy for, you know, all the people who like Trump or like Biden and so on,
*  how they think. We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well. We've got to understand how
*  the guy thinks and why he thinks like he does. You know, he has got his own context and his own
*  frame and his own rationale. And he is rational. He is a rational actor in his own context. We've
*  got to understand that. We've got to understand that he would take offense at something and he
*  would take action over something. It doesn't mean to say that, you know, we are necessary to blame
*  by taking actions, but we are to blame when we don't understand the consequences of things that
*  we do and act accordingly or, you know, take preventative action or recognize that something
*  might happen as a result of something. So you've been in the room with Putin.
*  Let me ask you for some advice. And it's also just a good philosophical question for you or for me.
*  If I have a conversation with Vladimir Putin right now, can you advise on what questions,
*  topics, ideas to talk through to him as a leader, to him as a human? What would you like to understand
*  about his mind, about his thinking? Yeah, remember what I said before that Putin
*  always tries to, you know, reverse things. He wants to hear the questions that people have.
*  Because remember, he himself at different points has been a recruiter, which is, you know,
*  the way that you're operating now as well, right? You're asking an awful lot of questions. Your
*  questions also betray, you know, often the times that where you're thinking about things, you know,
*  the kind of context, you know, kind of any kind of dialogue like this reveals a lot about the,
*  you know, the other person. And I've actually often, you know, noticed in these settings that
*  Putin likes to have a lot of give and take. So I think he would actually enjoy having a conversation,
*  you know, with you. But again, he would always be trying to influence you, inform and influence.
*  That's kind of, you know, part of the way that he always operates. So what you would have to,
*  be trying to think about, so what is it you would want to elicit information from him? You're trying
*  to understand the guy's worldview. And what we're trying to also understand is if there's any room
*  there where he might compromise on something. You know, so if your goal was to go in there,
*  you know, to talk about Ukraine at this particular moment. I mean, one of the problems that I've
*  often seen in the sort of the meetings we've had with Putin, he just ends up in sort of mutual
*  recriminations. You know, kind of know, well, what about what you've done? Oh, no, you've done
*  that about, you know, and there's always this what about-ism. I mean, it often say, well,
*  you're saying that I've done this, but you've done that. The United States invaded Iraq. What's the
*  difference between, you know, what I'm doing and all of the things that you've been doing here?
*  I mean, what you would have to try to do is kind of elicit information about why or what he is
*  thinking about this particular moment in time and why he thinks it.
*  Yeah, the what about-ism is a failure case. I think that shows from all the interviews I've seen
*  with him that just shows that he doesn't trust the person on the other side.
*  No, he doesn't.
*  Right. But I'm not cynical like people's. They seem to think he's some kind of KGB agent
*  that doesn't trust anybody. I disagree. I think everybody's human. And from my perspective,
*  I'm worried about what I've seen is I think whether it's COVID, whether it's
*  other aspects that I'm not aware of leading up to the invasion, he seems to be less willing to have
*  a charismatic back and forth dialogue.
*  Yeah, an open discussion. You know, actually, I mean, I said you asked me before about,
*  that issue of trust, and he often says he only trusts himself. And I said, you know,
*  he's often distrustful of people, but he does trust some people for certain things where he
*  knows it's within their competence. So he has people he trusts to do things because he knows
*  they'll do them and he knows that they'll do them well, which is why he has his old buddies from
*  St. Petersburg because he's known for a very long time and he knows that they want to try to
*  pull a fast one over him. But he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses,
*  and what they can be trusted to do. I mean, he's learning that, you know, some of the people in
*  the military that he thought were competent, or people and other things are not, right?
*  And he intends to actually have a lot of loyalty to people as well. Or he also kind of thinks it's
*  best to keep them inside the tent than outside. And he moves them around, you know, he kind of,
*  okay, you know, he gives them multiple chances to redeem themselves if they don't. It's not like he
*  has them done in. I mean, yeah, there is a lot of that in the system. But the people that he's
*  worked with for a long time, he moves them around to something else, perhaps where they can do less
*  harm. Although, you know, we've often seen that he has quite a small cadre of people that he's
*  reliant on and often, you know, they're not up to the task, which is kind of what's happening here.
*  But he also, in the past, has been more straightforward, just like you were saying
*  here, more pragmatic. And I think, you know, if you were engaged with him in Russian,
*  while you're actually literally speaking the same language, because there's so much lost in
*  translation. I used to jump out of my skin listening to some of the phone calls. Because,
*  you know, the way that they kind of relate, you know, with an interpreter,
*  Oh, because you're listening to the translation.
*  I'm listening to the Russian and the translation.
*  And the translation.
*  You know, in real time. And I haven't been at a translators' institute, it's really difficult.
*  Look, an interpreter is a trend in the moment to do something, you know, the synchronicity,
*  the synchronized or the real time translation. So translation is an art as well as a skill.
*  If you're doing simultaneous translation, that's the word in English, you know,
*  synchronicity in Russian, you're kind of focused in the moment on the fragments of the discussion
*  and trying to render it as accurately as you possibly can. And when you come out of that,
*  you can't relay the entire conversation. And often, you know, what translators do is they,
*  they take this little short note like journalists do. And afterwards, you know,
*  they've just been caught up in the moment and they haven't got the big picture.
*  Consecutive translation is different, you know, kind of you're trying to convey the whole mood
*  of like big chunks of dialogue that have already been there. But, you know, sometimes you might not
*  get that right either. And it breaks up the flow of the discussion.
*  That's terrible.
*  And often it's, you know, the kind of the person who translates, it's different. You know,
*  some of our best translators are women. But, you know, hearing a woman's voice,
*  you know, translating a guy who has a particular guy's way of speaking,
*  and a macho way of speaking and a crude way of speaking, you know, be that Putin or I've
*  seen that happen with Erdogan, the president of Turkey, you know, and it gets translated by
*  a much more refined, you know, female speaker, you've just lost the whole thing.
*  And, you know, many of the translators on the Russian side are not competent in English in the
*  way that you would hope they are. They're not, it's not just that they're not native speakers,
*  they're just not trained to the same high standards they used to be in the past.
*  And you just got, you lose the nuance, you lose the feel, you know, you almost need, you know,
*  kind of the interpretive actor, you know, doing, you know, the kind of the interpretation for that.
*  You need to match it as much as you can in the way that you, you know, do voiceovers in film.
*  The best way to talk to Putin is one-on-one in his own language.
*  And I have a really great friend here who is one of the best interpreters. Putin is often asked by
*  the, you know, the media to interpret for him. He just, he was at the institute that I was, I mean,
*  I knew him from that kind of period. And he is just excellent. Just like Pavel Palashenko was
*  absolutely phenomenal at interpreting Gorbachev. Now, he didn't always interpret him accurately
*  because Gorbachev made lots of grammatical gaffes and sometimes was, you know, Gorbachev himself
*  would joke that Palashenko, you know, spoke better for Gorbachev than Gorbachev could himself.
*  But Putin is actually quite precise and careful in the way that he speaks because there's a lot
*  of menace sometimes to things deliberately. Other times there's lots of humor and he's telling a joke
*  for a particular reason. And a lot of it is, I mean, he actually uses the richness of the Russian
*  language and the crudity of language that can't be conveyed in English.
*  Plus the facial expressions that go along with it.
*  Yeah, facial expressions, body language, the way that he sits back in the chair and slouches,
*  the kind of the way that he makes fun of people and he, you know, kind of uses irony.
*  Just some of it is just lost and it needs to be conveyed.
*  The depth of humor and wit. I've met quite a few like political leaders like that in
*  This Peek Only Russia when I was traveling in Ukraine. I don't know how you translate that.
*  I think it's almost the other person that reminds me like that a little bit is Obama.
*  There's Obama had a wit and an intelligence, but like he would smile as he said something
*  that add a lot to it. Like that he's trolling you or he's being sarcastic or like, I don't know,
*  it's me converting into words. It's obvious that all English speakers, if they listen to Obama,
*  but if you have to translate to a different language, I think you're going to lose a lot of
*  Yeah. I mean, when I watched the, I mean, I watched many of Putin's speeches, you know,
*  just in Russian, not looking at any of the, you know, the subtitles or anything. And it's
*  just watching the way that his body language is at the time when he's saying things, the way that
*  you smoke, he'll sneer, he'll laugh, he'll ad lib, you know, kind of from something that obviously
*  kind of, you know, wasn't there on the prepared speech. And it's really critical. And, you know,
*  kind of a lot, some people speak, you know, like Trump, it just needs kind of just words.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Putin, the words are very important. Trump, it's the atmosphere. It's the kind of the way you feel
*  about things. It's the buzz you get, you know, it's revving people up. It's the kind of slogans and
*  Putin, it's, you know, he's conveying a lot in what he's saying there.
*  I think, I mean, of course I don't know much because I only speak Russian and English,
*  but I have in English or Russian have not met almost anyone ever as interesting in conversation
*  as Putin. I think he shines not in speeches, but in interactions with others.
*  Yeah. When you watch those interviews and things with him, and I've, you know, been at many of
*  these sessions, it's been hours of him parrying questions. And it's like watching a boxer sparring,
*  you know, in a kind of training bout. Yeah, come on, give me another one. You know, and it's kind
*  of like, and he prides himself and he's made mistakes often, but the breadth of, you know,
*  the issues that he's often covered has been interesting, has been fascinating. And I used to
*  just take, you know, kind of really detailed notes about this because you learn a ton.
*  But it's not about his worldview again. I mean, he does live in a certain box like we all do.
*  And, you know, again, his world experience is not as extensive as, you know, you would hope it would
*  be, but that's why you have to really pay attention. That's where we've messed up.
*  That's where we haven't really paid a lot of attention to what he's been saying. He's been
*  telegraphing this grievances, dissatisfaction, this, I'm going to do something for years.
*  And the thing is during war time, the combined with propaganda and the narratives of resentment
*  and grievance that you dig in on those, like maybe you start out not believing it, but you're sure
*  it's all going to believe it eventually. Well, you convince yourself over time. Yeah. Look, the longer
*  you're in a position like Putin, 22 years now, come at one, 23 years, could be out there for 36
*  years. You become more and more rigid. I mean, this is again, you know, something that you see
*  in history. You know, you look at, you know, people through history have moved from kind of being kind
*  of left wing and been in the perspectives to hard right. They kind of have a kind of a sort of an
*  ossification or rigidity emerges in their views. I mean, again, I used to have these arguments with
*  Professor Pius about Lenin because he would talk about Lenin, but he didn't change his mind from
*  being 18. Have you not thought about that? I mean, it's like, we're not formed, fully formed
*  individuals at 18. You know, we don't know anything. We know something, but not everything.
*  I mean, obviously the younger context, you know, the kind of the way that you kind of grow up,
*  the place you grow up, the things that happen to you, the traumas you have. I mean, all of these
*  have an impact. But then if you don't grow beyond all of that, and Putin's been stuck in place and
*  since 2000, when he became president, he's not out and about, you know, kind of being a man of the people.
*  You know, he's not doing the kind of things that he used to do. Yeah, he gets out there and he goes
*  to Kazakhstan and, you know, Tajikistan and he goes to China and he does this and that. And then
*  under COVID, he didn't go anywhere. I mean, very few places. And so he got stuck. And that worries
*  me a lot because you could see before that he had a bit more of flexibility of thought. And that's
*  why nobody should be in place forever. You should always kind of like get out there and go out there
*  and learn a new skill, you know, kind of, he needs some, he needs to sort of, you know, he needed to
*  get out more and do something different. You had an interesting point you've made that both
*  Vladimir Zelensky and Putin are thinking about, they're just politicians. They're thinking about
*  the 2024 election, which is coming up for both of them. Yeah, I've said that in some of the other
*  interviews. Yeah, that's true. That's so interesting. I mean, because their election's
*  going to be pretty much at the same time. As the US election also. Oh, that'll be before. I mean,
*  because sometime in that, you know, early part of the year for the presidential election. Yeah. And
*  also, I don't know if you know about US elections, but they actually last way longer than a year.
*  We're in it now, aren't we? You know, already. We're already starting. So there's going to be
*  a significant overlap. Yeah, you know, you're right. Do you think that actually comes into play
*  in their calculus? I think it was one of the reasons why Putin invaded in February 2022,
*  because it was going to be two years. I mean, he thought it'd be over by March of 2022. And he
*  got two years to prepare for the election. And he got a big boost. You know, not only he got a boost
*  from Crimea. I mean, I didn't mention that before. I mean, one of the reasons for invading Crimea,
*  and annexing or invading Ukraine the first time annexing Crimea was, look, what happened to his
*  ratings? They went from kind of declining, and it was still pretty good, you know, by anybody's
*  standards to just rocketing off into the stratosphere. I mean, I didn't really meet
*  anybody in Russia who thought that annexing Crimea was, you know, kind of a bad thing.
*  I mean, even, you know, kind of people who would post Putin on so many other things. Crimea was,
*  you know, Krimnash, they kept saying, you know, this is kind of, you know, we got it back,
*  you know, it should never have gone away. It was ours, you know, but, you know, this is more
*  complex. And he wasn't, I don't think at the time, planning on annexing all of Ukraine,
*  when he went into this special military operation, he was going to try to turn it into what Belarus
*  has become, you know, part of a, you know, bring back the Commonwealth of Independent States or
*  the Union, then a new union with Belarus and Ukraine and Russia over time. But certainly,
*  you know, remove Ukraine as a major factor, independent factor on the world stage and,
*  you know, consolidate Crimea and maybe, you know, kind of incorporate Donetsk and Lukhansk, you know,
*  kind of, that was also a possibility. But it wasn't, it wasn't in his intention, in any case,
*  to have something on this kind of scale. He wanted to get on with then preparing for what
*  was going to be, he would think the cakewalk, the shoe in of the next presidential election.
*  I mean, last time around, he had to invent a bit of competition with this person who's reputed to
*  be his goddaughter, Ksenia Sobchak, you know, for a bit of, you know, kind of entertainment for people.
*  You know, this next time around, you know, maybe he wasn't really planning on running,
*  you know, against any other, you know, serious opposition. He was just going to have the acclaim
*  of, you know, the kind of the great leader, like President Xi in China. You know, Putin,
*  you know, was basically, I think, you know, he also hoped that he would be able to devolve some
*  authority away, you know, kind of, so he's more like the, you know, the supreme leader kind of
*  figure, the czar-like figure, the monarch. And then, you know, other people get on with the
*  chief executive, prime ministerial running the country, and he could kind of like step back and
*  just enjoy this, you know, maybe there was going to be again a new union of Belarus, Russia and
*  then Ukraine in some fashion, and he would preside over that.
*  So speaking of opposition, you've criticized the famed Putin critic, Alexei Navalny.
*  What's the nature of your criticism?
*  Well, it hasn't really been a kind of a criticism in the way that, you know, people have implied,
*  but more just reminding people that Navalny isn't some stooge of the West as other people have,
*  you know, kind of depicted him in the Russian firm, but, you know, saying that this is kind of,
*  he's pro-Western, he's a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot. You know, in the past,
*  he's articulated, you know, things are not sort of dissimilar from some of the people around Putin,
*  and it's more just reminding people that, you know, just because you kind of see somebody,
*  you know, as a kind of in an opposition figure or somebody who might be more palatable from,
*  you know, your perspective looking from the West, they're not always going to be, you know,
*  what you think they are. Alexei Navalny is a Russian, and, you know, in a particular
*  Russian context, he's different from Putin, but he wouldn't necessarily, you know, kind of run,
*  you know, the Russian system in ways that we will like. So that's kind of, it's not a kind of a
*  criticism, it's more of a critique of the way that we look at things. You know, I think it's a mistake
*  to always, you know, say, well, this is pro-Western, or this is a, you know, liberal, I mean, what the
*  heck does that mean, pro-Western? I mean, he's a Russian, he's a Russian nationalist and a Russian
*  patriot. And he's often, you know, been, you know, quite critical about immigration. He's had some
*  negative views about, you know, one part of him said, don't feed the Caucasus, you know, kind of
*  played upon some of the, you know, the racial and ethnic tensions inside of, you know, Russia itself
*  as well. Now he is a pluralist, and then he's kind of, and he wants to have, you know, different
*  set of political actors there, but he also isn't promoting revolution. He's not Lenin, he's not
*  one to bring down the state. He wants to kind of, you know, change the people who are in charge.
*  That's what he's being basically focused on. And, you know, he might have, and have things,
*  and do things that, you know, we elsewhere might not like. And I guess the bigger picture there is,
*  it's not trivial to know that if you place another human in power to replace the current
*  human in power, that things are going to be better. They could be a lot worse because
*  there's a momentum to a system. A system is bigger than just this leader, even when that leader has
*  a huge amount of power. That's absolutely right. And, you know, he grew up in that, you know,
*  same system. Now he's younger than Putin, so he's got a different generational perspective.
*  And he's not wedded to the Soviet Union or, you know, kind of some concept of the Russian
*  Empire. He doesn't seem to spend a lot of time. I don't know what he's doing, you know, in jail,
*  but he's probably not sitting around, you know, reading Lomonosov and, you know, the kind of the
*  great kind of tracks of Russian history. Could be actually. But I mean, I think, you know,
*  Navalny has a different worldview and a different perspective, just like Medvedev was different,
*  you know, in his time and presidency and made some, you know, changes and some innovations there.
*  But don't think that they're going to be radically different because, look, Gorbachev, I mean, he was
*  so different from Andropov and Chinenko and others as a person, but he was also constrained by the
*  system. And he wanted to have change, but he wanted evolutionary change. He didn't know how
*  to do it, but he didn't want to bring the whole system down. Look at Khrushchev when he came in,
*  you know, after that whole period of, you know, everybody trying to figure out what to do after
*  Stalin had died and there was all this kind of back and forth and eventually Khrushchev emerges.
*  And, you know, he tries to make changes to the system, but he's also a creature of a very specific
*  context. He's grown up in the same system and he, you know, kind of brings all kinds of elements of
*  chaos there into the whole thing and, you know, gets into a standoff with the United States
*  that we know as the Cuban Missile Crisis and eventually, you know, gets removed.
*  You know, we're looking at what's happening in the United Kingdom right now. You know,
*  they've just churned through three prime ministers and actually five prime ministers in, you know,
*  kind of as many years, but all of those prime ministers have come out with the context of the
*  conservative party in the whole, you know, kind of just shades of, you know, the same thing. They've
*  all come out of the same academic and, you know, kind of privileged backgrounds. Even Rishi Sunak,
*  the new prime minister, who's the first, you know, Indian or Anglo-Indian prime minister
*  in British history. It was a kind of phenomenal, you know, kind of as a child of Indian immigrants,
*  but also a person of great privilege from the same academic and party background as the others.
*  You know, so there are always differences with those human beings, but those contexts matter a
*  lot. What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon?
*  Well, Putin's definitely been thinking about it, right? I mean, he is the kind of person,
*  if he's got an instrument, he wants to figure out how to use it. You know, we look at polonium,
*  we look at Novichok, you know, we look at all kinds of things, you know, that he's also presided over
*  in Syria. He has, you know, put in charge of the war in Ukraine now. General Svorikin is known as
*  General Armageddon, you know, the kind of person who, you know, pretty much facilitated the use of
*  chemical weapons in Syria, you know, for example. So, you know, don't think that Putin, you know,
*  hasn't thought about how ruthless he can possibly be. The question is really the calculation. It's
*  his estimation of the probability that it will get the desired effect.
*  We keep talking about this idea of escalate to de-escalate. That's not what the Russians,
*  you know, how they call it, but it's the whole idea that you do something really outrageous
*  to get everybody else to back off. Now, when you talked about the precedent that the United States
*  set of detonating the nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what, you know, he obviously meant
*  the precedent of using nuclear weapons, of course, which of course, we would then say, well, we showed
*  then how the impermissibility of ever doing that again. But what he's talking about is the precedent
*  of escalating to such an extent that you stop the war because he reads that saying, well, you know,
*  the US dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war was brought to a quick conclusion.
*  And of course, there's a huge debate in America about whether it was necessary to do that,
*  whether the war was ending anyway. Did that really, you know, kind of change the minds of the
*  Japanese high command? I mean, there's all kind of books being written about that. And of course,
*  you know, the revulsion that people felt in the wake of that was just, you know, just the shock
*  of what actually happened. And we've spent, you know, 70 years, you know, basically coming to terms
*  with the fact that we did something like that. You know, the fire bombing, you know, we've also
*  looked at all the bombing, you know, in Vietnam and everywhere. And, you know, all these massive
*  bombing campaigns are realizing they actually often had the opposite effect. Hiroshima and Nagasaki
*  might have contributed and there's a lot of, you know, scholars suggesting it did to the end of
*  the war. But all of the big bombing campaigns, the destruction actually prolonged wars because
*  they made people fight back as we're kind of seeing in the case of Ukraine. So Putin has to
*  calculate the probability that if he uses some tactical nuclear weapon, that it will get the
*  desired effect, which is get us to capitulate and Ukraine to capitulate. Us to capitulate,
*  meaning the United States and the Europeans not supporting Ukraine anymore, pushing towards a
*  negotiating table and negotiating Ukraine away. And Ukraine saying, okay, we give up, like happened
*  in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in Japan. So it's his calculation, you know, as much as anything else,
*  which is really important. He said, we have to show him that he won't get that out of it.
*  It's kind of less our probability and, you know, kind of the odds of it. It's just how he calculates
*  that probability of getting what he wants. I mean, I guess that's how the game of poker works. It's
*  your probability and your estimate of their probability and your estimate of their estimate
*  of your probability. And so it goes on. I think he has two tools, right? So one is the actual use
*  of nuclear weapons and then the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. Oh, the threat is very effective.
*  And the more real you make the threat, the more you approach the actual use,
*  like get very close to using it. He's already using Chernobyl, Zaporizhzhia and then usually
*  Ukraine's the other nuclear reactor. So he's using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb.
*  It's ironic that he has Sergey Shoigu, his defense minister calling people up to the Ukraine to use
*  a dirty bomb. They're already doing it. I mean, what is kind of more destructive than stirring
*  up all the radioactive dust in Chernobyl as you send your troops through, for example,
*  or shelling the Chernobyl plant and the sarcophagus and putting it at risk? And Zaporizhzhia,
*  you've got the International Atomic Energy Agency running out there in utter panic and kind of
*  also trying to intervene in the conflict. So you're putting civilian nuclear reactors at risk.
*  I mean, that also has the great added effect of cutting off Ukraine's power supply because
*  Zaporizhzhia in particular was a third of Ukraine's power generation or some really high
*  percentage of that. I'll have to go back and take a look at that. But that's a twofer. It's
*  kind of a double effect there of undermining power generation, also frightening Germans and others
*  who've already been very worried about nuclear power and increasing your leverage on the energy
*  front, but also scaring people from the perspective of the use of nuclear weapon. Those reactors also
*  become a nuclear weapon tactically deployed. And as you said, the discussion of using a nuclear
*  weapon and engendering all those fears. And he's already got an effect. Everyone's running around
*  talking about the Cuban missile crisis and secret diplomacy and how we negotiate a way Ukraine in
*  return for Putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon. So he's got a lot of people already talking about
*  that. So sorry for the difficult and dark question. It could be for you directly or more like,
*  do you think we have a plan for this? What happens if he does drop a nuclear weapon? Do you have a
*  sense that the United States has a good plan? I know we're talking about it. I think we probably
*  have several plans because it depends on what, where, when, how. And also don't these things
*  happen very quickly? Well, there's also signaling and signs of movement there. I want to be very
*  careful about this, but the thing is it's also very important that we do this with other nuclear
*  powers. So the other thing that's different from how it might have been in the past and particularly
*  different from the Cuban missile crisis and the Euro missile crisis, we're not the only nuclear
*  players. China has a major nuclear arsenal now, less on the strategic side, but building it up,
*  but very much on the intermediate range and tactical. Kim Jong-un is firing off weapons
*  left, right and center at the moment. In North Korea, we've got other rogue states. Putin's
*  behaving like a rogue state, just to be very clear. And this is what we've got with Kim Jong-un in
*  North Korea. We've also got India and Pakistan, and we've got other states we're not supposed to
*  talk about that we know have nuclear capacities and others that would like to have nuclear
*  capacity. And the whole question here is about also proliferation. Getting back to that time when
*  Ukraine had nuclear weapons, at least there on its territory and so did Belarus and Kazakhstan,
*  you've got to wonder, was it wise for them to give it up? We were worried about, you know, kind of
*  loose nukes, nuclear weapons, you know, kind of getting out of hand proliferation at the time.
*  We wanted fewer nuclear powers. Russia wanted that too. Now we're going to have more. We've
*  got more. And what Putin is saying is, well, that was stupid of Ukraine to give up the nuclear
*  weapons. In fact, my colleagues and I back in our report and back in the US, I kind of suggest they
*  shouldn't give them up. And then that's why we had the Budapest memorandum. That's why the United
*  States and the United Kingdom in particular have, you know, basically some responsibility and
*  obligation going back to 1994 when they promised Ukraine that gave up the nuclear weapons, their
*  territorial integrity and sovereignty would remain intact, some obligation to actually do
*  something to step up. If we step back from that, this is the thing that people are not talking
*  about. You know, what about nuclear proliferation? If you're South Korea or Japan, you know, you're
*  any other country that's kind of worrying about your neighbors and, you know, what might happen
*  to you. And just like India and Pakistan are both like, whoa, you know, we've got to kind of keep
*  our strategic nuclear balance here. Everything is up for question. Saudis will want a nuclear weapon.
*  The Turks already want one. They've talked about one for years. You know, why should the Iranians
*  be the only one with an Islamic nuclear weapon? You know, and if we know that, you know, Iran has
*  breakout capacity now, the Saudis and all the other, you know, states that are in opposition to Iran
*  will also want to have some nuclear capacity. And the United States before wanted to maintain
*  everything under the nuclear umbrella. You know, one of the reasons why Sweden and Finland are
*  joining NATO is because of suddenly all of these nuclear threats. Sweden was actually the last
*  country on the planet to want to have nuclear weapons. They were actually pushing for a ban
*  on nuclear weapons in the United Nations. Now that Putin's doing the nuclear saber rattling,
*  you know, they're talking about joining and on the verge of joining a nuclear alliance. You know,
*  see what's happening here. So we have to make it more and more difficult for Putin to even
*  contemplate that. That's why people are saying this is reckless. This is irresponsible.
*  Putin is actually making the world less safe for himself down the line either, but he's thinking
*  short term here. He's thinking, what can I do? What do I actually have? You can also destroy
*  lots of infrastructure as he's doing. You can use subversion. You know, we're worried about all of
*  the undersea cables, all these weird things happening, you know, off Orkney or in the
*  Mediterranean or, you know, all these other things that are happening, Nord Stream 2 pipelines,
*  other infrastructure. There's all kinds of other things that you can do as well here.
*  It's not just, you know, again, this is civilian nuclear threat of blowing up, you know, one of
*  the reactors. Now it's got to be sure about where the wind turns and the wind blows.
*  And there's all kinds of things to factor in here. But Putin is definitely sitting around
*  calculating with other people, what can I do to turn this around? I mean, he still thinks that
*  he can win this. Or in other words, he can end it on his terms, Crimea, Danetsk, Luhansk,
*  Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and, you know, capitulation, all recognized as being part of Russia.
*  Or he can freeze it and then, you know, kind of figure out where it goes from there, what other
*  pressure he can put on. I mean, I'm sure he's confident he can get rid of Zelensky. And he
*  can prevail over us. I mean, look, I mean, the UK is going through prime ministers, you know, faster
*  than I'm changing my socks. You know, so it's like, you know, he can prevail on the, you know,
*  basically he can have an impact on the political scene in Europe and elsewhere. I mean, again,
*  everyone's talking about winter coming and Putin's thinking, yeah, great, I've, you know, destroyed
*  the infrastructure of Ukraine. Are you worried about the winter? Well, yeah. But I mean, look,
*  the other thing is that we have to start preparing. I mean, we have to start thinking about this. We've
*  got a wartime economy situation. That's where we are. We've got the home front to think about
*  as well. Putin has declared war on us. He did that on September 30th. And he's done it at other points
*  as well. We've just not paid attention. But he was pretty explicit in September 30th. I mean,
*  go back and watch that speech. And, you know, he is gambling that, you know, people will go back,
*  you know, to basically taking Russian gas and oil, but it's not going to be that simple as well.
*  And do people, and then, you know, the question has to be, do we really kind of think he's going
*  to play fair after that? When he's kind of also shown that he can leverage that.
*  It's such a complicated world. It is complicated. It's very complicated.
*  And it's never, I mean, this, it feels like things are heating up, like, and China is very
*  quiet right now. Because they're watching what happens. I mean, for President Xi,
*  you know, he's trying to consolidate his power even further after the party congress, but
*  he doesn't want to look like he made a mistake by backing Putin. I mean, he thought Putin was also
*  going to be in out. Ukraine would probably be open for massive Chinese investment. China was the
*  largest investor in Ukraine before the war. Largest single investor. I mean, the EU was bigger,
*  of course. How do you hope the war ends in Ukraine?
*  Well, I mean, I do hope it ends, you know, with a ceasefire and a negotiated solution, but it has
*  to be with Russia compromising on something. And that's not where we are right now.
*  Do you think both sides might be willing to compromise?
*  Most wars always end in that way. I mean, nobody's ever happy.
*  But they don't seem to either side, like legitimately doesn't want to compromise right now.
*  Yeah, because the thing is that for Ukraine, it's not going to be a compromise.
*  For Ukraine right now, anything is a compromise at its expense, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Vast devastation, unbelievable casualty rates, biggest refugee crisis since World War II.
*  Russia's just said, sorry, this is our territory, it's not just Crimea. I think there could have
*  been a negotiation over there. But, you know, Donetsk and Lukhansk, I mean, we've got all kinds
*  of formulas we've had all the way through history of, you know, putting things under a kind of
*  receivership of territory, the United Nations, all kinds of different ways of formulating that.
*  We could have easily been creative. But Russia's basically saying, nope, sorry, we've taken this.
*  And any other negotiations, just you recognizing this for us not doing more destruction.
*  That is not the basis for a negotiation. And, you know, having, you know, kind of people come and
*  just sort of laying those terms down is not a starting position. I think Russia is also,
*  you know, in a dilemma of its own making now, because Putin has made it very difficult,
*  you know, to compromise just by everything that he's said. Now, for Ukraine, they've already won
*  a great moral, political and military victory. It's just hard to see it, right, at the particular
*  moment. They've done what the Finns did in the Winter War, which the Finns were devastated by
*  the Winter War as well, but they pushed them back. Now, the Finns lost a lot of territory,
*  lost Karelia and huge spheres of territory, but they got to be Finland. And now they're,
*  you know, joining NATO, but they've been part of the EU. The question is how to, you know,
*  get Ukraine to be Ukrainian a success. And that's the challenge. Now, again, they've already won
*  psychologically, politically, militarily, because Putin hasn't succeeded in what he wanted to do,
*  but he has succeeded in completely and utterly devastating them. And this is the kind of the
*  old Muscovite, the old Russian imperial, old Soviet mentality, you know, going all the way back to
*  when the Muscovites were the bagmen for the, you know, the horde, for the Mongols. It was destruction.
*  You know, you don't play with us, we'll destroy you. You know, people talk about it as mafia,
*  but it's all, you know, all you have to go down is you go and see Tarkovsky's Andrey Rublyov. I
*  mean, I remember, you know, seeing that film when I was first as a student in Moscow and just being,
*  whoa, this is so brutal. I mean, this is just unremittingly brutal, because the whole point is
*  that you show people who's the boss. The destruction is the point of things as well,
*  because, you know, you are emphasizing your domination. And that's what Putin is doing
*  right now. He's saying, okay, you want to go in a different direction, so be it, but I'm going to
*  make you suffer. Remember when Hodokovsky got out of the penal colony, when Putin let him out eventually?
*  He said he suffered enough, but he suffered for 10, 11 years. I don't think Putin feels that
*  Ukraine has suffered enough at this point, or we have suffered enough.
*  So there's a part of this invasion that's punishment for something.
*  Yeah, it's medieval. I mean, look, we're all capable of the same things, right? There was
*  all that destruction, and that's what Assad was like in Syria, like his father. He would destroy,
*  because he'd teach them a lesson. And look, Britain did that in the colonial era. I mean,
*  all the history of British colonialism is exactly the same. I mean, all the Mao Mao, you know,
*  and Kenya, you know, up until recent times, brutality. Teaching people, you know, teaching
*  them a lesson. You have to suffer. The US did it. I mean, we did it with the Native Americans,
*  you know, we did it all over the place, you know, as well. This is kind of what big states do
*  at different points in history. It's just that, you know, Russia has not moved on from that.
*  I mean, we've learned some lessons later. I hope, you know, we've fully internalized them
*  of, you know, things that we've done, you know, kind of the past United States,
*  we ideally are trying to do better, and most of Europe's trying to do better as well. Think
*  about France and Algeria, you know, again, you know, we can see this in many different settings.
*  But I think, you know, for Putin right now, he hasn't taught all of us sufficient a lesson.
*  I just, I talked to hundreds of people in Ukraine and the tough thing,
*  the inspiring thing is that there's a unity. The tough thing is a lot of them speak intensely of
*  hate towards not just Russia, but Russians, Russians.
*  That's how Europeans felt about Germany and Germans at the end of World War II.
*  And generational hate, like, I don't think that hate is going to pass.
*  Well, it might well take a generation. I mean, I, when I was a kid in the 70s, I went on exchanges
*  to Germany. And that was like, you know, 30 years, more than 30 years after the end of the war,
*  my grandfather who'd fought in World War I wouldn't speak to my parents when they sent me on a,
*  I mean, I hadn't fought in World War II, we fought in World War I, he hated the Germans.
*  And he did not want me going, you know, to Germany as an exchange student. He refused to meet,
*  you know, kind of the German kid who, you know, came to stay at my house.
*  You know, for example, I mean, it takes a long time to, you know, it takes a long time to get
*  over that. But you do, I mean, and we have, we have in Europe, and that was the whole point
*  of, you know, all of that kind of exercise of European unity after World War II. Now,
*  the big challenge is what do we do with Russia? Because a lot of people are talking about we
*  can't have European security without Russia. Other people are saying we can't have a Europe,
*  you know, kind of with Russia, you know. So how do we deal with this? We've got to basically kind
*  of, it's going to be like Japan and Germany after World War II, after this, just the level
*  of the atrocities that have been carried out, as you said, the level of hatred.
*  But we found a way of doing it. Now, a lot of it will require change on the part of Russia as well
*  and Russians and really thinking about this. I mean, Gorbachev before tried to deal
*  in the late 1980s with the black spots in, with glasnost, with openness and talking about Russian
*  history, just kind of never sort of withered on the vine as time went on.
*  What gives you hope about the future? Well, my hope comes into the fact that we've done things
*  before, that we've got ourselves out of tough times and we've overcome stuff and in people,
*  because I meet amazing people. You just talked about hundreds of people that you've met within
*  Ukraine. And, you know, people all think differently, contexts and circumstances change,
*  and people can evolve. Some people get stuck, Putin's got stuck, but people can evolve.
*  And, you know, I do think that if we all pull together, and we've seen this in so many contexts,
*  we can find solutions to things. Just like we get back again to our discussion about scientists
*  and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs of, you know, what we did on COVID or done on, you know,
*  kind of other diseases and things. And look, there is some similarities, there's a pathology
*  around war and conflict. Years ago in the 1990s, I worked on, you know, a lot of projects that were
*  funded by the Carnegie Corporation of the United States under the then presidency of David Hamburg,
*  who was a scientist, and actually did see a lot of parallels between the sort of like the pathology
*  of disease and, you know, kind of the pestilence, you know, conflict kind of idea. And of course,
*  these, you know, parallels have to be very careful because, you know, they're not neat. But there
*  was kind of like an idea in there and how do you sort of treat this? How do you deal with this?
*  And we did come up with all kinds of ideas and, you know, things that are still out there. We've
*  created institutions that have helped to keep the peace. We just have neglected them, allowed them to
*  degrade, just like the United Nations. And, you know, we've created problems inside of them,
*  like the veto power of the permanent powers on the UN Security Council. But we can change that.
*  You're just going to have a will. And I do think out there, there are sufficient people with a will,
*  and we've just got to get people mobilized. I mean, I'm always amazed by how people can mobilize
*  themselves around a crisis. Remember Winston Churchill, I don't quote all the time because
*  I can never remember half his quotes. But I do remember the one about never let a good crisis go
*  to waste. And I always think that that, you know, yeah, that we should, we shouldn't let this crisis
*  go to waste. And something else can come out of this, just like in Ukraine, that we worried before
*  about corruption in Ukraine, the influence of the oligarchs. We've got to run oligarchs here in the
*  US. We need to, you know, deal with as well. But this is a chance to do it differently.
*  Yeah, it really is a chance to do things differently. And a part of that is young people.
*  I have to ask you. It is young people. I mean, I'm feeling a bit on the older side now, but I still
*  feel I've got, you know, a bit of, you know, kind of youth within me at 57. I'm not that old, but
*  I'm not that young. But we have to work together with younger and older people. You might work
*  together in coalitions of, you know, across generations. You remind me of kids who just
*  graduated college and say, I feel old. Yeah, no, I don't actually feel old, but it is a number age.
*  And, you know, when you kind of think about when I was, I thought you don't like math. Yeah.
*  I know. It's like things like that. Yeah. But I find it interesting. But you know, when I was,
*  I remember when I was a little kid, I kept thinking about the year 2000 and I thought, oh my God,
*  I'll be dead. I'll be 35. Yeah. That's 22 years ago. You've overcome a lot of struggle in your life
*  based on different reasons as you write about class being one of them, your funny sounding
*  accent being another, or just representation of class. But in general, through all of that,
*  to be at the White House, to be one of the most powerful voices in the world,
*  what advice would you give from grounded in your life story to somebody who's young,
*  somebody who's in high school and college, thinking of how they can have a big
*  positive impact on the world? Well, we all have a voice, right? We all have agency. We all actually
*  have the ability to do something. And you can, you know, start small in your local community or,
*  even in your own classroom, just helping somebody else out or speaking up and advocating on behalf
*  of things. You know, when I was like 11 years old, I got involved with other kids on Save the Wales.
*  You know, we had all this, you know, kind of, we were hardly Greta Thunberg, but we kind of got
*  together in a kind of network writing to people and, you know, trying to raise money to help
*  save the world. Now, actually, the Wales of the world are doing somewhat better. I can't say that
*  that was because of me and my network, but, you know, it was kind of a way of organizing and,
*  you know, kind of joining in at a larger movement. Everybody can be part of something bigger.
*  The thing is, it's all about working together with others and giving other people a chance as well.
*  I think, you know, one thing is that our voices have more impact when they're amplified. They
*  don't have to be the voices of discord or the voices of hate. You know, you've been, you know,
*  trying to do this with your podcast, you know, kind of give people a voice, give them a kind of
*  platform and, you know, get them to join in with other people. And, you know, one of the things
*  that I've been trying to do is, you know, kind of go and talk to just as many people as I possibly
*  can and say, look, you know, we can all do something here. We can all, you know, lend our voices to a
*  cause that we care deeply about. We can be kind to each other. We can give other people a chance. We
*  can kind of speak out while we see that, you know, something is wrong and we can try to, you know,
*  explain things to people. And what I'm trying to do at the moment is just sort of explain, you know,
*  what I've learned about things and, you know, hope that that helps people make informed judgments of
*  their own and that, you know, kind of maybe take things further and learn something more. It's like
*  kind of building up on, you know, the knowledge, you know, that I have, you know, to try to be
*  important. But isn't everybody can do that different ways? You can kind of, like, reach back,
*  you know, for 14, help somebody who's seven. For 21, help somebody who's 14, you know, kind of,
*  you know, the kind of my age now, I'm always trying to, you know, reach back and, you know,
*  work with younger people, listen to younger people, help them out, make connections for them,
*  listen to what they have to say about something, try to incorporate that in, you know, things that
*  I'm saying as well. The main point is that we've all got a voice, we've all got agency,
*  and it always works better when we work together with other people.
*  But sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless. It can feel, I mean, there's low points. You seem to have
*  a kind of restless energy, a drive to you. Were there low points in the beginning when
*  in your early days when you're trying to get the education where
*  it may have not been clear to you that you could be at all successful?
*  Yeah, there always were. I mean, there were lots of points where I was just despondent. But then,
*  you know, I'd meet somebody who would just suddenly turn things around. I was this look,
*  or was I out there looking for it? You know, sometimes, you know, you just, if you're open
*  and receptive to, you know, kind of hearing something from someone else. I mean, you know,
*  there are often times where I felt so despondent, you know, in such a black mood, I didn't think
*  I'd be able to go on. And then I'd have a chance conversation with somebody. I mean, I once remember,
*  you know, sitting on a bench, I was probably 11 or 12, just crying my eyes out, just really upset.
*  And an old lady just came and sat next to me, put her arm around me, said, oh, it's all right, pet.
*  What's the matter? You know, it can't be that bad, can it? And it was just this human embrace. It's
*  like somebody, you know, just basically reaching out to me that snapped me out of it. And I thought,
*  you know, here's somebody just, you know, she didn't know who I was. She just felt really bad
*  that I was, you know, sitting, you know, crying. And I mean, I can't even remember what it was
*  about anymore. You know, now it just seems inconsequential at the time. I probably thought
*  my life was at an end. Just, you know, sometimes people making out contact with you in the street
*  and saying something to you can kind of pull you out of something. And, you know, it's kind of a,
*  I think you would just have to open yourself up to the prospect that not everyone's bad,
*  just like you were saying before, that there's, you know, good in everybody, even during, you know,
*  that really difficult period of the impeachment. You know, I was trying to listen very carefully
*  to people. And I thought, we always, we still have something in common here. We need to remember
*  that, you know, kind of when people are kind of forgetting who they are, or, you know, the context
*  in their operating, there's always something that can, you know, can pull you back again.
*  There's always that kind of thread. So I'm sure you were probably attacked by a lot of people
*  and you were still able to keep that optimism that you- Well, I kept it into kind of perspective.
*  Like when I was a kid, I mean, things I mentioned before, I got bullied, you know, kind of again,
*  and I tried to understand why they're doing this. One of the most amazing things that happened,
*  you know, really almost my dad was a pretty incredible person and he would always open my
*  eyes to something. I was getting bullied really nastily by a girl at school. And my dad started
*  asking me questions about her. And one day my dad said we were going to go for a walk.
*  And my town's very small. Remember, it's very depressed, really, you know, a deprived area.
*  And we go to this housing estate, public housing place that's not too far away from where I live.
*  And it's really, you know, kind of one of the most rundown places and an already rundown place.
*  My dad knocks on the door and I said, what are we doing, Dad? And he says, we're going off to,
*  you know, we're going to visit somebody, an old family friend, I think a distant relative.
*  We knock on the door and this old man answers the door and he says, oh Alfie. My dad's name is Alf
*  Alfie. You know, kind of, oh, fancy seeing you here and seeing you. Come on in, have a cup of
*  tea. What are you doing? He said, oh, I'm just walking past my daughter. We're going for a trip.
*  Now we're going for a walk. And then suddenly I see that girl and she's in the kitchen. And I'm
*  thinking, oh my God, bloody hell, you know, British expression, what's this? And it turns out
*  that dad had figured out who she was. And he knew her grandfather and she was living with a
*  grandfather and she'd been abandoned by her parents and she was living in, you know, pretty dire
*  circumstances and she'd been getting raised by her grandfather and she was just miserable.
*  And the reason she was bullying me was to make herself feel better. And after that,
*  she never bullied me again. I mean, we didn't even talk because there was a connection made.
*  And suddenly she realized that her grandfather, who was the only person she had, knew my dad and
*  there were some, they were friends or they were even family, some, you know, kind of relationship
*  there. I mean, I was raised to half of North of England. I had no idea how we were related.
*  Everybody was some relative because people have lived there for generations to get in this very
*  small area. And that turned things around. So just remember you might have, and that's kind of
*  suddenly talked to me, there's always a reason why somebody's doing something. A lot of the times
*  they're really unhappy with themselves. Sometimes there's something else going on in their lives.
*  Sometimes they just don't know any better. And I shouldn't take it personally because I don't
*  have a personal connection with half these people who are up there saying that they want this and
*  that to happen to me. Well, thank you for the kindness and empathy you still carry in your heart.
*  I can see it through all that you must have gone through in the recent couple of years.
*  It's really inspiring to see that. And thank you for everything you've done, for the work you've
*  written, for the work you continue to write and to do. This seems like a really, really difficult
*  time for human civilization on a topic that you're a world expert in. So don't mess it up.
*  No, I know. Let's just keep it together, right? Exactly. Keep it together.
*  Your words have a lot of power right now. So it's a really, really tricky time. So thank you so much.
*  Given how valuable your time is to sit down with me today, it was an honor.
*  No, it's a privilege and a pleasure to talk to you as well. Thank you.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Fiona Hill. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from John
*  Steinbeck. Power does not corrupt. Fear corrupts. Perhaps the fear of the loss of power.
*  Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
