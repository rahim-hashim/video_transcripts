# GothamChess: Hans Niemann, Magnus Carlsen, Cheating Scandal & Chess Bots | Lex Fridman Podcast #327
**Lex Fridman:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSMpTmibeDw)
*  I have anal beads that are communicating with stockfish via Bluetooth.
*  We'll get to that.
*  If you cheat, you play God.
*  You decide when the game is over.
*  You can fake bad moves.
*  You can fake everything.
*  You can even if you're cheating, quote unquote, the right way,
*  you're going to lose plenty of games to avoid getting detected.
*  What's the probability that Hans cheated over the board
*  against Magnus in St.
*  I think day by day.
*  The evidence is slowly starting to show more and more that he's cheated.
*  It's like like how Magnus said, more than he said and more recently.
*  The following is a conversation with Levy Rosman, also known as Gotham Chess.
*  He's a professional chess player and educator.
*  I highly recommend you check out his YouTube channel called Gotham Chess.
*  This is a Lex Friedman podcast to support it.
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Levy Rosman.
*  You're known for being able to guess people's ELO rating.
*  So what do you think just by looking at my face deep into my eyes?
*  What's my ELO rating?
*  Yeah, I'll help you. I'll do E4 for the listener.
*  I actually read that Stockfish prefers E4.
*  Does it really?
*  I actually didn't know that because it maximizes the number of tactical options.
*  So that makes sense.
*  The right answer is 3400, which is, I believe, Stockfish.
*  You guess people's ELO chess rating.
*  What's that take? How hard is it to do that?
*  And like, how would you actually do that?
*  Like, what are telltale signs of red flags about a person at different ratings?
*  Is there something you look for?
*  Yeah, I think you can separate it something like the very first, the zero to about eight,
*  nine hundred for simplicity sake.
*  I'm going to use the chess dot com rating system because Lee chess is slightly different.
*  It tends to go two, three hundred points higher than chess dot com,
*  sometimes even four or five hundred points higher.
*  But then it catches up. They catch up around 22, 2300, I would say.
*  What's chess dot com? What's Lee chess?
*  Can you like, yeah, so explain what the differences and what they are?
*  There are two chess websites.
*  Good starting point.
*  Yes. Chess dot com is it has obviously the free option where you can play games.
*  You get some sort of puzzles every single day.
*  You get some sort of lessons every single day.
*  But then they have tiered memberships where you can pay annually or per month
*  that you can unlock all the other features.
*  And like what? Like for training, for training, for puzzles and all that.
*  Yeah, they have unlimited puzzles, but they also have their biggest selling point,
*  for sure, is like a dedicated game review that it's like very flashy and sophisticated.
*  And the coach will literally tell you what you did wrong.
*  Every single moment, the computer evaluated a mistake.
*  But the most important thing that they have is they offer
*  international masters, grandmasters the opportunity to make video lesson libraries,
*  which hundreds of hours of anything.
*  I can even learn some stuff on there, probably.
*  I have anal beads that are communicating with stockfish via Bluetooth.
*  We'll get to that. Yes, we will get to that.
*  It's epic. It's actually scary how many people think that's a real thing, by the way,
*  which is the danger of the Internet.
*  But we will get into that.
*  But I tend to believe that people believing a thing that's hilarious
*  at scale will make that thing a reality.
*  I'm with Elon on this.
*  I think people manifest the meme.
*  The meme becomes real.
*  So that but that that's in all walks of life.
*  I think there is something about humor sort of being.
*  Why is why did I I was going to I was going to say
*  is I feel like humor becomes a lubricant for the trajectory of human civilization.
*  And I don't know why the word lubricant went into my head, which beads.
*  I understand. Yeah, but it's very Freudian anyway.
*  So it's in zero to 900.
*  If you're a 1300 player, you were saying if you're not good at end games,
*  you don't understand how to convert positions that have seven
*  or eight pieces left on the board.
*  You don't know when you're supposed to activate your king.
*  You don't know how a bishop outplays a knight with just several pawns on the board.
*  Those are all very important things because it's not just about.
*  Knowing the theoretical end games, like some positions in chess are literally solved.
*  I showed you a position, I asked, what's the evaluation and how do you win it?
*  There's a technique you're supposed to know that technique in the coaches
*  on chess.com can help or no? Yeah.
*  So these lesson libraries, it's not like a live lesson.
*  It's pre-recorded training position.
*  Walk you through it.
*  And then there's a dynamic factor as well where you can practice.
*  You can practice the theoretical and you can practice a practical game
*  where there's no set format to do something.
*  It's just based on your previous experience.
*  Basically, Lee chess is their entire thing is it's an open source
*  website that tries to be as free as possible and operates totally on donations.
*  They don't have any advertisements they don't have, which is weird because normally
*  in big competitive settings, it's all capitalistic.
*  You have one big entity and another big entity and they're both for profit.
*  But in this case, the big argument is, well, they offer a lot of things for free.
*  You can analyze your games for free.
*  You can you can go into Lee chess's lessons library and do things for free.
*  The comparison that I always make is chess.com is basically like having a good
*  personal trainer and having someone to help you at the gym.
*  Lee chess says you have to do all the stuff yourself so you can combine YouTube
*  with Lee chess, no one's going to really point you in the right direction.
*  You got to go fully explore on your own.
*  If you want to do it, you can.
*  I also like to say, can I make a controversial joke?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Ardent Lee chess supporters are like very angry, you know, only vegetarian or
*  vegan folks because they will tear you apart and try to convert you as much as possible.
*  Did you just, did you just point a large number of, of haters onto this very podcast?
*  Is this what just happened?
*  No.
*  Is there like several people that were very upset at you right now?
*  No.
*  And throwing things?
*  Okay.
*  No, no.
*  That's always the joke that I've made because if people have chess.com and I
*  love all people, but I'm just saying chess.com patrons do not try to actively
*  convert folks on Lee chess, folks on Lee chess are like, you know, there's a meme
*  chess.com chess.
*  It started at Lee chess.
*  Start somewhere in red on Reddit, anarchy chess kind of a,
*  Oh, so Lee chess is a little bit of an anarchist organization.
*  Would you, would you go as far as to say they're a terrorist, terrorist,
*  extremist organization?
*  Are we going there for legal reasons?
*  That's a, I thought Lee chess has like really good analysis.
*  I somebody does it have an engine for analysis of like games or is that, is
*  that an open source thing that like, they both do, they both use stockfish 15.
*  Okay.
*  And then the rest is the interface around stock stockfish that shows
*  it's tough.
*  It's, it's the life.
*  So chess has a live server where you and I can play a game against each other.
*  We just both see you can, if we have the same rating, we have the same criteria.
*  We'll, we'll play a game, but there's also reviewing your own games.
*  There's an opening database so you can see what the most popular trends are.
*  So Lee chess is great.
*  Like I'm, I'm sponsored by chess.com and I will openly say that, but you
*  can't have, you're deeply biased.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  But I'm also complimenting the competitor, but, but can you play games on
*  Lee chess or is it just for analysis?
*  Yeah, you can.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's the same exact thing.
*  So they're like legitimately competitors, not exactly the same thing, but they
*  have the, they're trying to match for features, but you're saying Lee chess
*  is more chaotic and then chess.com is more like professional.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if it's chaotic.
*  I just know that it's a, you have to, no one's going to hold your hand.
*  If you, if you go to, to Lee chess, you absolutely can, you can play games.
*  You can analyze your games, but you have to discover it yourself.
*  The whole point of chess.com is to make the journey as simple as possible.
*  But I also firmly believe you can't have any sort of growth in chess
*  without a chess.com or a chess 24.
*  What's that?
*  Oh, what's chess 24?
*  So just when you, for it was another live server with some lesson
*  libraries and so on, but they were, I think the process was they
*  were bought by play Magnus.
*  So what's play Magnus play Magnus that's Magnus Carlson's thing.
*  He doesn't own it.
*  He owns some stake in it.
*  I think nine or 10%.
*  They owned a bunch of chess companies, including chess 24, but now it seems
*  like they're either merging or basically getting acquired by chess.com.
*  Got it.
*  And then play Magnus, it's an app also where you can play different levels,
*  but there's also the educational stuff.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  The for-profit chess companies make the option for grand masters to make a living,
*  to make chess and e-sport.
*  Yeah.
*  Lee chess is great.
*  It doesn't put on any events.
*  There's no commentary.
*  So you, you can have both in theory and probably some controversy is good.
*  Does chess.com like sponsor you that help you out in some way?
*  Like what's the connection between your videos and streams and so on and
*  chess.com like, are they supporting people in that way or no?
*  My content, they don't necessarily, I just make whatever I want.
*  Like I don't have a, I'm not senseless.
*  They do whatever they want.
*  I don't have, I'm not senseless.
*  If they do something stupid, I will call out their leadership.
*  It's not like, but I to have the logo up, like in my YouTube videos or on my,
*  yeah, that's just that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  So anyway, back to, I mean, that was really helpful.
*  I was confused about all of that.
*  The guessing people's rating.
*  So the thing you mentioned about the end game, if you don't know what the hell
*  you're doing with the end game, what does that mean about your writing?
*  If you don't know how to finish with just a few pieces on the board,
*  you could be my rating.
*  End game is tough.
*  That's the self-deprecating humor we tuned in for.
*  And games are hard, man.
*  They're tough.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't have, there's a reason Magnus is the best because seven hours into a
*  game, when everybody's given up, he's still squeezing juice out of the fruit.
*  So that's the way I would describe it.
*  So that's not a good source of information.
*  If you know within the first 15 moves, generally you can tell, because you can
*  tell how well they played the opening.
*  So how well they knew what they were supposed to memorize, what they were
*  supposed to play and then how they react to peace interactions.
*  So if they are faced with a move that a more advanced player would deal with very
*  swiftly because there's kind of a natural response that gives you information.
*  If they move their King, when they're in check, when they didn't have to,
*  that's a massive giveaway.
*  Some people just think, Oh, I'm in check.
*  So I have to move my King.
*  Okay.
*  So it's like how direct the response of your play is to the danger.
*  So like, if you're more moving, like multiple pieces at a time, meaning like
*  you're moving, like the pieces are tied together in interesting ways.
*  And then, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Like what about like, uh, what about the opening?
*  Can you tell also?
*  Because a lot of people can memorize openings, right?
*  Yeah, but takes two to tango.
*  So you could memorize a bunch of stuff, but if you're 900 and I'm 900, your
*  rating is fluctuating all over the place in the, in this podcast, I feel
*  it's all 13, 900, you can memorize things.
*  I'm going to play some crap and you can't play the way you, you memorized
*  because I have to respond to you in certain ways.
*  So you will either respond the way you think you're supposed to respond.
*  And that will probably be incorrect.
*  Or now you have to figure out how to deal with the fresh position.
*  Also the 900 will reflect itself in both cases.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if actually, so, uh, do you know your current rating or no, or your top
*  rating, what was your top?
*  I know both my current.
*  Elo like over the board now is 23, 20.
*  My peak was 24, 30.
*  Oh, cool.
*  So can you play like a 900 player?
*  Like, can you force yourself so you can like, given that you've
*  guessed a lot of Elo ratings, can you kind of emulate that?
*  It's kind of an interesting question.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Before I was doing YouTube and Twitch, I was teaching kids.
*  So I had to, not only did I have to play at their rating, I also had to play and
*  sometimes even behave and explain things in a way that the kid could
*  understand.
*  So absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's what contributed to the growth of the channel.
*  Frankly, I kind of understood how beginners thought about the game.
*  So yeah, you did, um, you taught people chess, you coach people for, for many
*  years, I guess in New York.
*  Yeah, New York.
*  What did you learn about the way people learn from that?
*  So like how, how did people that were successful at getting good at chess
*  quickly, what were the, some of the commonalities?
*  Some of the patterns that you saw?
*  Obsession.
*  Yeah.
*  What does obsession look like?
*  I would say it's obsession and also, and also love of the game.
*  So if you're bored, you don't want to watch a show.
*  You want to boot up chess.com or Lee chess just for, just so I don't get
*  flamed by any, anyone in the audience.
*  Uh, and you just play.
*  So you're saying Lee chess people are the ones that would attack aggressively.
*  They're the kind of.
*  It's probably the chess 24 people.
*  Oh, that's another, I didn't know.
*  I thought just 24 was part of the chess.com
*  well now yes, cult or tribe or whatever terms we want to use.
*  No, no, I'm sure there's even more places to play live.
*  There always have been more places to play live, but, uh, just like I'm Lee
*  chess dominated and well, just 24 is a rough for live interface.
*  Of course they have good courses and everything, but I got it.
*  I got it.
*  And some are even good people or whatever.
*  Yes.
*  That quote goes, okay.
*  Like, uh, obsession.
*  That means the way they look at the board when they're bored, how quickly do they
*  return to the chess board, that kind of stuff, just like how many hours a day
*  they, they want to spend, they spend and wants to spend some kids definitely have
*  a talent, of course there's this eternal debate, talent versus hard work.
*  I don't necessarily know if it's a talent for chess specifically, but it's a talent
*  for, I'm sure there's some sort of spatial visualization in your mind.
*  You're, you start picking up what squares are controlled by your pieces
*  and opponents pieces faster.
*  Your memory is much stronger.
*  So you, you don't just learn openings.
*  Like we discussed, you learn literal patterns such as, Oh, I remember
*  this from two tournaments ago.
*  I remember this from a game I played just yesterday and you just keep
*  playing and playing and playing.
*  But I think the one commonality I think I've seen in all kids, it's, uh,
*  obsession, you have to play a lot.
*  And I've seen kids who are brilliant kids.
*  Like if you give them a page of tactics, puzzles, they solve faster than anybody.
*  They can pick things up here super fast.
*  They're a pleasure to teach.
*  They go to a tournament, disaster.
*  They can't handle the anxiousness.
*  They can't handle that silent face to face war with another six year old.
*  They can't even handle, there's also trash talk.
*  One sentence by a kid can throw off your prize student.
*  And I've seen kids just totally disintegrate.
*  I've seen also my students bully other kids, corn.
*  My student wasn't that strong, but their verbal warfare, which is not allowed,
*  but goes unnoticed.
*  It's not even verbal warfare.
*  Like just going like, Hmm.
*  Like little, little like, like facial expressions you would make at the board.
*  Hey, I didn't even think about that.
*  That's pretty creepy.
*  The intensity, not creepy.
*  That's not the right word, but there's an intensity in that silence over the board.
*  Like you can probably hear stuff like just like, it's super quiet.
*  It's like a library.
*  Yep.
*  And then there's just a tension that builds.
*  You can hear the breathing.
*  Yeah.
*  And at the highest level, both sides are involved in a battle that they both
*  foresee 99% of the time.
*  That's the scary part is that you both see the exact same thing.
*  It's very rare you play a move and I didn't see it.
*  It's that I miss evaluated it.
*  I saw the move could be played, but I missed something three or four moves deeper.
*  You play that move and suddenly you're excited and I'm nervous, but all of a
*  sudden you make an inaccuracy and now the tide shifts, right?
*  We could be on totally different planes throughout the game or we could be on
*  the same plane throughout the game.
*  So it's, it's really fascinating.
*  It.
*  Yeah.
*  So your thought is when you see a move that to you seems suboptimally, you
*  start to think, what was that?
*  You start to try and make sense of that.
*  Did you miscalculate or did they miscalculate?
*  What isn't that what Magnus is really good at is taking people away from like
*  making suboptimal moves to take them away from the known openings or is that unfair
*  to say, yeah, he gets part of his really dominant reputation, I think from not
*  letting people get into ultra theoretical positions.
*  He just won this tournament, this online tournament, and he said he had a, a
*  young player strategy.
*  He had an anti, sorry, a anti young player strategy.
*  What's that mean?
*  It means that by move seven or eight, you go to the database, no games.
*  Kid is on their own.
*  They have to swim on their own.
*  Yeah.
*  And they have to deal with the strategic complexities of the position, which he
*  just, he gets, and he might get from just an enormous database within his brain of
*  historical games that have similar structures or just sheer genius.
*  Like we, we, we won't know.
*  It's a mix of the two for sure.
*  The younger you are, you can't remember a game played in 1951 and some bar in the
*  Soviet union, but he does, cause he read a book once or a magazine once and he
*  just remembers, he remembers the structure, which it's just, it's not fair.
*  It's crazy.
*  Right.
*  What do you think makes them, if we can sort of linger on it, what do you
*  think makes them so good?
*  I think it's the memory and I think it's, he just seems to get the game
*  better than anybody else.
*  That's the best way I can describe it in sports.
*  You have reaction time, you have strength, you have, but also as he's now evolving
*  it's stamina.
*  So there have been games that if you put two other 27, 50 rated players or world
*  top 10 players, they would have drawn the game.
*  The game would have ended the game.
*  Nobody would have won it.
*  You put Magnus as one of the aggressors in that game.
*  Suddenly the chance of victory doubles from 5% to 10%.
*  Weird.
*  What's that about?
*  Cause what is it game six against NEPA?
*  Like, uh, isn't stockfish say that it's supposed to be a draw?
*  So 0.00 does mean a draw sometimes, but other times it means, and it's the joke
*  I always make, it means the stockfish is out for a smoke break.
*  It just, it can't.
*  Can you explain the joke?
*  Can you explain 0.00?
*  Yes.
*  So when, so stockfish will show an evaluation which determines whether the
*  position is equal, slightly better for one side, slightly better for the other
*  side or completely winning.
*  You can, 0.00, 0.2 minus 0.2.
*  That's all within a balance.
*  You can say, okay, black has a little sprinkle of activity, something.
*  White has that.
*  But if it's 0.00, it could be literally a dead draw, meaning theoretically
*  just impossible to win.
*  But oftentimes what that means is the smoke break joke is stockfish doesn't know.
*  There is so much complexity within the position, the combinations of different
*  moves that are acceptable and okay.
*  It cannot evaluate correctly.
*  Wow.
*  So even the end games are tough for stockfish.
*  Which is why Magnus won that game because there was practical value remaining.
*  It wasn't a dead draw.
*  He continued to ask questions over the course of six or seven hours.
*  He would sacrifice a pawn.
*  He would sacrifice another pawn to damage the structure.
*  Valuation stayed the same because a machine could stop him, but not Yan.
*  And that was one of my favorite, that game ruined my whole day, by the way.
*  It destroyed, because I made so many plans that day.
*  It completely ruined my day, but it was a very worthy recap.
*  You were just all in.
*  You watched that whole game.
*  I watched the whole game and the world championship was a crazy time because I
*  wanted to be first with the recap video, but I also wanted to be best with the
*  recap video.
*  So I spent all the hours of the games watching all the live broadcasts and
*  getting all the information, all the variations and trying to put that into the
*  recap.
*  It was, it was a lot of fun.
*  It was a huge adrenaline dump when it was all over.
*  So just for people who don't know, that's the most recent world championship.
*  Um, so you had a, I mean, that was, that was a draw after draw after draw after
*  draw.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was, it was kind of boring in that way.
*  Or maybe our draws, is there like non boring parts within the draw to you when
*  you were like just studying it carefully?
*  For me, yes.
*  For the average viewer, no, that's the truth.
*  Especially when the game itself is not that exciting.
*  When Magnus plays a strange move on move nine or 10 that hasn't ever been played.
*  And then Jan has to try to exploit it and he fails and no attack builds up and they
*  shuffle their pieces for three hours.
*  My favorite thing is when the commentators like, I don't know why he did that.
*  I wonder why he did that.
*  Like when the commentators are confused, that's my, as a, as a person who's just
*  a spectator, just like, uh, that's, that's interesting.
*  Cause then you, the most interesting part is about listening to the commentators
*  who I guess themselves might be grandmasters.
*  Uh, they are trying to, I guess, just like Nepal, just like Magnus tried to
*  figure out what's the idea here.
*  What are you thinking?
*  That's cool.
*  That's, that's, that's an interesting part of the game.
*  But other than that, it's, it seemed, um, yeah, I was sure this is just
*  kind of keep being a draw, especially in that situation.
*  So it's almost, it seems almost remarkable that his, uh, Magnus was able
*  to put, pull out a win in game six.
*  And after that, uh, at least Magnus said that, that, that ends it because now
*  that was going to have to take more risks and that opens it up to pure chess.
*  And then it's, uh, who was it?
*  Uh, Steve pre-fontaine said like, whenever it's, whenever there's a race is down to
*  like pure guts, then that's when I win it.
*  There was also a conversation about Jan's first half, second half in any
*  tournament and the first half, he's just brilliant on fire.
*  You could even say he was out playing Magnus, but the entire conversation
*  before the match was Jan slows down.
*  And at the first sign of a loss or a setback, the match might fall apart.
*  And that was the worst way to lose.
*  There was literally no worse way.
*  And it just got worse from there and there.
*  I mean, it was one move mistakes.
*  And, but he's back.
*  He's Jan has won the candidates again.
*  He's going to play for the world championship.
*  So who you got, who you got, what is, what is this slang terminology?
*  Can we like, uh, somehow edit that into a more sophisticated with the British
*  accent type of phraseology.
*  Okay.
*  Who do you think will win that match?
*  I think it's 55, 45, but I don't know.
*  So it's close.
*  It's very close.
*  Okay.
*  You can make both cases.
*  You could say Ding, uh, you could say Jan has been here before you can say to
*  the world championship stage, he knows what it's like to have a training camp.
*  And so on and so forth.
*  His playing style is very, but you can also say Ding Liran is one of the most
*  stable, unemotional chess players.
*  And Ding oftentimes goes from down to up.
*  So in the candidates, he lost to Jan in the very first game, 14 round
*  tournament, he got demolished in the first game.
*  I'm sure he was suffering from jet lag, the flight.
*  He came to Spain like two days before the games began, which was crazy to me.
*  And, uh, he got second place by the end.
*  His chances of finishing in the top two were like 2% after that first round
*  game, people wrote him off completely.
*  So he doesn't go from top down.
*  He goes the opposite way.
*  And if he loses, he might come back.
*  But the truth is, I don't know.
*  The truth is it's, it's going to be an interesting match.
*  And it's also disappointing.
*  We're not going to get Magnus in it.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think about him stepping away from the world championship?
*  Are you a romantic about the world championships?
*  No, I'm not a romantic about anything.
*  I don't think I, I can't imagine what that went dark quickly.
*  I don't think I'm sophisticated enough to be a romantic.
*  I think I, uh, you know, I, I, I taught chess and now I make YouTube videos.
*  I I'm not qualified on the subject of romanticism, but I, you
*  don't think it's a beautiful game.
*  Chess?
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think, I think it is a beautiful thing.
*  There you go.
*  I got you.
*  Yeah.
*  Does that, is that considered being a romantic?
*  Yeah.
*  I was seeing the beauty in the, you can be like Bach and seeing the math in the
*  music, or you can see the beauty, the magic.
*  I think I see beauty in certain types of chess for sure.
*  Not in all chess.
*  So I'll partially romantic.
*  Part-time romantic.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So what, I mean, what, what do you feel about Magnus stepping away from the
*  world championships?
*  Disappointing, but understandable.
*  Can you still man his case?
*  What's, what's, what's understandable about it to you?
*  I don't think it's as prestigious as it could be.
*  I don't think the world championship.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Why does Magnus still sign everything as world champion?
*  Then that's a good point that he did just put out a statement and he did.
*  But he does it everywhere else too.
*  Does he really?
*  Yeah.
*  Like world champion, right?
*  World champion, world champion, world chess champion.
*  Maybe it's just because he, he, he wanted, but he thinks that the journey to the top
*  once again, to maintain the status quo has lost its appeal.
*  You know what the example that I like to, I like to make, I, I'm a big fan of UFC.
*  So we've never really seen with the exception of George St.
*  Pierre walking and Khabib, but Khabib was kind of a different story walking away
*  from a belt at the absolute zenith of their career.
*  But also in the UFC champions are extremely well taken care of.
*  I mean, champions have some of the best, some of the best lives.
*  Of course you can argue not all champions.
*  You can say some of the lower weight divisions.
*  Yes.
*  But what I'm saying is a lot of them get all the sponsors.
*  They get massive, massive paydays.
*  They're international celebrities.
*  I don't think chess has that.
*  In fact, the world championship of chess price fund has not changed much in like 40 years.
*  So you could probably make more money on, on YouTube.
*  Yes.
*  Playing randos, not randos, but other having fun and playing challenging, really
*  challenging games, playing other super grand masters, like an ad hoc events, or
*  maybe a little bit of organized events, but not the world championship and still,
*  and still have a lot of fun, make a lot of money, get everybody excited, all that
*  kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  So for Magnus specifically, and we're using him because he's the world champion.
*  If you tally, if he wins every tournament that he plays in over the course of a year,
*  which is really not even that crazy of an estimate, cause that's really how it
*  seems sometimes, I don't know how much money that is.
*  I haven't tallied, but if he dedicated an entire year to being managed on social
*  media and doing various things and growing all his brands and getting sponsored
*  deals, I think you would make five times more than being the world champion, which
*  is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  But money isn't everything.
*  I know that's, that's totally fair.
*  People dedicate their whole life to winning the Olympics.
*  The Olympics is a funny, is an interesting one too, because like, I didn't even watch
*  the Olympics as carefully as I usually do this year.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Neither.
*  It's, it's really strange.
*  I'm not sure why that is.
*  And during COVID, I'm not sure.
*  That's, that was weird.
*  I don't know if it's losing its magic.
*  Part of it is also the people that own the Olympics and the way they distribute it.
*  They make it a little bit more difficult to watch.
*  Like it's, it should, in my opinion, it should all be just available on YouTube
*  and, uh, easily accessible.
*  It's like the difference between like, uh, SpaceX and, and, uh, some other
*  organ, like even NASA, just SpaceX is better at streaming their launches and,
*  and commentating them.
*  And they've made NASA better as well, but just like the ability, it sounds
*  ridiculous, but making it more frictionless for people to watch, get excited,
*  to share all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm not exactly sure where the magic like balances between the, the
*  classy traditional world championships and the kind of dramatic, exciting streamer
*  world.
*  And it feels like for, for the world championships to be relevant, they have
*  to find that balance.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this recent one had, I was, it's pretty good commentating.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm not, I'm not even necessarily talking about myself.
*  There was a lot of, that was the worst part for me.
*  No, it was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I appreciate that.
*  It was a lot of, uh, I was a big arms race.
*  So every major chess platform tried to get one super grand master,
*  Vishwanathan, Anand, Fabiano Caruana, you name it.
*  They were, they were basically involved.
*  And to, to go back to that point, yeah, I, the big question is money.
*  And if, if Magnus is not motivated by money, if the prize fund for the next
*  world championship was $10 million, would he play it?
*  If he says no, then it must be something else.
*  It must just be a matter of something's not worth it.
*  It's not worth it.
*  You got to take him at his word and his word is like, there's too much stress
*  to the low sample play.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I want to play many more times.
*  Yeah.
*  He wants to play more.
*  He wants to make it more interesting.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  More shorter games, like where you can, um, increase the possibility of pure
*  chess, whatever the heck that means.
*  Well, we can't go back to the first carp of Kasparov match, which they
*  have to stop due to health concerns.
*  I mean, the guy went down five nil and it was first to six wins and draws didn't
*  count, so draws didn't amass to the total score.
*  There was no best of system.
*  So what happened there?
*  The match went something like seven, eight months, Kasparov started making
*  a comeback after being down five, nothing.
*  He was five, three, and they called it off.
*  They called it off.
*  They said both players are in poor health conditions because far of stormed
*  down, yelled that this is a farce.
*  And, but the match was 50 games long.
*  It would even more maybe I made a video and I don't even remember how
*  many games it was.
*  It was so long.
*  Can you imagine Bobby Fisher wanted something almost as extreme draws don't
*  count its first one to 10 wins.
*  And if it's nine, nine, the world champion retains his title.
*  So you have to beat the world champion 10, eight.
*  That's the only way.
*  Do you don't like that?
*  What's, I, it's just grueling.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe I like it for the YouTube recaps, but do I like it for the players?
*  And do I like it for general public?
*  No, it's three, four hours, right?
*  You imagine your favorite tennis match was six months long.
*  What are we doing?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's still a magic to the world championship.
*  I wish they could make it some interesting.
*  They make it work somehow, but I think Magnus is really challenging feed
*  day and everybody else to step up and try to figure that out, which is great.
*  Ultimately.
*  Um, who would you say is the greatest of all time?
*  Can you, can you make the case?
*  You mentioned Kasparov can make the case for Kasparov.
*  Can you make the case for Magnus Carlson?
*  Uh, Bobby Fisher, tall.
*  In my opinion, you can make a case for Magnus, Gary, and Bobby Fisher.
*  I'm not one of the folks that's like, Oh, I mean, cup of Blanca was brilliant.
*  You can argue Steinitz was brilliant, but as, uh, I think, I think it was, it's
*  probably Kasparov and Magnus has a chance to overtake it.
*  So the longevity is really important to you when you were thinking about this.
*  Yes, I think so.
*  I think Magnus is very, very close.
*  It's extremely close.
*  What would be the magic?
*  You got to get that sixth one.
*  Also, the world championships matter.
*  It's kind of like basketball, right?
*  Rings.
*  It's all, it all comes down to how many rings did this person win?
*  What about, well, basketball doesn't have this, the number of years at number one.
*  Right.
*  Like, uh, rating, sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, like there's a, there is a, which is what Magnus really likes is like, there
*  is a nice system of rating of who isn't ranked number one and it has to do not
*  with some championships or low sampled tournaments has to do with general game
*  after game after game helps estimate more accurately the ELO rating.
*  So,
*  yeah, he's been world number one for, I think, 11 years, right.
*  She's still less than,
*  it was world number one for 20 years.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is, which is quite wild,
*  but still lower rating.
*  I think that Magnus now, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I think rating in general has sort of.
*  Allegedly it got inflated.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that true?
*  Is there truth to that?
*  I think so.
*  I don't, I can't speak to how exactly it happened, but it also happens online.
*  If you go back just three or four years, I think some of the best blitz players on
*  those shows that com were 27, 2800 and now they're 3,200.
*  I think it's just sort of what happens, but I, I don't exactly know.
*  Uh, I will mention that there was a very strange change.
*  Not exactly sure when the year was in FIDE.
*  So over the board chess, where if you were.
*  Under the age of 16 or 18 years old, one of those two, and you were below 2300.
*  Okay.
*  Your rating change factor was three to four times higher.
*  So just imagine what that means.
*  Magnus has a rating change factor of, of let's say one.
*  I have a rating change factor also of one, anybody over the rating 2,400
*  has the same rating change factor.
*  What is the rating change factor?
*  So if you win.
*  Yeah, there's a formula and basically let's say at the very base level, five
*  point change, if your rating change factor is one, you beat somebody, you gain five
*  points.
*  Those kids who were under 18 and under 2300, they were, they were, they were
*  under the rating change factor was four.
*  So their ratings were going out four times higher and four times like up and
*  down compared to normal folks.
*  And there was a, there was one teenager in the U S in particular, who in one
*  month played a bunch of tournaments with his rating change factor and became
*  nearly rated 2,640, which is top 50 in the world.
*  He was just a random teenager from the United States.
*  He became a grandmaster ultimately, but he bled like 90 points down because his
*  rating was so inflated and this K 40 exists now.
*  I mean, you have many kids who out of nowhere, 2,100, 2,100, 2,400 after, you
*  know, one good month.
*  It's like, what?
*  So that's interesting.
*  That's like a similar to like how Tik TOK inflates your virality early on.
*  Does it?
*  Well, yeah, like I, I, I, I, well, at least the rumor is like, they want you to get
*  engaged and I thought there was even artificial likes and so on that they
*  want you to get that dopamine addiction.
*  So maybe they want to throw you, if you're really passionate about chess, they
*  want you to throw you to the sharks by artificially inflating you and flaying
*  your rating and maybe that gets you into the game much more intensely.
*  Maybe.
*  I wonder how many like backdoor feed a meetings there are with cigars.
*  And so that, that was a, the factors determined by who, who does the, the
*  the ELO rating who changes this stuff?
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows it's probably those Lee chess anarchists.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I think they want to, I think they want to, they want to stay away from that stuff.
*  But so there's a guy named Hans Nieman.
*  Yep.
*  And, uh, he beat Magnus Carlsen recently.
*  Yeah.
*  Has been already.
*  What is, was it August?
*  September 4th.
*  Oh, it was September.
*  So he beat him twice, right?
*  Recently.
*  Once is the allegations the, by the internet that Hans Nieman cheated.
*  And then the second time, uh, Magnus played a few moves and forfeited and resigned.
*  There's actually, so there's three.
*  Okay.
*  Sorry.
*  Can you?
*  No, no, no.
*  Yeah.
*  Can we go through the, yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  So they play a live e-sports event in Miami, Miami beach.
*  Yes.
*  Eden rock.
*  That's where I actually interviewed Magnus.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where that was.
*  Oh, by weird circumstance, I found myself in Miami unrelated to chess event.
*  And, uh, yeah, it was a very dramatic event for me for various reasons.
*  One of which the camera stopped working halfway through the conversation.
*  I saw that.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw that.
*  I also side note, I really respect how you write comments, pin them at the top.
*  You had timestamps.
*  You're like very true professional.
*  I am the complete opposite on YouTube when I'm off the camera.
*  So I dig in the mud.
*  What does that mean?
*  Dig in the mud.
*  From when I started on YouTube in 2020, I, in June, like May, June, 2020, I had no
*  subscribers, so I got to a million in a year.
*  I had a lot of people analyzing my every move, all of my small flaws.
*  And I, I love getting hate comments.
*  Because you pin, you pin, is it the comment of shame or?
*  That's what it was.
*  It's been named over the years by, by folks.
*  I never called it that, but yeah, it's, it's, it's pinning.
*  Pin of shame.
*  And it's been tough because now people pretend to write hate comments just to
*  get attention.
*  So like anything, the public ruined the good thing.
*  But it started that way.
*  It started with people just shredding me to bits, calling me, spin-offs of this
*  and that, and I think I'm, I'm a human more than I am a creator and influencer
*  and attention seeker.
*  Like I'm just a person.
*  So to me, even at the size of 1.6 million subscribers now, September, 2022, I
*  don't understand that I've gotten big and that I shouldn't do this stuff and that
*  I should be beyond it, or I shouldn't be checking my social media as much as I
*  do and interacting one-on-one.
*  I'm still very much a human being.
*  And my guilty pleasure, the way of killing time, if I'm not laying on the
*  couch and playing some chess blitz games off stream is I just interact with people
*  who say nice things and who say horrible things.
*  And I really like to get into the head of the people who say the terrible things.
*  Sometimes you can, sometimes they are truly trolls, but sometimes people just,
*  they just, they just really hate you.
*  So what's the successful, what's the successful interaction with the person
*  that's trolling you?
*  What's like at the end of that hero journey that you were partaking in, what's,
*  what's like, what's the top of the mountain look like?
*  Is the troll conquered and broken mentally?
*  Not, no, not mentally.
*  I don't want to, I don't want to defeat.
*  I honestly, sometimes somebody writes a very long comment.
*  I'll just, I'll respond with a question mark.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so you're, you're, you see each other as like a, like a brother and sister.
*  You're going to travel together on this journey of deep meaning, like
*  introspection of what does this mean?
*  Yeah.
*  I've had people write, I can't quote now, but something about my persona, my
*  behavior, this and that.
*  And I just like respond to them and I say, Hey, it sounds crazy that a large
*  creator might do something like this, but this kind of goes back to you speak to
*  folks on a very respectful way.
*  If you make a mistake, you completely own up to it.
*  So I have this sometimes these one-on-one interactions where I say, I think you're
*  reading too much into this.
*  I think you're kind of, you don't understand maybe some of my humor or
*  sarcasm as such, so you form this opinion that I'm this kind of a person, this and
*  that.
*  And now you're sort of anything I do, you're trying to attach to that reasoning.
*  And here you are writing this lengthy essay of why nobody should watch my
*  content.
*  And sometimes people go, you know what?
*  I think you have a point.
*  Maybe I should relax a little bit.
*  Yeah, I would love, I would love to sort of interview and understand the lives of
*  the folks that post that kind of stuff.
*  I mean, they're, they're human beings.
*  They have interesting journeys also.
*  I think they often don't realize, I think they don't realize their comment will be
*  read by anybody, especially you.
*  Maybe they think like, and they also don't realize you're a human being.
*  I feel like that's, it's so interesting to watch it.
*  Like some guy, cause I posted on Twitter for like a minute that I'm talking to
*  you and asking for questions.
*  I deleted that tweet because 95% of the people were talk about cheating, talk
*  about the cheating.
*  All right.
*  I got it.
*  Thank you.
*  This is not going to be helpful at all.
*  So I was like, all right.
*  But in that time, like there's one comment, which I'm, it's hilarious to me that
*  you found that one comment.
*  The one comment says like, this seems like a waste of time or something like
*  white, lame guest, lame guest, lame guest, and then used, uh, like responded
*  something like with a question mark.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I wrote, why am I a lame guest?
*  Why am I made a sad face?
*  Let's talk about this.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, why am I a lame guest?
*  And he responded.
*  He responded even after you deleted the tweet.
*  What did he say?
*  He said, he doesn't know what value I would bring because I just
*  make videos about chess games.
*  And that's true.
*  You've had some absolutely brilliant people on, but I also looked at this
*  gentleman's profile and he, his, he was one of the folks that put things about
*  his family and God and his politics in his Twitter bio.
*  And I started thinking, maybe I said something in some video and I made a
*  joke about religion or something, just some offhand five second thing somewhere
*  that someone turns me into just an absolute outcast in the household.
*  They can no longer watch me.
*  And that has happened.
*  Yeah.
*  That has happened.
*  I'll record a 30 minute video and I'll make a joke about something and some
*  phrasing and that's it.
*  I've lost the viewer forever and they will let me know.
*  They will write me an email and I just don't think people should be that serious.
*  Yeah.
*  There's some of that because I'll, I've seen people say that sometimes about me,
*  but I see it more with others.
*  They'll say, uh, you know, I used to be like Joe Rogan guesses.
*  Uh, I used to be a huge fan of Joe Rogan until he said this, right?
*  It's like one, um, first I do wonder if you were ever really a big fan.
*  That's, that's one question mark I have, but the other is like, I think when you
*  should be more lenient with each other in terms of how much stupid shit we say.
*  And, and, you know, if you actually, I wish people were able to sort of
*  introspect on their own, on the own, on the stupid shit they say themselves,
*  like to have a little bit of empathy.
*  Like I wish there was a way to read all the emails you've ever written and just
*  see, or maybe do a search engine for all the stupid shit you've said in emails in
*  the past and like summarize it and to reveal it to yourself that like you have
*  bad days, you have good days, you have emotional days, uh, you have stoic days,
*  you have sometimes you have like, uh, you take very different political views and
*  you do another day.
*  And it's like, it's all over the place.
*  And if you're a creator, if you're putting stuff out all the time, you're
*  going to have those and you're, you're still, you're still a full, like complex
*  bag of emotions and thoughts and ideas and contradictions and all of that.
*  Like you shouldn't judge a person by a single statement.
*  And even when you do, you should try to infer the best possible
*  interpretation of that statement.
*  I feel like that that's just a healthier way to interact with the
*  world and with other humans.
*  It's like, I wonder what's the best possible interpretation of the thing
*  they just tweeted or they said, like what, let's, let's imagine that the person
*  saying those words is actually a really good human being.
*  And what did they mean when they said that thing about anal beads?
*  So good for so long.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Uh, or whatever it is, like, you know, they didn't mean to be offensive.
*  To the sexuality of a certain group.
*  They're just talking about, they're talking shit about anal beads.
*  Like they're not, uh, like sometimes it's humor.
*  Sometimes it's actually genuinely, uh, embodying like a political viewpoint and
*  like walking with it, thinking through it for a few days, like, like taking it
*  seriously, empathizing, not just for a brief moment, but for a time, like
*  walking with an idea and allowing yourself to express it, like playing
*  devil's advocate.
*  I do that all the time.
*  With yourself or with myself.
*  Yeah.
*  In conversation I do too.
*  And I find I have to say, I'm playing devil's advocate.
*  Like you have to be very explicit, but with myself, I'll just do it in my head.
*  Like I have different voices, like, you know, uh, obviously it just in, I've
*  been getting so much information, so many thoughts in all the complexities of the
*  war in Ukraine, for example, and all the different voices within Ukraine.
*  I just interviewed hundreds of people and they have very different perspectives
*  in nuanced ways about the war.
*  Uh, some are full of hate.
*  Some are full of love, like hate for the other love for their own country, love
*  for family and tradition, all of it.
*  That's a beautiful mix.
*  I have to walk, I have to like carry those ideas in my head and empathize with
*  them deeply.
*  And then I have to listen to people that live elsewhere that live in India.
*  They have a very different perspective.
*  There's a lot of people in India that have a very different perspective.
*  The people in Ukraine.
*  So I don't know.
*  And some of that will bleed out into the thoughts I express publicly.
*  And, um, like when people judge you harshly for it, it, it, first of all, me
*  as a human being is psychologically difficult.
*  Uh, but also it makes me less willing to be fragile.
*  I still try to be strong enough to be fragile in front of the camera.
*  Just say, like say things that are on my mind, even if I know it's going to create,
*  uh, people that are going to be like ruthlessly negative towards me.
*  So I tried to wear my heart in my sleeve and still try to be fragile, but it's
*  harder.
*  You're going to pay a psychological cost.
*  Like, like, um, you know, in some sense I try to be tough, but like I can be a
*  softie in that, in like certain, certain like attacks can get to me.
*  So I'm surprised that they don't get, I mean, do, do, does the, some negativity
*  get to you or is this the way you deal with it by responding?
*  Uh, like that's that guy saying, like, what value does talking to add to the world?
*  Yeah, no, but that was, I mean, that was so good.
*  I was looking at, I was thinking at various moments, you went to jump in and
*  I was, I was kind of letting, letting you speak.
*  One of the things I wanted to mention was it's significantly simpler to talk about
*  chess than it is to talk about some of the things you talk about.
*  And you have a big responsibility because you have to absorb information like a
*  sponge, but you also then need to present it in a way where you potentially have an
*  opinion while trying to be fair to everybody.
*  And you're talking about things that will literally never please everybody.
*  Just literally, what else are you going to talk about?
*  Some issues that are going to get out there into the, into the, people are going
*  to watch it, the eyes, right?
*  The years of millions of people and not everybody is going to be satisfied.
*  And these are issues where people are going to be much more likely to speak up in all
*  sorts of ways, like tremendous support or tremendous hatred, vitriol, and God knows
*  what else. Yeah.
*  You, you, it's one of the reasons I'm, I'm blown away to even be sitting here, frankly,
*  because up until a few months ago, you weren't talking to, you know, you, I'm not saying
*  you weren't talking to, but you hadn't spoken to chess players.
*  You were speaking to people who are doing much more substantial things in the world.
*  I appreciate the humility there.
*  No, just to me is an incredible, it's a beautiful game, but I think the reason comments
*  hurt is not, I mean, they hurt no matter what to me, like not to me, because I'm in a
*  simpler space.
*  That's what you have to understand.
*  I, I, so if it's chess based criticism, it doesn't hit as hard.
*  No, if you had a podcast about anal piece, no, I'm just, I'm launching.
*  If you had a podcast about photography, you got to, you got to realize like it wouldn't,
*  it wouldn't be the same way you talk about potentially existential things.
*  You talk about cyber, you know, things, things in cybersecurity or, or AI or people who
*  are massive heads of companies that are just inherently going to be a bit more controversial.
*  So that I can't imagine being in your shoes because you have so many complex emotions
*  about situations where you may not necessarily agree with everything that someone has said
*  publicly, but you still invite them for a conversation because they're a human being.
*  It's totally different.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  I, not the way I experienced it to me.
*  I think what hurts is it's not even online because I'm super self-critical, usually way
*  more than the internet can be.
*  It's that like human beings can be cruel to each other.
*  So like the reason it hurts for some reason, it's like this almost like disappointment
*  in people.
*  They don't give each other a chance.
*  So in that sense, the negativity doesn't have to be about Ukraine or geopolitics.
*  It could be about the silliest of things.
*  I said, and like to me it's like, why, why be mean to each other in a context where the
*  mean doesn't like it's out of place?
*  Cause I, for example, there is like a gaming culture where they just talk shit to each
*  other and I'll stop.
*  I think it's more acceptable there.
*  It seems to fit.
*  It seems to be funnier there.
*  And like when streamers talk shit to each other, I've been listening to several
*  streamers recently and it's like, it somehow works a little better.
*  Even if they're just like cruel to each other, it makes more sense.
*  But I think when people are genuinely trying to educate or to help and so on, and you
*  still get the shitty comments, I don't know.
*  It makes me sad.
*  No, it doesn't, it doesn't make me, it doesn't make me sad.
*  I think part of that is also the way I was brought up.
*  So I was, I skipped kindergarten.
*  So I was always the smallest kid and you're picked on.
*  I was picked on and then I did picking.
*  So I had kind of both in my life.
*  I kind of know I went home from summer camp crying and I also made a kid cry once in
*  fourth grade.
*  So I had the balance and I-
*  Physical or mental abuse?
*  Or both?
*  Verbal.
*  Verbal.
*  No, I didn't beat anybody up.
*  I was tiny.
*  I think the kid in the younger grade was bigger than I was.
*  And you still broke him.
*  Because I was, ah, I was-
*  Well done.
*  Yeah.
*  So I had to use my-
*  Mental warfare.
*  I had to use my words.
*  I had to be, and growing up, my parents split when I was super young and I played
*  chess.
*  So all things that make you super self trustworthy.
*  Like you believe your first instinct.
*  You don't listen to what other people tell you.
*  And if people give you advice, say, okay, I'm going to think about that.
*  I'm not going to go and do that.
*  I wasn't impressionable.
*  You couldn't convince me to do something.
*  That stuck to this day.
*  My wife has had to deconstruct some of my stubbornness.
*  I didn't even realize was incredible stubbornness.
*  It's just something that you brought up with.
*  So to me, that stuff doesn't bother me.
*  And it's-
*  So the voices of others don't shake you quite.
*  They can't mentally shake your psychological stability.
*  No, they haven't.
*  I think when it got, probably at its worst point was in combination with being unable
*  to perform well in over the board play.
*  But that was also self driven.
*  I wasn't performing poorly because I was getting comments, but because I was performing
*  poorly, the comments got to me more.
*  The cycle was sort of in the opposite direction.
*  And that was probably the most frustrating.
*  People have said some vile things to me, you know, about my whole Indonesia thing.
*  Ooh, this is good.
*  This is going to give the anarchist and Lee Chess some humor.
*  Let's go to what's the Indonesia thing.
*  The way you said it, okay, maybe we don't want to talk about it.
*  No, no, it's totally fine.
*  I-
*  Who did you kill?
*  I was going to say I wish, but I'm not even sure I can make a joke like that.
*  I-
*  So the Indonesia thing was I was streaming Chess on chess.com, I might add.
*  And I got booted up a 10 minute game.
*  Just a random account from Indonesia.
*  That was the flag.
*  Now, mind you on these websites, you can pick your flag.
*  It can be from wherever, you don't- it's not geo tracing, you can change it.
*  I was like, okay, account from Indonesia.
*  And as always, I looked at the account because it was an untitled high rated account.
*  And I looked through the games.
*  Win rate was suspiciously high.
*  Average accuracy was suspiciously high.
*  I was like, okay, I think this is a cheater.
*  I said it out loud.
*  It's not the first time I've played cheaters on stream.
*  And I said, okay, I'm still going to play.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  The game was not crazy suspicious, but definitely suspicious.
*  A few critical moments where I just clearly thought I had a good position.
*  And then the person or the bot played some move that just killed my hopes and I lost.
*  So I'm like, okay, I lost.
*  And I wrote to the chess.com fair play team.
*  Like behind the scenes, I wasn't even saying anything publicly on
*  stream and the guy got banned.
*  It was cheater.
*  So that night, right before I'm going to sleep.
*  Cause Indonesia is 12 hours ahead of New York.
*  I'll go on my Twitter.
*  The hell is going on?
*  I see hundreds of responses to my recent tweets.
*  Levy, you got to check Facebook, man.
*  You got to check Facebook.
*  Like you got, here's a link.
*  So allegedly that account belonged to an older gentleman and his son made a
*  Facebook post that said, my dad played a big streamer in chess, Gotham chess.
*  And Gotham got mad.
*  He lost to my dad.
*  So his community mass reported my dad and he was banned for cheating.
*  Oh, it went viral.
*  Oh no.
*  Did you know that Indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world?
*  I didn't know.
*  I learned it the hard way.
*  Interesting tens of thousands of DMS every second Instagram DMS.
*  Cause I had my DMS open.
*  I was never afraid of that stuff.
*  Uh, my YouTube videos went from 99% of, uh, of vote down vote to 50, 50, 50.
*  Oh, they swarmed my account.
*  All negative.
*  Oh, all play him again.
*  You, I mean, I don't know how much swearing there is on this podcast, but I mean,
*  it was just all sorts of all the fucking swearing.
*  You are, uh, they just everything ruthless.
*  The vicious, they were going to kill me.
*  They were going to rape my family.
*  They were going to, they were contacting people I followed on Instagram.
*  They were contacting them and telling them crazy things.
*  It was, I'm not joking.
*  It was tens of thousands of people every minute.
*  It was unbelievable.
*  And I didn't know what to do because the guy cheated.
*  I was in the right.
*  Yeah.
*  How certain were you that he cheated?
*  100%.
*  Okay.
*  100%.
*  I'm okay.
*  I don't know if you can say a hundred percent, but
*  suggest.com had also had a suspicion.
*  They have like good, they have the good detection.
*  Yes.
*  Danny wrench would be able to, I legitimately know nothing about the behind
*  the scenes because it's only kind of tech people.
*  But, uh, what, one thing I did not realize was that this account, whether it was the
*  sun playing or the father playing, we will not know.
*  We don't know who played.
*  It could have been the son.
*  It could have been the dad covering for him, whatever.
*  But at some point that account won 27 games in a row at 95% accuracy.
*  I mean, even Magnus can't do that.
*  Even, you know, uh, this took a month.
*  This story took one month from start to finish.
*  First, I had to work with a, like a media company to geo block my
*  content in Indonesia on YouTube.
*  So Indonesians could not see my channel.
*  Oh, so you, you didn't want to like lean into it.
*  Go full Donald Trump.
*  No, no.
*  Let's let's, uh, cause you're in the right.
*  You feel like you're in the right.
*  You, as far as you know, you're in the right.
*  Yeah.
*  And I hated watching all my work burn to the ground.
*  Like, oh, you felt it was being.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm one thing I'm learning about myself is I'm not a good crisis actor.
*  I need someone to like slap me so I don't do something emotional in the
*  moment when crisis is ongoing.
*  What would be the emotional act that's not productive there?
*  Partnering with an MCN that makes you give away a bunch of your revenue.
*  And then when you break with them, I wasn't monetized for a week.
*  It was a very big decision to plug in.
*  I think they're called MCNs, but what are they?
*  Sorry.
*  I don't, they're like, we there's there's specialized agencies that work behind
*  the scenes with YouTube that if you connect your account, they say they can
*  give you certain ad benefits.
*  They can geo block your content.
*  They, which you can't do normally.
*  They have certain perks that only YouTube allows behind the scenes.
*  You pay them 10% of your monthly ad revenue, but they claim to do a
*  handful of things for you.
*  I just needed them to geo block my content.
*  I just, I just didn't, I didn't care how much money I was going to give away per
*  month, but why geo block it?
*  You just didn't like the, the downloading.
*  Yeah, I didn't want you want a positivity more like you're being educational.
*  You're, I mean, they're like, you do a bit of shit talking, but it's more
*  like fun and easy going.
*  You didn't want this kind of viciousness.
*  Yeah, my comment section was just being completely flooded.
*  Like they were destroying my channel.
*  And to be honest, maybe all of the views and the downvotes out of would have
*  actually been beneficial.
*  Maybe it meant my videos would have actually started getting
*  recommended to more people.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm a person.
*  This is, it all goes back to the same thing.
*  Oh, so this got to you.
*  Yeah, this was like, I was just watching it and I'm like, this is not fair.
*  This is, I don't, I don't know what to do.
*  So I'm going to stop this as much as I can.
*  They still got through their VPN.
*  And they were like, you asshole, you don't think we have VPN in Indonesia.
*  It was this whole, you know, it was this whole thing.
*  This father and son got invited to every major news network.
*  I'm not joking.
*  They got invited to the major podcast.
*  They like to say the Joe Rogan of Indonesia.
*  Yeah.
*  Daddy Corbusier is this mentalist.
*  He's a bald guy, very fun guy.
*  He had them.
*  And that's when the Indonesian chess federation stepped in.
*  The thing is nobody who was harassing me knows anything about chess.
*  They just saw the story and long story short, they brought in a sponsor.
*  The guy played a strong, one of the strongest chess players in the country, who
*  also happens to be a woman, Irene Sukandar.
*  She's like 24 hundred international master.
*  She crushed him because his actual playing strength is 1300, 1400, you, something like that.
*  He still got paid because there was a winning prize, prize fund, a losing prize
*  fund, and we never heard from him again.
*  And that was the whole story.
*  So that was, that was why I had to shut down all of my social media to DMs and
*  DM requests and even notifications.
*  Like I don't get notifications unless it's someone I follow.
*  But see stuff like that doesn't often get resolved in this kind of clear way.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  Could have been.
*  So you got lucky there that there's a conclusion to this.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody got views, somebody got money.
*  Uh, and I never got, I never got many apologies.
*  What did you learn from that experience about yourself, about, about the internet?
*  I think first and foremost, I learned that every moment you are live or
*  broadcasting can be completely blown out of proportion.
*  You have to be real careful.
*  And I can't actively think about that.
*  Unfortunately, even when I'm streaming, I've had other instances where things
*  come back to bite.
*  I've even had these moments live on stream.
*  I feel like I said something too sarcastically to somebody and I don't know
*  how their day is going in my room and their whole day, you know, God knows what.
*  You have these moments of regret where you want your personality to shine through
*  and you want to entertain.
*  They start thinking at what cost.
*  If I make a joke to a, to a viewer that suddenly the whole chat is laughing at
*  them, what if that puts them in a deep, dark place?
*  And again, it's all, it all comes back to this one-on-one thing for me, because
*  I'm a human.
*  I would hate to put another person into that situation if I would much rather get
*  a drink with somebody than, but it's all kind of part of this act and you want to
*  make jokes.
*  And I also learned I'm a horrible crisis actor, so I have no patience, but I think
*  that's normal in 2022.
*  Everything is immediate.
*  We can barely sit, think, let time go by.
*  It makes me sad because I think that kind of stuff can destroy good people.
*  That's what makes you sad.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, one of the things we discussed just here before recording, which I'm also,
*  I've talked about this on stream.
*  I'm very open with this type of stuff is over the, I think for me, a lot of that
*  comes down to just a lack of control of the, of the narrative.
*  That's that phrase is kind of messy.
*  It can be used for political stuff, but I, I, I hate when I say things and they
*  get completely misconstrued or they are completely misinterpreted.
*  And I can't imagine being in your shoes because again, I do chess.
*  You cannot really, you can clip me saying something about a chess game out
*  of context and it's hilarious.
*  You know, it's, it's dumb.
*  It's, it's nothing.
*  It's not an attack on, on, on me or, or, or something that I said.
*  It's not an attack on kind of more, more similarly to, to what you were describing.
*  Uh, you don't say, you don't say stuff like that, like ridiculous.
*  You don't say ridiculous shit about yourself.
*  Oh, I do.
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  And you don't feel like that could be made.
*  Isn't this the same guy that said X?
*  Maybe, maybe, maybe I, I either haven't said enough of those things or there's
*  no moments in, I don't have three, four hour open conversations with other humans.
*  And I'm pretty sure if I did, there would be more of that, that stuff out there.
*  But, uh, it's probably what it is.
*  It's just a lack of, it's a lack of being able to kind of control what is actually
*  reality and that, that is very frustrating.
*  And, uh, yeah, you're right.
*  I mean, there is a sense that there's not enough motivation for people to attack you.
*  You're ultimately adding a lot of positive stuff to the world.
*  And when you get into more political topics, there's people that who are hurting,
*  who have a lot of anger in their hearts and they want to direct it towards you.
*  So then they need ammunition and ammunition comes in the way of like clips from the past.
*  So I'm sure that you, I'm pretty sure you already have clips like that.
*  It's just, there's not people that really have anger to direct towards you.
*  Ultimately, you're adding a lot of good stuff to the world.
*  And so, yeah, but it's man, the, the viciousness of human beings under the veil
*  of anonymity at scale can be really painful.
*  So that, that's, I guess that's the curse, the challenge of being a creator, um, on
*  YouTube and so on, on Twitch.
*  Um, when you talked about retiring, you, I think you tweeted about retiring from chess.
*  I mean, a video, yeah, I tweeted, um, it's my value to the world.
*  The tweet or the video, the both.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I'm retiring from all competitive chess events.
*  My preparation is outmatched.
*  My calculation skills are too flawed.
*  And most importantly, my anxiety is beyond repair.
*  I physically and emotionally cannot do it anymore.
*  What was the hardest thing?
*  What was the hardest thing about competing?
*  Like, can you, can you elaborate on that?
*  Yeah, I think it's separated into phases of my life.
*  So after being a creator and coming back and playing over the board and making
*  recaps of all my games, I think the constant feeling that I had at the board was a kid
*  who hadn't studied enough for a test, which is a very unique type of anxiety.
*  And during the game, it was just self-hatred.
*  Like good moves did not feel as good as how bad, bad moves felt and bad moments.
*  And in the underneath that you're saying there was a sense that I did not
*  prepare well enough, always?
*  One unquestionably.
*  So my, I'm an international master, but there is international masters now who are 11.
*  I got the title when I was 22, which is late.
*  That might not sound like it's late, but it's really late.
*  And I quit chess multiple times when I was a teenager.
*  If I hadn't, if one of my parents was like, sit down, this is the only
*  thing that you're good at.
*  Focus on it.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe I would have been a grand master, but that's, that's life.
*  Right.
*  And I would come back to chess at various points in my life when I felt more mature,
*  I felt more ready and I felt more motivated.
*  It was all me.
*  I never, I had one coach when I was maybe about 10, I never listened to the guy.
*  Great guy.
*  Like he emailed me even recently, just wanting to catch up, which I thought was
*  adorable because I'm like, I don't even know if he knows that YouTube chess exists.
*  He's in his seventies.
*  He's just, he's just like a nice older guy.
*  Yeah.
*  And he would come to my house.
*  We would have dinner and my grandma would make us food and he would tell her
*  that I'm brilliant, but I never work.
*  And I have so much potential.
*  If only I ever worked at all one minute on anything.
*  I just played speed games online and, and I, did he speak the truth there?
*  Like, could you have worked more?
*  I could have worked more for sure.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  When you listen to Magnus who doesn't, he seems like he doesn't work either.
*  He works.
*  Uh, he might work in different ways, but I think for him, it's also, uh,
*  obsession again, love it's, it's everything.
*  It's he might read a book.
*  He doesn't consider it work.
*  It's work.
*  He's getting information in and he's learning something.
*  It might just be easier for him to learn than for me, for example, or for anybody.
*  It just, everybody learns and absorbs things differently.
*  So I would come back to chess and the best run of my life that I had was in 2016
*  where I basically, while teaching a chess program, scholastic chess program,
*  I told all the parents, Hey, so for these four months, I want to stop doing private
*  lessons and I'm going to go travel and play tournaments because I want to become
*  an international master.
*  Finally, I'm 20 years old.
*  This is in 2016.
*  Like, can, can you help me raise some money?
*  These are all managing directors.
*  These are lawyers.
*  These are seven figure, eight figure households and they contributed.
*  And I kept the blog and then I worked just six hours, seven hours every day,
*  like studying all the opening trends, all of the new ideas, reading the books,
*  analyzing my own games, playing my own speed games and analyzing them,
*  training every day.
*  And that year I went from 2240 over the board to 2404 with two of the three
*  norms, as they call them, which are basically tournament performances.
*  Like you perform at a certain level, not too complicated.
*  So I got almost everything I needed to be an I am, but I just slipped up at the
*  very end and 2017 I didn't play chess, but in 2018 I came back once again with a
*  vengeance.
*  I started playing in the summer once again and I went up, up, up to my peak.
*  But then something interesting happened.
*  My life mission was accomplished.
*  I never wanted or thought I could be a grand master.
*  I wanted to be an international master.
*  And the adrenaline dump of hitting the I am title, I just stopped working
*  completely.
*  I just completely stopped working.
*  I couldn't.
*  And the second I started falling, I couldn't stop.
*  And I spent the rest of the summer just tanking and I said, ah, fuck this.
*  I made my, I made my I am, I'm going to, I'm going to fuck off someplace and
*  whatever.
*  I'll be I am, it doesn't matter.
*  But when I play games online, I mean, I destroy grand masters all the time.
*  Like dynamically, dynamics in chess are just complex positions with all sorts of
*  calculation, attacking, defending, like very forcing lines.
*  I think it's my best strength.
*  I think I'm easily grand master level.
*  So that you have the capacity to be grand master.
*  A hundred percent.
*  Like if I, if the work was put in, if the work was put in and I was not doing
*  my current career, if I just train full time, I think I could do it.
*  Do you have a desire to be grand master?
*  Did you have a desire?
*  You said I didn't really want like the main goal was in international master,
*  which by the way is a really interesting, just I've talked to Olympic athletes.
*  The crash after the gold medal is fascinating.
*  I didn't get gold, but for me, that was my goal.
*  That was your goal.
*  I mean, it doesn't matter.
*  It's the goal.
*  Yep.
*  Uh, it takes a very, very special person to not be destroyed by the gold and
*  continue the dominance is to continue growing, to continue.
*  I mean, it's hard to, that's why they talk about it's hard to be a champion
*  and defend your championships or whatever the goal is to achieve the goal and
*  stick to like, um, yeah, it broke me.
*  It broke you.
*  Yep.
*  So you have the capacity to be a grand master.
*  Have you ever thought, by the way, is there still possible for you or you're
*  fully dedicated now to the love of creating and analyzing this game?
*  I don't think I'm going to do what I do right now forever.
*  So you're going to die one day.
*  Right.
*  Just a heads up.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I once cried when I realized that it was at a funeral.
*  It was very sad.
*  That's another entirely separate rabbit hole to go down.
*  Which is when, when, when did this happen?
*  Yeah.
*  Just a couple of years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  It was wrong.
*  You really were able to like, like that, the realization really hit you like,
*  fuck this, this ends.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm the kind of person who I have my active thoughts in my brain of things I
*  have to get done and the more of those, the better cause I'll, my brain will walk
*  me off a cliff, not the physical body.
*  The brain itself will walk off a cliff, uh, spinning in circles.
*  So I try to keep myself as active as possible on tasks I have to do.
*  It's good.
*  And I'm busy.
*  It's good.
*  I'm at the scale I am, cause you can't really rest a whole lot, but yes, that
*  was, I have these moments in my life where I have realizations of past fuck ups or
*  things I had, like I really have to do that I've been like really doing poorly
*  or things like this, massive existential things that just hit me like, just like
*  a bus, there's several things tricky about it.
*  So, cause I meditate on death a lot, like in this conversation, I imagine this is
*  the last thing both you and I do just, and we're going to die after this.
*  So you meditate on that, but then you also have to, I think what hits people
*  really hard is the realization that life moves on, not only does it just end for
*  you, but most people will be like, um, they'll, you know, in your case, they'll
*  tweet and it's like, oh, he's so great.
*  After there'll be so much outpouring, there'll be outpouring of love and so on
*  for a day and then it moves on and the, you know, the new trees grow, new bridges
*  are built and then eventually human civilization ends or moves over to Mars
*  and so on, and you'll be forgotten completely.
*  But that, that for most people will come right away.
*  Like you, you get a cancer diagnosis or something like that.
*  And it's like, doesn't anyone else know that I'm going to die?
*  Does anyone else care?
*  Like nobody gives a shit.
*  I mean, they do.
*  I mean, there's love there, but like not in, in a dramatic way that you would
*  somehow deep inside hope for that the world would stop because your life is
*  facing this catastrophic event.
*  So, but I think ultimately what you could channel that realization into appreciation
*  of the current moment, it's just the people you love and sharing love with them
*  as intensely as possible, experiencing every moment as intensely as possible.
*  Cause eventually there'll be a last moment and after that there'll be no more moments.
*  That's sort of what I do.
*  Yeah.
*  I try to channel all of that into, sorry.
*  I don't use these fancy microphones in my own.
*  You look uncomfortable.
*  It's not your fault.
*  It's not your fault.
*  With this microphone?
*  No, with this quiet, with this line of conversation.
*  Oh, uh, I'm playing therapist.
*  I don't know if I'm uncomfortable.
*  I just, I don't know if I have a lot to say.
*  I'm sometimes I just listen.
*  Yeah.
*  Like sometimes I'm intimidated.
*  You say a lot of good things and I'm like, shit, what am I going to say?
*  Like at the end of it on this, on this subject, especially, I'm like, that's
*  sort of what I, there's nothing.
*  All right.
*  What do you think happens after we die?
*  Oh man.
*  No, that's a rhetorical question.
*  What were we talking about?
*  Grandmaster, grandmaster.
*  So, uh, how hard is it to reach?
*  What are the, what are the requirements for grandmaster by the way?
*  Cause yeah.
*  And what are the requirements for international master?
*  You mentioned a few requirements and so on.
*  Yes.
*  So the first one is you have to know how to use a sure mic and an arm.
*  Um, slowly you were impressed by the share microphone, by the way, for the,
*  for people listening, we're using this, uh, as I'm sure SM seven B that a lot
*  of podcasts use, I don't know why.
*  And Michael Jackson on thriller, which Grimes told me.
*  Really?
*  That's what I think it looked a little different, but it's the same underneath
*  it, a few musicians used it in studio.
*  I don't know where it became popular as a podcasting microphone.
*  Cause I think most broadcasters use condenser mics that look like really fancy.
*  Yeah.
*  This looks a little, you know, this one's great.
*  It sounds really, really good.
*  And I told you before that I wanted to use it, but it requires a external
*  dashboard of some sort and I'm way too lazy to learn how to do it.
*  And my microphone doesn't sound that bad for YouTube and for, for
*  Twitch, but this is a longterm.
*  I still have to figure out how to stream stuff.
*  I haven't, I haven't figured that out because you want to go
*  down into the world of Twitch.
*  No, I don't.
*  Okay.
*  I don't.
*  You just want to learn how to do it.
*  Uh, uh, no for, uh, no, not.
*  Twitch.
*  Do you know what we have over there?
*  So first of all, yes, it is.
*  It's like, uh, I feel like the hobbit going into like mortar, like I, I, yeah.
*  Twitch is, is a very intense world, but the, there is useful cases when you
*  should have your microphone work with like the different, the processing
*  chain work in real time.
*  So you can do like interviews and also I play video.
*  I try to play a video game once a month.
*  So, um, I've done that like three times already.
*  Uh, so stream that kind of stuff for like, like an hour.
*  Um, like play Skyrim.
*  I like, I love playing Skyrim.
*  I actually love the idea.
*  I haven't done that yet, but apparently in Skyrim, you can turn off the monsters
*  and you could just walk around.
*  So I love the idea of just walking around in Skyrim for a couple of hours.
*  And just like, cause it's beautiful nature.
*  I see.
*  Have you, do you know anything about those?
*  Uh, I know very, I know, I know a little about Skyrim, uh, but so it's,
*  it's kind of like chat.
*  No, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's just beautiful worlds.
*  So, um, there's games that are able to create this sense of, you know, the way
*  you feel when you go hiking, the sense of nature there.
*  It's not that they're ultra realistic, but they capture some
*  majestic aspect of nature.
*  I think some of it is also music, something peaceful, like old timey,
*  uh, medieval type of music and just the trees, like the wind, like you could,
*  and then there's in the distance, there's the mountains and you can like,
*  you have a sense of history that the nature gives you.
*  You have a sense of space, like this, you're like this tiny little creature
*  and there's this big world all around you.
*  I don't know how video that's like an art for a video game to create that.
*  It's not just about the monsters in front of you.
*  Yeah.
*  It's about this world and this feeling of a world.
*  So I can just walk around and enjoy it.
*  I get asked this question a lot.
*  Why don't, why don't I stream more video games?
*  Yes.
*  And I didn't know that such video games, first of all, existed.
*  I thought it was mostly just various sci-fi ish characters and shooting and
*  objective duty.
*  I've played Overwatch on stream.
*  It's the, it's the only video game I actually played a lot and got decent at.
*  And I couldn't play it on stream anymore because my teammates would use racial
*  slurs in the voice chat.
*  Yeah.
*  So that is one of the, cause I've been thinking of talking to a few streamers
*  and they do, they're a little bit, I don't know, as far as they, that community
*  broadly does use racial slurs and seem to make them okay.
*  Um, but for the ones I would talk to are a little bit, they're just harsh in
*  general in the intensity of language.
*  And I don't know what to do.
*  Like, I don't want to be the guy who says like kids these days with their, with
*  their mean language on the internet.
*  Like you want to kind of adapt to the different communities, but at the same
*  time there is, there's lines that you can cross, right?
*  Like if you make everything into a joke, because that's what they kind of do.
*  Everything ends in LOL.
*  Everything is funny.
*  And that becomes, uh, once again, a lubricant that, uh, it's like a slippery
*  slope that takes you to a place where you actually make pretty, um, mean ideas,
*  even evil ideas.
*  Okay.
*  Because it started as a joke.
*  And so, I mean, you start getting into the territory of, I mean, because I've
*  been reading a lot on Hitler and Stalin and so on, and you'll see those kinds of
*  topic come up in that community.
*  And it's like, Ooh, they have a very different perspective on that stuff.
*  That to them, it's just a fun, fun joke, fun time.
*  And I, and I see that the contrast of that would call a duty where you're,
*  where you're shooting.
*  And I, I love shooting and killing things in video games, but there's a slippery
*  slope there too, because then just having visited the front in Ukraine, you get to
*  see the real killing of people and you see how one can lead to another.
*  It, it's not an obvious, but there's a, there's something that happens in video
*  games where you're like, well, this is not reality.
*  The same kind of things happens in war.
*  Well, the people on the other side aren't really human.
*  It does become a kind of video game.
*  And that same mechanism, I feel like I want to be cautious about our
*  brain going down that road.
*  So yeah, I, I do worry about that community.
*  But there are video games that don't have such communities around them.
*  I think Skyrim, I don't think Skyrim is an online component.
*  Minecraft I think is relatively civil from what I've seen.
*  Interesting.
*  Good community.
*  I think it's a lot of, a lot of right now it's booming.
*  It's a lot of young creators who are all seemingly quite close.
*  And I think the community then extends to social media.
*  Some of them are intense, but who isn't?
*  And I think, I think they foster a more or less kind of good group of folks, but
*  no, I completely agree.
*  I think a lot of that stuff and combined with the anonymity stuff that we
*  mentioned earlier, totally dehumanizes the way people interact with each other.
*  And it's, it's scary.
*  I don't, I don't know.
*  Combine that with two years of some people barely going outside.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not a good mix.
*  It's not a good mix at all.
*  I mean, you'd like to think that folks it's like in their teenage years, kind of
*  go through those and they mature out of it and stuff.
*  So like they, they, they, they start to realize the weight of their words.
*  Like that's my hope, but we're all trying to figure that out.
*  How the internet has changed youth.
*  Like easy access to porn, easy access to like some dark communities.
*  Yeah.
*  Where dark ideas breed.
*  I don't know.
*  But then again, I trust in the goodness and the intelligence of people at the
*  end of the day, and I think kids will now it's sounding an old man, but it's, it's
*  good for kids to play with different ideas and then they grow out of it.
*  Hopefully.
*  But then you have to have parents and good school and like good friends that
*  kind of calm out and they're bullshit.
*  You need that.
*  If you're stuck in inside under anonymity, maybe you don't have some of those signals.
*  Kids these days with their internet.
*  I had to go through this.
*  That's kind of what I, what I mentioned.
*  So I didn't have two divorced.
*  My parents were divorced.
*  I didn't have two households.
*  I had three.
*  So I had, so I went to school most of my childhood in a town where my grandmother
*  lived and she was kind of like the Switzerland.
*  So I would be with her and my mom would come with me there half the week.
*  Dad would take me to his place for the other half of the school week.
*  And they, my parents was split weekends.
*  My mom's weekends were in New York where she, my stepdad was and that, that family.
*  So three houses.
*  So grandma, your dad's mom and then, yeah.
*  So step siblings there and there new people there and their extended family there and
*  there, and also at grandma's where I would come anytime I had a conflict.
*  And when I was 12 and 13 and being just a total lunatic, emotional manipulator of all
*  folks in my family, I was just teenager rebelling and also having to deal with
*  three different households.
*  And I mean, I carried a backpack, the same backpack, literally that I, not the
*  physical one, but what's inside of it that I carried.
*  Uh, like when I came here to record the episode and have my stuff in the hotel, a
*  backpack with a laptop, a bunch of clothes, a bunch of other things that I need
*  throughout the week, deodorant, things like that.
*  I mean, of course you start getting that stuff in all the houses, but the, that was
*  the way I lived for some of the most important developmental years of my life.
*  And who knows if I had too much of what we're describing one sprinkle of this too
*  much, one sprinkle of this too much.
*  If I had someone influenced me in a negative way, luckily I managed to steer clear a
*  lot of, of a lot of it.
*  And yeah, how did you not get into trouble with the internet?
*  Meaning like, how did you know?
*  What was your experience with the internet?
*  So I, I wasn't having to move a lot, having to have multiple households, just
*  psychologically different and difficult upbringing.
*  I, yeah, it was, it was extremely tough.
*  I, it's hard to speak about it now because I'm in a completely different mental state.
*  I don't even remember some of like those moments, but it's almost like a different
*  person.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's exactly how it feels.
*  But I, I remember I had a big video game addiction, just like most teenagers.
*  I want to say teenagers, but probably teenage boys, but I'm not, I don't know.
*  I don't know how addicted teenage girls are to, to video games.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't get on that.
*  I definitely look back on things that I did in certain instances, like, well, I
*  was a teenager, that was stupid.
*  Oh, I scammed somebody in some video game.
*  No, that was, you know, I was, oh, that's hilarious.
*  Like in just the, I was just an idiot teenager.
*  Like I didn't do anything unforgivable luckily.
*  And for the most part, just kind of went about my life and I somehow got older and
*  started getting more independent and stopped playing video games.
*  And to be honest with you, I would love to sit here and say, I have some sort of
*  logical explanation of why I am the person I am today.
*  But I think you need elements of the right upbringing and support system, as
*  you said, and you also need luck.
*  You just, I've been in some situations as a teenager where I almost got, I
*  almost got killed by some gang members.
*  That's a very exaggerated story, but I was in a park in New York City and I got into
*  it with a kid whose brother was in a notorious gang of that neighborhood.
*  And he told me he, his brother was gonna come and kill me basically over a stolen
*  basketball.
*  And I was, I was going to fight this kid because I was 14, you know, he stole my
*  basketball.
*  Of course I'm going to fight this kid.
*  This kid was like 12.
*  He had a pierced tongue.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this wasn't a joke.
*  Yeah.
*  This kid was from a totally different way of life and his brother did show up, but
*  his brother was like, I'm like, look at this kid's like, I was a little teenager.
*  I wasn't a big, now 14 year olds are six feet tall.
*  Maybe something would have happened to me, but I was a little kid.
*  And his brother was like, but looking back at that is crazy because I definitely had
*  some of these moments in New York City more than anywhere else, because it's such a
*  big place, but luck, you need some, you need some luck.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of funny that there's certain moments in life on which the entire
*  trajectory of your life can turn.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they're all like, in that case, nothing happened, but you know, I most
*  intensely feel this when I get almost run over by a car kind of thing.
*  How many times have you almost get run over?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe it happened like twice in my life.
*  Okay.
*  That kind of stuff.
*  Like when somebody runs a red light that happened to me here in Austin, you
*  realize, oh shit, that was like your life flashes before your eyes.
*  And those moments can turn.
*  And then there's more meeting certain people where you meet them and for the
*  positive, they're like, wow, this, um, just moment of inspiration.
*  Like, wow, this is possible.
*  Wow.
*  This, this kind of person can exist.
*  Maybe I can be that kind of person too.
*  So yeah, those things can like change the direction, but maybe not.
*  Maybe they just reveal something that was already there and the momentum is always
*  carrying you forward into a thing that you are always going to end up in.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder about that.
*  Um, speaking of teens doing stupid things, let's return to the Magnus Hans saga.
*  I know.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, how did it start?
*  Who is Hans Nieman?
*  Who is Magnus Carlsen?
*  How did it start?
*  There's three games.
*  It started in Miami.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, a good, a good background story is Magnus Carlsen is the
*  arguable greatest player of all time.
*  Very close.
*  I would say to, to Gary Kasparov, world number one for now over 10 years.
*  At the top of his game, you think like close to the top of his game right now?
*  After the most recent thing, yes.
*  I think he has the uncanny ability of top athletes to absorb the
*  bullshit and show, Oh yeah, dad's home now.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, run.
*  I was only trying 70% before that, you know, and, and I think that's what he, I
*  think, I really think that's what he showed.
*  I was in awe.
*  I, if Magnus is playing in a tournament, yes, it's good for views to put him in my
*  YouTube thumbnails and make the video title about him if he does something
*  brilliant, but I was legitimately just blown away.
*  It wasn't even, it wasn't farming him for content.
*  It was, this is unbelievable what he's doing to people.
*  Uh, and he has a point to prove.
*  Hans is a, I believe he's 19 years old right now.
*  He's an American.
*  I don't know if prodigy is necessarily the right word.
*  Prodigies, you, you know, they're prodigies from very, very young.
*  You don't in chess, you don't become a prodigy at 18, but he was always
*  a good junior player.
*  He was always a very unique character.
*  Like I met Hans when he was 11, 12 years old, this little kid, just trash
*  talking folks at the Marshall chess club.
*  And he already had a reputation, literally.
*  Like he had a reputation with, with, with counselors with like, and the
*  truth is I was similar.
*  I was kicked out of chess camp by one of the best chess grand masters of all time.
*  Artur Yusupov.
*  I was in a chess camp when I was nine years old.
*  What'd you do?
*  I was just an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  I was too strong.
*  So I helped other people with other work.
*  I was not your ego shine.
*  That was a kid.
*  I mean, I wouldn't read it.
*  Not every kid lets the ego shine, but some do.
*  Oh yes.
*  You did.
*  Hans does, there's interviews when he's young or like, he's kind of talking shit,
*  but it's entertaining.
*  Yes.
*  What I try to stay away from is just, yes, I let my ego shine, but I don't think I
*  even knew what any of that was when I was, yeah.
*  So it's just sort of, I was just, I was just a loud boisterous kid from a
*  household where I wasn't paid attention to because I had three of them.
*  So I just was like, here's where I'm going to show up and get my attention.
*  And Artur Yusupov, I mean, he's a great, great man.
*  I drove that man crazy.
*  He was like top five in the world at some point in the eighties and nineties.
*  He said it's either me or this kid.
*  Oh wow.
*  So you really got to him.
*  Yes.
*  He said, I'm not going to come back and teach camps unless it's me.
*  And I remember like going through this.
*  I have very vague, distant memories of this.
*  My dad calling, apologizing.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh,
*  Did it make you feel good that you got to a grand master?
*  No, I felt horrible.
*  I felt guilty.
*  I feel guilty my whole life about it.
*  I very rarely feel proud of bad things or I showed them even things.
*  It gets to the point you feel guilty about things you didn't do.
*  That's when, that's when your brain really goes crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm with you on that.
*  So, okay.
*  So you can relate to the Hans.
*  Yes, to young Hans.
*  And he was like in and out of chess.
*  This is what I remember.
*  He was around the rating of 2300.
*  And I remember looking at some of his games in a tournament in Philadelphia.
*  And I was like, there was some game that he played and he didn't know the opening.
*  It was like a London, which is a very popular opening, some theoretical.
*  And I looked at him like, Whoa, he didn't know that.
*  Okay.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I just kind of walked by and I saw him in a tournament a few months later
*  and he did something very rare where in an open tournament, not a tournament of 10
*  players or everybody plays everybody open tournament, randomized pairings, depending
*  on how many points you have, he played nine grand masters, which is crazy.
*  That means he was performing so well, so consistently.
*  That was where he got his first I am norm.
*  It's like, Oh, here it is.
*  Here comes that like boom of a young player where he gets mature.
*  He gets back into the game and he gets stronger.
*  I don't follow a whole lot.
*  Pandemic happens and he starts streaming a bit and he's, he's boisterous.
*  He's, he's kind of like loud.
*  He's talking trash and he's gaining rating constantly.
*  He's just, but so are a lot of people.
*  So you don't think much of it.
*  And then now you can go play over the board again, live tournaments, face to
*  face, as opposed to online events.
*  And he's like, I'm going to go to this tournament.
*  I'm going to win it.
*  I'm going to get my last GM norm.
*  And he does.
*  And then he's like, all right, my goal is this rating by the end of this year.
*  He gets it.
*  He just demolishes absolutely everybody.
*  And you're like, this guy's over the board.
*  I like this guy's for real.
*  There's a lot of people like that.
*  If you look at the top juniors of the world, it's crazy.
*  Alireza, Faroozha 2,800 Vincent, Kymor 2,700, a bunch of kids from India, 2,700
*  age or younger, one or two years younger, maybe, maybe a little older by a year,
*  but it's just this wave and you're just high for the guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this is fucking awesome.
*  Like we got, we got a young American guy who shit talks every time he's on
*  camera and he beats everybody he plays.
*  But then you start hearing sprinkles here and there, maybe in some stream.
*  Oh, I think he, he doesn't, he doesn't get to play on chess.com anymore.
*  Like chess.com doesn't put that badge there on the account.
*  Sometimes, sometimes it's just say the player, listen, we know.
*  And the player's like, all right, you got me.
*  And that's it.
*  There's no conversation.
*  So there's like these sprinkles, but people cheat online, especially when
*  they're young, it's very, you know, it's very captivating.
*  It's a very nice thing to do.
*  Just to be clear.
*  I mean, just make explicit that the accusation and I think it's proven, but
*  they're still being shady about it to the degree is done as that he cheated on
*  chess.com when he was 12, 12 and 16.
*  And he said, that's what he said.
*  That's what he admitted to.
*  But right now chess.com put out a statement and now Magnus put out a
*  statement as well saying, we think it's more than that.
*  Yeah.
*  I've talked to Danny because he wants to come on the podcast, which I'm actually
*  have kind of interested in.
*  I think he's a cool person.
*  Um, and they're also doing some really interesting anti-teating stuff, which to
*  me from an algorithmic perspective is interesting, but he is also the man.
*  Like there's always in every field, there's the institution.
*  So he represents the institution because chess.com is the institution.
*  It's like in the Olympic is it's the IOC.
*  It's like, um, you know, I have to be, I have to be careful.
*  Um,
*  no, in chess feed day is the institute.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  But just that call.
*  They've outgrown way more people actually know chess.com way more people know me
*  way more people know Hikaru.
*  It's one of the reasons that's interesting where the power lays.
*  Yeah.
*  Who has the most power?
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Chess.com has the most power, which I don't know.
*  Maybe you and Hikaru do, do the steer public opinion.
*  You know,
*  that's a very good question.
*  I have to think with my evil cap.
*  Now what would happen if I'd rather you have the evil cup than Hikaru.
*  Cause I feel like he would really, you know, the power absolute, if the two of
*  you ruled the world, it'd be a problem.
*  You mean side by side or the opposite?
*  Yeah.
*  It'd be like, yeah, as rivals, there would definitely be a war.
*  It's one of the reasons I would, I would, I would not just box him.
*  Do you guys, how much do you like each other?
*  I mean, do you admire each other as fellow?
*  Um,
*  as I tell you how I feel,
*  well, we should finish Magnus Hans.
*  Yes.
*  Then we should.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I know.
*  It's, I feel like it just inside.
*  We don't want to talk about it because it feels like it's been talked about so
*  much.
*  I'm going, I'm trying to give.
*  No, for you just remember, I've, for me, it's even, it's much less.
*  Yeah.
*  And for the listeners, zero.
*  Yeah.
*  So like a, like Rogan asked me like, so what, what was this?
*  I know I heard him even talking.
*  What's this chess?
*  You know, Joe talked about the Indonesia thing in some, in some super random small
*  thing.
*  And that was a very funny moment.
*  I told him about this drama a few weeks ago and then he was like, yeah, this is
*  interesting.
*  Is the animal bees, is that possible?
*  Is that good?
*  And it was like, yeah, I think it's possible.
*  Is it?
*  Um, I don't remember how drunk he was, but this, so even, you know, he's
*  curious.
*  He doesn't really know.
*  But anyway, cheating when he was 12, when he was 16, as he said, he admitted
*  to cheating online when he was 12 and 16.
*  Yes.
*  But for timeline sake, let's just, let's just do it this way.
*  He has a lot of over the board success, but nobody really talks about the
*  online cheating stuff.
*  It's sort of kind of kept low key.
*  Couple hundred people, maybe a couple thousand people, which sounds like a lot,
*  but it's not because there's millions of viewers know about this.
*  It's generally kept kind of low key because historically, if you cheated
*  online as a teenager, you're not cheating over the board.
*  It's not possible.
*  You will get caught.
*  Nobody has ever attempted it.
*  We've had over the board cheaters, but not at the ultra elite level.
*  And so what happens is they play this tournament in Miami and the first day
*  Hans loses three, nothing.
*  This is important because on the very next day, it's not like Hans was
*  destroying every, every day.
*  The second day of the tournament, he sits down game one versus Magnus
*  in their best of four and destroys him.
*  Like he destroyed him.
*  Made it look like I was playing in Magnus's shoes, you know, the level
*  difference, it went to be like he, it wasn't close.
*  Of course we can argue it might be because of the, maybe Magnus knew
*  something ahead of time.
*  There's obviously the psychological element.
*  Not, not important.
*  Hans leaves.
*  They say, interviewer says, Hans yesterday, by the way, horribly
*  phrased interview question.
*  He goes, he goes, Hans yesterday was a terrible for you.
*  And today you start with a masterpiece.
*  What do you have to say?
*  Chest speaks for itself, walks away.
*  Argue.
*  You can argue it's cringe.
*  You can argue, I thought it was cool.
*  And then the guy, the guy then keeps asking a question with his arm extended
*  because he's so shocked.
*  He doesn't know what to do.
*  Like he, he didn't even occur to him.
*  How ridiculous it looked to be asking.
*  And then not only does Hans come back and loses the best of four, he loses
*  like two more games or maybe three.
*  He had seen he lost the next three games.
*  He then proceeds to lose every single best of four match for
*  the rest of the tournament.
*  He ends with zero points and a prize money of $0.
*  They put up the graphic and he put Neiman zero.
*  I think he got some minimum, right?
*  So it's like, wow, this is like insane.
*  This guy comes out with this crazy interview.
*  And in my recap videos, I was like, the next time Hans has success, he has
*  to stay away from the cameras.
*  Don't let him talk.
*  Just don't let him talk.
*  It's going to be bad luck.
*  You know, I'm joking around like next time he plays, it's crazy.
*  He's going to, so that was the, that was their kind of first interaction there.
*  They also, there was some photos.
*  They were having fun playing on the beach.
*  I don't know where they had a chess board on the beach.
*  Chess players are so, yeah, they were still getting along.
*  I guess so.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting because I talked to him at that time.
*  Would he have mentioned something?
*  Right.
*  I wonder what he would, would have said if I asked him about Hans,
*  because I was clueless.
*  Did, did anyone care about Hans?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Hans is not a super known entity, right?
*  He became much more known.
*  He became probably a top five all time popular chess player in the last three weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's, it's not, it wasn't, it wouldn't even be a worthy question.
*  No, you don't know.
*  Maybe Magnus already kind of knew.
*  A lot of the top players, it seems, are coming out now and saying,
*  we already were suspicious.
*  It seems like Magnus might've known, but maybe not enough to address it.
*  He still might not be willing to address it.
*  Yes.
*  But anyway, so like, so, so yeah, so totally horrible tournament performance after,
*  correct.
*  After Hans beat Magnus.
*  Then the annual tradition of the St.
*  Louis tournaments happens, which is a strong field of players first for a fast
*  tournament, rapid and blitz and a classical tournament.
*  And the classical tournament is the Singfield cup.
*  It's the, it's named after Rex Singfield, billionaire chess philanthropist.
*  Uh, and it's like St.
*  Louis chess club is a prestigious place.
*  It's this whole host of a prestigious tournament.
*  Hall of Fame is there for chess.
*  I don't know if it's the U S hall of fame or worldwide hall of fame, but yeah,
*  it's, it's the countries play chess.
*  So I didn't, they do, but you know, we will.
*  I don't know who determines where the hall of fame gets to be.
*  If we say it's the hall of fame.
*  Okay.
*  What one day some other part of the world is going to be like, actually it's over
*  here.
*  Yeah.
*  So basically what happens is we have a field set for the Singfield cup set.
*  It's the top 10 players in the world.
*  Some can't make it.
*  So, okay, you get number 11 in there or something.
*  One of them can't come because of something related to coronavirus.
*  It's not, it's not now we're going to get a little asterisk on Spotify because it
*  was mentioned.
*  Uh, get more info about COVID-19.
*  Uh, so I don't know why he couldn't come, but he couldn't come.
*  Okay.
*  Something happens.
*  He can't make it.
*  Hans Nieman is the replacement.
*  Yeah.
*  At the time we didn't know this, but now weeks later we knew Magnus wanted to not
*  play.
*  This is very important.
*  Back then we didn't know.
*  Apparently some other top players also didn't want to play.
*  They also were suspicious.
*  They also wanted increased anti-cheating measures, which by the way, in chess are
*  dog shit.
*  Like you give this little metal wand and you put it on the little ears body.
*  And there's apparently an argument, a micro earpiece would not be caught.
*  Something in the armpit vibrating would not be caught something in the shoe.
*  They don't make the players take their shoes off because it's too elitist.
*  How are you going to make players take their shoes off?
*  That's, oh my God.
*  But if these things are out there.
*  Or if anything was inside any other orifice.
*  Correct.
*  Yes.
*  I have to bring that up.
*  I mean, to be honest, yes, that is very truthful.
*  If nothing else, this podcast is about honesty and truth.
*  So I have to be complete.
*  Correct.
*  And transparency.
*  So what ends up happening in this Singfield Cup is Magnus ends up still playing, but
*  the anti-cheat measures are not introduced.
*  So the first few games, Hans has a very, very impressive first round game against
*  Levon Aronian, one of the best players in the world.
*  Okay.
*  Draw.
*  He was pushing draw second game demolishes like a, like a top player.
*  My mid Yarev crushes him dominant opening, but not like a perfect game.
*  You understand?
*  Like it was, it was, uh, he made some inaccuracies here and there and he ended
*  up winning in a complex game.
*  This game three happens versus, uh, versus Magnus.
*  And not only does he beat Magnus with the black pieces, he dominates
*  him from start to finish.
*  So in the opening, Magnus played something with white that he had
*  maybe played once or twice before.
*  There was some big debate about it.
*  I'm not going to get into it.
*  Basically a very niche, small thing that just, he had never played in maybe a long
*  game before with some sprinkled in venom that might get Hans off guard.
*  Hans proceeds to play like the first 15, 20 moves absolutely perfectly.
*  And then converts the game into a slightly better end game and squeezes Magnus to death.
*  Basically beats Magnus with black, which nobody had done in years the same way
*  Magnus would have beaten other players.
*  Then he goes and gives this interview, which where he claims that he had looked
*  at those first 15, 20 moves right before the game.
*  Basically he got lucky.
*  Didn't you say he looked at something very similar?
*  No, no, he, it was, it was either similar or literally that exact
*  variation, which is possible.
*  I've done that before.
*  One of my best ones of my life.
*  That morning I went, you know, I'm not prepared.
*  What if my opponent plays this Queen's Gambit accepted variation?
*  And I literally learned the first 12 moves.
*  He didn't know move 12.
*  I killed him.
*  Okay.
*  Like it just happens.
*  Yeah.
*  Unfortunately, when you combine that with other small elements of the interview, and
*  now there's body language experts going all on this, it was odd.
*  He gave an interview afterwards explaining his, explaining various details of the game.
*  But not really explaining them.
*  That's the thing.
*  The standard chess player interview is you sit down and you go something about the
*  opening, something about not, Oh yeah, I looked at this right before the game.
*  And then you explain various symphonies and compositions of variations, things
*  that went through your head, things you were evaluating, but Hans's interviews
*  are different.
*  So everything about him as a chess player already is different and his interviews
*  are extremely strange and also different.
*  That's fine.
*  But not when you combine it then with the world champion withdrawing right after you
*  beat him and ghosting the entire chess world.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's a, for people who haven't listened to it, there's a kind of sloppiness
*  to the way he analyzes the game.
*  Like he's like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Like it's very, um, cause it's very obvious.
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  It's just completely winning here.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I'm completely winning here.
*  And it's like, uh, I, uh, yeah, I just played perfect.
*  I played perfect.
*  Like there's a sense of like, but it also doesn't, for me again, a very outside
*  spectator, it doesn't raise any red flags.
*  That's just his personality.
*  He seems to really like to talk this way.
*  And plus this could be crazy.
*  Uh, but do you have a sense that he's more of an intuitive player versus like, he's
*  just not the kind of person that analyzes really well or is it, or is that a
*  ridiculous notion?
*  Well, let's put it this way to succeed legitimately, because obviously this is a
*  cheating scandal at the end of the day at the 2750, 82800 level, the upper
*  echelon of chess, you cannot be an intuitive player.
*  You can be a little bit more intuitive than a calculator and a concrete
*  evaluator of positions.
*  Meaning if I give you five seconds to play a move, you're going to choose the
*  best move quickly.
*  Those people are generally better at fast time controls, but you have to be good at
*  everything.
*  And what raised red flags in this interview was the fact that it was
*  different than every other interview any human being ever gave at that level of
*  chess, particularly after beating Magnus for the first time as a teenager, which
*  is a very small group of people.
*  I said, so that's where it got weird.
*  And the very next day, Magnus withdraws from the event.
*  Chess world lights completely on fire for multiple weeks.
*  And he also tweets.
*  Right.
*  That was the resignation.
*  No, resignation.
*  The tweet was I'm withdrawing from the tournament in St.
*  Louis.
*  I've always enjoyed playing here and I will in the future.
*  And then it's a clip of Jose Mourinho.
*  I cannot speak.
*  I choose not to speak.
*  If I speak, I'm in big trouble.
*  I don't want to be in big trouble.
*  And that's some people nuts.
*  People said it's not even a cheating insinuation, which was one of the
*  theories.
*  Another theory was someone in team Magnus told Hans what Magnus was looking at.
*  And that's why Hans learned those first 15 moves, which is so fucking stupid
*  because Magnus knows like five people, not in his life, but his team is five.
*  Yeah, it's very close to that group.
*  Right.
*  But to the outsider, that sounds like a very legitimate theory.
*  How could, how else can you explain?
*  Hans said he knew before the game what was going to happen.
*  Magnus senses a mole.
*  He's not.
*  No.
*  By the way, just, just to, just so I know, like if that was, forget the cheating
*  aside, if you knew, it doesn't matter how the opening your opponent is going to do,
*  they prepared, is that a significant help to you?
*  If that opening is ultra sharp and requires basically the game to be on a
*  knife's edge.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Meaning one mistake from can be fatal.
*  Cause then you can look up what the engine says.
*  And you can, you can know everything.
*  You can know all the possibilities.
*  So even if your opponent goes off that engine path, you will know how to punish it.
*  In this case, what happened basically was Magnus played a line that if completely
*  optimally punished would have given Hans a slightly better position.
*  And that's what happened.
*  But then he also demolished him in that later phase of the game.
*  Yes.
*  And then, okay.
*  So Magnus designs goes silent.
*  The chess world goes crazy.
*  What else is interesting in that period of time?
*  Hans's fourth round game of that tournament right after beating Magnus was
*  also just absolutely genius.
*  Just an absolutely brilliant game, which he failed to win.
*  But then after that game, he also gives once again, another in-game
*  where he's like, this game was absolutely genius.
*  Like this was, I was just killing him from start to finish.
*  And like, there was a moment he literally says, oh yeah, just gave him a piece,
*  like a full piece, which is a substantial advantage to the other side.
*  And he starts explaining why the position is winning, but in words, not in
*  chess moves, not in specific concrete chess moves, which is the way you're
*  supposed to, if you understand the position, right?
*  So now there's this new theory of how to win.
*  The interviews are going to be used as the evidence.
*  And beyond round four, he just played like a good grandmaster and he lost two
*  or three games, maybe, maybe two games and he drew the rest.
*  So he didn't win again.
*  And he beat in the first two out of his first three games, he beat
*  Mametiarov, he beat Carlson.
*  And he also went on the other side of the board, he beat the
*  Carlson.
*  And he also went on the attack himself.
*  He, that was when he publicly admitted to cheating in an interview that he gave
*  to the St. Louis chess club.
*  That's when he said he has never cheated over the board.
*  Then he said, chess.com has banned me from the global championship, which is
*  what I was invited to, to play privately.
*  They banned me, they didn't even ban me publicly.
*  And then he said, and Hikaru is, is, is, is on Twitch every day, you know, saying
*  things about me, this and that.
*  And since then, nothing.
*  Tournament finishes somehow.
*  I don't know how we got to the end of the tournament.
*  I really thought that it was going to get called off, but tournament ends.
*  Hans has said anything since then.
*  So has he still said, when was the last time you said that was the last
*  time, the tweet that he sent September 7th.
*  He says, Hikaru wants to play the victim or something like this.
*  They faced each other again recently.
*  When it was, what was that about?
*  I played in the online event of this, uh, meltwater champions chess tour, which is
*  a 16 player tournament where everybody plays everybody first and after 15 games,
*  the top eight make a knockout bracket and Magnus played the game.
*  There was obviously a lot of hype prior for what was going to happen in this game.
*  Magnus plays one move and resigns.
*  Actually, I imagine he didn't want to play one move.
*  I imagine he would have resigned the game as it was starting, but I think some
*  websites don't let you resign before you make one move because then the game
*  isn't counted.
*  So I think he didn't want to play at all, but he played one move and that made it
*  even more epic, I suppose.
*  He resigned and that was, that was that.
*  Like, so you still, you, you lose that game counts, right?
*  Game can lose the rating.
*  All these online events, unfortunately don't count for any sort of rating, but
*  on the tournament, yeah, play one move.
*  Yeah.
*  So resides and then how does the tournament still work out?
*  Is it the tournament already over?
*  So he made the eight as Magnus still made the top eight.
*  It was round five or like round six or something.
*  So it was halfway through the preliminary stage.
*  Yeah.
*  It affected his standings.
*  But then after resigning that game, Magnus finished first, uh, in the bracket
*  in the preliminaries and then he won the entire event.
*  There was a chance that they were going to meet in the final.
*  But Hans lost them the first round against the Vietnamese strong
*  player, Le Quang Liem, and then Magnus, uh, gave a short interview to the live
*  broadcast where he said he would give a statement at the end of the tournament.
*  And then he did, he gave a statement at the end of the tournament.
*  And now here we are.
*  The only other thing missing from this is the very intense scrutinization of
*  all those over the board games that I mentioned earlier that Hans dominated in.
*  So people are now going through all of his games that he played in tournaments
*  and they're analyzing them with engines and they're saying he played exceptionally
*  well and the debate is, was he cheating or was he way too good already, but underrated?
*  Because he could have had incubated knowledge.
*  So he could have not played for a couple of years was 2,700 level, but
*  was playing people who are 24, 2,500.
*  Ah, well, well over the, I see.
*  So not just over the board with the top level people like Magnus,
*  but over the board in general.
*  Uh, yes, before he got a chance to play in these super tournaments against the
*  best players in the world, he had to go to Europe.
*  He was the most active chess player in 2021.
*  And he was quite dominant.
*  Yes.
*  I think he played more over the board games than any player in 2021 or 2022.
*  I think it's 2021.
*  And yes, I think his rise was steeper than everybody.
*  Maybe with the exception of all the rest of Ferozha who got to 2,800.
*  See, I'd like to believe, cause he, he talks about being very, he just
*  became obsessed with chess.
*  I, I like stories like that.
*  I like stories of, um, the underdog, especially with the Scarlet letter of
*  having been a cheater in the past.
*  I like the idea of somebody who is flawed psychologically and ethically
*  and just, just a full fascinating personality.
*  And this somehow just becomes obsessed.
*  I mean, similar to Bobby Fisher is also a tortured soul, also flawed,
*  also just chaotic all over the place.
*  You could see Bobby Fisher being somebody that might cheat when he was 12,
*  on the online chess, right?
*  Like if, if it existed.
*  Yeah, actually I think in some podcasts, like small chess podcasts, I don't want to,
*  I like Ben Johnson, so I, I'm apologizing for calling it small, but compared to
*  like, let's say Lex Fridman podcast.
*  Uh, it's, uh, what's, what's, what's this podcast?
*  It's perpetual chess.
*  It's kind of like, oh, I love perpetual chess.
*  Are you joking?
*  Really?
*  How dare you copy?
*  Yeah.
*  The, the way, right.
*  Um, I'll show you cause it does a lot of, it talks, it makes me feel
*  special.
*  Let me see.
*  Where's it perpetual chess?
*  Um, he does like improver series.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  He's great.
*  Ben, I forgot.
*  I'm so horrible at names.
*  His name is Ben, Ben Johnson.
*  Yeah, it is Ben Johnson.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  The perpetual chess podcast.
*  That's amazing.
*  See, like when even individuals like myself who might have a large audience, when I
*  look at you, you're at a, you're just at a different level.
*  I don't expect you to be listening to chess podcasts during the day.
*  Just imagine you're general doing something to change the world or
*  no, into some visionary people.
*  Well, I should say it, you know, I've been running a lot and I listened to podcasts
*  a lot because they are such, I love human beings excited about stuff that really
*  energizes me and, um, I've listened to a bunch of chess podcasts.
*  I I'm really energized by your love of chess.
*  Um, I really like, yeah, sorry.
*  I did forget his name, but Ben Johnson.
*  I love it when he talks to grandmasters.
*  I love when he talks to the, the, the, the regular folks for the improvers, like
*  to see how they balance life and chess and all that kind of stuff.
*  He's just pretty good at it.
*  And he's like super excited and they talk about books and they get excited
*  about different books.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, it, it also gives me a sense of, um, where the chess world is from a
*  different perspective is like people studying chess.
*  Like what they get excited about, how difficult it is.
*  Um, yeah, it's, it's nice to get a sense of the community's language that's used
*  because I did want to have a bunch of conversations, um, with folks about
*  chess, cause I think it's a beautiful game and I think it's a beautiful community.
*  So that's, that's one of the podcasts I listened to.
*  So yeah, anyway, he's, it's great.
*  Anyway, you were saying why, why'd you bring them up?
*  Yes.
*  Great podcast.
*  Great podcast.
*  I only reason I thought of it, uh, and I use the word small, no
*  disrespect, Ben is because even that episode, which he did with Hans,
*  like it was a small episode.
*  It wasn't seen by mass audience of chess.
*  And he did an episode with Hans recently or no some time ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And in that episode, Hans very openly is like Bobby Fisher was
*  misunderstood and he was my idol.
*  Oh, I said a couple of things like that.
*  And Hans is an intense guy.
*  Like I, when I listened to Hans, I get a little anxious.
*  I just, he brings out some sort of disturbance in my ecosystem.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, I, I, yeah, I can't really put him down to like what, what's going on
*  there as a person who's trying to read people.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, it's, it's difficult.
*  Like I can, I can, this is the dark aspect.
*  He could be both the genius of Bobby Fisher and a genius cheater.
*  And you could see like there's something chaotic about him, which makes
*  him very appealing in that way.
*  Yes.
*  So right now, late September, 2022, the current environment is such that Hans
*  hasn't said anything in weeks and people are sort of dissecting every bit of
*  circumstantial evidence that they can.
*  And they're trying to present the case.
*  I don't even know to who ultimately, I guess it would be the feed aid
*  cheating, anti-cheating commission or whatever.
*  It may be to you essentially.
*  I mean, the people with the platform, it could be to present convincing
*  evidence to where the, the people, the people are convinced that one way or
*  the other, because you're for people who don't know, and they should definitely
*  follow Gotham Chess, you've been on this, you've covered it a lot and I'm sure
*  if anything comes out, you'll cover it more, but you've been quite balanced and
*  thoughtful and kind of objective about the whole thing.
*  Yeah.
*  So the reason for that is I understand the power that I wield with anything.
*  And if I say one sentence the wrong way, I might be sending 10,000 people or
*  more to go do something.
*  Yeah.
*  And I hate that.
*  I want to present the evidence and I want the video to end and people go, okay.
*  I understand not, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go fuck someone up.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, cause that's, and I also believe that even if Hans, even if Hans is guilty,
*  this goes all the way back.
*  He's a human being.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can argue that cheaters got to be punished and you can argue that
*  people who do things wrong, you shouldn't feel any sort of compassion, but I would
*  hate to have the whole world pointing their fingers at me, the entire world
*  that I've known my entire life.
*  And even if I, if I messed up, there's still a world after chess, there might
*  still even be a world in chess.
*  I don't know, but that stuff, it doesn't make me, it doesn't make me feel good to
*  present all of the circumstantial evidence in my videos and start being like,
*  yeah, it looks, you know, so.
*  But at the same time, you deeply care about chess and the chess community.
*  And there's some sense where, was it you or was it Magnus that said that cheating
*  poses an existential threat?
*  Magnus said that.
*  I mean, there is some aspect of truth to that, which is like, you know, we, the
*  chess is in a state where bots, uh, chess engines are much better than humans.
*  And we're living in a world where technology becomes easier and easier to
*  integrate with human beings, whether you put it in some office or elsewhere.
*  And that, that does pose a threat to, um, to our ability to trust that a world
*  champion is indeed a world champion, that somebody we think is good is indeed good.
*  And so there is some aspect to the ecosystem that should punish cheating
*  and perhaps over punish cheating.
*  And the other thing is in sport, you can take PEDs and have bigger muscles,
*  bigger, better reaction time, but you still have to perform the
*  action in a successful way.
*  There is still a chance you can lose if you take PEDs.
*  Maybe in some sports, the gap between non PED and PED user is
*  significantly more noticeable.
*  But in chess, if you cheat, you play God.
*  Yeah.
*  You decide when the game is over.
*  You can fake bad moves.
*  You can fake everything.
*  You can even, if you're cheating, quote unquote, the right way, you're going
*  to lose plenty of games to avoid getting detected.
*  So you can create bots that are 2,800.
*  Like you can also just not listen.
*  If you know all the best moves, but choose to play on your own,
*  and, oh, I made a mistake.
*  Not a big deal.
*  You could, yes, bots are all at a different level, but if you were to
*  cheat that you play God, you can decide when you make your move and when the
*  engine makes its move.
*  And if you know the top four lines of the engine, you choose the fourth one.
*  So in hindsight, people will analyze your game and they will go, Oh, it wasn't perfect.
*  Well, no shit.
*  Only the stupid cheaters play the top engine line the whole game.
*  By the way, I'm not saying that this is what's happening here, but there's
*  there's probably an excitement to playing God and getting away with it.
*  Like I know people, I know adults, grown adults who are successful in their fields.
*  And they cheat.
*  They cheat in lessons.
*  They cheat in, like I've, I don't want to say I've taught any.
*  May I, may or may not have.
*  For some reason, one of them watches this and they know they're guilty.
*  Uh, and it happens, it happens, uh, not just teenagers, not just young adults,
*  but full grown adults will cheat when they play because it, I think it helps them learn.
*  Oh, uh, well that's good.
*  I could just, that's justification, but I just meant like, I, it might not be just
*  about winning in my also just feel good to have that power, power.
*  Like I bet you it's a drug.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, like with a lot of criminals, with a lot of criminals, I feel like
*  part of like the mass, like mass murders would be serial killers.
*  I feel like a lot of is they can get away with it.
*  They, the fact that they, like they've like everyone else is a sucker and they figured
*  out how to do this evil thing.
*  And, uh, obviously cheating is nowhere close to that, but the, but there's still
*  a feeling of getting away with it.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder, I think you're pretty objective on the whole thing.
*  Like where, if you were, um, a betting man, what would you say is the
*  probability in, are you changing day by day in your head?
*  What's the probability that Hans cheated over the board against
*  Magnus in the, in St.
*  Louis?
*  That's a tough one, man.
*  Have you even allowed yourself to, to put a probability on it?
*  No, not on that specific game because I think a lot of that game was affected
*  by Magnus's own psyche.
*  That was one of his worst games ever.
*  So he played poorly too.
*  Magnus played, which doesn't help his case.
*  Yeah.
*  Hans might've cheated then that game, but we'll never know.
*  I, I think day by day, the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more
*  that he's cheated it like, like how Magnus said more than he said.
*  And more recently it's undeniable.
*  Like, right.
*  A lot of the statistics are there.
*  The problem is you can't prove you're not cheating.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless you strip naked, like that site offered him a million bucks to like
*  everything about the site.
*  Some sort of headline that said Hans Nieman has offered a million bucks.
*  And where I struggled to comprehend is how on earth he could pull it off.
*  And like, I'm a guilty, that my brain goes to guilt first and resentment,
*  remorse, guilt, that kind of that trio.
*  Magnus put out a statement as we speak yesterday saying, dear chess world
*  at the 2022 Sinkfield Cup, I made the unprecedented professional decision to
*  withdraw from the tournament after my round three game against Hans Nieman.
*  A week later during the champions chess tour, I resigned against Hans Nieman
*  after playing only one move.
*  I know that my actions have frustrated many in the chess community.
*  I'm frustrated.
*  I want to play chess.
*  I want to continue to play chess at the highest level in the best events.
*  I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game.
*  I also believe that chess organizers and all those who care about the sanctity
*  of the game we love should seriously consider increasing security measures
*  and methods of cheat detection for over the board chess.
*  When Nieman was invited last minute to the 2022 Sinkfield Cup, I strongly
*  considered withdrawing prior to the event I ultimately chose to play.
*  That's the thing you're referring to is that he can, like now we know he was
*  torn about the whole thing.
*  I believe that Nieman has cheated more and more recently than he has publicly admitted.
*  His over the board progress has been unusual and throughout our game in
*  Sinkfield Cup, I had the impression that he wasn't tense or even fully
*  concentrating on the game in critical positions while outplaying me as black
*  in a way I think only a handful of players can do.
*  This game contributed to changing my perspective.
*  He must do, we must do something about cheating.
*  And for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have
*  cheated repeatedly in the past because I don't know what they're capable of doing
*  in the future.
*  There's more than I would like to say.
*  Unfortunately, at this time I'm limited in what I can say without explicit
*  permission from Nieman to speak openly.
*  So far I have only been able to speak with my actions and those actions have
*  stated clearly that I am not willing to play chess with Nieman.
*  I hope that the truth in this matter comes out, whatever it may be.
*  Sincerely, Magnus Carlsen, world chess champion.
*  How would you sign off your statements?
*  If I was a world, no, just say whatever.
*  Lex Friedman, what would be the title?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I think I would not, even if I was a world champion, I would just say Lex.
*  Or make up a title.
*  And I feel like I really fucked up in life if I have to tweet a statement as an
*  image, that's like when you get, you've, you're a politician and you got caught
*  cheating on your wife, like for many years in a row.
*  Yes.
*  Then I tweet an image.
*  I'm sorry for all the people I have hurt and the people that believed in me and
*  whatever else, and then I would sign world chess champion.
*  You know, the most like the modern way to give a statement, what I thought
*  Magnus was going to do, thought he was going to write on the recent scandal or
*  my statement on the past few weeks, tweet longer.
*  What do you mean?
*  So you put a URL.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So that's for tweets, but it's unlimited characters.
*  It's not a hundred and forty.
*  I didn't know what that is.
*  Can you explain that to me?
*  Yeah.
*  So generally when a celebrity has a giant audience on Twitter, they will make their
*  statement on social media and say what it is in a sentence, one line, and then
*  there's a link.
*  Where does the link take you?
*  To a website called tweet longer.
*  Oh, that's a natural website.
*  Tweet longer.
*  Tweet longer.
*  Yeah.
*  And that is where they write their statements.
*  That is what I was expecting.
*  When I saw this, I haven't seen this before.
*  Oh, this is, this is, I don't have one off the top.
*  I have one off on my head, but it's that Kanye Kim Kardashian breaking up that
*  would use that.
*  Streamers, musicians.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think politicians use it because that it's just feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  They use the image.
*  They use my, yeah, my space and Facebook.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I would probably go, see, I like, I mean, I'm not just being biased here just
*  because I have a podcast.
*  I'm a huge fan of podcasts.
*  I feel like I would go on a podcast to talk about it with somebody I trust.
*  So like long form.
*  And discuss it.
*  Thought it was going to do that too.
*  In fact, I wanted to write him a message and be like, I can be that, that guy for
*  you.
*  I have a very strange relationship with Magnus because.
*  Good, bad.
*  I don't, I, we've never interacted.
*  I very openly, I don't want to say use him for views because that is a very crude
*  way of saying it.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you wanted to insult my YouTube channel, that is what you would say.
*  So Magnus is in a lot of videos, thumbnails or, or videos, not click baity, but if
*  he's playing in a tournament and he plays a great game, he's going on that fucking
*  thumbnail because, because, uh, let's see, he's the number one chess player, very
*  likely the greatest chess player of all time.
*  Right.
*  Plus he's exciting.
*  Uh, and YouTube algorithm loves his name and people click on it.
*  Oh, do they do the best?
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't know what the chicken or the egg is, but the reason it loves it.
*  The reason people click on it is because he is an exciting personality.
*  He's an exciting chess player.
*  Is there something compelling about him?
*  Yeah.
*  He's also, he can, he knows how to, in a subtle, dry wit, humor way, talk shit
*  with the silences and all of that.
*  Yes.
*  He knows, he knows it, he knows it, he knows the whole game of it.
*  Specifically to Magnus, my relationship with him, we've never interacted.
*  And throughout the last couple of years, he generally has interacted
*  with Hikaru as a competitor.
*  He has done some collabs with the Botezes.
*  He obviously has talked to Ludwig who's a very, very big streamer.
*  And part of me regrets the fact that when I was smaller as a
*  YouTuber and a Twitch streamer, I'm sure I used to make jokes or some tweets at
*  Magnus, like when Magnus would tweet something, I would try to respond so I
*  could be the top reply, because that was my social media.
*  I literally think I once responded to a Magnus tweet and saying, responding for
*  engagement, because it was some, like, it wasn't some controversial tweet.
*  Yes.
*  It was just something funny.
*  And I went, ha ha, responding for engagement because I was just being a
*  little bit of an idiot and I knew that if it got enough likes, it would be at the
*  top and people would see me, my brand and just get to know me.
*  This is the type of-
*  Please don't use the word brand, but yes.
*  Yes.
*  But yeah, no, and your worry is that he wouldn't take you seriously.
*  He wouldn't take me seriously.
*  And if I was one of the best of all time and I saw some dude on YouTube just kind
*  of being a moron and I'm all over his thumbnails, I can imagine he has a very
*  legitimate-
*  I appreciate your humility and self-critical nature, but one of the realities
*  with people like him is he wouldn't hold a grudge or not treat you seriously.
*  I'm pretty sure he's a fan.
*  He's a big support.
*  He doesn't watch YouTube videos.
*  I can imagine.
*  I barely watch YouTube videos.
*  I think of chess.
*  Yes.
*  He might watch more fun chess adjacent stuff, but it's not for him.
*  So I'm pretty sure he knows of you and likes you and you're commenting on stuff
*  has zero effect on his belief, which is funny.
*  That's something you think about.
*  Now you're perfect, but you're well-respected.
*  Like you're a lot of people mention you as a person who was like, okay, this
*  person is legit, which is an important thing.
*  It's not just an entertainer.
*  It's not just a shit talker and so on.
*  This person does is a great educator, great fan and student of chess.
*  A great player himself.
*  So all of those components.
*  And so, yeah, you're definitely a good person.
*  And on this particular aspect have been very objective.
*  I understand that I'm nowhere near perfect.
*  I don't, I'm not a different person on camera off camera.
*  I will say it like it is maybe on Twitch.
*  You got to, you got to dig in the mud there a little bit more, a lot more
*  sarcastic, a lot more brash and whatnot, but you meet me in a taco place.
*  And I'll talk with you the same way I might if it was a video, just that you may
*  not, you may not consider me just a random guy at a taco place.
*  And that's why I think about the stuff with specific to Magnus.
*  And it's one of the reasons I don't reach out to him directly ever.
*  I've never, I've never DMed him on Instagram, hoping for a response.
*  Never.
*  I've never even reached out to anyone on his team trying to get the conversation
*  very candid with him, which I think it would be.
*  I even barely reached out to guys in the top 10, like top 15 only recently
*  started pushing myself more to do that.
*  And I even in my intro messages to them, preemptively say something like, you
*  might think I'm some idiot.
*  You might not be totally wrong, but like, I think this would be a good
*  conversation and give it a shot.
*  And I've been surprised.
*  I've been ignored by a few, but some said, Oh yeah, I've seen your stuff.
*  I'm generally a fan, like no problem.
*  I was actually really blown away.
*  This YouTube channel, Levitov Chess, it's a Russian chess channel.
*  And I think the last name of the guy is the name of the channel is named after
*  Ilya Levitov, who has some sort of managerial role in the Russian chess federation.
*  And this channel has interviewed some of the greatest players of all time.
*  They have interviews with the modern best Russian players and Kasparov,
*  Karpov, Kramnik, you name these guys from Russian chess.
*  History, it's unbelievable.
*  I just thought this was a channel of just unbelievably well-respected chess players
*  and a legion of fans that were long-time chess fans, and I mentioned them very
*  briefly in a YouTube video and that little clip went into their next community event.
*  And the founder of the channel went on this two minute, beautiful description of
*  why he liked me and how he only watched my channel as a beginner and how I have a
*  natural voice and how if I talked about cards, I would have a million, a hundred
*  million subscribers, just all this really kind stuff that in my mind, I thought was
*  either undeserved or I just never fathomed that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you said you certainly should not feel as deserve as you should have a
*  humility about that kind of stuff.
*  But I think that is the thing that works over time.
*  It's like reputation spreads, which is like, if, if one person likes you and they
*  tell you to other people and it kind of spreads and over time.
*  You have one conversation with the top 10, uh, like a, like a super grand master
*  and they, they say nice things about you.
*  And it just kind of spreads.
*  Cause I've been very surprised in all walks of life.
*  Like, um, I'm, you know, this, this really gets me, this makes me happy, honestly.
*  Cause, um, like people ask me like how I get guests and so on.
*  And it just seems honestly, just be a good person and like a real person and honest.
*  And it just kind of spreads the word word of mouth.
*  It, you know, even coming here, I almost didn't reach out.
*  What do you mean?
*  I had seen you had never talked to a chess person and I've watched a lot of, I've
*  watched some of the things start to finish, especially if the guest I'm really
*  interested in, like George St.
*  Pierre, I'll watch that guy do whatever.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I'll watch him do basically anything.
*  Yeah.
*  Make an omelet or something.
*  Yeah.
*  I love listening to him.
*  Some of the other things I, I've listened to as well.
*  And I noticed that neither, well, to me, you, you obviously, and Joe are
*  the two biggest podcasters.
*  I don't know if that's like factual.
*  I don't have some influencer has some podcasts, but you guys interview folks
*  that I listen to more, more often than anybody else.
*  And when Magnus came on, I was like, oh, this is, that's amazing.
*  You know, I, I don't even know how I would reach out to someone like you.
*  It just seems like a limp, like climbing a mountain.
*  And then a couple of days later, and I, I even in that episode wanted to write,
*  but I didn't know how it's like, do I make a YouTube comment?
*  I don't want that.
*  I'm looking like I'm clout chasing on the Magnus episode.
*  But then you talked to the Botezes and I said, oh, what's this?
*  I shouldn't overthink it.
*  Like, you know, I, so I just said, all right, fuck it.
*  I'll, I'll just write a comment and you're like, yeah, I'd love to have you on.
*  I was shocked.
*  I didn't even, you responded just within a couple of hours or something.
*  And yeah, yeah, I loved it, man.
*  I mean, there was an honor.
*  It's a good way to connect.
*  I also like on live streams.
*  I'll watch, I try to resist commenting, but, um, you know, I'll watch some,
*  some even smaller channels, like I'll get super excited by the, by them
*  and connect in that way.
*  There's an intimacy to that.
*  Man, YouTube is beautiful.
*  I don't know anything about Twitch.
*  Um, maybe it's similar, but YouTube has ruined you.
*  There is an intimacy, like, especially if it's live.
*  I don't know what that is, but.
*  If it's live, they're like right there.
*  You can just like reach out and say, hello.
*  Yeah.
*  That's cool.
*  That's like really, uh, I don't know.
*  I'm just happy to live in this time when you could connect with people in that way.
*  There is an intimacy.
*  That's why I love podcasts too.
*  I, I listen to people and I feel like they're my friend.
*  It's cool.
*  That's a cool, it's a cool feeling.
*  It makes you feel less lonely.
*  Um, in this world, like you have a lifelong companion, especially like
*  people that do a podcast for many, many years.
*  I'm like, we've been, you've gone through all the ups and
*  downs of life together with a creator, with a, with a podcast or with anything.
*  It's cool.
*  I don't know.
*  It's a cool, it's, it makes it, um, it's surprisingly intimate, a one way
*  friendships, maybe for an intro, I don't know.
*  There's, there's, there's some negatives that people definitely describe the
*  word that gets used a lot as parasocial.
*  You think you, you like the viewer will think that the streamer or the
*  YouTuber knows them or owes them something or has some, they have a
*  bigger connection than they do.
*  But you know what, actually, cause I had to interrupt, I have to look,
*  maybe you can explain to me.
*  I've heard this term parasocial a lot.
*  I'm meaning to look it up.
*  Might as well look it up while in live.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Sure.
*  Sure.
*  Parasocial interaction, PSI refers, is this a new term?
*  Cause I have just started listening, hearing it like the last.
*  Yeah, I think it's year.
*  Parasocial interaction, PSI refers to a kind of psychological relationship
*  experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performance
*  in the mass media, particularly on television and on online platforms.
*  Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends, despite
*  having no or limited interaction with, oh shit, that's a term for a thing I've
*  been referring to interesting.
*  The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard Wall in 1956.
*  Wow.
*  When there was like very limited media, huh?
*  Well, I guess TV and radio stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Parasocial interaction and exposure that gamers interested in persona become
*  a parasocial relationship after repeated exposure to the media.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  What's the downside, bro?
*  What's what's okay.
*  Oh, well I can tell you the downside.
*  The downside is, is people thinking they're in relationships with
*  streamers and stalking them.
*  That's the stalking part, but the relationship is like, I mean, okay.
*  You mean like actual relationship, like, like waking up and saying, how are
*  you doing like in your head to them?
*  Yeah, no, but that might be an extension more like, yeah, getting mad.
*  They don't respond to you in.
*  Anytime you're in the stream or that convincing yourself, the other person
*  wants you and you need to go to them.
*  So you need to find where they are.
*  Like this has happened.
*  Some of the biggest female streamers have reported that they get stalked
*  and harassed for months and that's born out of this.
*  This on a very small scale is you come into a stream every so often and give
*  an update about your academic career.
*  That's not so bad.
*  I was going to mention I've streamed on Twitch for years and I watched people
*  have kids like people will come in over the course of months and say, Hey man,
*  you know, I just finished, I just took the bar exam.
*  Yo man, like I'm having my first kid and that's crazy.
*  That's, that's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  But if they do it in a healthy way, that's one thing, but I, there's
*  always going to be downsides, but most of it is beautiful, man.
*  I have, I have a very, I have, I guess, parasocial relationships of people
*  that take it a little too far, but it's all love.
*  You also have a fundamental belief and hope in people to be good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I, I've been, you know, I haven't gotten in trouble with it yet.
*  That's, that's good.
*  You know, me too.
*  I've interacted with plenty of people in person and no one's been negative.
*  So, yes.
*  And I've even gone to a war zone.
*  Uh, there, there's no, there hasn't been, uh, people have been very, I don't know.
*  Uh, people have only surprised me in the positive direction in the depth of the,
*  the capacity they have for compassion.
*  Uh, do we, okay.
*  So now we're in this weird place with the cheating.
*  Can I ask you a question about how it's possible to cheat?
*  Like if you and I, you know, the conversation you're going to have with
*  Magnus, we're going to have, we're going to play chess if we're, we're trying to
*  figure out how can you beat them?
*  What are the different ways do you think over the board chess?
*  What are the ways you cheat?
*  Yeah.
*  That's where I lose the thread because I don't know.
*  That's what I immediately went to is like the engineering challenge of cheating.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's because that's like how you're good at that.
*  I mean, you're not good at creating cheating in over the board situation.
*  I'm just saying you, your brain works differently.
*  I just choose to not even like, I can't entertain that.
*  I can come up with some bullshit, but it's not going to be anywhere.
*  Oh, your mind is not like immediately attracted to pulling at that thread of
*  like, how would you fuck with the system?
*  Yeah.
*  My mind stops at, huh, that would have to be a really sophisticated thing.
*  And that's it.
*  It doesn't go any further.
*  My brain every day thinks about the best way to compartmentalize chess into a
*  digestible format and put it out into content.
*  Chess on the board.
*  Chess, not cheating.
*  Yeah.
*  I just think about the YouTube.
*  I just think about that.
*  That's currently where my mind is fully focused.
*  I'm also working on like a book.
*  So that's what you think.
*  Yes.
*  For me, because I've built chess engines that without understanding chess much
*  as like, you know, as anyone does who's interested in AI, you build all kinds of
*  systems that do all kinds of stuff.
*  And chess is just an easy game.
*  Like it starts with Othello goes up to chess and go, there's, it's just a great
*  benchmark, a great place to explore different AI algorithms from search to
*  machine learning and so on.
*  But to me, cheating is like, it's, it's a similar kind of ideas.
*  Well, if I make it a board instead of eight by eight to 10 by 10, I
*  caught us to change things.
*  And with cheating, it's almost like expanding the engineering challenge of
*  chess out into the real world to me.
*  Okay.
*  So just allow me, I know cheating is horrible and everything.
*  But stockfish AI engine and human working together in interesting ways.
*  It forgets us just machine and human working together to expand the
*  capability of the human is really fascinating.
*  And that's like a beautiful thing to me.
*  Um, of course, the purely for the chess game, it ruins the game.
*  Yeah.
*  But I just like thinking of how AI can interact with the human.
*  Uh, in, in ways that doesn't, that it's frictionless, like, uh, you know, like
*  neural link brain computer interfaces, dream of directly connecting the
*  human brain to AI system.
*  The problem in this case is I don't think the human and the AI are interacting
*  together.
*  The AI dominates the human is just the mechanism that makes the moves.
*  I actually played, if I may, I don't, maybe I need your advice on this.
*  I thought, and I told myself I won't do it.
*  And then a friend of mine said, uh, and, uh, a couple of friends and both of them
*  are previous guests in this podcast.
*  So I definitely need to do it, which is, um, you know, connect.
*  So I already have for the chess arm that I built, um, this computer vision on
*  the chess board is able to, to, uh, extract from vision.
*  The way you do optical character recognition, extract the board.
*  So I was going to just build that cheating system to demonstrate it with
*  the reason I thought it was interesting.
*  So something we didn't mention is, I don't know who started this rumor, but
*  the rumor started there.
*  It might've been like anal beads that I don't know who started this, but I do
*  know that Elon magnified it.
*  My username was dead center in that thing that he retweeted.
*  It was like, I don't know.
*  My username was dead center in that thing that he retweeted, which was hilarious to me.
*  Uh, you're using, uh, what do you mean?
*  He retweeted the clip, but also the copy pasta, like the paragraph that was like,
*  uh, describing the whole anal beads theory and dead center in the middle of
*  that paragraph is as Gotham chess says.
*  And the worst part about it was I was literally tagged.
*  So it was as user slash Gotham chess says.
*  So every time that paragraph gets posted on Reddit, I get tagged.
*  Getting posted a lot.
*  So yes, but yes, he tweeted.
*  And then there's also the funny thing, which I really love the, the
*  weirdest, most entertaining thing.
*  Uh, was that part of the same thing where, uh, like a plot twist Magnus has been
*  using anal bees this whole time.
*  That's how you got.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Uh, I love that so much.
*  Okay.
*  But anyway, uh, there's a, I quickly realized that there is, I have to admit
*  that I know not much about sex toys.
*  And then I quickly realized that there's a lot of sex toys that Bluetooth
*  capability that you can interact with.
*  So you could, it's very easy to connect stockfish to a sex toys.
*  Actually.
*  Actually.
*  Yeah.
*  So, uh, apparently that's a popular thing.
*  Like a lot of sex toys are Bluetooth enabled so you can communicate with them.
*  So this is actually pretty trivial to do, uh, not trivial, but, but then, and then
*  in fact, there is a, um, there's several libraries.
*  One of them is really active called.
*  Now this is on GitHub friends.
*  It's in rust, but I think there's Python wrappers.
*  It's called butt plug is the name of the library, um, that communicates
*  with it, it supports a bunch of different devices, uh, a bunch of different,
*  like vibrators and all that kind of stuff.
*  But then I looked at the kind of vibrators that supports and they're all like
*  creepy looking, I mean, like it doesn't.
*  It doesn't have, um, I don't know.
*  It felt too dirty, you know, like there's a line I was like, uh, I know.
*  Is this not gonna cause the reason I like that kind of stuff is I like the joke of
*  it that ultimately is somehow educational.
*  Cause to me, I really care about AI and this is a cool little project to do.
*  It's pretty easy to share.
*  Um, yeah, but I was thinking about doing it.
*  I was thinking about doing it at first.
*  I said, no, it's just kind of feels dirty.
*  But then the, the aforementioned, uh, friend said, no, you should definitely do it.
*  Um, I like the huge, who's your test subject?
*  No, we wouldn't test it.
*  I'm sure that people would sign up, right?
*  I just went on the table, like show the vibration.
*  Like, like you're basically converting, uh, now it's not, I'm not obviously a
*  grandmaster, so you have to say everything.
*  I feel like, no, you don't.
*  You could say the square.
*  You don't have to say the piece.
*  The human will fill in the gap.
*  No, a good human chess player.
*  I can't.
*  Oh, that's what I, that's the point I wanted to make is like, for me, I would
*  like to know the actual move I need to make.
*  Yeah.
*  So I need the full information, right?
*  So I have to convert the Bishop C five, whatever, to more, uh, to Morse code,
*  which is a lot of my patient.
*  I, that yes, exactly.
*  Uh, but it still works.
*  It's, it's hilarious and fun.
*  So I was thinking about doing it, but, uh, because it's pretty easy to do.
*  Um, it would be just like a fun exercise.
*  I love a mix of technical rigor and humor.
*  Well, this is the perfect project for that.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  This was born, I think, out of a user comment in a Twitch stream.
*  So I thought it was born on Reddit, this theory, but I think, uh, Eric Hansen
*  was streaming, uh, Chessbra and someone in his chat made that joke and he read
*  it out loud.
*  That was the first time it was read out loud and then somebody clipped it and it
*  became international news.
*  Like, I don't have you followed how big the traction got on this anal
*  beads thing.
*  No, it was covered by every major news network, late night talk show, Trevor
*  Noah, Stephen Colbert, international news, international news in countries like
*  China, where I would have never thought that they would report about anal beads.
*  Yeah.
*  Did they, what was the tonality of it?
*  Was it seen as a joke or did they say there's a cheating scandal?
*  I think to mention anal beads, literally anal beads, like just saying,
*  just accused, accused denies, denies cheating with anal beads, which he never
*  did.
*  He never denied cheating with anal beads.
*  It was a joke internet theory.
*  If I was him, I would lean into it.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't imagine, man.
*  Like that's, I don't, I don't know what the right thing for him to do is, but
*  it's, you're not touching this one.
*  I, I, I've talked about it.
*  I don't say the words anal beads in my YouTube videos, but I'll say beads.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I'll, uh, okay.
*  The thing is, do you think I should do the code thing?
*  Is it like a tutorial?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it would be hilarious if you find a way to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You can show that it is possible to theoretically vibrate via Bluetooth.
*  Chest moves.
*  And if someone shoves it up their ass, what it was another joke.
*  Okay.
*  They offered you to play naked.
*  They're going to make you spread your cheeks.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't understand why naked solved the problem.
*  I think there's, it doesn't have to be naked.
*  I don't think naked is enough.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, okay.
*  Some questions from Reddit.
*  Ask him, ask Levy if he deep down hates his audience.
*  I saw that.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw, I saw that was the top one.
*  I have a, I have a love hate relationship with the chest sub Reddit.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's why some of those questions were going to be tough.
*  I have a love hate relationship.
*  Do you think that's a tough question or is that come from a place of love?
*  Uh, very, very tough to say.
*  Very tough to say.
*  Uh, love and hate, like they're basically next door neighbors on Reddit.
*  I feel like they oscillate very quickly between each other.
*  Yes.
*  So Reddit chest specifically, I think is mostly folks who are
*  around before the chest boom.
*  So the chest sub Reddit.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So a lot of them have been around for five years, seven years, 10 years, even more.
*  And I think the average age on Reddit is lower than the average age on the chest sub Reddit.
*  I think that the chest sub Reddit is beyond the age of 20, maybe even 25.
*  Like a lot of folks there are ancient, ancient people.
*  And they're basically 20s.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, not 15 or 16, uh, anarchy chess is younger.
*  So anarchy chess is basically chess memes.
*  That's a sub Reddit.
*  Yes.
*  You got it.
*  Yeah.
*  Anarchy chess is great.
*  A lot of stupid memes on there.
*  Do they like you or, or no, or is it love hate?
*  They did until my crypto sponsorship, um, which is a separate convo that I'm
*  more than happy to have.
*  Uh, but, uh, yeah.
*  So my relationship with the Reddit chess sub Reddit is tough because my content on
*  YouTube stops at a certain point with them.
*  They can't learn from me because I'm tailoring to 95% of my audience, which
*  is about 16, 1700 and below.
*  And I have a lot of content where I jokingly make fun of low rated players.
*  And everyone's in on it and we all have fun.
*  And I laugh at myself a ton, laugh at, as you can even see in this conversation.
*  I, but just like you mentioned in with, with clips and out of context things,
*  folks have already formed the perception of my personality.
*  There's nothing I can do to win them back.
*  And I think the dominant percentage of the loudest group of folks on the chess
*  sub Reddit, they just, they have a certain perception of me.
*  It's not going to change.
*  And you add something like cryptocurrency sponsorship, which people on Reddit,
*  just in general are relatively negative on the subject is going to start, you
*  know, snowballing more and more.
*  So if you ever look up a thread of, should I buy a Gotham course?
*  And it's on Reddit chess.
*  It's going to say no, everyone's calling it a scam overpriced.
*  Interesting.
*  I got, I heard a lot of really positive stuff.
*  I don't know where on Reddit in general.
*  About me?
*  Yeah.
*  You might've, you might've been looking for it.
*  You might've not been looking for, for negative things.
*  And I was looking for like best educators online, like that kind of stuff.
*  I don't, I'll be, it might've not been read at chess.
*  I'll be totally honest with you.
*  If you ever go there and look for something like best recaps or best
*  educational content for intermediates, I'm not mentioned.
*  I might not be mentioned because I'm already expected to be on the list.
*  So they just kind of want to generally shout out smaller creators.
*  Totally fine with that.
*  And I'm not even going on this whole explanation because I want to
*  win folks back is just sort of the reality of the situation.
*  A lot of my stuff is really clickbaity and I'm playing the YouTube game.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't want that.
*  Do you ever feel like a limit or tension between your creativity and the YouTube
*  algorithm, like, do you feel like it has negative effects on it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to cover more in depth stuff in a 30 minute video that I
*  think is super useful to people.
*  It's only going to get 60,000 views.
*  And you feel, why is that a bad thing?
*  Is it good?
*  Is it good to mix it up?
*  Yes, it's good to mix it up, but I make a video a day.
*  I make one bad video.
*  The other videos suffer.
*  And then if I make two videos that underperform, the rest of the
*  videos don't get pushed out as much.
*  Your earnings can go down 40% day to day, which doesn't happen in other careers.
*  And if I ever want to supplement, if I ever want to make a very instructional
*  video, I try to do it in a very fun way.
*  So something like eight of Magnus Carlsen's best end games, you can still learn a ton.
*  But the concept of the video is going to be different.
*  Like I try to still teach things, but in more interesting and exciting ways.
*  Like the guy who was scammed for a million dollars, Alexei Shirov, who
*  has basically promised the world championship.
*  If he won his match, he won his match.
*  He didn't get a world championship.
*  So there's still stuff in there you can learn and you can, my goal is just, you
*  click on the video, you learn something and you enjoy yourself.
*  That's it.
*  Get people to click on it by any means necessary.
*  But once they're there, have quality stuff they can learn.
*  And yeah, I mean, I wish, so I have zero of those pressures, but I also really,
*  really, uh, like I turn off views and all that kind of stuff.
*  I don't pay attention to any of that.
*  Uh, but I wish YouTube would like.
*  The algorithm would include how good the video is like beneficial for people's
*  long-term wellbeing in the calculation.
*  Yeah.
*  I actually really hate the fact that they turned off dislikes.
*  Yeah, I didn't get that at all because like, and now I don't know the
*  difference between like for tutorials specifically, like, I don't know what's
*  a good chess video or not, or what's a good review or not.
*  I mean, it emphasizes following certain people more than like, if you trust the
*  creator, but like, man, um, I really don't know what's a good video or not essentially.
*  And then you have to trust more the title and then the click baiting this comes
*  in and it's, it's no good.
*  You have to use your own gut instinct as opposed to data.
*  Sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  There's videos that have almost no views that are still great.
*  Incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of the, some of the best ones, some people who are just
*  focused on like the quality.
*  Yeah.
*  And don't want to play the game or don't even know how to play it.
*  And they don't really want to play the game of the YouTube algorithm.
*  Yeah, it sucks.
*  It sucks, especially given how dominant YouTube is in, um, in defining the sort
*  of the creative energy of our whole civilization, the youth, not just just,
*  not just just, uh, when you're going to chess box against Eric Rosen, this
*  is a question from Reddit chess box.
*  You, uh, you said your hands are all messed up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you training for something or regular?
*  Like, so I also just remembered we never talked about Hikaru so I can talk about
*  Rosen and Hikaru in the same chess boxing.
*  Oh, is this your McGregor like shit talk segment?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Uh, Eric Rosen is actually a close friend of mine.
*  I probably have five of those.
*  And he just so happens to be, uh, not just the chess streamer, but we, we,
*  we talked about buying homes.
*  We've talked about, he's stayed at my place.
*  He took my wedding photos.
*  I flew him to New York and paid for all his stuff just so he could hang out with
*  my wife and I, and, you know, take some six AM photos in the sun, uh, in the park.
*  So, oh, he looks familiar.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's, uh, yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
*  Now in terms of chess boxing, I'm not sure if you're a chess player, but I
*  you know, in terms of chess boxing, chess boxing is this really fascinating sport
*  where you have boxing, but you also have chess and you have rounds.
*  So you start a chess game with a clock.
*  That segment itself lasts for a couple of minutes.
*  They put the board away and pause the clock, whatever the
*  time situation is, then you box for a minute.
*  And that keeps going on.
*  I don't know how it works in terms of the time expiring, meaning in
*  fighting there's judges that just tell you how the fight was going, right?
*  I don't know who wins and how like do you win but you can win by knockout you can win by checkmate or their clock
*  Can run out on the chessboard, but is there judges who is there a round limit?
*  Does this just go on and on and on and on?
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I thought it's like 12 rounds right isn't this a thing in in Russia
*  it's a big thing in the UK UK UK, I don't know why and
*  There's a lot of youtuber events just for boxing so
*  Youtubers just learn to box and then they just box no chess
*  They just straight up box each other like Jake Paul for example you ever gonna get Jake Paul in here
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure okay. I'm sure feel like we just so many different guests have been mentioned
*  Jake Jake Paul would be it would be a fun guess, but he's obviously the biggest scale right? He's legitimately boxing people
*  he's not yeah, but check a chess players is never gonna learn to box to that level and all of us are starting basically from zero and
*  Lot of would talk to me behind the scenes say hey, how would you feel about being in a chess boxing match? I?
*  Said okay. Yeah, maybe when is it gonna be said five months from now? I've always wanted to train combat
*  I've weight lifted. I've done cardio. I've played a lot of your UFC fan, too
*  Yeah, but you admire fighting. Yeah, I would enjoy it. I just have a really bad lower back and
*  That makes a lot of different combat difficult
*  But I said you know what screw this I'm going to contact a few local gyms
*  Yeah, and one of them the guy emailing me back and forth had actually watched my YouTube videos
*  So he was the first to respond and he said yeah like come in do a couple classes like see how you feel
*  So first I did conditioning which killed me because fighting conditioning as you know it kills you
*  It's it's a completely different type of conditioning
*  But I felt good, and I really wanted to come back and since July I've been training three four days a week nice
*  Yeah, pretty good. I love it lower back feels good lower everything the whole body goes stronger
*  So you see what you're saying is you're gonna fuck up a car?
*  It's easy training. I'm not fighting so I talked to Eric about it
*  Yeah, and the truth is we're both concerned about head trauma. I haven't actually sparred
*  I like sparring shadow boxing, but I go there. I do personal training. I don't do a
*  Group class I'm not fighting. I'm fighting the bag. I'm doing shadow boxing my form is improving, but I haven't been punched
*  I got hit in the stomach. You know I get hit in the side with kicks
*  Nobody's punched me in the face yet
*  So I think we both were adequately concerned about that and there was not some ridiculous amount of money on the table
*  So we decided it's just not worth pursuing mm-hmm. How does the car come into the picture?
*  Well, he is a possible competitor people ask me all the time would you who would you fight would you yeah people are like?
*  Andrea both does with kick your ass. That's a tough one because I can't what am I gonna say?
*  I'm gonna fight a woman who I'm larger than and you know so I just have to take the L against
*  Anytime a woman is mentioned. That's fine. Like Owen's no winning that one right exactly
*  So I'm I've lost to both both says is Anna Rudolph Anna Kremlin. They're all chess creators like hypothetically
*  Yeah, I get a hypothetical fight. Yeah, okay
*  They've been training. I think yeah, Andrea has been training
*  That's because an event got announced this this event that I was hypothetically gonna be the main event against Eric Rosen
*  Yeah, it was got announced. Yeah, you kind of like thought like maybe let's not do this
*  No, I knew once I declined to fight Eric that I would not be participating and I even knew you know
*  I knew who was gonna be the main event because I was kind of offered both of those guys
*  So I'm on Hamilton is this still going on the chess boxing event will happen in December in Los Angeles
*  Yeah, nice. So who is the main event? It's a Mon Hamilton who's also chess bra
*  so they have a couple of guys as part of the chess bra channel and Lawrence Trent Lawrence Trent is a
*  International master from England. He's a
*  Think he's done some boxing a little bit. He's a commentator brash guy nice controversial guy. Yeah
*  It's funny cuz they started Lawrence put out some videos and I went damn I should have done this
*  Yeah, I think
*  But I mean you're right first of all, there's so many things to say one of which is
*  If you're if you want to take it seriously, you know, it does pull you in like, you know, if you train a lot
*  it's gonna affect the rest of your life and then and
*  Then there's it changes you I think taking combat sports seriously changes you in good and
*  There's negative cost to it. I think because it's a whole nother thing man
*  it's like a it's like doing a marathon running or something really pulls you in and the other thing is the
*  Is the head trauma like you have to take that kind of stuff seriously, especially if you're doing sparring and all that kind of stuff
*  Still some of the celebrities I don't know why but it's pretty exciting, right?
*  I don't know why it'd be fun to watch a car
*  Like there's something I always said if he car and Magnus did a boxing event and I was the co-main event against
*  I don't know who that would that be that be as Magnus said anything about it like a
*  Badu in chess box. Uh, well, first of all, he's gonna commentate the Ludwig event
*  Nice which he which he said he he kind of said
*  Oh, there's been people in the past that are my level in chess not mine his level in chess and
*  Have wanted to get physical with him. I think he's talking about Hikaru. It's it's I don't think anybody else's
*  That'd be that'd be a good one, man. That'd be a good one. I think Magnus. What do you think?
*  What is that one? I think Magnus is in
*  Better physical shape. He's also a little bit bigger. I think than Hikaru
*  Long reach I think he cars a dog though
*  I think I think he'll I don't think he's gonna he's gonna get out of there
*  Like I don't think he's gonna quit out in in the ring
*  I would think Hikaru just goes nuts in the beginning and burns himself out
*  So if Magnus can survive that I feel like Hikaru would just go crazy and then just get exhausted would not be able to pace
*  Himself correctly. Maybe chasing that first round knockout. Yeah. Yeah, just swing like crazy. Honestly, I just love to see that
*  Which is like the effect of physical exertion on the on the game I think it's sure they're strong enough to
*  Yes, but I think we definitely underestimate the effect of being punched maybe bleeding out of your nose or something like that
*  It's it's it's no joke. I can't I
*  Can't say I'm anticipating the first day. I actually do some sparring and get seriously hit because I
*  Know it's not gonna feel good even now I take a hard jab to the to the stomach or the ribs and I'm just like
*  this is this is rough, I mean I I had to do three minutes on heavy bag and
*  when I finished
*  My I had I had been like slacking on my form because my arms were tired and I hit with my fingers instead of my
*  Knuckles and my hands are like you can see the the red skin like completely pink meaty skin under
*  I didn't realize when I was hitting and only today it's the pain is unbearable. So I can't imagine head
*  It must be no, I mean it gets a different thing
*  I mean, of course your skin gets tougher everything is tougher
*  So you get used to it the head the head is a weird one because it's not gonna send you those kinds of signals
*  You're not gonna get this the skin type of signals
*  The brain is a weird thing because it doesn't hurt. Yeah
*  It just does the damage and the damage can materialize itself manifest itself only years later, yeah, it's a weird one
*  But then we all die
*  There's that Braveheart speech
*  I got to ask you about boss because to me it's a super interesting and you've played a lot of boss at different levels
*  You have a video called the advanced chess bots are terrifying
*  So what's the difference between playing humans and bots?
*  Like you mentioned this Nelson bought yeah, it brings this Queen out I think rated
*  1600 or 1400. Okay, so like there's a style to those
*  What what's the difference between the way bots play and the way humans play a lot of people?
*  Prefer playing bots because they have anxiety playing other humans. It's a very legitimate thing
*  Interesting a lot of beginners. They don't like live chess. They get nervous
*  Yellow anxiety you get close to your highest ever rating you panic happens to me too. Yeah happens to me even now
*  So they play bots there's somehow more reliable or something. Yeah, they're I don't know but that's it's a big thing
*  It's a big thing and the popularity of that video shows that people enjoy watching you play chess bots. So
*  I'm gonna demystify this this might be shocking
*  Those bots are all the same but for the most part
*  You could just program a bot to make mistakes at a certain moment
*  you could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves and
*  It's gotten sophisticated enough that you can basically program it to play at whatever more or less level
*  That a human plays at you say I'll play it at 1800 level. So it's programmed to throw in mistakes
*  The problem is and this is why it's all beginners to not play bots
*  Because bots are programmed in the following way
*  Beginner bots are like literal toddlers. They have no understanding whatsoever
*  They will literally lose all their pieces
*  But they won't lose all their pieces and make mistakes the way beginners do beginners actually know how to start a game
*  They just struggle
*  The first eight moves nine moves
*  Their mistakes are very different than Bob Bob plays completely outlandish types of mistakes that you cannot pick up in terms of a pattern
*  Standpoint because no actual humans play like that. They just move their queen to the opposite side of the board for no reason
*  You can take it. Yeah, it's not even a blunder. It's almost like randomness
*  it's completely random and this problem extends further because
*  Advanced bots will play an opening completely reasonably and they just hang a rook
*  Which okay, maybe happens, but that's not exactly how you get to 1800 at 1800
*  That's a very strong level of the game. You know your openings very well
*  You start navigating the middle game based on already things that you remember
*  And then basically one side chooses a bad plan and the other side chooses a better plan and one thing leads to another
*  Nobody just recreationally hangs all their pieces
*  She's the way bots are kind of programmed to play but some of those bots in that video were I remember playing them and
*  They were they were nuts. They were out calculating me every time
*  I thought I had a trick in two three second moment of thought
*  It would just play the best move and sometimes that also happens it gets into a dead loop
*  Where it just starts bulldozing you and it can't stop so it made its mistakes already
*  Yeah, it's programmed to make only a few and then it just bulldozes you the rest of the way. I mean, that's that's why I
*  played with stockfish a bunch
*  So I got I
*  Built for myself a bunch of different chess experiments recently I had to do with the chess playing bots
*  but I also built the infinite chess board where was stockfish was playing like an infinite number of chess games and
*  One of the parameters that was interesting to play with is how long it gets to think about a move
*  And how that affects the rating of the thing. I did that a little bit. So it's that that's a tricky one
*  I'm sure people know how to do that
*  Well, but it's true. It's not trivial to understand like what there must be a good formula for it
*  But it's also interesting to think about like a controlled number of blunders. Mm-hmm
*  But it's probably better
*  The controlled number of blunders is not a good way to build a bot
*  Yeah, it's yeah for training purposes at least the time the time per move is probably better
*  but the craziest thing is I did that a couple of my of my devs were helping me with the build like a
*  I'm scaling my courses into a better chess learning platform essentially
*  We've done a lot of different experiments with stockfish, which I'm even happy to get into here
*  and
*  stockfish making moves in point one millisecond plays better than a human which is
*  Disgusting and disturbing frankly because that's crazy
*  like you can't react to a car stopping in front of you anywhere near that fast and
*  Yeah, so the reason I was interested in that is because when you have a very large chessboard you have
*  Tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of game going on at the same time you have to
*  Like think of the minimum amount of thinking per move that you can allow for and it does it does it's damn good
*  At least to my eye basically at the lowest possible setting you can give it. So yeah, it's incredible
*  It's incredible about three what to do now. It's
*  As far as I know is primarily machine learning based stockfish so stockfish move to machine learning
*  Completely. It's not doing search
*  As far as I know yeah, this is where you you lose me a bit
*  But the move discovery and evaluation is what's been changing in the way starfish works
*  So it's discovering of moves and then the way it looks forward and then evaluates positions that has changed but
*  Matthew Sadler who wrote the book game changer about Alpha Zero
*  Yeah that that he explains it significantly better, but that's the way I think it works
*  What did that make you feel when you first saw Alpha Zero play? I was excited. I didn't have any any sort of
*  Existential thoughts I enjoyed watching it completely destroy openings that people thought were good
*  and it
*  That experiment though has does have some caveat in the sense that I
*  Think Alpha Zero was playing with a full tank of servers and I think stockfish wasn't which I think is what one of the things
*  People point out they they weren't playing since then they were able to demonstrate much less. Yeah
*  But also Alpha Zero stopped developing
*  They stopped developing it. Yes
*  Which sucks, but again from their perspective from deep mass perspective. It's like alright
*  Well, we took on this really tricky game. There's something honestly incredible they won
*  Not just one I mean they did it without any human supervision so like without any training on human expert games
*  so only through self play which I
*  Mean that's what learning is about. It's like it's what you think of as a child a human child a toddler learning from
*  you know somewhat nothing and
*  Becoming a capable human that's that's what we think of when we think about intelligence
*  So the fact that it's able to play itself and become the best player in the world that at the game of go
*  And all kinds of games is just incredible and obviously that inspired the modern stockfish
*  Yeah, now to do the same all the same kind of self play methods
*  Somebody on reddit asked a pretty interesting question
*  I don't know if you have an interesting answer to it. What makes a chess move quote-unquote human as
*  You are someone oh, this is to me
*  But it's mentioning you in third person as you are someone working in AI this idea of human this would seem incredibly interesting
*  Yes, sir
*  It is especially since most cheat detection relies on human this as a way to detect cheaters
*  I think since children being born right now will have the advantage of engine training their whole life
*  They will start to see the game the way an engine does will a person be considered a cheater if they play like an engine
*  There also seem to be a discrepancy especially with levy about who can play what appears to be a non-human move
*  He often says things like quote if you were a normal player
*  Normal in quotes if you were a normal player, I would think you were cheating but since it's Magnus I
*  Don't doubt Magnus is great, but if human this is our benchmark
*  What is the elo rating where your moves can start to look like an engine without critique?
*  There's a bunch of questions in there. They combine two of my quotes. Yes into one
*  So one thing that I like to say is sometimes in a chess game moves look or an opening looks so ridiculous
*  That if a viewer played it I would make fun of them or slap them. That's always the job
*  I was your chess coach. I smack you but
*  When Magnus plays it was oh wow, you know, it's a very different so they mixed up this quote with another quote which is
*  You know if if I if
*  I'll be explaining something and I'll say oh and here the engine says you should play like this
*  Yeah, if one of your opponents plays like this report them for cheating. They say they fuse two quotes
*  They said oh human can't play like that
*  Because it's an engine move but because Magnus is playing so they they mixed kind of two things but there's interesting
*  levels of humor and
*  Insight there on both of those. Yeah, the difference between human move and engine and like what an engine move is is
*  I think two things number one a computer move is
*  Outlandish in its in its concept and its
*  And its idea so the best example that I can give of that is if you gave a hundred grandmasters a position and
*  Told them, you know, what do you think the best move here is for black? Not in this position right here
*  We have nothing but an overwhelming amount of them would look at the position evaluate everything
*  They know about the game of chess, which is relatively similar
*  but obviously
*  slightly imbalanced based on their skill level and they would come up with a sample size of two or three moves and
*  Incomes the computer with a fucking haymaker and suddenly everybody goes
*  Oh everything we know about chess has gone out the window
*  So they all start looking at that move and they know it's the best move. So now they start adding the evidence behind
*  The verdict as opposed to getting to the verdict while first looking at the evidence
*  So the concept of it and the idea of it is so outlandish based on a certain type of position
*  That you can't fully grasp it
*  You have to continue to beg the engine to tell you what the variation is a move is only good if its extension is good
*  That's the way chess works
*  So it's like a move is good
*  It's because the computer has seen that the various branches of things going forward are also good
*  So you bring all that back and no human could have even conceptualized that initial thing
*  But the second thing about computer moves is they they look counterintuitive
*  so
*  that's a
*  if you might be in a position where it looks like the demands of the position are
*  ABC and then the computer is like nope, it's not because I've seen the future way more than you possibly could have and I don't
*  have emotions
*  so like
*  Dumb moves and brilliant moves can look similar
*  yes, and oftentimes do and this is actually back to the Hans thing a lot of people now dissecting these games they're playing and
*  There are they're basically say like even Fabiano Caruana one of the best players in the world was on some
*  On his podcast yesterday basically saying okay. This is beyond my level
*  Out of my league. Yeah, what's that? What's out of your league? You played for the World Championship kind of we get what we can read between
*  The lines right? It's it's impossible that Hans is that level of genius. Is there like different?
*  Different kinds of genius
*  Like where one you could be out of each other's league kind of thing
*  Maybe in the case of Magnus its understanding of end games
*  It's just somehow he understands the that last phase of the game and the complexities and the problems he can pose better than anybody else
*  So you can see Magnus do
*  Poor looking moves in the end game
*  Or like moves that don't fit what seem your gut says is would be the optimal
*  Yes, but also
*  So it's not that you even think they're right you just might not even consider them
*  Because of over reliance on your own information or even the computer that was what was going on in game six
*  She kept doing things and kept playing and kept finding play and posing those questions that humans and computers could not understand
*  So he beat the engine basically
*  He could he wouldn't have beaten the engine because they would have defended
*  Yon lost that game in the 90s move psychologically. He thought the game was over so that contributed computer would have defended
*  So by the by the time this podcast comes out, which I don't know would be in a week or something like that
*  I feel like more will happen
*  Let's see you're predicting energy. How does this Hans drama end?
*  saga
*  Look, let's look in in three months by the time we get to the next World Championship. Let's say
*  what what
*  This what are the options? What are the possible? Let's imagine. Let's not say like what the probabilities are. What are the options?
*  Chess.com is forced to or agrees to or
*  Whatever to come up with a huge amount of evidence of cheating in the past
*  Or Hans comes out
*  What are the what can Hans do with this? So I'm uncomfortable with the general
*  Make sure you could maybe update me on this
*  But there was a little bit of an attack on him a lot of an attack that he's a cheater, right without evidence
*  Without evidence without clear conclusive evidence physical evidence
*  Physical evidence so all of those right? That's the tricky thing. Yeah, so like that stuff we're talking about is beyond my level
*  that starts being
*  kind of intuitive circumstantial evidence, there's
*  The statistical evidence behind the over-the-board games that he's played in 2020 2021
*  Where the games match what's called engine correlation?
*  more than
*  Magnus and many other top grandmasters combined
*  But that can be argued is because he was very strong and playing weaker opposition
*  So there's always kind of this argument against statistics, right? There's the fact that the guy who Magnus name dropped
*  Maxim Lugi Lugi is a chess grandmaster
*  And he's even been I think president of the US Chess Federation
*  I've played him in some blitz games. It turns out I wasn't even fully aware of the extent of this
*  He has been banned from chess.com for cheating for cheating
*  Have they actually have has him and Hans actually worked? Yes, so that was why he name dropped that right? That's also not good
*  You see where this is getting you still don't have the physical proof, but you have
*  smoke
*  So, I don't know how this ends. I don't know if this if if
*  He denies it to the death and he ends up filing some sort of legal action some sort of ethics complaint
*  Or he admits everything I
*  Don't know boy
*  Well, no matter what I hope despite chess or not that he's mentally strong enough for whatever is to come
*  That's what I keep saying because I have to fire right? Yeah, I can't I can't imagine right?
*  Like I just I really can't imagine and maybe well, we just have too much compassion, but I don't think so
*  I really just feel like at the end of the day chess is just a game
*  but it is a game played by millions of people throughout history and
*  Nations have basically fought wars over the chessboard
*  So like there's there's a lot it's like Olympics Olympics is just a little
*  I just dude running and so on the hockey is just the thing with with a puck and but you know
*  It's it's also much more than that it's also
*  Nations
*  Sort of figuring out their conflict in a way that doesn't involve violence
*  As a serious thing and it's the thing that inspires
*  Millions of people and it's testing ground for intelligence systems that eventually
*  Take over human civilization, you know
*  Yeah, I mean the bots bots are really interesting
*  I don't know if there's other lessons like you you you played a clone of yourself
*  You watched stockfish versus stockfish
*  your video
*  People should check out each other. You have a lot of awesome videos your video title stockfish versus stockfish
*  I that was the experiment. I made them play each other
*  So I made them listen. What did you learn from that experiment? I
*  Enjoyed first of all, they will always make a draw
*  So engines don't get to play each other from a beginning position because they will always draw
*  Especially if they're the same engine so stackfish 15 stockfish 15. I don't think one side will ever beat the other basically
*  But if you program them to play a certain opening position according to chess theory
*  You get to see interesting ways into how they evaluate one of the things one of the ways that it played against the London opening was
*  absurd
*  Like it just it was completely ridiculous black sacrifice two pawns as early as move six, which is a borderline completely lost position
*  and then both sides foresaw that the only way white was gonna be able to use those that material advantage was to give it back and
*  Stabilize their own position like black just got a crazy attack
*  Jesus this is crazy. Yeah, but they drew them in the end of drawing. So I I'm also gonna make them play against each other in
*  Either bad openings or like some of the most popular gambits
*  Looking looking at something like that and the way I'm gonna do this is basically say
*  Which chess gambits are the best and the way I'm gonna do that is
*  Theoretically the engine should be able to beat the gambit because a gambit is very rarely blessed by the computer
*  So if the computer cannot beat that gambit, that means it's good
*  That means it's not losing if it's a completely lost gambit it will beat it
*  But if it draws despite getting that early disadvantage
*  Then that means the gambit is very reliable and you can play it. So that's a good way to
*  Evaluate opening games. Yeah
*  What's what's the best? What's your favorite opening?
*  Or what openings do you like there was an opening that
*  Got me back into chess when I was 15
*  Got me back into chess when I was 15
*  I had quit for like three years and I went to my friend's house and he had a book
*  by Lars Skandorf a Danish Grandmaster called the Karl Kahn defense, which is
*  C6 do you want white to do one black? Do you want to show them the opening? This is the opening
*  That's a Karl Kahn defense. So you play before I play C6. I have I have to play black. That's it
*  Yeah, and we develop from here. I put my
*  What counts as an opening? Okay
*  But the development does the development matter? Yeah, so from here the development goes into the variations of the Karl Kahn
*  So this is the Karl Kahn like you can be in a city, but then you can be in neighborhoods. That's a very non-dramatic
*  Okay. Yeah
*  Two pawns in the center. So that's called the Breyer variation. So which what's a good thing for me to two squares
*  Yeah, if you can put two pawns in the center, yeah, you should and then that's a good thing
*  Yes, and then I will go here and now you have to decide what you're gonna do with
*  Your center pawn you can push take or defend it and
*  Push take or defend right? Yeah, what would you suggest?
*  Take is the worst take is just stable. So we just trade but pushing is considered the best
*  Advancing and taking my space away from me
*  So I think alpha zero or stockfish would probably always push push and now there's something called like
*  The main line or the sideline main line is what's the most popular played at all levels which is moving the bishop here
*  I've played this a lot but for beginners this is an intermediate players
*  This is why I love this opening so much on move three black already has a plus score
*  which is
*  Crazy, it's not supposed to happen and there's this very tricky
*  second most popular move which is undermining your center trying to get you to take my free pawn but
*  Destabilize and leave both of them kind of hanging and
*  Is that why the the plus score is because you're susceptible to the de-stabilization? Yes, because
*  People at 99% of the rating ladder do not understand how to deal with what's coming. Basically, they don't know how to deal with a
*  structural attack
*  So would with stockfish try to defend the pawn here and keep no it would take the pawn and tell you to go fuck yourself
*  Oh
*  Because I am 3,400 right I would take the pawn and be like I win it back and
*  even if you did you would suffer it would make you win it back in the most annoying way would make you tie your
*  shoes together and
*  Block so I like as stockfish I would take yes
*  That's the best move but not at 99% of the rating ladder, which is funny
*  interesting
*  But you like to play this I play this against GM's I play both I move my bishop
*  What are the different ways it evolves like then the rest doesn't matter. So this is just like a pawn structure thing
*  Yeah, and I mean it deeper most openings
*  It's anywhere from like two moves to like 10 moves kind of thing
*  Yeah
*  You can be out of theory very very quickly to move to move free like basically on your own you have a general idea
*  But you don't remember games
*  I mean I know Karo Khan games from start to finish because I've played it since 2011
*  So, you know all the different branches that goes without doubt. Yeah, I think I know every opening in chess basically
*  I think most most title players know every opening but we don't know we can't play it competitively because we would be but
*  What are some of the weirder openings that?
*  Like slightly suboptimal but might be explored
*  Like Magnus might play them just to fuck with the opponent
*  He played something recently actually against this German prodigy Vincent Keimer
*  which was a
*  specific move order in a very popular opening
*  So it was basically position had been reached thousands of times but the move order Magnus chose with white
*  Was played maybe point oh five percent of the time
*  Which is crazy thousands of games and it's supposed to be not good
*  Meaning it allows black to equalize because that's what black is going for
*  Not winning the game but equalizing because you go second
*  Magnus says I don't care about equalizing. I just want a position. I don't want my opponent to know the answers to the test
*  And that's so interesting. Yeah, too. Cuz also fucks you psychologically
*  Yeah, throws you off and just always keep you on your toes
*  He's in a weird position, but he also has the advantage of being able to intimidate. Mm-hmm. I wonder how many people
*  How much is that a role of it like being scared of the other person it's usual
*  I think I think some of the top guys would deny it but
*  You know when you're in the seventh hour and you're playing Magnus
*  It's a very different feeling than some of the other when Magnus is messing around in the opening
*  It's very different
*  When Magnus is messing around in the opening, it's very different than another person messing around in the opening. You just kind of like
*  Expect to for something to be there
*  We'll see if it translates to poker for him
*  But I think he got he gets a little bit maybe less respect in the poker world in the chess world
*  He sort of he gets a lot of respect. I just talked to Daniel Nagrano
*  He just gets the only person that doesn't respect Magnus Carlson
*  Honestly, either in chess or poker is Magnus Carlson
*  That's true, but like Magnus is hilarious
*  I mean when he talks about his rating is like it's pretty good when he talks about how good he's this poker I suck
*  But you know, I think that self-critical view that he I think he honestly believes
*  to a degree is
*  It's probably part of the the engine that fuels him to get better and better and better and better
*  Yeah, but what I'm saying is if you if you're face-to-face with Magnus at a chessboard
*  It's not the same as being in a nine-handed poker table with him
*  You kind of keep an eye on him maybe and then he's a mysterious guy
*  But just different because you're like this is the man
*  Yeah, there's very few people. Yeah, so in in poker they talk about Phil Ivy that way. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's like this super intimidating. I think that's that's
*  It's probably harder to intimidate in poker
*  Actually, I don't know I don't know there's something intimidating about
*  Like excellence in a deterministic game that's just terrifying like
*  You're fucked. I mean, it's like playing stockfish like
*  You're fucked. This thing will suffocate you and
*  Especially when you do makes moves that you don't understand
*  This I to me the most beautiful thing. Honestly is the sacrifices that the the engines do
*  Just the it's such a fuck you. Yep, like I could sacrifice people
*  I could sacrifice pieces and I'll get them back and I'll get them back more and I could look even I don't even have
*  To get them back. Your position is so bad. I gave you full material and there's nothing you can do about it
*  Yeah, that's terrifying. Yeah, that's terrifying. That's like and that transfers to AI systems in general like
*  Like a system that plays weak just to fool you
*  For people who are trying to get better chess beginners or at any stage of their development
*  What advice would you give about getting better?
*  Except watch you of course watch my videos check out chesley.com. That's where I'm gonna scale the courses to
*  But no on a serious note you have to be prepared to lose way more than win
*  My mom gave me advice when I was
*  Maybe 13 or 14 and I just discovered that I I liked girls
*  She said you're gonna get a lot more nos in life than yeses
*  That even happened with with my wife. Actually our whole journey is quite quite fascinating
*  It's paved with rejection get paved with yes various
*  Ghost things over the course of years, but we got married and we love each other very much. So I
*  Said it's a it's a it's a wonderful tale, but it's the it's the same in chess
*  You're gonna lose a lot and you have to be for adults and noticed kids and adults learn chess very differently kids
*  Yell out in class and they're very excited and they don't realize how many times they get something wrong
*  Adults never want to talk during lessons because they're afraid of being wrong
*  Adults will preface correct answers with this is probably wrong
*  But like shut up you're paying for a for a private lesson
*  This is the place to be wrong
*  You know, so adults especially think that being dominant in a career
*  Where they've dedicated a lot of their brain power a lot of their work ethic and a lot of their study time
*  It's gonna translate to chess they do it to keep their own kids
*  They helicopter their own kids because they try to apply a lot of the same stuff
*  Chess studying chess is different than studying anything else anything else
*  Which seem could be argued for martial arts, I guess but yeah 100%
*  you have to have a beginner's mind and what that actually means is
*  sucking in every aspect of the game and and
*  Studying all the interesting ways in which you suck and
*  You will realize you get better without actually trying to get better. I show up to the boxing gym one day
*  I move my hips better. Yeah, and my I would do shadow boxing sensei goes you moving your feet better today
*  You got better
*  I'm like I didn't practice footwork. It's just your brain just starts putting it all together randomly
*  You might study a shitload and still lose a hundred points if you're gonna study chess own for fuck's sake
*  This is the only activity where people go in going how much do I have to work to be a grandmaster?
*  Nowhere else in my life. Have I ever seen someone try to pick up a hobby and want to be the top ranking level only in chess
*  You're right. But like for example
*  I'll see people come to a gym and basically ask like how long before I can get into the UFC, right?
*  But you see champion is different. I mean, no grandmaster is equivalent to getting into the UFC
*  I guess yeah, so but people quickly realize when like the 110-pound girl taps them out over and over and they're
*  200 pounds and they're like, oh my god, I'm gonna be a champion
*  Yes, yeah, so but people quickly realize when like the 110-pound girl taps them out over and over and they're a 230-pound like
*  Ripped dude they realize like okay. This is an art. This is a journey. Yeah, I think if you resist
*  The lessons that failure teaches you that's when you know girls like just relax
*  One of the things you have to learn probably applies to chess too is to know how to relax your body your mind
*  and just like
*  there's something about just like you said like
*  If you don't resist if you relax
*  Then your body your mind will learn the way of this game. Mm-hmm
*  And probably add to that is just put a lot of hours in of having fun
*  but then then I on that perpetual chess pockets
*  I listen to somebody that say like it doesn't like puzzles
*  What matters is the number of hours you spend kind of suffering
*  meaning like thinking deeply like count like like
*  straining like thinking with your mind like really working hard, so
*  And then you know, you have the Magnus who says no what matters is the number of hours you spend having fun
*  Yeah, it's a mix. It's a mix. He's right. I don't quite agree with suffering, but I think people do a lot of fake learning
*  they play speed games they
*  Just go through tactics. So okay. I have to do 20 tactics. Okay boop wrong next one
*  I used to tell my students you need to do
*  Ten puzzles and you need to get 100% correct. I don't care how long it takes
*  So I suppose that kind of is like the suffering theory
*  But if you do 30 puzzles and you get eight, correct
*  What even is that that's?
*  It's a laughable and the correct amount of you know, it was 29% I don't know but 26%
*  It's you can't do that
*  You have to get things right and that's the only way you're actually requires like thinking deeply like really struggling
*  Okay, especially if you're doing the puzzles at the level that that's your level. I've
*  Done the puzzle for an hour before because I was so stubborn. Yeah, I didn't want to just put in a wrong answer
*  Yeah, the the guy was listening to said like that's good
*  You should maybe for me and the same with blindfold chess I have to say like my blindfold skills
*  I never practice. I just I can visualize the board quite well. I've played
*  At most I've played four games blindfolded at the same time that sucks
*  That just feels horrible in the brain afterward, but like I can play four simultaneous games
*  Blindfolded. Yeah, what's that take to do that? I don't know and I get asked that all the time. How do I practice?
*  Why the fuck
*  Party trick it is. Yes. I it is the video of Magnus doing it in Columbus Circle on YouTube has like
*  I don't know how many views I did it live with an announcer
*  I can't imagine how chaotic that was but he yeah, it's a great party trick. Yeah
*  Oh, there is a reddit thing. I
*  Forgot to ask Magnus that they asked me to ask him because they moved the wrong piece. Yes
*  And then somehow he remembered I don't know how that happened. I have to tell you I I
*  Was I kind of presumed that he figured out?
*  From the way the other person was moving that they moved the wrong piece. Yeah. Yeah, I forgot that
*  Let me remember me sucks
*  You said
*  You know ups and downs in your childhood a little rough sometimes
*  Also, you get attacked by the beautiful wonderful people on the internet sure so sometimes it's difficult what's
*  What's been the lowest point that you ever gone to in your mind?
*  in
*  My career in my life in your life in your career and everything your mind. So have you ever been depressed?
*  For sure. Yes. How how did you like if you can remember moments? How did you overcome that?
*  Well, I I will share two anecdotes one when I was
*  May 2012 so I was 16 and a half and
*  I
*  was living in
*  a household situation
*  where I
*  Thought
*  Nobody knew what was going on basically without sharing obviously extremely personal details like what was going on except me and
*  I confided in my grandmother. I
*  Was
*  Imagine living in a house where you basically feel like a prisoner. You don't want to interact with anybody in the house
*  You don't know how you're supposed to bring these things up
*  Of course, this sounds extremely vague and I just don't I don't feel like exposing all of my entire family drama to the audience
*  but I live this way for
*  probably something like
*  Eight months, I don't know something ridiculous. It was the junior year of high school
*  So I was supposed to take my SATs
*  That was the year I was supposed to finish up my portfolio for college
*  Because you're only get really a few months of senior year to start applying it was a fuck
*  it was a nightmare a complete nightmare and I
*  Don't know how I got through it time went by I
*  Listened to sad music and tried to spend as little time as home as possible
*  I would pretend to fall asleep at my friend's houses so that my mom was like you coming for dinner
*  And I would just pretend to be asleep. It was just a grind
*  Yeah, yeah, it was it was a grind. I don't remember a whole lot from from that period just sort of
*  finding what made me happy and
*  Trying to focus on it and I was a teenager in the house. I wasn't gonna run away
*  I still had a roof over my head. So I'm not not saying I had a
*  Better or worse than others. I just had a different and actually recently this is much more on my memory
*  I
*  More or less tore up a very happy life my wife and I had and I've talked about this in bursts on stream
*  but essentially what happened was
*  We we had just been living in
*  It's actually funny the way we got into this apartment was was also very bad
*  But we were living in just a very like nice little apartment
*  Like high-rise apartment safe and the reason we moved into a high-rise was because we had lived in a house for two weeks that
*  Got broken into
*  Not because of who I am
*  But because we suspect we had people moving in mattresses and they went oh shit. These two people live here. That's it
*  And basically there was three apartments my upstairs neighbor let in somebody that they didn't expect
*  And the guy cracked our door open with a crowbar. Thank God. That was the first day in two years. My wife went to work
*  Did they know did they not know I don't know everything happens for a reason
*  So we got hurt. Hmm. Nobody got hurt. Yeah, they stole did they stole in them some couple of important things, but nobody was hurt
*  And cops did nothing
*  so you
*  Moved into high-rise in New York
*  Yeah in New York for safety and we're away from things and we have our own nice little nook and
*  Somewhere some months into it. I started hearing noises from above our neighbors
*  and it started in the morning 7 a.m. It started in the afternoon and
*  I picked up on it and I expected it every day for weeks
*  Then it was driving me crazy and I was like, okay, we're gonna go have a civil conversation with who's ever up there sounds like kids
*  So we go knock lady gas lit the shit out of us. I've never been gas lit that hard in my life
*  She went noise what noise it's probably our other neighbor. Who's a boxer
*  Lady you have kids we can hear you through the vents. Are you talking to your kids?
*  Went to the front desk of the building. They did nothing went to the leasing office. They did nothing and basically over time
*  I just let this drive me nuts. It was
*  Back to the stubbornness thing. I I
*  Decided we were leaving we were going to live somewhere. There was no noise because we can't beat these people
*  there's there's nothing we can do right and
*  My wife I dragged her around to a bunch of different viewings. I was dead set. I was decided I was completely miserable and
*  We found a house to rent like a nice house family had just moved away house
*  standalone house not gonna have neighbors, but wife decided that
*  Wife decided we decided that the it's too big. It's too big for for bliss. So we're gonna get a dog
*  We always wanted an animal so we're gonna get a dog
*  So we get an absolute lunatic puppy who just doesn't let us sleep at all
*  This is on top of everything else of the mental health crisis that's going on and the day we are moving to this house. I
*  Realize I fuck up like I realized that this whole thing
*  Was in my head and I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave this could have all been avoided and
*  The guilt and resist I didn't want to exist like it's not that I it wasn't suicide
*  But you know the feeling of just you want to just observe yourself from a distance
*  Yeah, and I couldn't sleep. I thought my wife was gonna leave me like this is the way and that's what anxiety does
*  it also takes everything you feel to an absolute dread and
*  That I experienced
*  For a good chunk of two weeks and then we kind of settled down and decided like we're gonna live you tell her about it
*  Like we able to talk through it. Yeah. Yeah, I
*  Yeah, this you know the levels of madness that could be inside your mind
*  I don't know if she'll ever know but I tried to tell her that and
*  Glimpses. Yes, I'm not sure you'll ever know I got at the point
*  Yeah, I try to that's why I try to keep busy
*  But that was that was the darkest that got and yet through all of that
*  I went on stream every day and made YouTube videos every day like I
*  Understood that I had a job to do and and I did it and I talked about it here and there
*  but that was that was the worst that ever got because
*  I'm
*  learning that the emotions I experience are guilt remorse and
*  Your brain just goes in circles basically about things that you've done or haven't done. It's funny because noise
*  Can do that. So no, the noise was real but it was building in your head. Yeah
*  So I tried to actually
*  It's kind of funny because I like to focus deeply and I'll have like sources of noise
*  I've tried to teach myself over time. I'll go to like coffee shops and stuff to like I
*  Like I almost try to put myself next to annoying situations. So I get like trained
*  Really? Maybe I should do that. But it's a certain point at the same time
*  I've gotten to hang out with certain people especially in LA. They're like in the middle of nowhere
*  Like a Malibu or something and it's like that quiet
*  Can you hear your ears ringing it's so quiet basically, yeah, and it's like holy shit
*  This is a good place. This is a good way if you want to write something or create something
*  This is like super quiet. So my mom does my mom's a science journalist science author
*  She just published her first her first book actually on poop of all things. Yeah fecal
*  The waste management is actually very fascinating concept and look through history and she would do that
*  She goes to complete solitude
*  And she writes, yeah, it's beautiful no sirens. I mean, New York is the opposite of that. So, you know, it's you've brought it
*  You brought on yourself
*  I've lived there for 20 years
*  It has it been tough like going on stream to put on the face of happiness through that. Yeah
*  Yes, but I find my ways to
*  Have moments where I can talk about it
*  If it's on a stream I don't get 10,000 live viewers. So it's very different
*  It's if I stream late night, I get a 1500 2000 viewers
*  I used to care a lot more about viewers on on on stream, but I've basically invested fully in YouTube
*  So that's kind of the way and I think I don't know maybe you can correct me, but I think people appreciate
*  The the human being behind the chess
*  Streamer I think so. I think so
*  I think a lot of people are interested in the way that I think about it
*  I think so. I think a lot of people
*  not in the chess world, but
*  Just a lot of people they put on a persona and just in general social media is the highlights of your life
*  Or the low lies just as long as they're dramatic
*  But I've tried I tried to be very open and honest when i'm tired. I'm tired. It's what makes my
*  Recaps of my tournaments. I think so real
