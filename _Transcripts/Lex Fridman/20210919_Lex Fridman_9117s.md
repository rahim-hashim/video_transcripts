# Jay McClelland: Neural Networks and the Emergence of Cognition | Lex Fridman Podcast #222
**Lex Fridman:** [September 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui38ZzTymDY)
*  The following is a conversation with Jay McClelland, a cognitive scientist at Stanford
*  and one of the seminal figures in the history of artificial intelligence, and specifically neural
*  networks, having written the parallel distributed processing book with David Rommelhart, who co-authored
*  the backpropagation paper with Jeff Hinton. In their collaborations, they've paved the way for
*  many of the ideas at the center of the neural network-based machine learning revolution of the
*  past 15 years. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. This
*  is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Jay McClelland.
*  You are one of the seminal figures in the history of neural networks. At the intersection of
*  cognitive psychology and computer science, what to you has over the decades emerged as the most
*  beautiful aspect about neural networks, both artificial and biological?
*  The fundamental thing I think about with neural networks is how they allow us to link
*  biology with the mysteries of thought. When I was first entering the field myself
*  in the late 60s, early 70s, cognitive psychology had just become a field. There was a book published
*  in 67 called Cognitive Psychology, and the author said that the study of the nervous system was
*  only of peripheral interest. It wasn't going to tell us anything about the mind.
*  I didn't agree with that. I always felt, oh, look, I'm a physical being. From dust to dust,
*  ashes to ashes, and somehow I emerged from that.
*  That's really interesting. There was a sense with cognitive psychology that
*  in understanding the neuronal structure of things, you're not going to be able to
*  understand the mind. Then your sense is if we study these neural networks, we might be able to
*  get at least very close to understanding the fundamentals of the human mind.
*  Yeah. I used to think or I used to talk about the idea of awakening from the Cartesian dream.
*  Descartes thought about these things. He was walking in the gardens of Versailles one day,
*  and he stepped on a stone, and a statue moved. He walked a little further, he stepped on another
*  stone, and another statue moved. Why did the statue move when I stepped on the stone? He
*  went and talked to the gardeners, and he found out that they had a hydraulic system that allowed
*  the physical contact with the stone to cause water to flow in various directions, which caused water
*  to flow into the statue and move the statue. He used this as the beginnings of a theory about how
*  animals act. He had this notion that these little fibers that people had identified that weren't
*  carrying the blood were these little hydraulic tubes that if you touch something, there would
*  be pressure, and it would send a signal of pressure to the other parts of the system,
*  and that would cause action. He had a mechanistic theory of animal behavior,
*  and he thought that the human had this animal body, but that some divine something else had to have
*  come down and been placed in him to give him the ability to think. The physical world includes the
*  body and action, but it doesn't include thought according to Descartes. The study of physiology
*  at that time was the study of sensory systems and motor systems and things that you could
*  directly measure when you stimulated neurons and stuff like that.
*  The study of cognition was something that was tied in with abstract computer algorithms and
*  things like that, but when I was an undergraduate, I learned about the physiological mechanisms.
*  When I'm studying cognitive psychology as a first-year PhD student, I'm saying,
*  wait a minute, the whole thing is biological.
*  You had that intuition right away. That seemed obvious to you.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that magical though that from just a little bit of biology can emerge
*  the full beauty of the human experience? Why is that so obvious to you?
*  Well, obvious and not obvious at the same time. I think about Darwin in this context too, because
*  Darwin knew very early on that none of the ideas that anybody had ever offered
*  gave him a sense of understanding how evolution could have worked,
*  but he wanted to figure out how it could have worked. That was his goal. He spent a lot of time
*  working on this idea and reading about things that gave him hints and thinking they were
*  interesting but not knowing why, and drawing more and more pictures of different birds that
*  differ slightly from each other and so on. Then he figured it out, but after he figured it out,
*  he had nightmares about it. He would dream about the complexity of the eye and the arguments that
*  people had given about how ridiculous it was to imagine that that could have ever emerged from
*  some sort of unguided process, that it hadn't been the product of design. He didn't publish
*  for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own ideas. He didn't think they could
*  probably possibly be true. By the time the 20th century rolls around, we understand that,
*  many people understand or believe that evolution produced the entire range of animals that there
*  are. Descartes' idea starts to seem a little wonky after a while. Like, well, wait a minute,
*  there's the apes and the chimpanzees and the bonobos and they're pretty smart in some ways.
*  Oh, there's a certain part of the brain that's still different. There's no hippocampus and the
*  monkey brain is only in the human brain. Huxley had to do a surgery in front of many,
*  many people in the late 19th century to show to them that there's actually a hippocampus
*  in the chimpanzee's brain. Their continuity of the species is another element that contributes
*  to this idea that we are ourselves a total product of nature. That, to me, is the magic
*  and the mystery how nature could actually give rise to organisms that have the capabilities that
*  we have. So it's interesting because even the idea of evolution is hard for me to keep all
*  together in my mind. So because we think of a human time scale, it's hard to imagine that
*  the development of the human eye would give me nightmares too, because you have to think across
*  many, many, many generations. And it's very tempting to think about a growth of a complicated object
*  and it's like, how is it possible for that such a thing to be built? Because also,
*  me from a robotics engineering perspective, it's very hard to build these systems.
*  How can, through an undirected process, can a complex thing be designed? It seems wrong.
*  So that's absolutely right. And a slightly different career path that would have been
*  equally interesting to me would have been to actually study the process of embryological
*  development flowing on into brain development and the exquisite laying down of pathways and so on
*  that occurs in the brain. And I know the slightest bit about that. It's not my field, but
*  there are fascinating aspects to this process that eventually result in the complexity of
*  various brains. At least one thing in the field I think people have felt for a long time,
*  and in the study of vision, the continuity between humans and non-human animals has been
*  second nature for a lot longer. I had this conversation with somebody who's a vision
*  scientist and he was saying, oh, we don't have any problem with this, the monkey's visual system and
*  the human visual system, extremely similar up to certain levels, of course, they diverge after a
*  while, but the visual pathway from the eye to the brain and the first few layers of cortex,
*  or cortical areas, I guess one would say, are extremely similar.
*  Yeah, so on the cognition side is where the leap seems to happen with humans.
*  It does seem more kind of special. And that's a really interesting question when thinking about
*  alien life or if there's other intelligent alien civilizations out there is how special is this
*  leap? So one special thing seems to be the origin of life itself. However you define that, there's
*  a gray area. And the other leap, this is very biased perspective of a human, is the origin of
*  intelligence. And again, from an engineer perspective, it's a difficult question to ask,
*  an important one is how difficult does that leap, how special were humans? Did a monolith come down,
*  did aliens bring down a monolith and some apes had to touch a monolith?
*  It's a lot like Descartes' idea, right? Exactly. But it just seems one heck of a
*  leap to get to this level of intelligence. Yeah. And so Chomsky argued,
*  that some genetic fluke occurred 100,000 years ago. And just happened that some
*  hominin predecessor of current humans had this one genetic tweak that resulted in language.
*  And language then provided this special thing that separates us from all other animals.
*  I think there's a lot of truth to the value and importance of language,
*  but I think it comes along with the evolution of a lot of other related things related to
*  sociality and mutual engagement with others and establishment of, I don't know, rich mechanisms for
*  organizing and understanding of the world, which language then plugs into.
*  Right. So language is a tool that allows you to do this kind of collective intelligence.
*  And whatever is at the core of the thing that allows for this collective intelligence is the
*  main thing. And it's interesting to think about that one fluke, one mutation could lead to the
*  opening of the door to human intelligence. Like all it takes is one. Evolution just kind of opens
*  the door a little bit and then time and selection takes care of the rest.
*  You know, there's so many fascinating aspects to these kinds of things. So
*  we think of evolution as continuous, right? We think, oh yes, okay, over 500 million years,
*  there could have been this relatively continuous changes. But that's not what
*  anthropologists, evolutionary biologists found from the fossil record. They found
*  hundreds of millions of years of stasis. And then they found the
*  changes. And then suddenly a change occurs. Well, suddenly on that scale is a million years or
*  something, or even 10 million years. But the concept of punctuated equilibrium was a very
*  important concept in evolutionary biology. And that also feels somehow right about
*  the stages of our mental abilities. We seem to have a certain kind of mindset at a certain age.
*  And then at another age, we look at that four-year-old and say, oh my God, how could
*  they have thought that way? So Piaget was known for this kind of stage theory of child development.
*  You look at it closely and suddenly those stages are so discrete and transitions. But the
*  difference between the four-year-old and the seven-year-old is profound. And that's another
*  thing that's always interested me is how something happens over the course of several years of
*  experience where at some point we reach the point where something like an insight or a
*  transition or a new stage of development occurs. And these kinds of things can be understood
*  in complex systems research. And so evolutionary biology, developmental biology,
*  cognitive development are all things that have been approached in this kind of way.
*  Just like you said, I find both fascinating those early years of human life, but also the early
*  minutes, days of embryonic development to how from embryos you get the brain. That development,
*  again from an engineer perspective, is fascinating. So when you deploy the brain
*  to the human world and it gets to explore that world and learn, that's fascinating.
*  But just like the assembly of the mechanism that is capable of learning, that's amazing. The stuff
*  they're doing with brain organoids where you can build many brains and study that
*  self-assembly of a mechanism from the DNA material, that's like what the heck?
*  You have literally biological programs that just generate a system, this mushy thing
*  that's able to be robust and learn in a very unpredictable world and learn seemingly arbitrary
*  things or a very large number of things that enable survival. Yeah. Ultimately,
*  that is a very important part of the whole process of understanding this sort of
*  emergence of mind from brain kind of thing. And the whole thing seems to be pretty continuous.
*  So let me step back to Neural Networks for another brief minute. You wrote parallel
*  distributed processing books that explored ideas of neural networks in the 1980s together with
*  a few folks, but the books you wrote with David Rommelhart, who is the first author
*  on the backpropagation paper, which you have hinted. So these are just some figures at the
*  time that were thinking about these big ideas. What are some memorable moments of discovery
*  and beautiful ideas from those early days? I'm going to start sort of with my own
*  sort of with my own process in the mid 70s and then into the late 70s when
*  I met Jeff Hinson and he came to San Diego and we were all together.
*  In my time in graduate schools, I've already described to you, I had this sort of feeling of,
*  okay, I'm really interested in human cognition, but this disembodied sort of way of thinking about
*  it that I'm getting from the current mode of thought about it isn't working fully for me.
*  And when I got my assistant professorship, I went to UCSD and that was in 1974.
*  Something amazing had just happened. Dave Rommelhart had written a book together with
*  another man named Don Norman and the book was called Explorations in Cognition. And it was
*  a series of chapters exploring interesting questions about cognition, but in a completely
*  sort of abstract, non-biological kind of way. And I'm saying, gee, this is amazing. I'm coming
*  to this community where people can get together and feel like they've collectively exploring
*  ideas. And it was a book that had a lot of, I don't know, lightness to it. And Don Norman,
*  who was the more senior figure to Rommelhart at that time, who led that project,
*  always created this spirit of playful exploration of ideas. And so I'm like, wow, this is great.
*  But I was also still trying to get from the neurons to the cognition. And I realized at one
*  point, I got this opportunity to go to a conference where I heard a talk by a man named Don Norman,
*  James Anderson, who was an engineer, but by then a professor in a psychology department,
*  who had used linear algebra to create neural network models of perception and categorization
*  and memory. And it just blew me out of the water that one could create a model
*  that was simulating neurons, not just kind of engaged in a stepwise algorithmic process
*  that was construed abstractly, but it was simulating remembering and recalling and
*  recognizing the prior occurrence of a stimulus or something like that. So for me, this was
*  for me, this was a bridge between the mind and the brain. And I just like, and I,
*  I remember I was walking across campus one day in 1977, and I almost felt like St. Paul on the
*  road to Damascus. I said to myself, you know, if I think about the mind in terms of a neural
*  network, it will help me answer the questions about the mind that I'm trying to answer.
*  And that really excited me. So I think that a lot of people were becoming excited about that. And
*  one of those people was Jim Anderson, who I had mentioned. Another one was Steve Grossberg, who
*  had been writing about neural networks since the 60s. And Jeff Hinton was yet another. And
*  his PhD dissertation showed up in an applicant pool to a postdoctoral training program that Dave
*  and Don, the two men I mentioned before, Rumelhart and Norman, were administering. And Rumelhart got
*  really excited about Hinton's PhD dissertation. And so Hinton was one of the first people who
*  came and joined this group of postdoctoral scholars that was funded by this wonderful
*  grant that they got. Another one who is also well-known in neural network circles is Paul
*  Smolenski. He was another one of that group. Anyway, Jeff and Jim Anderson organized a
*  conference at UCSD where we were. And it was called Parallel Models of Associative Memory,
*  and it brought all the people together who had been thinking about these kinds of ideas
*  in 1979 or 1980. And this began to really resonate with some of Rumelhart's own thinking,
*  some of his reasons for wanting something other than the kinds of computation he'd been doing so
*  far. So let me talk about Rumelhart now for a minute, with that context.
*  Well, let me also just pause because he said so many interesting things before we go to
*  Rumelhart. So first of all, for people who are not familiar, neural networks are at the core of the
*  machine learning, deep learning revolution of today. Jeffrey Hinton that we mentioned is one
*  of the figures that were important in the history like yourself in the development of
*  these neural networks, artificial neural networks that are then used for the machine learning
*  application. Like I mentioned, the back propagation paper is one of the optimization mechanisms by
*  which these networks can learn. And the word parallel is really interesting. So it's almost
*  like synonymous from a computational perspective how you thought at the time about neural networks,
*  that it's parallel computation. Would that be fair to say?
*  Well, yeah, the word parallel in this comes from the idea that each neuron is an independent
*  computational unit. It gathers data from other neurons, it integrates it in a certain way,
*  and then it produces a result. And it's a very simple little computational unit, but it's
*  autonomous in the sense that it does its thing. It's in a biological medium where it's getting
*  nutrients and various chemicals from that medium. But you can think of it as almost like a little
*  computer in and of itself. So the idea is that each our brains have, oh, look, a hundred or
*  hundreds, almost a billion of these little neurons, right? And they're all capable of
*  doing their work at the same time. So it's like, instead of just a single central processor that's
*  engaged in chug, chug one step after another, we have a billion of these little computational
*  units working at the same time. So the time that's
*  maybe you can comment, it seems to me, even still to me, quite a revolutionary way to think about
*  computation relative to the development of theoretical computer science alongside of that,
*  where it's very much like sequential computer. You're analyzing algorithms that are running on
*  a single computer. You're saying, wait a minute, why don't we take a really dumb, very simple
*  computer and just have a lot of them interconnected together and they're all operating in their own
*  little world and they're communicating with each other and thinking of computation that way. And
*  from that kind of computation, trying to understand how things like certain characteristics of the
*  human mind can emerge. That's quite a revolutionary way of thinking, I would say. Well, yes, I agree
*  with you. And there's still this sort of sense of not sort of knowing how we kind of get all the
*  way there, I think. And this very much remains at the core of the questions that everybody's asking
*  about the capabilities of deep learning and all these kinds of things. But if I could just play
*  this out a little bit, a convolutional neural network or a CNN, which many people may have heard
*  of, is a set of, you could think of it biologically as a set of collections of neurons. Each one had,
*  each collection has maybe 10,000 neurons in it, but there's many layers, right? Some of these things
*  are hundreds or even a thousand layers deep, but others are closer to the biological brain and maybe
*  they're like 20 layers deep or something like that. So we have, within each layer, we have
*  thousands of neurons or tens of thousands maybe. Well, in the brain, we probably have
*  millions in each layer, but we're getting sort of similar in a certain way, right?
*  And then we think, okay, at the bottom level, there's an array of things that are like the
*  photoreceptors in the eye. They respond to the amount of light of a certain wavelength at a
*  certain location on the pixel array. So that's like the biological eye. And then there's several
*  further stages going up, layers of these neuron-like units. And you go from that raw
*  input array of pixels to the classification, you've actually built a system that could do
*  the same kind of thing that you and I do when we open our eyes and we look around and we see
*  there's a cup, there's a cell phone, there's a water bottle, and these systems are doing that
*  now, right? So they are, in terms of the parallel idea that we were talking about before,
*  they are doing this massively parallel computation in the sense that each of the neurons in each of
*  those layers is thought of as computing its little bit of something about the input
*  simultaneously with all the other ones in the same layer. We get to the point of abstracting
*  that away and thinking, oh, it's just one whole vector that's being computed. One activation
*  pattern is computed in a single step and that abstraction is useful, but it's still that parallel
*  and distributed processing, right? Each one of these guys is just contributing a tiny bit
*  to that whole thing. And that's the excitement that you felt that from these simple things you
*  can emerge when you add these level of abstractions on it. You can start getting
*  all the beautiful things that we think about as cognition. And so, okay, so you have this
*  conference, I forgot the name already, but it's parallel and something associated with memory and
*  so on. Very exciting, technical and exciting title. And you started talking about Dave Romohart. So
*  who is this person that was so, you've spoken very highly of him. Can you tell me about him,
*  his ideas, his mind, who he was as a human being, as a scientist?
*  So Dave came from a little tiny town in western South Dakota. And his mother was the librarian
*  and his father was the editor of the newspaper. And I know one of his brothers pretty well.
*  They grew up, there were four brothers and they grew up together and their father encouraged them
*  to compete with each other a lot. They competed in sports and they competed in mind games,
*  I don't know, things like Sudoku and chess and various things like that. And Dave was
*  was a standout undergraduate. He went at a younger age than most people do to college
*  at the University of South Dakota and majored in mathematics. And I don't know how he got
*  interested in psychology, but he applied to the mathematical psychology program at Stanford and
*  was accepted as a PhD student to study mathematical psychology at Stanford. So mathematical psychology
*  is the use of mathematics to model mental processes.
*  So something that I think these days might be called cognitive modeling, that whole space.
*  Yeah, it's mathematical in the sense that you say, if this is true and that is true, then I can
*  derive that this should follow. And so you say, these are my stipulations about the fundamental
*  principles and this is my prediction about behavior. And it's all done with equations.
*  It's not done with a computer simulation. So you solve the equation and that tells you what the
*  probability that the subject will be correct on the seventh trial of the experiment is or something
*  like that. So it's a use of mathematics to descriptively characterize aspects of behavior.
*  And Stanford at that time was the place where there were several really, really strong mathematical
*  thinkers who were also connected with three or four others around the country who brought a lot
*  of really exciting ideas onto the table. And it was a very, very prestigious part of the field of
*  psychology at that time. So Rumelhart comes into this. He was a very strong student within that
*  program. And he got this job at this brand new university in San Diego in 1967, where he's one
*  of the first assistant professors in the Department of Psychology at UCSD. So I got there
*  in 74, seven years later. And Rumelhart at that time was still doing mathematical modeling,
*  but he had gotten interested in cognition. He'd gotten interested in understanding.
*  And understanding, I think, remains. What does it mean to understand anyway? It's an interesting,
*  sort of curious, like how would we know if we really understood something? But he was interested
*  in building machines that would hear a couple of sentences and have an insight about what was going
*  on. So for example, one of his favorite things at that time was,
*  Margie was sitting on the front step when she heard the familiar jingle of the good humor man.
*  She remembered her birthday money and ran into the house. What is Margie doing? Why?
*  Why? Well, there's a couple of ideas you could have, but the most natural one is that
*  the good humor man brings ice cream. She likes ice cream. She knows she needs money to buy ice
*  cream, so she's going to run into the house and get her money so she can buy herself an ice cream.
*  It's a huge amount of inference that has to happen to get those things to link up with each other.
*  And he was interested in how the hell that could happen. And he was trying to build
*  good old-fashioned AI style models of representation of language and content of
*  things like has money.
*  So like formal logic and knowledge basis, that kind of stuff. So he was integrating that with
*  his thinking about cognition. The mechanisms of cognition, how can they mechanistically be
*  applied to build these knowledge, to actually build something that looks like a web of knowledge and
*  thereby from there emerges something like understanding. Whatever the heck that is.
*  Yeah. This was something that they grappled with at the end of that book that I was describing,
*  Explorations in Cognition. But he was realizing that the paradigm of good old-fashioned AI wasn't
*  giving him the answers to these questions. By the way, that's called good old-fashioned AI now.
*  It wasn't called that at the time. Well, it was. It was beginning to be called that.
*  Because it was from the 60s.
*  Yeah. Yeah. By the late 70s, it was kind of old-fashioned and it hadn't really panned out.
*  People were beginning to recognize that. And Rumelhart was like, yeah, he's part of the
*  recognition that this wasn't all working. Anyway, so he started thinking in terms of
*  the idea that we needed systems that allowed us to integrate multiple simultaneous constraints
*  in a way that would be mutually influencing each other. So he wrote a paper that just really,
*  first time I read it, I thought, oh, well, yeah. But is this important? But after a while,
*  it just got under my skin. And it was called an interactive model of reading. And in this paper,
*  he laid out the idea that every aspect of our interpretation of what's coming off the page when
*  we read, at every level of analysis you can think of, actually depends on all the other levels of
*  analysis. So what are the actual pixels making up each letter? And what do those pixels signify
*  about which letters they are? And what do those letters tell us about what words are there?
*  And what do those words tell us about what ideas the author is trying to convey?
*  So he had this model where we have these little tiny
*  elements that represent each of the pixels of each of the letters and then other ones that
*  represent the line segments in them and other ones that represent the letters and other ones
*  that represent the words. And at that time, his idea was there's this set of experts.
*  There's an expert about how to construct a line out of pixels and another expert about
*  how which sets of lines go together to make which letters and another one about which letters go
*  together to make which words and another one about what the meanings of the words are and another one
*  about how the meanings fit together and things like that. And all these experts are looking at
*  this data and they're updating hypotheses at other levels. So the word expert can tell the
*  letter expert, oh, I think there should be a T there because I think there should be a word
*  the here. And the bottom up sort of feature to letter expert could say, I think there should be
*  a T there too. And if they agree, then you see a T, right? And so there's a top down bottom up
*  interactive process, but it's going on at all layers simultaneously. So everything can filter
*  all the way down from the top as well as all the way up from the bottom. And it's a completely
*  interactive bidirectional parallel distributed process.
*  That is somehow because of the abstractions is hierarchical. So like, yeah, so there's different
*  layers of responsibilities, different levels of responsibilities. First of all, it's fascinating
*  to think about it in this kind of mechanistic way. So not thinking purely from the structure of your
*  own network or something like in your own network, but thinking about these little little guys that
*  work on letters and then the letters come words and words become sentences. And that's a very
*  interesting hypothesis that from that kind of hierarchical structure can emerge understanding.
*  Yeah. So, but the thing is, though, I want to just sort of relate this to earlier part of the
*  conversation. When Romelhart was first thinking about it, there were these experts on the side,
*  one for the features and one for the letters and one for how the letters make the words and so on.
*  And they would each be working sort of evaluating various propositions about, you know,
*  is this combination of features here going to be one that looks like the letter T and so on.
*  And what he realized kind of after reading Hinton's dissertation and hearing about Jim Anderson's
*  linear algebra based neural network models that I was telling you about before was that he could
*  replace those experts with neuron like processing units, which just would have their connection
*  weights that would do this job. So what ended up happening was that Romelhart and I got together
*  and we created a model called the interactive activation model of letter perception, which is,
*  takes these little pixel level inputs, constructs line segment features, letters and words.
*  But now we built it out of a set of neuron like processing units that are just connected to each
*  other with connection weights. So the unit for the word time has a connection to the unit for the
*  letter T in the first position and the letter I in the second position, so on. And because these
*  connections are bidirectional, if you have prior knowledge that it might be the word time, that
*  starts to prime the letters and the features. And if you don't, then it has to start bottom up. But
*  the directionality just depends on where the information comes in first. And if you have
*  context together with features at the same time, they can convergently result in an emergent
*  perception. And that was the piece of work that we did together that sort of got us both completely
*  convinced that this neural network way of thinking was going to be able to actually address the
*  questions that we were interested in as cognitive psychology.
*  So the algorithmic side, the optimization side, those are all details. Like when you first start
*  the idea that you can get far with this kind of way of thinking, that in itself is a profound
*  idea. So do you like the term connectionism to describe this kind of set of ideas?
*  I think it's useful. It highlights the notion that the knowledge that the system exploits
*  is in the connections between the units. There isn't a separate dictionary. There's just the
*  connections between the units. So I already sort of laid that on the table with the connections
*  from the letter units to the unit for the word time. The unit for the word time isn't a unit
*  for the word time for any other reason than it's got the connections to the letters that make up
*  the word time. Those are the units on the input that excite it when it's excited that it in a
*  sense represents in the system that there's support for the hypothesis that the word time
*  is present in the input. But the word time isn't written anywhere inside the model. It's only
*  written there in the picture we drew of the model to say that's the unit for the word time.
*  Right. And if somebody wants to tell me, well, how do you spell that word? You have to use the
*  connections from that out to then get those letters, for example. That's such a counterintuitive idea
*  where humans want to think in this logic way. This idea of connectionism, it's weird. It's
*  weird that this is how it all works. Yeah. But let's go back to that CNN, right? That CNN,
*  with all those layers of neuron-like processing units that we were talking about before,
*  it's going to come out and say, this is a cat, that's a dog. But it has no idea why it said that.
*  It's just got all these connections between all these layers of neurons, like from the
*  very first layer to whatever these layers are. They just get numbered after a while because they
*  somehow further in you go, the more abstract the features are, but it's a graded and continuous
*  process of abstraction anyway. It goes from very local, very specific to much more global,
*  but it's still another pattern of activation over an array of units. Then at the output side,
*  it's a cat or it's a dog. When I open my eyes and say, oh, that's Lex or, oh, there's my own dog,
*  and I recognize my dog, which is a member of the same species as many other dogs, but I know this
*  one because of some slightly unique characteristics. I don't know how to describe what it is that makes
*  me know that I'm looking at Lex or at my particular dog, or even that I'm looking at
*  a particular brand of car. I could say a few words about it, but if I wrote you a paragraph
*  about the car, you would have trouble figuring out which car is he talking about. The idea that we
*  have propositional knowledge of what it is that allows us to recognize that this is an actual
*  instance of this particular natural kind has always been something that
*  never worked. You couldn't ever write down a set of propositions for visual recognition.
*  In that space, it's always seemed very natural that something more implicit,
*  you don't have access to what the details of the computation were in between, you just get the
*  result. That's the other part of connectionism. You don't read the contents of the connections.
*  The connections only cause outputs to occur based on inputs.
*  Yeah. For us, that final layer or some particular layer is very important, the one that tells us
*  it's our dog, or it's a cat or a dog. Each layer is probably equally as important in the grand scheme
*  of things. There's no reason why the cat versus dog is more important than the lower level
*  activations. It doesn't really matter. All of it is just this beautiful stacking on top of each other.
*  We humans live in this particular layer. For us, it's useful to survive, to use those
*  cat versus dog, predator versus prey, all those kinds of things. It's fascinating that it's all
*  continuous. But then you then ask the history of artificial intelligence, you ask, are we able to
*  introspect and convert the very things that allow us to tell the difference between cat and dog
*  into logic, into formal logic. That's been the dream. I would say that's still part of the dream
*  of Symbolic AI. I've recently talked to Doug Lennett, who created Psych, and that's a project
*  that lasted for many decades and still carries a sort of dream in it. We still don't know the
*  answer. It seems like connectionism is really powerful, but it also seems to be a very
*  powerful tool. It's a tool that's been around for a long time. It's been around for a long time.
*  Connectionism is really powerful, but it also seems like there's this building of knowledge.
*  And so how do you square those two? Do you think the connections can contain the depth of human
*  knowledge and the depth of what Dave Romelhart was thinking about of understanding?
*  Well, that remains the $64 question. With inflation, that number is higher.
*  Maybe it's a $64 billion question now. I think that from the emergent side, which I place myself
*  on... I used to sometimes tell people I was a radical, eliminative connectionist, because
*  I didn't want them to think that I wanted to build anything into the machine.
*  But I don't like the word eliminative anymore, because it makes it seem like
*  it's wrong to think that there is this emergent level of understanding. And
*  I disagree with that. I would call myself a radical emergentist connectionist rather than
*  eliminative connectionist, because I want to acknowledge that these higher level kinds of
*  aspects of our cognition are real, but they don't
*  exist as such. There was an example that Doug Hofstadter used to use that I thought was helpful
*  in this respect. Just the idea that we can think about sand dunes as entities
*  and talk about how many there are even.
*  But we also know that a sand dune is a very fluid thing. It's a pile of sand that is capable of
*  moving around under the wind and reforming itself in somewhat different ways. And if we think about
*  our thoughts as sand dunes, as being things that emerge from the surface of the earth,
*  sand dunes, as being things that emerge from just the way all the lower level elements work together
*  and are constrained by external forces, then we can say, yes, they exist as such, but they also,
*  we shouldn't treat them as completely monolithic entities that we can understand without
*  understanding all of the stuff that allows them to change in the ways that they do.
*  And that's where I think the connectionist feeds into the cognitive. It's like, okay,
*  so if the substrate is parallel distributed connectionist, then it doesn't mean that the
*  contents of thought isn't abstract and symbolic, but it's more fluid maybe
*  than is easier to capture with a set of logical expressions.
*  Yeah, that's a heck of a sort of thing to put at the top of our resume, radical,
*  emergentist, connectionist. So there is, just like you said, a beautiful dance between that,
*  between the machinery of intelligence, like the neural network side of it, and the stuff that
*  emerges. I mean, the stuff that emerges seems to be, I don't know what that is,
*  that it seems like maybe all of reality is emergent. What I think about, this is made most
*  distinctly rich to me when I look at cellular automata, look at game of life, that from very,
*  very simple things, very rich, complex things emerge that start looking very quickly like
*  organisms, that you forget how the actual thing operates. They start looking like they're moving
*  around, they're eating each other, some of them are generating offspring. You forget very quickly.
*  And it seems like maybe it's something about the human mind that wants to operate in some
*  layer of the emergent and forget about the mechanism of how that emerges happens.
*  So it just like you are in your radicalness, also it seems like unfair to eliminate the magic of
*  that emergent. Like eliminate the fact that that emergent is real.
*  Yeah, no, I agree. That's why I got rid of eliminative, right?
*  Yeah, because it seemed like that was trying to say that it's all completely like...
*  An illusion of some kind.
*  Well, who knows whether there aren't some illusory characteristics there.
*  And I think that philosophically, many people have confronted that possibility over time,
*  but it's still important to accept it as magic, right? So I think of Fellini in this context,
*  I think of others who have appreciated the role of magic, of actual trickery in creating illusions
*  that move us. And Plato was on to this too. It's like somehow or other these shadows
*  give rise to something much deeper than that. So we won't try to figure out what it is,
*  we'll just accept it as given that that occurs. But he was still onto the magic of it.
*  Yeah, yeah. We won't try to really, really, really deeply understand how it works.
*  We'll just enjoy the fact that it's kind of fun. Okay, but you worked closely with Dave
*  Ramahart. He passed away as a human being. What do you remember about him? Do you miss the guy?
*  Okay. Absolutely. He passed away 15-ish years ago now. And
*  his demise was actually one of the most poignant and
*  relevant tragedies relevant to our conversation. He started to undergo a progressive neurological
*  condition that isn't fully understood. That is to say his particular course isn't fully understood,
*  because brain scans weren't done at certain stages and no autopsy was done or anything like that.
*  The wishes of the family. So we don't know as much about his life, but we do know that he was
*  in a very difficult situation. And he was in a very difficult situation. And so he was in a very
*  difficult situation. And so we don't know how much of the underlying pathology was done.
*  We don't know how much of the underlying pathology was done or anything like that.
*  The wishes of the family. So we don't know as much about the underlying pathology as we might. But
*  I had begun to get interested in this neurological condition that might have been the very one that
*  was the most important. And so I was trying to find the right efforts to understand another
*  aspect of this mystery that we've been discussing while he was beginning to get progressively more
*  and more affected. So I'm going to talk about the disorder and not about Rummelhart for a second.
*  The disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators have chosen to call
*  a specific form of loss of mind related to meaning, semantic dementia. And it's progressive
*  in the sense that the patient loses the ability to appreciate the meaning of the experiences that
*  they have, either from touch, from sight, from sound, from language. I hear sounds,
*  but I don't know what they mean kind of thing. So as this illness progresses, it starts with
*  the patient being unable to differentiate similar breeds of dog or remember the lower frequency,
*  unfamiliar categories that they used to be able to remember. But as it progresses,
*  it becomes more and more striking and the patient loses the ability to recognize
*  things like pigs and goats and sheep and calls all middle-sized animals dogs and all
*  can't recognize rabbits and rodents anymore. They call all the little ones cats and they can't
*  recognize hippopotamuses and cows where they call them all horses. So there was this one patient who
*  went through this progression where at a certain point any four-legged animal, he would call it
*  either a horse or a dog or a cat. And if it was big, he would tend to call it a horse. If it was
*  small, he'd tend to call it a cat. Middle-sized ones, he called dogs. This is just a part of the
*  syndrome though. The patient loses the ability to relate concepts to each other. So my collaborator
*  in this work, Carolyn Patterson, developed a test called the pyramids and palm trees test.
*  So you give the patient a picture of pyramids and they have a choice, which goes with the pyramids,
*  palm trees or pine trees. And she showed that this wasn't just a matter of language because
*  the patient's loss of this ability shows up whether you present the material with words
*  or with pictures. The pictures, they can't put the pictures together with each other properly
*  anymore. They can't relate the pictures to the words either. They can't do word picture matching,
*  but they've lost the conceptual grounding from either modality of input. And so that's why it's
*  called semantic dementia. The very semantics is disintegrating. And we understand this in terms of
*  our idea that distributed representation, a pattern of activation represents the concepts,
*  really similar ones. As you degrade them, you lose the differences. So the difference between
*  the dog and the goat is no longer part of the pattern anymore. And since dog is really familiar,
*  that's the thing that remains. And we understand that in the way the models work and learn. But
*  Rummelhart underwent this condition. So on the one hand, it's a fascinating aspect of parallel
*  distributed processing to me. And it reveals this sort of texture of distributed representation
*  in a very nice way, I've always felt. But at the same time, it was extremely poignant because
*  this is exactly the condition that Rummelhart was undergoing. And there was a period of time when he
*  was this man who had been the most focused, goal-directed, competitive, thoughtful
*  person who was willing to work for years to solve a hard problem. He starts to disappear.
*  And there was a period of time when it was hard for any of us to really
*  appreciate that he was sort of in some sense not fully there anymore.
*  Do you know if he was able to introspect this, the solution of the understanding mind?
*  Was he able to look at himself and understand the fading mind?
*  We can contrast Hawking and Rummelhart in this way. And I like to do that to honor Rummelhart
*  because I think Rummelhart is sort of like the Hawking of cognitive science to me in some ways.
*  But both of them suffered from a degenerative condition. In Hawking's case, it affected the
*  motor system. In Rummelhart's case, it's affecting the semantics. And not just the pure object
*  semantics, but maybe the self-semantics as well. And we don't understand that.
*  Concepts broadly.
*  But I would say he didn't. And this was part of what from the outside was a profound tragedy.
*  But on the other hand, at some level, he sort of did because there was a period of time when
*  he finally realized that he had really become profoundly impaired. This was clearly a biological
*  condition. And it wasn't just like he was distracted that day or something like that.
*  So he retired from his professorship at Stanford. And he lived with his brother for a couple years.
*  And then he moved into a facility for people with cognitive impairments.
*  One that many elderly people end up in when they have cognitive impairments. And
*  I would spend time with him during that period. This was like in the late 90s, around 2000 even.
*  And we would go bowling. And he could still bowl. And I would go to the gym. And he would
*  go to the gym. After bowling, I took him to lunch. And I said, where would you like to go?
*  You want to go to Wendy's? And he said, nah. And I said, okay, well, where do you want to go?
*  And he just pointed. He's turned here. So he still had a certain amount of spatial cognition. And he
*  could get me to the restaurant. And then when we got to the restaurant, I said, what do you want
*  to order? And he couldn't come up with any of the words. But he knew where on the menu the thing was
*  that he wanted. So he couldn't say what it was. But he knew that that's what he wanted to eat.
*  It isn't monolithic at all. Our cognition is, first of all, graded in certain kinds of ways.
*  But also, multi-partite. There's many elements to it. And certain sort of
*  partial competencies still exist in the absence of other aspects of these competencies.
*  So this is what always fascinated me about what used to be called cognitive neuropsychology,
*  you know, the effects of brain damage on cognition. But in particular,
*  this gradual disintegration part. You know, I'm a big believer that the loss of
*  human being that you value is as powerful as, you know, first falling in love with that human being.
*  I think it's all a celebration of the human being. So the disintegration itself, too,
*  is a celebration in a way. Yeah. Yeah. But just to say something more about
*  the scientist and the back propagation idea that you mentioned. So in 1982,
*  Hinton had been there as a postdoc and organized that conference. He'd actually gone away and
*  gotten an assistant professorship. And then there was this opportunity to bring him back.
*  So Jeff Hinton was back on a sabbatical. In San Diego.
*  And Rumelhart and I had decided we wanted to do this, you know, we thought it was really exciting.
*  And the papers on the interactive activation model that I was telling you about had just been
*  published. And we both sort of saw huge potential for this work. And Jeff was there. And so the three
*  of us started a research group, which we called the PDP Research Group. And several other people
*  came. Francis Crick, who was at the Salk Institute, heard about it from Jeff.
*  Because Jeff was known among Brits to be brilliant and Francis was well connected with his British
*  friends. So Francis Crick came. It's a heck of a group of people. Wow. Okay. And several,
*  Paul Spolanski was one of the other postdocs. He was still there as a postdoc and a few other people.
*  But anyway, Jeff talked to us about learning and how we should think about
*  how, you know, learning occurs in a neural network. And he said, the problem
*  with the way you guys have been approaching this is that you've been looking for inspiration from
*  biology to tell you how, what the rules should be for how the synapses should change the strengths
*  of their connections, how the connections should form. He said, that's the wrong way to go about
*  it. What you should do is you should think in terms of how you can adjust connection weights
*  to solve a problem. So you define your problem and then you figure out how the adjustment of
*  the connection weights will solve the problem. And Rummelhart heard that and said to himself,
*  okay, so I'm going to start thinking about it that way. I'm going to
*  essentially imagine that I have some objective function, some goal of the computation. I want
*  my machine to correctly classify all of these images. And I can score that. I can measure how
*  well they're doing on each image. And I get some measure of error or loss. It's typically called
*  in deep learning. And I'm going to figure out how to adjust the connection weights so as to
*  minimize my loss or reduce the error. And that's called gradient descent.
*  And engineers were already familiar with the concept of gradient descent. And in fact,
*  there was an algorithm called the Delta Rule that had been invented by
*  a professor in the electrical engineering department at Stanford,
*  Bernie Widrow and a collaborator named Hoff. I never met him.
*  Anyway, so gradient descent in continuous neural networks with multiple neuron-like processing units
*  was already understood for a single layer of connection weights. We have some inputs
*  over a set of neurons. We want the output to produce a certain pattern. We can define the
*  difference between our target and what the neural network is producing. And we can figure out how
*  to change the connection weights to reduce that error. So what Rummelhart did was to generalize
*  that so as to be able to change the connections from earlier layers of units to the ones
*  at a hidden layer between the input and the output. And so he first called the algorithm
*  the generalized Delta Rule because it's just an extension of the gradient descent idea.
*  And interestingly enough, Hinton was thinking that this wasn't going to work very well.
*  So Hinton had his own alternative algorithm at the time based on the concept of the Bolson
*  Machine that he was pursuing. So the paper on the Bolson Machine came out in 1985.
*  But it turned out that BACProp worked better than the Bolson Machine learning algorithm.
*  So this generalized Delta algorithm ended up being called BACPropagation as you say.
*  Probably that name is opaque to me. What does that mean?
*  What it meant was that in order to figure out what the changes you needed to make to the
*  connections from the input to the hidden layer, you had to back propagate the error signals
*  from the output layer through the connections from the hidden layer to the output
*  to get the signals that would be the error signals for the hidden layer.
*  And that's how Rummelhart formulated it. It was like, well, we know what the error
*  signals are at the output layer. Let's see if we can get a signal at the hidden layer that tells
*  each hidden unit what its error signal is essentially. So it's back propagating through
*  the connections from the hidden to the output to get the signals to tell the hidden units how to
*  change their weights from the input. And that's why it's called BACProp.
*  Yeah. So it came from Hinton having introduced the concept of define your objective function,
*  figure out how to take the derivatives so that you can adjust the connections so that they make
*  progress towards your goal. So stop thinking about biology for a second and let's start to think
*  about optimization and computation a little bit more. So what about Jeff Hinton? You've gotten a
*  chance to work with him in that little... The set of people involved there is quite incredible. The
*  small set of people under the PDP flag, it's just given the amount of impact those ideas have had
*  over the years, it's kind of incredible to think about. But just like you said, like yourself,
*  Jeffrey Hinton is seen as one of the, not just like a seminal figure in AI, but just a brilliant
*  person. Just the horsepower of the mind is pretty high up there for him because he's just a great
*  thinker. So what kind of ideas have you learned from him? Have you influenced each other on,
*  have you debated over what stands out to you in the full space of ideas here at the intersection
*  of computation and cognition? Well, so Jeff has said many things to me that had a profound impact
*  on my thinking. And he's written several articles which were way ahead of their time.
*  He had two papers in 1981, just to give one example.
*  Yeah. One of which was essentially the idea of Transformers and another of which was a
*  early paper on semantic cognition, which inspired him and Rummelhart and me throughout the 80s and
*  still I think sort of grounds my own thinking about the semantic aspects of cognition.
*  He also, in a small paper that was never published that he wrote in 1977, before he actually arrived
*  at UCSD or maybe a couple of years even before that, I don't know, when he was a PhD student,
*  he described how a neural network could do recursive computation. And
*  it was a very clever idea that he's continued to explore over time, which was sort of the idea that
*  when you call a subroutine, you need to save the state that you had when you called it so you can
*  get back to where you were when you're finished with the subroutine. And the idea was that you
*  would save the state of the calling routine by making fast changes to connection weights.
*  And then when you finished with the subroutine call, those fast changes in the connection
*  weights would allow you to go back to where you had been before and reinstate the previous
*  context so that you could continue on with the top level of the computation.
*  Anyway, that was part of the idea. And I always thought, okay, that's really, you know, he just,
*  he had extremely creative ideas that were quite a lot ahead of his time and many of them in the
*  1970s and early 1980s. So another thing about Geoff Hinton's way of thinking, which has profoundly
*  influenced my effort to understand human mathematical cognition, is that he doesn't
*  write too many equations. And people tell stories like, oh, in the Hinton lab meetings,
*  you don't get up at the board and write equations like you do in everybody else's machine learning
*  lab. What you do is you draw a picture. And, you know, he explains aspects of the way deep learning
*  works by putting his hands together and showing you the shape of a ravine and using that as a
*  geometrical metaphor for what's happening as this gradient descent process. You're coming down the
*  wall of a ravine. If you take too big a jump, you're going to jump to the other side. And so
*  that's why we have to turn down the learning rate, for example. And it speaks to me of the
*  fundamentally intuitive character of deep insight together with a commitment to really understanding
*  in a way that's absolutely, ultimately explicit and clear, but also intuitive.
*  Yeah, there's certain people like that. Here's an example, some kind of weird mix of visual
*  and intuitive and all those kinds of things. Feynman is another example, different style of
*  thinking, but very unique. And when you're around those people, for me in the engineering realm,
*  there's a guy named Jim Keller who's a chip designer engineer. Every time I talk to him,
*  it doesn't matter what we're talking about. Just having experienced that unique way of thinking
*  transforms you and makes your work much better. And that's the magic. You look at Daniel Kahneman,
*  you look at the great collaborations throughout the history of science, that's the magic of that.
*  It's not always the exact ideas that you talk about, but it's the process of generating those
*  ideas, being around that, spending time with that human being. You can come up with some brilliant
*  work, especially when it's cross-disciplinary as it was a little bit in your case with Jeff.
*  Yeah. Jeff is a descendant of the logician bull. He comes from a long line of English academics.
*  And together with the deeply intuitive thinking ability that he has, he also
*  has, it's been clear, he's described this to me and I think he's mentioned it from time to time
*  in other interviews that he's had with people. He's wanted to be able to think of himself as
*  contributing to the understanding of
*  reasoning itself, not just human reasoning. Bull is about logic, right? It's about what can we
*  conclude from what else and how do we formalize that? And as a computer scientist, logician,
*  philosopher, the goal is to understand how we derive truths from other, from givens and
*  things like this. And the work that Jeff was doing in the early to mid-80s on something called the
*  Bolton machine was his way of connecting with that Boolean tradition and bringing it into the more
*  continuous probabilistic graded constraint satisfaction realm. And it was beautiful,
*  a set of ideas linked with theoretical physics and as well as with logic. And it's always been,
*  I mean, I've always been inspired by the Bolton machine too. It's like, well, if the neurons are
*  probabilistic rather than deterministic in their computations, then maybe this somehow is part of
*  serendipity or adventitiousness of the moment of insight, right? It might not have occurred at that
*  particular instant. It might be sort of partially the result of a stochastic process. And that too
*  is part of the magic of the emergence of some of these things. Well, you're right with the
*  Boolean lineage and the dream of computer science is somehow, I mean, I certainly think of humans
*  this way, that humans are one particular manifestation of intelligence, that there's
*  something bigger going on and you're trying to, you're hoping to figure that out. The mechanisms
*  of intelligence, the mechanisms of cognition are much bigger than just humans. Yeah. So I think of
*  I started using the phrase computational intelligence at some point as to characterize
*  the field that I thought people like Jeff Hinton and many of the people I know at DeepMind
*  are working in and where I feel like I'm
*  a kind of a human oriented computational intelligence researcher in that I'm actually
*  kind of interested in the human solution. But at the same time, I feel like that's where a huge
*  amount of the excitement of deep learning actually lies is in the idea that we may be able to even go
*  beyond what we can achieve with our own nervous systems when we build computational intelligences
*  that are not limited in the ways that we are by our own biology. Perhaps allowing us to
*  scale the very mechanisms of human intelligence, just increase its power through scale.
*  Yes. And I think that obviously that's being played out massively at Google Brain, at OpenAI,
*  and to some extent at DeepMind as well. I guess I shouldn't say to some extent,
*  but the massive scale of the computations that are used to succeed at games like Go or to solve
*  the protein folding problems that they've been solving and so on. Still not as many synapses
*  and neurons as the human brain. So we still got, we're still beating them on that. We humans are
*  beating the AIs, but they're catching up pretty quickly. You write about modeling of mathematical
*  cognition. So let me first ask about mathematics in general. There's a paper titled Parallel
*  Distributed Processing Approach to Mathematical Cognition, where in the introduction there's some
*  beautiful discussion of mathematics. And you reference there Tristan Needham, who criticizes
*  a narrow form of view of mathematics by liking the studying of mathematics as symbol manipulation
*  to studying music without ever hearing a note. So from that perspective,
*  what do you think is mathematics? What is this world of mathematics like?
*  Well, I think of mathematics as a set of tools for exploring idealized worlds
*  that often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world, but need not.
*  But they're worlds in which
*  objects exist with idealized properties
*  and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision
*  so as to allow the implications of
*  certain facts to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty. So
*  if you have two triangles and you know that there is
*  an angle in the first one that has the same measure as an angle in the second one,
*  and you know that the lengths of the sides adjacent to that angle in each of the two triangles,
*  the corresponding sides adjacent to that angle also have the same measure, then you can then
*  conclude that the triangles are the same length, and the length of the sides adjacent to that
*  are the same length. So you can conclude that the triangles are congruent. That is to say they have
*  all of their properties in common. And that is something about triangles. It's not a matter of
*  formulas. These are idealized objects. In fact, we built bridges out of triangles and we understand
*  something we can't climb by extending these ideas about triangles a little further.
*  All of the ability to get a tiny speck of matter launched from
*  the planet Earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out and way beyond Pluto
*  somewhere at exactly a predicted time and date is something that depends on these ideas.
*  It's actually happening in the real physical world that these ideas make contact with it
*  in those kinds of instances. But there are these idealized objects, these triangles,
*  these distances, these points, whatever they are, that allow for this set of tools to be created
*  that then gives human beings this incredible leverage that they didn't have without these
*  concepts. And I think this is actually already true when we think about just the natural numbers.
*  I always like to include zero, so I'm going to say the non-negative integers, but
*  that's a place where some people prefer not to include zero.
*  We like zero here. Natural numbers, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and so on.
*  Because they give you the ability to be exact about how many sheep you have. I sent you out
*  this morning, there were 23 sheep. You came back with only 22. What happened?
*  The fundamental problem of physics, how many sheep you have.
*  It's a fundamental problem of human society that you damn well better bring back the same number
*  of sheep as you started with. It allows commerce, it allows contracts, it allows the establishment of
*  records and so on to have systems that allow these things to be notated. But they have
*  an inherent aboutness to them. That's one at the one in the same time abstract and idealized and
*  generalizable while at the other on the other hand potentially very, very grounded and concrete.
*  And one of the things that makes for the incredible achievements of the human mind
*  is the fact that humans invented these idealized systems that leverage the power of human thought
*  in such a way as to allow all this kind of thing to happen.
*  Mathematics to me is the development of systems for thinking about
*  the properties and relations among sets of idealized objects and
*  the mathematical notation system that we unfortunately focus way too much on
*  on is just our way of expressing propositions about these properties.
*  It's just like we're talking with Chomsky in language. It's the thing we've invented for
*  the communication of those ideas. They're not necessarily the deep representation of those ideas.
*  So what's a good way to model such powerful mathematical reasoning, would you say? What
*  are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model? The insights that human mathematicians
*  have had is a combination of the kind of the intuitive kind of connectionist-like knowledge
*  that makes it so that something is just like obviously true, so that you don't have to think
*  about why it's true, that then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason
*  and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about. It then
*  ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have
*  to ground their own thinking on so that they can extend the ideas even further. I came across this
*  quotation from Henri Poincaré while I was walking in the woods with my wife in a
*  state park in Northern California late last summer. What it said on the bench was
*  it is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. So what for me the essence of
*  the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on
*  letting the intuitive discovery arise from engagement in thinking with this formal system.
*  So I think of the ability of somebody like Hinton or Newton or Einstein or
*  Rommelhart or Poincaré to Archimedes. This is another example. Suddenly a flash of insight occurs.
*  It's like the constellation of all of these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other
*  causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before and give rise to a new idea
*  that then you can say, okay, well now how can I prove this? How do I write down the steps of that
*  theorem that allow me to make it rigorous and certain?
*  I feel like the kinds of things that we're beginning to see
*  deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of
*  hope or encouragement that ultimately it'll all happen. So in particular, as
*  many people now have become really interested in thinking about, neural networks that have been
*  trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt and they can then sort of generate some
*  really interesting, fanciful, creative story from that prompt.
*  There's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like novel out of the
*  you know, all of the particulars of all of the billions and billions of experiences that went
*  into the training data that gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a
*  fun and interesting little story to tell or something like that. It just sort of wells up out of the
*  out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say given this
*  prompt as an input to get it to start to generate its own thoughts. And to me that
*  that sort of represents the potential of capturing the intuitive side of this.
*  Yeah and there's other examples, I don't know if you find them as captivating,
*  on the DeepMind side with AlphaZero, if you study chess the kind of solutions that has come up in
*  terms of chess, there's novel ideas there. It feels very like there's brilliant moments of insight
*  and the mechanism they use if you think of search as maybe more towards good old-fashioned AI and
*  then there's the connectionist network that has the intuition of looking at a board,
*  looking at a set of patterns and saying how good is this set of positions and the next few positions
*  how good are those? And that's it, that's just the intuition. Grandmasters have this
*  and understanding positionally, tactically how good the situation is, how can it be improved
*  without doing this full like deep search and then maybe doing a little bit of the what
*  human chess players call calculation which is the search, taking a particular set of steps down the
*  line to see how they unroll. But there there is moments of genius in those systems too so that's
*  another hopeful illustration that from neural networks can emerge this novel creation of an idea.
*  Yes and I think that you know I think Demis Tsisabas is
*  you know he's spoken about those things. I heard him describe a move that was made in
*  in one of the go matches against Lise Siddal in a very similar way and
*  it caused me to become really excited to kind of collaborate with some of those guys at DeepMind.
*  So I think though that what I like to really emphasize here is
*  one part of what I like to emphasize about mathematical cognition at least is that
*  philosophers and logicians going back three or even a little more than 3,000 years ago
*  began to develop these formal systems and gradually the whole idea about thinking formally
*  got constructed and you know it's preceded Euclid certainly present in the work of Thales and others
*  and I'm not the world's leading expert in all the details of that history
*  but Euclid's elements were the kind of the touch point of a coherent document that sort of laid
*  out this idea of an actual formal system within which these objects were characterized and the
*  the system of inference that
*  allowed new truths to be derived from others was sort of like established as a paradigm and
*  and
*  what I find interesting is
*  the idea that the ability to become a person who is capable of thinking
*  in this abstract formal way is you know a result of the same kind of immersion
*  in experience thinking in that way that you know we now begin to think of our understanding
*  of language as being right so we immerse ourselves in a particular language
*  in a particular world of objects and their relationships and we learn to talk about that
*  and we develop intuitive understanding of the real world in a similar way we can think that
*  we can think that what academia has created for us what you know those early philosophers and their
*  academies in Athens and Alexandria and others other places allowed was the development of these
*  schools of thought modes of thought that that then become deeply ingrained and you know
*  it becomes what it is that makes it so that somebody like Jerry Fodor would think that
*  systematic thought is the essential characteristic of the human mind as opposed to
*  a derived and an acquired characteristic that results from acculturation in a certain mode
*  that's been invented by humans would you say it's more fundamental than like language if we start
*  dancing if we if we bring chomsky back into the conversation first of all is it unfair to draw
*  a line between mathematical cognition and language linguistic cognition I think that's a very
*  I think that's a very interesting question and I think it's one of the ones that I'm actually
*  very interested in right now but I I think the answer is in important ways it is important to
*  draw that line but then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and
*  interesting aspects of the difference so
*  if we think about chomsky himself
*  he was born into an academic family his father was a professor of rabbinical studies at a small
*  rabbinical college in Philadelphia and he was deeply enculturated in
*  uh you know a culture of thought and reason and brought to the effort to understand natural
*  language this profound engagement with these formal systems and um you know I think that
*  there was tremendous power in that and that chomsky had some amazing insights into the
*  structure of natural language but that I'm going to use the word but there the actual intuitive
*  knowledge of these things only goes so far and does not go as far as it does in people like
*  chomsky himself and this was something that was discovered in the PhD dissertation of lila
*  gleitman who was actually trained in the same linguistics department with chomsky so what lila
*  discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase
*  not just about its grammar but about what they thought a phrase must mean were very different
*  from the intuitions of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker and
*  well it recently has become much more salient I happen to have learned about this when I myself
*  was a PhD student at the university of pennsylvania but um I never knew how to put it together with
*  all of my other thinking about these things so so I actually currently have the hypothesis that
*  formally trained linguists and other formally trained
*  academics whether it be linguistics philosophy cognitive science computer science machine learning
*  mathematics have a motive engagement with experience that is intuitively deeply structured
*  to be more organized around the systematicity and ability to be conformant with the principles
*  of a system than is actually true of the natural human mind without that immersion
*  that's fascinating so the different fields and approaches with which you start to study the mind
*  actually take you away from the natural operation of the mind so it makes it very difficult for you
*  to to be somebody who introspects yes and you know this is where um
*  um things about human belief and so-called knowledge that we consider
*  private not our business to manipulate in others we are not entitled to tell somebody else what to
*  believe about certain kinds of things um what are those beliefs well they are the product of
*  this sort of immersion and enculturation uh that is what I believe so and that's limiting it's
*  it's something to be aware of does that limit you from uh having a good model of some of cognition
*  it can so when you look at mathematical or linguistics so I mean what what is that line then
*  what um so is chomsky unable to sneak up to the full picture of cognition are you when you're
*  focusing on mathematical uh thinking are you also unable to do so I think you're right
*  you're right I think that's a great way of characterizing it and um I also think that
*  it's related to the concept of beginner's mind and um another concept called the expert blind spot
*  so the expert blind spot is much more prosaic seeming than than this point that you were just
*  making but it's it's something that plagues experts when they try to communicate their
*  understanding to non-experts and that is that things are self-evident to them that
*  they they can't begin to even think about how they could explain it to somebody else because
*  it it's like well it's just like so patently obvious that it must be true and um you know like
*  um when
*  kronecker said god made the natural numbers all else is the work of man he was expressing that
*  that intuition that um somehow or other you know the basic fundamentals of discrete quantities
*  being countable and innumerable and you know indefinite in number um was was not something that
*  had to be discovered um but he was wrong it turns out that uh many cognitive scientists
*  agreed with him for a time there was a long period of time where there were where um you know the
*  natural numbers were considered to be a part of the innate endowment of you know core knowledge or
*  you know to use the kind of phrases that uh spelky and and carry used to talk about what they believe
*  are the innate primitives of the human mind and um they no longer believe that they it's actually
*  um been more or less accepted by almost everyone that the natural numbers are actually a cultural
*  construction and it's it's so interesting to go back and sort of like study those few people who
*  still exist who you know who don't have those systems so so this is just an example to me
*  and where you know a certain mode of thinking about language itself or a certain mode of thinking
*  about geometry and those kinds of relations so it becomes so second nature that you don't know
*  what it is that you need to teach and um and in fact we don't really teach it all that explicitly
*  anyway and it's it's you know you you take a math class the professor sort of teaches it to you the
*  way they understand it some of the students in the class sort of like you know they get it they
*  start to get the way of thinking and they can actually do the problems that get get put on the
*  homework that the professor thinks are interesting and challenging ones but but but most of the
*  students who don't kind of engage as deeply don't ever get you know and we we think oh that man must
*  be brilliant he must have this special insight but i you know he must have some you know biological
*  sort of bit that's different right that makes him so that he or she could have that insight but i
*  i'm although i don't want to dismiss biological individual differences completely i
*  i find it much more interesting to think about the possibility that um you know it was that
*  difference in the dinner table conversation at the chomsky house when he was growing up that made it
*  so that he had that cast of mind yeah and uh there's there's a few topics we talked about the
*  kind of interconnect because i wonder the better i get at certain things we humans the deeper we
*  understand something what are you starting to then miss about the rest of the world we talked about
*  um David and his degenerative mind and you know when you look in the mirror and wonder
*  how different am i am i cognitively from the man i was a month ago from the man i was a year ago
*  like what you know if i can um having thought about language if i'm chomsky for for 10 20 years
*  what am i no longer able to see what is in my blind spot and how big is that and then to somehow
*  be able to leap back out of your deep like structure that you form for yourself about
*  thinking about the world leap back and look at the big picture again or jump out of the your current
*  way of thinking um and be able to introspect like what are the limitations of your mind
*  i how is your mind less powerful than you used to be or more powerful or different powerful in
*  different ways so that that seems to be a difficult thing to do because we're living
*  we're looking at the world through the lens of our mind right to step outside and introspect
*  it's difficult but it seems necessary if you want to make progress you know one of the
*  threads of psychological research that's always been very um
*  i don't know important to me to be aware of is is is the idea that um our explanations of our own
*  behavior aren't necessarily um actually part of the causal process that caused that behavior to
*  occur or even um valid observations of the set of constraints that led to the outcome
*  but they are post-hoc rationalizations that we can give based on information at our disposal
*  about what might have contributed to the result that we came to uh when asked and um so this this
*  is an idea that was introduced in a very important paper by nisbet and wilson about
*  you know the limits on our ability to to be aware of the factors that cause us to make the choices
*  that we make um and um you know i think it's it's uh
*  it's something that we really ought to be much more um cognizant of in general as human beings
*  is that our own insight into exactly why we hold the beliefs that we do and we hold the attitudes
*  and make the choices and and and feel the feelings that we do is not something that we um
*  we totally control or totally observe and um it's subject to you know uh our culturally
*  transmitted understanding of what it is that is the mode that we give to explain uh these things
*  when asked to do so as much as it is about anything else and so even our ability to
*  introspect and think we have access to our own thoughts is a product of culture and belief you
*  know practice so let me ask you the big uh question of advice so you've you've lived an
*  incredible life in terms of the ideas you've put out into the world in terms of the trajectory
*  you've taken through your career through your life what advice would you give to young people
*  today in high school and college about um how to have a career or how to have a life they can be
*  proud of
*  finding the thing that you are intrinsically motivated to engage with
*  and then celebrating that discovery is is what uh what it's all about when when I was in
*  college I struggled with that I I um I had thought I wanted to be a psychiatrist
*  because I think I was interested in human psychology in high school and at that time the
*  only sort of information I had that had anything to do with the psyche was you know Freud and
*  Eric Fromm and sort of popular psychiatry kinds of things and so well they were psychiatrists
*  right so I had to be a psychiatrist and uh that meant I had to go to medical school and I got to
*  college and I find myself taking you know the first semester of a three-quarter physics class
*  and it was mechanics and this was so far from what it was I was interested in but it was also too
*  early in the morning in the winter court semester so I never made it to the physics class um but
*  I wondered about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year
*  until I found myself in the midst of this situation where around me
*  there was this big revolution happening I was at Columbia University in 1968 and the Vietnam War
*  is going on Columbia's building a gym in Morningside Heights which is part of Harlem and people are
*  thinking oh the big bad rich guys are stealing the parkland that belongs to the people of Harlem
*  and you know they're part of the military industrial complex which is enslaving us
*  and sending us all off to war in Vietnam and so there was a big revolution that involved a
*  confluence of black activism and you know SDS and social justice and the whole university blew up
*  and got shut down and I got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they
*  were in this context and I you know I happened to have taken mathematical statistics I happened to
*  have been taking psychology that quarter at just psych one and somehow things in that space all
*  ran together in my mind and got me really excited about about asking questions about why people
*  what made certain people go into the buildings and not others and things like that and so suddenly
*  I had a path forward that and I had just been wandering around aimlessly and at the different
*  points in my career you know and I think okay well should I take this class or should I
*  just read that book about
*  some idea that I want to understand better you know or should I should I pursue the thing that
*  excites me and interests me or should I you know meet some requirement you know that's
*  I always did the latter so I ended up my my professors in psychology were thought I was
*  great they wanted me to go to graduate school they they nominated me for five beta capitals
*  they nominated me for five beta kappa and I went to the five beta capa and ceremony and this guy
*  came up and he said oh are you magnar summa and I wasn't even getting honors based on my grades
*  they just happened to have thought I was interested enough in ideas to belong to five beta capa so
*  I mean would it be fair to say you kind of stumbled around a little bit
*  uh through accidents of uh too early morning of classes and physics and so on until you
*  discovered intrinsic motivation as you mentioned and then that's it it hooked you and then you
*  celebrate the fact that this happens to human beings and it's like yeah like and what is it
*  that made what I did intrinsically motivating to me well that's interesting and I don't know all
*  the answers to it and I don't think uh I want to I want anybody to think that um you should be
*  sort of in any way I don't know sanctimonious or anything about it you know it's like
*  I really enjoyed doing statistical analysis of data I really enjoyed
*  uh running my own experiment which was what I got a chance to do in the psychology department
*  that chemistry and physics had never I never imagined that mere mortals would ever do an
*  experiment in those sciences except one that was in the textbook that you were told to do in lab
*  class but in psychology we were already like even when I was taking psych one it turned out we had
*  our own rat and we got to after two set experiments we got to okay do something you think of you know
*  with your rat you know so it's the opportunity to do it myself yeah and and to to bring together a
*  certain set of things that that engaged me intrinsically and and I think it it has something
*  to do with why certain people turn out to be you know profoundly um amazing musical geniuses
*  right they get immersed in it at an early enough point and it just sort of gets into the fabric
*  so my my little brother had intrinsic motivation for music as we witnessed when he discovered
*  how to put records on the phonograph when he was like 13 months old and recognize which one he
*  wanted to play not because he could read the labels because he could sort of see which ones had which
*  scratches which were the different you know oh that's rapid e-espanyol and that's oh wow you know
*  and and and he enjoyed that that connected with him somehow and yeah and and there was something
*  that it fed into and it you're extremely lucky if you have that and if you can nurture it and
*  can let it grow and let it be be a important part of your life yeah those are the two things is like
*  be attentive enough to to feel it when it comes like this is something special I mean I don't know
*  uh for example I really like um tabular data like excel sheets like it brings me a deep joy
*  I don't know how useful that is for anything but there's this part of what I'm talking exactly
*  so there's like a million not a million but there's a lot of things like that for me you
*  have to hear that for yourself like be like realize this is really joyful but then the other part
*  that you're mentioning which is the nurture is take time and stay with it stay with it a while
*  and see where that takes you uh in life yeah and I think I think the um the the motivational
*  engagement results in the immersion that then creates the opportunity to obtain the expertise
*  so you know that we we could call it the motzart effect right I mean when I think about motzart I
*  think about you know the person who was born as the fourth member of the family string quartet
*  right and uh and they handed him the violin when he was six weeks old all right start playing you
*  know it's like and um so the the level of immersion there was was amazingly profound but
*  uh hopefully he also had you know some something maybe this is where the more
*  sort of the genetic part comes in sometimes I think uh you know something in him resonated to
*  the music so that that the synergy of the combination of that was so powerful
*  so so that's what I really considered to be the motzart effect it's sort of the the synergy of
*  something with with experience that that then results in the unique flowering of a particular
*  you know mind um so I know my siblings and I are all very different from each other we've all gone
*  in our own different directions and you know I mentioned my younger brother who was very musical
*  I had my other younger brother was like this amazing like intuitive engineer
*  um and um my sister one of my sisters was passionate about
*  uh in you know water conservation well before it was a uh you know such a huge important issue
*  that it is today so we all sort of somehow these find a different thing um and uh I don't I don't
*  mean to say it isn't uh tied in with something about about us biologically but but it's also
*  when that happens where you can find that then you know you can do your thing and you can be
*  excited about it so people can be excited about fitting people on bicycles as well as excited
*  about making neural networks achieve insights into human cognition right yeah like for me personally
*  I've always been excited about love and friendship between humans and just like the
*  actual experience of it since I was a child just observing people around me and also been excited
*  about robots and there's something in me that thinks I really would love to explore how those
*  two things combine it doesn't make any sense a lot of it is also timing just to think of your own
*  career and your own life you found yourself in certain pieces places that happen to involve some
*  of the greatest thinkers of our time and so it just worked out that like you guys developed those
*  ideas and there may be a lot of other people similar to you and they were brilliant and
*  they never found that that right connection and place to where they the ideas could flourish so
*  it's timing its place it's uh it's people and uh ultimately the whole ride you know it's uh
*  undirected can I ask you about something you mentioned in terms of psychiatry when you were
*  younger because I had a similar experience of of you know reading Freud and uh Carl Jung and just
*  you know those kind of popular psychiatry ideas and that was a dream for me early on in high
*  school to uh like I hope to understand the human mind by like somehow psychiatry felt like
*  the right discipline for that does that make you sad that psychiatry is not
*  the the the mechanism by which you want to are able to explore the human mind so for me
*  I was a little bit disillusioned because of how much um prescription medication and biochemistry
*  is involved in the discipline of psychiatry as opposed to the dream of the the freud like
*  use the mechanisms of language to explore the human mind so that was a little disappointing
*  and and that's why I kind of went to computer science and thinking like maybe you can explore
*  the human mind by trying to build the thing yes I wasn't exposed to the um
*  sort of the biomedical slash pharmacological aspects of psychiatry at that point because um
*  I didn't I dropped out of that whole idea the physics that I never even found out about that
*  until much later but you're absolutely right that's uh so I was actually a member of the
*  national advisory mental health council that is to say the board of scientists who advise the director
*  of the national institute of mental health and that was around the year 2000 and in fact
*  at that time the man who came in as the new director I had been on this board for a year
*  when he came in um said okay schizophrenia is a biological illness it's a lot like cancer we've
*  made huge strides in curing cancer and that's what we're going to do with schizophrenia we're
*  going to find the medications that are going to cure this disease and we're not going to listen
*  to anybody's grandmother anymore and um you know good old behavioral psychology is not something
*  we're going to support any further and um you know he he uh
*  completely alienated me from the institute and from all of its prior policies which had been much
*  more holistic I think really at some level and and basically and the the other people on the
*  board were like psychiatrists right and uh very biological psychiatrists it didn't pan out right
*  that that that nothing has changed in our ability to uh to help people with mental illness uh and
*  so 20 years later that that that particular path uh was a dead end as far as I can tell
*  Well there's some aspect to and sorry to romanticize the whole philosophical
*  conversation about the human mind but to me psychiatrists for time held the flag of
*  we're the deep thinkers in the same way that physicists are the deep thinkers about the
*  nature of reality psychiatrists are the deep thinkers about the nature of the human mind
*  and I think that flag has been taken from them and carried by people like you it's like it's
*  more in the cognitive psychology especially when you have a foot in the computational view of the
*  world because you can both build it you can like intuit about the functioning of the mind by
*  building little models and be able to see mathematical things and then deploying those
*  models especially in computers to say does this actually work they do like experiments
*  and then some combination of neuroscience where you're starting to actually be able to
*  observe you know do certain experience on human beings and observe how the the uh the brain is
*  actually functioning and there using intuition you can start being the philosopher like Richard
*  Feynman is the philosopher a cognitive psychologist can become the philosopher and psychiatrists
*  become much more like doctors they're like very medical they help people with medication
*  biochemistry and so on but they are no longer the the the book writers and the philosophers which
*  of course I admire the I admire the Richard Feynman ability to do great low-level
*  mathematics and physics and the high-level philosophy yeah I think it was uh from and
*  young more than Freud that was sort of initially kind of like made me feel like oh this is really
*  amazing and interesting and I want to explore it further I actually when I got to college and
*  I lost that thread I I found more of it in sociology and literature than I did in any place else so I
*  took quite a lot of both of those disciplines as an undergraduate um and you know I was actually
*  deeply ambivalent about the psychology because I was doing experiments after the initial flurry of
*  interest in why people would occupy buildings during a insurrection and consider you know
*  be sort of like so over committed to their beliefs but I ended up in in the psychology laboratory
*  running experiments on pigeons and and so I had these profound sort of like dissonance between
*  okay the kinds of issues that would be explored when I was thinking about uh what I read about in
*  in modern British literature um versus what I could study with my pigeons in the laboratory
*  that got resolved when I went to graduate school and I discovered cognitive psychology and and so
*  for me that was uh that was the path out of this sort of like extremely sort of um ambivalent
*  divergence between the interest in the human condition and and the desire to do you know
*  actual mechanistically oriented thinking about it um and I think we we've come a long way in
*  that regard and that uh in this you're absolutely right that nowadays this is something that's
*  accessible to people through um the pathway in through computer science or the pathway in through
*  neuroscience um you know you can get derailed in neuroscience down to the bottom of
*  the system where you might find the cures of various conditions but you don't get a chance
*  to think about the higher level stuff so it's in the systems and cognitive neuroscience and
*  computational intelligence miasma up there at the top that I think these opportunities are most
*  are richest uh right now and um so yes I am indeed blessed by having had the opportunity to
*  fall into that uh space. So you mentioned the human condition speaking of which you happen to
*  be a human being who's unfortunately not immortal that seems to be a fundamental part of the human
*  condition that this riot ends. Do you think about the fact that you're going to die one day? Are
*  you afraid of death? I would say that I am not as much afraid of death as I am of um degeneration.
*  Uh and uh I say that in part for reasons of having you know seen some tragic degenerative situations
*  uh unfold it's exciting when you can continue to participate and uh feel like you're you're near the
*  the place where the the wave is breaking on the shore if you like you know um and and I I think
*  about you know my own uh future potential um if if I were to undergo a uh begin to suffer from dementia
*  uh Alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia or some other condition you know I would sort of
*  gradually lose the thread of that ability and um uh so so one can live on for several
*  for a decade after you know sort of having to retire because one no longer has uh these kinds
*  of um abilities to engage and uh I think that's the thing that I feared the most. The losing of
*  that like the that that um the breaking of the way the flourishing of the mind where you
*  have these ideas and they're swimming around you're able to play with them. Yeah and and and and
*  collaborate with other people who you know are themselves uh um really helping to push these
*  ideas forward so yeah. What about the edge of the cliff? The end. I mean the the mystery of it.
*  I mean the migrated sort of conception of mind and you know sort of continuous sort of way of
*  thinking about most things makes it so that uh to me the the the um the discreteness of that
*  transition is less less less less apparent than it seems to be to most people. I see I see yeah um
*  yeah I wonder so I don't know if you know the work of Ernest Becker and so on. I wonder what
*  what role mortality and our ability to be cognizant of it and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid of
*  it what role that plays in in our reasoning of the world. I think that it it can be motivating
*  to people to think they have a limited period left. Um I think in in my own case you know it
*  it's like seven or eight years ago now that I was I was sitting around doing experiments on
*  decision making that were um satisfying in a certain way because I could really get closure
*  on what whether the model fit the data perfectly or not and I could see how one could test you know
*  the predictions in monkeys as well as humans and really see what the neurons were doing.
*  But I just realized hey wait a minute you know I may only have about 10 or 15 years left here
*  and I don't feel like I'm getting towards the answers to the really interesting questions
*  while I'm doing this this particular level of work and that's when I said to myself
*  um okay um let's pick something that's hard you know so that's when I started working on mathematical
*  cognition and um I I think it was more in terms of well I got 15 more years possibly of useful
*  life left let's imagine that it's only 10. I'm actually getting close to the end of that now
*  maybe three or four more years um but I'm beginning to feel like well I probably have another five
*  after that so okay I'll give myself another another six or eight um but a deadline is looming
*  and therefore it's not going to go on forever yeah and so um so uh yeah I got to keep um thinking
*  about the questions that I think are the interesting and important ones for sure.
*  What do you hope your legacy is? You've done some incredible work in your life as a man as a scientist
*  when the aliens and the human civilization is long gone and the aliens are reading the
*  encyclopedia about the human species. What do you hope is the paragraph written about you?
*  I would want it to sort of highlight um
*  a couple things that I was you know
*  able to see um one path
*  that was more exciting to me than the one that seemed already to be there for a cognitive
*  psychologist you know but not for any super special reason other than that I'd had the
*  right context prior to that but that I had gone ahead and followed that lead you know and then
*  I forget the exact wording but I said uh in this preface that the the joy of science is the moment
*  in which you know a partially formed thought in the mind of one person gets crystallized a little
*  better in the discourse and becomes the foundation of some exciting concrete piece of actual
*  scientific progress and I feel like that you know moment happened when Rummelhard and I were doing
*  the interactive activation model and when Rummelhard heard Hinton talk about gradient descent and um
*  having the objective function to guide the learning process and um
*  it happened a lot in that period and I sort of seek that kind of thing in my
*  collaborations with my students right so um you know the idea that this is a person who
*  contributed to science by finding exciting collaborative opportunities to engage with other
*  people through um is something that I certainly hope is part of the paragraph.
*  And uh like you said taking a step maybe in directions that are non-not obvious so it's the
*  the old Robert Frost road less taken so maybe because you said like this incomplete initial idea
*  that step you take is a little bit uh off the beaten path. If if I could just say one more
*  thing here. Sure. I uh this was something that really contributed to energizing me in a way that
*  I uh that I feel it would be useful to share. I my my PhD dissertation project was completely
*  empirical experimental project and I wrote a paper based on the the two main experiments that were
*  the core of my dissertation and I submitted it to a journal and uh at the end of the paper
*  I had a little section where I laid out my um the beginnings of my theory about what I thought was
*  going on that would explain the data that I had collected and I had submitted the paper to the
*  Journal of Experimental Psychology. So I got back a letter from the editor saying thank you very
*  much these are great experiments and we'd love to publish them in the journal but what we'd like you
*  to do is to leave the theorizing to the theorists and um take that part out of the paper. And so I
*  did I took that part out of the paper uh but you know I almost found myself labeled as a non-theorist
*  right by this uh and um I could have like succumbed to that and said okay well I guess my job is to
*  just go on and do experiments right but but uh that's not what I wanted to do and and so when I
*  when I got to my assistant professorship um although I continued to do experiments because
*  I knew I had to get some papers out I also at the end of my first year submitted my first article to
*  Psychological Review which was the Theoretical Journal where I took that section and elaborated
*  it and wrote it up and submitted it to them and they didn't accept that either but they said oh
*  this is interesting you should keep thinking about it this time and then that was what got me going
*  to think okay you know so it's not a superhuman thing to contribute to the development of theory
*  you know you don't have to be you can do it as a mere mortal and the broader I think lesson is
*  don't succumb to the labels of a particular reviewer or anybody labeling you right you know
*  exactly I mean that yeah exactly and any especially as you become successful
*  you label labels get assigned to you for that you're successful for that thing connectionist
*  or cognitive scientist and not a neuroscientist and then you can you can completely that's just
*  that's the stories of the past you're today a new person that can completely revolutionize in totally
*  new areas so don't let those labels hold you back well let me ask the big question
*  when you look at into the you said it started with Colombia trying to observe these humans and
*  they're doing weird stuff and you want to know why are they doing this stuff so zoom out even
*  bigger at the hundred plus billion people who've ever lived on earth why do you think we're all
*  doing what we're doing what do you think is the meaning of it all the big why question
*  we seem to be very busy doing a bunch of stuff and we seem to be kind of directed towards somewhere
*  um but why
*  well um I myself think that we make meaning for ourselves and that um
*  we find inspiration in the meaning that other people have made in the past uh you know and the
*  great religious thinkers uh of the first millennium bc and you know few few that came
*  in the early part of the second uh millennium uh you know laid down some important foundations for us
*  um but I I do believe that you know we are uh an emergent
*  result of a process that happened naturally without guidance and um that
*  meaning is what we make of it and that the creation of
*  uh efforts to reify meaning in um like religious traditions and so on is just a part of the
*  expression of that of that goal that we have to you know not not find out what the meaning is but to
*  but to make it ourselves and um so to me it's something that's very personal it's very
*  individual it's like meaning will come for you through the particular combination of
*  synergistic elements that are your fabric and your experience and your
*  um context and your and um you know you should
*  it's it's it it's all made in a in a certain kind of a local context though right what
*  here I am at UCSD with this brilliant man Rommelhart uh who's having you know these doubts about
*  um symbolic artificial intelligence that resonate with my desire to see it grounded in the biology
*  and um uh let's make the most of that you know yeah and so and so from that like little pocket
*  there's some kind of uh peculiar little emergent process that then uh which is basically each one
*  of us each one of us humans is a kind of you know you think cells and they come together
*  and it's an emergent process that then tells fancy stories about itself and then gets
*  just like you said just enjoys the beauty of the stories we tell about ourselves it's an emergent
*  process that lives for a time uh is defined by its local pocket and context uh in time and space
*  and then tells pretty stories and we write those stories down and then we celebrate how nice the
*  stories are and then it continues because we build stories on top of each other and uh eventually
*  we'll colonize hopefully other planets other uh solar systems other galaxies and we'll tell even
*  better stories but it all starts uh here on earth Jay you're uh speaking of uh peculiar emergent
*  processes that uh lived one heck of a story you're you're one of the the the great scientists
*  of cognitive uh science of psychology of computation it's a huge honor you would
*  talk to me today that you spend your very valuable time i really enjoy talking with you and thank you
*  for all the work you've done i can't wait to see what you do next well thank you so much and i uh
*  you know this has been an amazing opportunity for me to let ideas that i've never fully expressed
*  before come out because you asked such a wide range of um you know the deeper questions that
*  we're all we've all been thinking about for so long so thank you very much for that thank you
*  thanks for listening to this conversation with jay mclelland to support this podcast please check
*  out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from jeffrey hinton
*  in the long run curiosity driven research works best real breakthroughs come from people focusing
*  on what they're excited about thanks for listening and hope to see you next time
