# Saifedean Ammous: Bitcoin, Anarchy, and Austrian Economics | Lex Fridman Podcast #284
**Lex Fridman:** [May 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp4U5aH_T6A)
*  You can't have permanent war without fiat.
*  And I also think there's a case to be made that you can't really have fiat without war.
*  The following is a conversation with safety in a moose, one of the central and most
*  impactful economists, philosophers and educators in the world of Bitcoin.
*  He's an Austrian economist and anarchist and the author of the Bitcoin standard and
*  the new book, the Fiat standard.
*  Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists and humans in general with whom
*  he disagrees.
*  For example, Paul Krugman, who is a neo-Lakensian economist and a previous guest at this podcast.
*  Safety's opinions are strong and often controversial.
*  I do push back in this conversation playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man each
*  side.
*  But as always, I do so in the service of exploring the rich space of ideas that safety has about
*  human nature and human civilization.
*  I trust the intelligence of you, the listener, to come to your own conclusions.
*  That is the burden of being a free thinking human.
*  It is on each of us individually to dive into this chaos of ideas and from that chaos,
*  discover long lasting universal wisdom to live by.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Safety and Amoose.
*  Let's start with a big question.
*  What is money and what is the role of money in the history of human civilization?
*  Money is a medium of exchange.
*  The thing that defines money is that it is a good that you don't buy for its own sake
*  because you want to consume it itself or because you want to employ it in the production of other
*  goods, which is what capital goods are.
*  So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.
*  Money is distinct from those two because it is a good that is acquired purely to be exchanged
*  later on for other goods.
*  So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake.
*  You acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.
*  And that's a market good.
*  That's a market good like all other goods.
*  You acquire food because you eat it.
*  You acquire a car to move you around.
*  You acquire money so that you can exchange it for other goods.
*  And that's something that many people have a hard time grasping on the concept of money
*  as a market good.
*  But it is a market good just like all others.
*  And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.
*  It allows us to develop the division of labor, which would not be possible at any kind of
*  sophisticated level without money.
*  So if we live in a small society of 10 people, then think about all the things that we can make,
*  all the things that we can produce.
*  If we're only 10 people isolated from the world, there's only very few things that we
*  can make.
*  And therefore, we can exchange those things directly with one another.
*  But as if we get in contact with other societies that have more people, then the opportunities
*  for specialization increase.
*  There's 10 people.
*  The only thing that you can make is the very basics you need for your survival.
*  But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people, there's much more room for specialization.
*  You can make a car.
*  You can make a house that's very sophisticated.
*  And that relies on the division of labor.
*  That relies on you specializing in doing one tiny little thing, which is not what you consume.
*  And you trade that thing for all the things that you consume.
*  So as the economy becomes more sophisticated and involves more people, and currently we're
*  all part of an economy of almost 8 billion people, each one of us produces one tiny little
*  thing.
*  And they exchange that thing for all the things that they want.
*  Because we specialize, we become more productive in doing the thing that we're good at.
*  There's people out there who are engineers who are designing windshields in cars.
*  It's a very specialized thing.
*  They sell windshield design to Mercedes-Benz.
*  And then from that, that windshield design is added onto millions of cars around the world.
*  And from that, they're able to get enough money to meet all of their needs.
*  So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money.
*  Because without money, it's very difficult to be able to exchange a large number of goods.
*  It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy with a large degree of specialization.
*  Because it's very difficult to find people who want the thing that you have and have the thing
*  that you want.
*  We call this the coincidence of wants.
*  And that's really the problem that money solves.
*  So you make apples and I make oranges.
*  I'd like to have some of your apples, but you don't want my oranges.
*  We have a problem of coincidence of wants.
*  So what do I do?
*  You want bananas.
*  I need to find somebody who has bananas, give them my oranges, take their bananas, give you
*  their bananas, and then I take the apples.
*  In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.
*  So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve and will emerge in an economy
*  as an economy becomes more sophisticated.
*  As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods, it's inevitable that we're going to come to
*  a situation where we have the problem of coincidence of wants.
*  And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.
*  And it can be anything.
*  It can be a banana.
*  It can be food, stuff.
*  It can be any kind of good.
*  As long as I acquire the good with the purpose of passing it on to you, not with the purpose
*  of me consuming it or using it, then that's a medium of exchange.
*  So when we look at the entirety of human society of millions of billions of people,
*  you think of them as just a bunch of individuals running around.
*  I love the term coincidence of wants.
*  So each one of them is like a stochastic system.
*  They have desires.
*  It's like a random collection of desires.
*  Somehow rooted in our evolutionary history, but mostly random in terms of preference of
*  banana or apple, that kind of thing.
*  And then they also have the capacity for competence and excellence in particular kind of labor.
*  So like a specialization.
*  They're able to be like incredible at a particular set of tasks.
*  So there's a bunch of ants running around with consciousness and intelligence.
*  They have desires and they have capabilities.
*  And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have and the capabilities they have.
*  And you wanted to create a system that kind of exchanges those things.
*  So when you imagine like what is a good, what is markets?
*  When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system, what do you imagine?
*  What is a market?
*  A market is just the name for the naturally emergent phenomena of people voluntarily
*  exchanging things.
*  At any scale?
*  At any scale, yeah.
*  It could be a market of two people on an island on their own.
*  It could be 8 billion people across the planet.
*  Naturally emerging.
*  Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard for many people who don't have a good
*  understanding of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets are not something that you need
*  a central planner or a government officer to make happen.
*  Capitalism is just what happens when people are left to their own devices.
*  It's just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools that we can use for production.
*  And that's what we do.
*  That's what humans have been doing since they started making spears to hunt.
*  That's the first capital good probably.
*  So we're constantly accumulating capital.
*  We're constantly trading with one another.
*  We find an opportunity.
*  You've got a lot of oranges.
*  I've got a lot of apples.
*  Then I'll take some of yours.
*  You'll take some of mine.
*  We're both better off.
*  This is just a naturally emergent thing.
*  And money is what makes it enormously powerful.
*  Money is what allows it to scale, really.
*  Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies into just something that is global.
*  Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier, all you need to do is specialize
*  in doing one thing, the thing that you do best.
*  And then you exchange that for money.
*  And you don't have to worry about whether the other people involved in this
*  want what you have and have what you want.
*  You just sell it for money to whoever wants it.
*  And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.
*  And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden of how a market economy functions.
*  So the first thing that I would say about money is that it allows for the division of labor.
*  And it allows for the market system to grow.
*  And the second thing is that money is a mechanism for storing value into the future.
*  So again, as humans, we develop the capacity to think for the future.
*  We make a spear so that we can hunt.
*  And then we see that it works.
*  And then we take it out of the animal that we hunted it with.
*  And we keep it for the next day's hunt.
*  And then we start making a better spear.
*  And we make a better fishing rod.
*  And then we make a fishing net.
*  And then we make a fishing boat.
*  And that's our ability to think of the future.
*  And as we start building durable goods, we start thinking more and more of the future.
*  We start becoming more and more future-oriented.
*  And that's really the process of civilization, the process of denying our needs now
*  in order to think for the future.
*  So instead of spending all of our day on the beach enjoying ourselves,
*  we take time off from leisure on the beach and spend some time making a spear,
*  making a fishing rod, so that our productivity in hunting or fishing tomorrow is going to be higher.
*  And so that ability to think for the future is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.
*  And we do that with durable goods.
*  But then money ends up being the best mechanism for providing for the future.
*  Because the future is uncertain.
*  So you can save your apples and oranges.
*  You can save the spears.
*  You can save the animal that you hunted.
*  But these things, first they rot.
*  They're not very good at holding on to their value over time.
*  But even if they were, even if you have objects that are durable,
*  the problem with them is that you don't know if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.
*  You're not sure if you're going to be needing them.
*  And you might end up not needing them.
*  And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them or finding somebody who needs them
*  but doesn't value them much and won't give you much in exchange.
*  Money allows you the optionality of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.
*  So it's something that you can sell tomorrow with the least uncertainty.
*  It has the most liquidity, the most ability to be sold without a loss in its value.
*  So money is our most advanced technology and our best technology for moving value into the future.
*  And so I think history really, I argue this in all my books, is that really history we see,
*  and we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.
*  And so our money gets better at holding on to its value for the future.
*  And by harder, I mean harder to produce.
*  We find things that are hard to produce that are better at holding on to their value.
*  So they hold on to their value better for the future.
*  And that allows us to plot and plan for the future.
*  That makes the future less uncertain.
*  And that makes us more future-oriented.
*  In other words, it lowers our time preference.
*  And the harder the money is, the better it is allowing us to think of the future.
*  So people should know that you've written the book Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.
*  Yeah.
*  And then a new book called Fiat Standard.
*  The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible in the cryptocurrency space,
*  in the Bitcoin space of just a very rigorous systematic explanation of why Bitcoin,
*  what is it, why should it be, why is it good.
*  So you're describing in that book and in the new book,
*  different implementations of the technology of money.
*  In the new book, you talk about Fiat money, which is another way to do money.
*  So obviously, there's a lot of different ways to do money.
*  And maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money yet.
*  Our conversation today is how to do money better.
*  Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually.
*  Right.
*  Very good reasons why we won't.
*  Well, we can disagree.
*  We can agree to disagree on this.
*  I'm open-minded to the bananas.
*  One of the biggest sources of joy to me when I first came to this country is eating bananas.
*  And so maybe money happiness, perishable happiness will eventually become
*  the best medium of exchange.
*  I don't know.
*  Open-minded.
*  Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.
*  So there's different ways to do money.
*  What is hard money?
*  What is soft money?
*  In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument that money is always whatever is the hardest
*  thing to make.
*  Historically, I think we see many examples of that.
*  So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money because nobody can make cigarettes in
*  prison.
*  In societies, we have the example of Yap Island, for instance.
*  It's an island that doesn't have any limestone, but there's a nearby island that has a lot of
*  limestone.
*  And it's very expensive, obviously, with primitive technology to move limestone from Palau to
*  Yap.
*  So on Yap, limestones were money.
*  Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find, end up serving as money in places
*  where they're rare.
*  Glass beads were money in West Africa where there was no glassmaking technology because
*  they were imported from abroad and they were very hard to make.
*  And I think there's a conscious effort of some people might recognize the hardness and
*  the scarcity and choose this as money.
*  But I think what's more important is just a natural evolutionary process whereby people
*  choose all kinds of random things as money, bananas maybe even.
*  But then the people who end up making these bad choices don't end up with any wealth left,
*  whereas the people who store their wealth in the things that are hard to make end up
*  acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth and maybe even increasing it over time.
*  And of course, this culminated in the 19th century, in the end of the 19th century by
*  basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.
*  And that-
*  What is a gold standard?
*  The gold standard is basically when money is gold or at least government currencies
*  backed by gold.
*  But the reason gold became money and not copper, not nickel, not bananas is that gold is the
*  hardest metal in the world and it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.
*  And the reason for that is based in chemistry.
*  So gold is indestructible.
*  You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.
*  It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.
*  The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt is today probably in somebody's
*  necklace or in somebody's gold coin.
*  It's still there.
*  For thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.
*  They dig it out of the ground, they refine it, and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin,
*  and then it just stays there.
*  It gets melted down into new other forms.
*  The jewelry gets turned into coins or coins get turned into bars.
*  But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.
*  On the other hand, every year we get better at our technology of looking for gold.
*  There's more people all over the world.
*  The population increases.
*  The technology improves.
*  So we keep finding more and more gold, and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.
*  However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile that is not being devalued,
*  sorry, that is not being consumed because there's no way of consuming gold.
*  You can't eat it.
*  You can't burn it.
*  You can't.
*  It doesn't rust.
*  Because of that, we're constantly adding to a constantly growing stockpile.
*  So if you look at the numbers, you see over the last 100 years, we've got pretty reliable
*  data on gold production worldwide.
*  We see that pretty much gold stockpiles increase at around one and a half to 2%
*  per year every year.
*  So yes, we're making more every year, but we're making more.
*  So we're adding to the stockpile.
*  The stockpile grows more.
*  So every year we're adding only around one and a half to 2%.
*  Compare that to the second hardest metal historically was silver.
*  And that increased historically at around maybe 5% per year or so.
*  Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30% because it's now getting used
*  extensively in industrial uses.
*  So when you use it in industry, when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera or in a machine,
*  effectively, you are consuming the stockpile because it's not used as money.
*  It's taken out of the monetary stockpile.
*  So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular, and I discuss this in detail in
*  the Bitcoin standard, what happened in 1870 was Germany won the Franco-Prussian war and
*  Germany was on a silver standard, but the value of silvers was declining.
*  So Germany did something very smart, which is they took their indemnity from France in
*  gold and used that big chunk of gold to switch to going on a gold standard.
*  And since then, silver has been collapsing in value next to gold.
*  So back then, the price of an ounce of gold was around 15 ounces of silver.
*  Today, it's closer to 100.
*  It's just been declining for the last 150 years.
*  And so because of that, because of the fact that it's lost its monetary role as people
*  shifted toward gold, the value of silver went down.
*  And so it became economical to use it in more and more industrial applications.
*  So the stockpile declines.
*  And then as a result, that weakens its monetary properties more and more and more.
*  So that's why at the end of the 19th century, I mean, at the beginning of the 19th century,
*  gold and silver were money.
*  By the end, it was basically only gold.
*  And the countries that were still on a silver standard, China and India in particular,
*  suffered enormously from it because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold.
*  And so Europeans who would come to China or India were able to buy things at practically
*  a big discount.
*  So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple, very basic questions.
*  There's few people in this world that are as good as you are at answering very basic,
*  almost ridiculously basic questions.
*  Because I think exploring questions like what is money is a really great way to think from
*  first principles, to really think deeply about this world.
*  So I really appreciate you doing that.
*  When you say standard, what does it mean?
*  When you say silver standard, gold standard, again, with the basic question.
*  The term really, I think, was based out of gold.
*  The first time this came out was the gold standard.
*  Because so I said gold was money at the end of the 19th century.
*  But it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins and trading with gold coins,
*  because that's got a problem of divisibility.
*  So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.
*  So how do you buy that thing?
*  And the answer was that you created the monetary instruments that were backed by gold.
*  And so currencies, national currencies under the gold standard, were specific units of gold.
*  And that's how a gold standard functioned.
*  Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper that were redeemable in gold.
*  So you could go to the central bank, you'd give them the piece of paper, the $100 bill or the $10
*  bill, and they'll give you gold in exchange, and they give you a specific quantity of gold in
*  exchange.
*  Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.
*  So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.
*  Exactly.
*  That was the plan.
*  That was what it's supposed to do.
*  But arguably, we never had a pure gold standard, because the nature of gold means that the people
*  who are in charge of the gold, they have an enormous amount of power because the gold is
*  concentrated with them.
*  And as long as not everybody shows up at the same time, asking for their gold, then you can
*  make more receipts than you have gold.
*  Sure.
*  This is there's always shady stuff going on.
*  But at least that's the state of goal is the receipt should exactly represent the amount
*  of gold there.
*  And also, when you say standard, it means that governments sort of publicly stated that this
*  is the approved, the main way of making transactions that are monetary.
*  So this is the money.
*  This is the official money that you should be using if you live in this country.
*  Yes.
*  Although I would say it's more like the other way around.
*  It's not that the governments established gold as money.
*  It's more like gold gave the governments the credibility for their currencies.
*  So governments were not the ones that made gold money.
*  Gold has been money before states were invented.
*  States, if you have a government and you'd like to have some legitimacy, and you'd like to be
*  able to deal with other governments on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard.
*  You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold so that you could trade with the rest
*  of the world so that people could, in your country, use that currency.
*  So it's not that governments were choosing gold.
*  It's more like they were having to adapt their own currencies to gold in order to give their
*  currencies credibility.
*  So there's a dance there, though, because if they had to, then why did they switch away from it
*  after?
*  So there is a dance where the governments, the people pressure.
*  So first of all, the basic characteristics of the hard money pressures the governments and the
*  people in terms of what should be used.
*  Then the people, based on their community, the network effects, the way they, the narratives
*  they tell each other, all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments to take on a
*  particular money.
*  Then the governments, they like power, they like control, all those kinds of things.
*  They pressure the people until different kinds of narratives.
*  So there's a dance going on in this evolution of what technology to use for a monetary system.
*  So the reason I don't know if governments had to, because they clearly didn't have to because
*  they eventually moved away from it.
*  But there was pressure, probably.
*  Yeah, but even after they moved away from it, you know, central banks, until today, they still
*  hold a lot of gold reserves.
*  In fact, if you look at 1914, when they, when the world really went off the gold standard,
*  the amount of gold reserves held by central banks was a tiny fraction of what it was.
*  As time went on, central banks accumulated more and more gold.
*  What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens from using the gold, but they
*  continued to use it.
*  So gold continued to be money up until 1971 because effectively the world was on a dollar
*  standard and the dollars were backed by gold.
*  But then after 1971, even then, you know, central banks continue to accumulate gold
*  because why would you as a central bank want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively,
*  or credit liabilities of another central bank that can produce them infinitely?
*  And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious to governments today, you know,
*  as we see US sanctions taking, say, Russian reserves or Afghanistan reserves.
*  And this is why, you know, we see China and Russia have accumulated a lot of gold over the
*  last 10, 20 years.
*  So just to return to the question of definitions.
*  So what is hard money versus soft money?
*  Yes.
*  So hard, I mean, it's a relative thing, but the hardness refers to the difficulty of producing
*  more units of the money supply.
*  So an easy money would be a money that is relatively easy to make.
*  So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50% or something like that.
*  So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities other than gold and silver,
*  they're easy money and they're not suitable as a monetary medium because they're being consumed.
*  So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard, I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow
*  ratio, which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.
*  If you look at all the other metals, they're easy money because they're being consumed.
*  So think about how much stockpiles of copper there are in the world today.
*  So copper companies obviously have some stockpiles of copper.
*  Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper, but the vast majority of copper
*  is essentially on a conveyor belt of production from the mine straight to the consumer good
*  that it's being used for.
*  So the existing stockpiles are roughly in the range of one year's production.
*  If you take all of the companies, I don't have exact statistics.
*  It's very difficult to get these, but it's roughly in the same range.
*  Like if copper production were to stop completely today, we'll have about a year's production
*  stored in various places.
*  So that makes copper terrible money because if you started using copper as money,
*  and this is why a lot of people say, well, money is a collective illusion.
*  Money is a social construct.
*  If we all agree that something is money, then something is money.
*  I think this is completely clueless.
*  It's usually Marxists who believe this, so obviously no understanding of economics.
*  It's completely clueless because even if everybody in society decided we wanted to
*  make copper as money, even if we all decided to collectively take part in this hallucination
*  or illusion, it would not make copper money.
*  It would just make everybody who decides to take part in this hallucination poor.
*  That's it.
*  It would make copper miners rich.
*  It would make all of the people who chose copper as money poor, and copper would not
*  be money.
*  It can't work because what happens is because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,
*  if you buy, even if you get the 1000 richest people in the world, all of the world's
*  billionaires, they get together and they all dump all of the money that they have, all
*  the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold, all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own,
*  they dump it and they buy copper with it.
*  What's going to happen?
*  Price of copper is going to go up a lot, but what's going to stop copper miners from
*  flooding the market with even more copper than what the billionaires bought?
*  Nothing.
*  They're going to dump all of that extra copper production.
*  If the price of copper is going to go up, so there will be a lot more copper mining
*  than all the other metals.
*  A lot of nickel companies and gold miners are going to switch to focusing on copper,
*  and then we're going to dump an enormous amount of copper on the market.
*  The value of copper is going to crash and the people who chose copper as money are
*  just going to end up with large warehouses of very cheap rusting metal.
*  So that's a brilliant description and that kind of pushes towards gold where the
*  stock to flow ratio, I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2% like you mentioned earlier.
*  That would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.
*  That's the supply growth rate.
*  So the stock to flow is the inverse.
*  It's around 60.
*  60.
*  Got it.
*  But let me push back on, as somebody who likes human psychology, let me push back on
*  the collective hallucination and the illusion.
*  So that's for copper, but what about paper money?
*  That's not, you can't smoke it, you can't eat it.
*  It's supposed to represent, it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange.
*  In that sense, what role does collective hallucination play in the effectiveness of money?
*  Exactly zero.
*  Because all of the paper money, first of all, there's never been an instance, and again,
*  this flies in the face of a lot of people that think about money.
*  There's never been an instance where a government came out and said,
*  all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper, use them as money.
*  This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things.
*  And here's the piece of paper.
*  This has never happened.
*  They've always taken fiat money, paper money, all of these things were always born out of fraud.
*  Initially, it was a receipt for gold, and then they told you,
*  well, you don't need the gold anyway, and you have to use this.
*  And then if you don't use it, we throw you in jail.
*  And then, so first of all, it doesn't, you can't enforce this thing.
*  So it's never really just happened.
*  And it's never been hallucinated into existence.
*  People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense in writing textbooks and books and in academia,
*  but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.
*  People are very careful about what they put their money in.
*  For people listening, we're going to have fun in this conversation.
*  Because you're like, you already said Marxist fraud, hallucination,
*  just because we use these words doesn't mean they're true, but they're fun to talk about.
*  So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk, which I think is fun.
*  But allow me and my dumb self to push back to play devil's advocate.
*  And I'll actually ask you sometimes to play devil's advocate if possible,
*  because you're smarter than me on all this stuff.
*  So we want the smartest devil's advocate possible.
*  And I'm certainly not that.
*  But anyway, so, but nevertheless, we are currently on a fiat standard.
*  So money does have value, paper money.
*  And the reason it has value is because we believe it has value.
*  To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,
*  the belief that something is worth value is actually value and is the thing that helps money work.
*  Because you're saying it's fraud, and the belief is almost valueless.
*  But how much value can we quantify the value of the belief, the collective belief?
*  I should say like, all economics is subjective.
*  I consider myself an Austrian school economist.
*  And the starting point of all Austrian economics is that all value is subjective.
*  So obviously, you know, value only exists because humans choose to make the valuation.
*  However, the economic reality of the way that money works
*  means that it's just the technology like all others.
*  And so, for me, when people say, well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,
*  then it'll be money.
*  If we can hallucinate bananas to be money, then it'll be money.
*  For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate the bananas can be spaceships,
*  they'll be spaceships.
*  I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,
*  but a banana is not going to get you to the moon.
*  Nevertheless, that's true.
*  So you're drawing a big distinction between physical reality and the space of belief,
*  but it seems like so much power of human civilization,
*  so much destruction, so much creativity, creation happens in our minds.
*  Absolutely.
*  Everything does happen in the mind.
*  You're not going to get to the moon, but you might still have a significant impact
*  on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.
*  True, but economic reality exists in a way in which your beliefs are rewarded
*  when they match up with economic reality.
*  With physical reality.
*  And they're punished when they don't.
*  So if you ride a banana, jump off a cliff thinking you're going to get to the moon,
*  that solves the problem of people thinking the bananas are spaceships
*  by killing people who think that bananas are spaceships.
*  And I think to go back to your question in terms of paper money,
*  so yes, even though ignoring the original sin of the creation of fiat money
*  and ignoring everything that happened before 1971, all right, well, here we are.
*  People are using, well, it's not really paper money.
*  We should say fiat money is predominantly credit.
*  It's also a digital currency.
*  So more than 90% of dollars are digital.
*  Less than 10% of dollars are physical.
*  So it is a digital currency.
*  And all over the world, all these governments are using digital currencies
*  effectively with some physical manifestations in paper.
*  But yet even within these currencies, it's still the same analysis.
*  And I discussed this in chapter four of the Bitcoin standard.
*  You look at government monies, you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,
*  the ones that have the biggest value, the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,
*  the ones that are used as currency reserves all over the world,
*  are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.
*  The ones that grow, whose central banks are the least inflationary.
*  And on the other hand, the ones that who supplies more inflationary, similar to copper,
*  end up failing.
*  You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.
*  These are currencies whose supply increases very quickly.
*  And therefore, their value collapses.
*  Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen,
*  they increase at a much lower rate in general than these terrible currencies.
*  And that's why all over the world, you see people are looking to get more dollars
*  and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.
*  So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money and the ease of money
*  is pretty well supported empirically.
*  So like you said, you're at least in part or in whole, consider yourself an Austrian economist.
*  So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.
*  What is Austrian economics?
*  What is Kenzian economics?
*  How do you compare the two?
*  What should people know?
*  What are the interesting defining characteristics to you about these schools of thought?
*  So Austrian economics, the way that I see it, Austrian economics is economics.
*  We call it Austrian economics because economics has been hijacked by a bunch of frauds.
*  Or people who are wrong.
*  Well, it's much worse than wrong by people who are just essentially propagandists for inflation.
*  It's like your opinion, man.
*  Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion, man.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.
*  So he's the O speaks enough, but he's one of the people that is perhaps most harshly criticized
*  by folks in Austrian economics perspective and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.
*  Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor who plays an economist on TV and the internet.
*  So anyway, now tell me what you really think.
*  So the basics of what is Austrian economics?
*  What perspective does it take on the world?
*  Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is the continuation of a tradition that it
*  goes back to the ancient Greeks of studying economics.
*  Historically, it's really just economics and that has evolved over time.
*  And the establishment of the Austrian school per se came in 1871, 150 years ago, when Carl Manger,
*  the father of the school, wrote a book called Principles of Economics and essentially invented
*  marginal analysis, which is a big deal in economics.
*  Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics, individuals carry out decisions at the margin.
*  That it's when you make choice, you're not making it.
*  For instance, if you're making a choice between what should I spend my money on,
*  you're not making a choice whether it is this thing is object A or B, which one is more valuable
*  for me in general, which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.
*  You're choosing about the next unit right now at this point at this stage.
*  And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin, it makes a lot more sense and
*  you can understand why people decide and make the decisions that they do.
*  Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis, things don't make sense.
*  The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve is what is called the water diamond paradox.
*  So you will die without water.
*  We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.
*  Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous.
*  Nobody needs them.
*  Nobody is going to live or die because they have a diamond and yet they're extremely expensive.
*  And yet they're extremely expensive.
*  So why is it that as human beings, we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,
*  whereas we pay thousands of dollars for a few grams of diamonds?
*  Why is this the case?
*  Do we value water less than diamond?
*  And the answer is no.
*  But at the margin where we are right now, you live in a place where water is very abundant
*  because cities are only built in places where water is abundant.
*  And you're only making a choice about the next unit of water.
*  And so water is extremely abundant and you're choosing about whether to spend the next
*  unit of money on water.
*  The valuation that you give to water given that you have a lot of water at home
*  and that you live in a place that has abundant water is pretty low to the marginal unit.
*  But it's very high for water overall.
*  So if I asked you how much would you spend for water in general,
*  how much would you pay for water for all of your life, it would be a lot higher than diamonds.
*  If I told you you can only have water or diamonds for the rest of your life,
*  you choose water obviously.
*  But nobody's ever had to make that choice.
*  You only make your choices at the margin.
*  So at the margin where we are, modern civilization, we have an abundance of water.
*  That's why we have civilization.
*  And diamonds are very rare and scarce.
*  And people are only buying, you buy your first diamond when you're going to get married,
*  you give it to your wife, and that's going to be the first few grams of diamond that
*  she's ever going to own.
*  I'm giving my wife water.
*  Smart move.
*  You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.
*  I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her how many Bitcoin we could have had if I
*  bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.
*  What's the downside of, by the way, diamonds from the analysis of gold and so on?
*  That's a great question.
*  Arguably, diamonds are a scam.
*  Because they became popular as a thing in marriage after gold was banned, after gold
*  ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s and in many places around the world.
*  So before that, you'd give gold.
*  And the reason you'd give gold in a dowry in a wedding is because it wasn't just that
*  it's pretty and shiny, it's because it's money.
*  So if you die, your wife can take the gold and she can live off of it.
*  It's a demonstration that you're giving her something valuable.
*  And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold that has the high stock to flow ratio.
*  But then they banned gold ownership, or they allowed people to only own very tiny
*  quantities of gold.
*  And that's when the diamond industry stepped in and marketed diamonds as
*  the thing that you need to give.
*  But the problem with it is, of course, that diamonds aren't like gold.
*  They're not very hard to make more of.
*  And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds is really artificial.
*  There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.
*  They restrict the supply.
*  And it's a pretty dirty business.
*  And the way that they do it is all of the talk about
*  blood diamonds is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.
*  So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers, then it doesn't matter how many
*  people get killed producing your diamonds.
*  If you're out of the monopoly, then human rights organizations descend on you
*  and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.
*  And they're also restricting the production of artificial diamonds.
*  This is the other thing.
*  You can make artificial diamond, you can't make artificial gold.
*  So they restrict the production of artificial diamond and they try and
*  insist that you shouldn't take artificial diamonds, but they're indistinguishable from
*  real diamonds.
*  So it's an artificial scarcity.
*  And I think there's going to come a point at some point that this monopoly is going
*  to break and a lot of people are going to be left with essentially highly devalued jewelry.
*  I'm going to take this segment of the podcast.
*  When I'm getting mad, I'm going to send it.
*  And then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.
*  Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.
*  So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin is the thing that allows you to most accurately
*  capture human nature, the actual day-to-day decisions that we humans make.
*  Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics.
*  So 1870.
*  And that was Menger's work.
*  And then he had a student, Eugene Bomberg, who developed capital theory.
*  And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises, who is arguably the most important economist
*  ever.
*  And he developed theory of money and he wrote a book in 1912 called The Theory of Money and
*  Credit.
*  And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action, which is a big treatise on economics.
*  And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.
*  And before World War I, this was just known as economics.
*  Then after what happened in World War I, and I discussed this in detail in the Fiat standard,
*  is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold and tried to pass off their own credit
*  as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.
*  And incidentally here, this is part of the history that is not discussed often.
*  This is presented as an innovation.
*  Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school that would justify what they did.
*  And later on, it's presented as, oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.
*  And now, look, we've built this thing that is better than gold, where now the government
*  can just print money whenever it wants.
*  And now, gold money is not an issue anymore, which is extremely idiotic, because the whole
*  point of money is that it's not easy to make.
*  If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.
*  It's just destroying the entire function of money.
*  And we've seen that happen extensively in the 20th century after countries went off
*  the gold standard.
*  So essentially, Keynesian economics is just inflation apologia.
*  It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.
*  And it's profoundly nonsensical.
*  It's built on the idea that if you just make more money, you can stimulate economic production.
*  And of course, this is very self-serving to the central banks and to the banks and to
*  the governments who promote this nonsense.
*  And this is also very pervasive.
*  If you've had the misfortune of studying at a university over the last century, you were
*  taught Keynesian garbage economics.
*  You were taught that if there is a problem in the economy, the way to fix it is that
*  the government prints money.
*  The government lowers the interest rate.
*  And then that leads to more economic production, which is completely nonsensical.
*  So, again, for the listener, you're using strong words and I'll push back just to
*  please devil's advocate to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.
*  So just because it's in the interest of the central banks and the government,
*  the interests and the models of Keynesian economics and the government are aligned
*  doesn't mean they're wrong.
*  So let's give them a chance.
*  So the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom, is that inflation is good
*  in moderation as it encourages spending.
*  But too much is bad because it completely devalues, destroys people's savings.
*  So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.
*  And I suppose this is one of the things that's supported by Keynesian economics.
*  This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics, is to try and find an endless
*  array of explanations to explain why inflation is a good thing.
*  Well, it could be the chicken and egg.
*  So that's the cynical take.
*  This is a propaganda machine to sell the government's narrative.
*  The less cynical take is this a bunch of economists who are telling who.
*  Who figured out this thing and it happens to be good for banks and governments.
*  And just because it's good for them doesn't mean.
*  And it justifies the existence of government and your basic, I don't think it's your basic
*  assumption, but a foundational principle of your thought is that a lot of government is
*  not a good thing.
*  Your first gut instinct, government bad.
*  Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice, who probably beats you on the intensity
*  and how quickly he says government bad.
*  So there's a potential argument for government good.
*  Some government is good.
*  Maybe a lot of government is good.
*  Maybe we need a lot of centralized management for resource allocation and so on because
*  we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.
*  So there is an argument for that that exists.
*  You probably disagree with any possible argument on that side.
*  But anyway, so why is that idea of Keynesian economics wrong?
*  I'm going to focus for this on the money idea, the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.
*  The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that without inflation, people wouldn't spend and
*  then the economy would come to a grinding halt.
*  And that's nonsensical because people spend not because they want to keep this magical
*  monster called the economy going.
*  People spend because they need to consume because that's how we live.
*  That's how we survive.
*  You need to eat.
*  You need shelter.
*  You need clothes to keep you warm.
*  And as technology advances, the capabilities of the things that we can do with our time increases,
*  and so we want to buy more things.
*  So people buy things because people want to consume.
*  There's a limitless desire to consume.
*  There's no shortage of reasons for people to consume, whether it's food or Ferraris or
*  private jets.
*  People just always want to buy more.
*  Can I interrupt just really quick?
*  What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future where they might want to buy things,
*  but they're really afraid because it seems like there's a lot like a pandemic going on
*  or whatever it is.
*  That's good.
*  So fear of uncertainty is good.
*  You have too much fear.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  What I was saying is I was making the point that we don't need to be motivated to consume.
*  We have the insatiable desire to consume.
*  Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.
*  Everybody would like to have a bigger house.
*  Well, not everybody.
*  Some people have a big enough house, but everybody would like a house.
*  Everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things, electronics, machines.
*  We don't need a desire to consume, but of course, the limit on how much we consume is
*  opportunity cost.
*  Why don't you buy a Ferrari?
*  Well, because that's really expensive and it would mean that maybe you do have a Ferrari,
*  but most people don't buy a Ferrari because it's too expensive.
*  They can't afford it.
*  They'd have to work too hard to get it.
*  If they do get it, it might mean that they can't afford their house anymore.
*  So we have to economize.
*  That's a good thing.
*  And we have to also think of the future.
*  And so humans consume.
*  We don't need more motivation to consume.
*  We have to deal with the economic reality of the things that limit us from consuming more.
*  So what Keynesians present is that when there is a problem in the economy,
*  like there was after World War I, the problem is always caused by the inflation.
*  And what the Keynesian hucksters do is that they look at the consequences of inflation
*  and blame it on people not spending enough.
*  When people are doing the rational thing, the money is...
*  So there was inflation, caused an unsustainable boom, it caused the recession.
*  And now a lot of people lost their jobs and they don't have enough money to go out and spend
*  frivolously.
*  So they save for the future.
*  The future is uncertain.
*  That's a good thing.
*  That's how you fix things.
*  You begin the recovery by...
*  Well, you lost some wealth, so you spend less.
*  Like if your business goes bust, if you lose your job,
*  it's natural and smart that you stop spending money on the frivolous thing that you used to spend.
*  And you save it for the future.
*  You invest in something else, you get a new job.
*  And then once you've recovered, you start spending more.
*  This is very sane and very good.
*  And it's the way to recovery.
*  But essentially, the Keynesians have used this as a justification for more inflation.
*  Because inflation is an addiction.
*  Once the government gets down the path of spending money to solve its problems,
*  then every problem looks like it can be solved by more inflation.
*  And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.
*  And of course, the Keynesian economics is based on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.
*  And this is the key point.
*  It's portrayed in the textbook as if it's just this scientific breakthrough.
*  Somebody in the 1930s, this genius came about and realized that,
*  oh, we don't actually need gold.
*  We don't need hard money.
*  We can actually just print all the money.
*  And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin, flimsy, idiotic justification
*  for what governments were already doing for 20 years.
*  They'd already gone off the gold standard.
*  And they'd gone through 20 years in which they were lying to their population,
*  telling their population, we're still on a gold standard,
*  but there are problems caused by various random things.
*  But don't worry, we're going to be going back on the gold standard.
*  20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,
*  they come up with this justification for why, oh, actually, the gold standard was bad.
*  And this is a really pernicious thing about it is,
*  the problems that were caused by us going off the gold standard
*  were caused by the gold standard.
*  And we're going to fix them by going off the gold standard even more.
*  Just because government is lying and it's shady and it does these kinds of things
*  doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong.
*  So just because I wanted to separate a few things you said.
*  It could very well be very wrong.
*  And they could indeed be hucksters.
*  All of these colorful, such colorful language.
*  I love you deeply for this.
*  This is fun.
*  Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's like somebody like Krugman doesn't
*  use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.
*  It's just that when actors like him use it, it's presented as if it is legitimate,
*  because he's, you know, he's part of the major shows.
*  So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make of Austrian economics
*  and the case they make for Keynesian economics is based on empirical evidence.
*  So Austrian economists are high in the sky, theorists about like how human nature works.
*  And it's just all theory.
*  And just like you said, Keynesian economics kind of sell it as a science, data-driven science.
*  So where's the data, bro?
*  So one way of saying it is how do you know if we get rid of inflation?
*  How do you know if we get rid of central banks?
*  If we push towards that direction, we will have a better world,
*  a better functioning economy, better functioning markets, better functioning society.
*  This is another inaccurate way in which they present the economics.
*  They present it as if it's just theory and the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.
*  What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory, data is mute, data is dumb,
*  data can't say anything.
*  Theory first and then you have to have models to provide context for interpretation of data.
*  It's a sign of just how little self-awareness they have that they think
*  that they're just being led by the data when they're being led by Keynes's moronic theories.
*  They use the data to justify those theories and to stick by them.
*  And in fact, they are the ones whose theories cannot be refuted because it's just government
*  mandated religion.
*  According to Keynes's nonsense, the way that they justify the inflationism is this,
*  and I'm just using this to give an example of what you're talking about in terms of theory.
*  The way they justify the inflationism to tie it back to the original point,
*  they justify, all right, we need money to spend.
*  And then the level of spending in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.
*  And I've taught macroeconomics at university level for a while, so I know this.
*  I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians know, Austrians, if not all of them,
*  I guarantee you.
*  So the way they see it is the level of spending in the economy is what
*  determines the state of the economy.
*  There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.
*  So there's like the factories on the one side that are churning out goods,
*  and those goods have a certain quantity and value, market value.
*  It's completely nonsensical, of course, because how can the value of the goods produced be
*  different from the value of the spending?
*  But let's put that aside for a second.
*  So the amount of spending that happens in the economy determines the state of the economy.
*  If the value of the production, which they call Y, is higher than the aggregate expenditure,
*  so this is the production and the aggregate expenditure is lower,
*  then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods.
*  And then that causes a recession, the factories start laying off workers,
*  and then the laid off workers start spending less,
*  and then that leads to aggregate expenditure dropping even further.
*  And so it's a vicious cycle where the economy gets into recession.
*  And the only way out is for Keynes' bankster buddies and government buddies to print
*  a lot of money to give to themselves.
*  And then that will...
*  That's one interpret.
*  But to print more money to increase the expenditure, to match the supply.
*  To match the level of output.
*  Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.
*  All right.
*  Even though you're saying huckster, so...
*  Yes.
*  The way...
*  I love you very much, but just for people who are listening,
*  I love the way you talk and it's great and keep doing it, but just for context,
*  I don't know anything that involves human nature deserves this level of certainty.
*  At least my position is that we don't know what the hell we're doing on basically anything.
*  Perhaps.
*  But I mean...
*  There's a lot...
*  Certainty can get us in trouble, is my worry.
*  I don't know much about economics.
*  I don't even know financial systems, monetary systems.
*  But I've just seen us get in trouble with human psychology.
*  Certainty.
*  Certainty of ideologies in general.
*  You mentioned Marxism and so on.
*  I came from the Soviet Union.
*  There's a lot of people that are very certain throughout the history of the 20th century
*  that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for.
*  So I'm nervous around certainty.
*  I could be wrong, but you ask me for my opinion.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Sorry.
*  So that little bit of a caveat.
*  So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand, you have the level of...
*  The other situation is when the level of spending is higher than the amount of aggregate output.
*  In that situation, you have too much spending,
*  so therefore what ends up happening is inflation.
*  So according to the Keynesian worldview,
*  this is really important because this is a way that I'm going to get to your point about
*  empirical data and to show you why they're not correct.
*  Yeah, they're not correct about what they say about empirical data.
*  So then what this means is that there's a level of output and there's a level of aggregate
*  expenditure.
*  The aggregate expenditure can either be higher or lower than the output or equal to it.
*  If it's higher, we get inflation.
*  If it's lower, we get recessions.
*  Okay?
*  So is there any universe in this model, is there any potential universe in which you can have
*  both inflation and a recession?
*  According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?
*  Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher and lower than output.
*  So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person, if you were looking at evidence and trying
*  to analyze data, you'd look at this and say, one example, you just need one example of high
*  inflation and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?
*  And of course, the world is full of examples of high inflation and high unemployment.
*  And that's what happened in the 19th, and of course, they ignored it when it happens in
*  poor countries because poor countries don't really matter.
*  But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US and in the Western economies and the most
*  advanced industrial economies.
*  So historically, before then, you had all these Keynesian central bankers talking about this
*  model and saying, well, aggregate expenditure is too low now, and that's why we have unemployment,
*  so we need to print more money.
*  And then they print more money, inflation goes up, but also unemployment goes up.
*  Because this model is broken.
*  That's not how the world works.
*  That's not the level of aggregate spending in the economy is not a lever with which you can
*  control inflation and unemployment.
*  So what would a scientist do?
*  What would a non-Huxter do in this case?
*  Admit the theory is wrong and find another way to reformulate it.
*  Have the Keynesians done that?
*  No, still the same garbage in the textbook that is being taught until today.
*  So is it possible to have a non-Keynesian model?
*  One that still supports moderate amount of inflation is good for the economy.
*  I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened, yeah, this is what basically most
*  fiat economists, as I like to call them, essentially anybody at a university financed
*  by governments, which is financed by central banks, which is fine.
*  I will talk about that.
*  The effect of fiat money on our life, as you write about in your book,
*  fiat standard, one of them is education.
*  I'm sure we'll disagree there too.
*  Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.
*  So yeah, a whole bunch of other models came up, but basically it's such an example of
*  motivated reasoning.
*  Anybody who's got a familiarity with the scientific method or who's got an engineering
*  background who comes into economics immediately has a lot of red flags.
*  I remember when I used to teach macroeconomics, I used to teach introductory macroeconomics,
*  and it's a course that would be taken by econ majors as well as engineers.
*  A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.
*  I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff, and every time I'd explain it, there's always
*  that smart engineering kid who just looks at me and says, sir, this doesn't make any
*  sense because this and this and that.
*  I'm always like, you get it.
*  Exactly.
*  You're correct.
*  Because if you have any kind of shred of scientific thinking, you see that this is all
*  motivated reasoning.
*  The answer is government needs to print money.
*  Here's a whole bunch of models brought up by people for why government printing money
*  is good.
*  And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion is that you only get funded if you come up
*  with this conclusion.
*  If you come up with a conclusion that we need to shut down the central bank, you don't get
*  funded by the central bank.
*  You don't get published in the journals.
*  You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.
*  You don't get quoted by fiat publications like the New York Times and CNN.
*  They don't invite you on as an expert.
*  Well, that's a fundamental flaw with a lot of institutions we have today, human and
*  throughout human history.
*  Let me zoom out for just a second to the big question.
*  What is economics in general?
*  What's the goal?
*  You said there's a bunch of models.
*  Any economist basically trying to throw a bunch of models about human behavior on the
*  table and try to generalize it to the global scale.
*  So both dance between micro and macro somehow in order to determine public policy and explain
*  the past, predict the future, prescribe policies that can control the future, those kinds
*  of things.
*  That's the big basic ridiculous question of what is economics?
*  Economics is the study, the way the Austrians define it is the study of how humans make
*  choices under the condition of scarcity.
*  We begin with the starting point of economics is the fact that scarcity exists.
*  And why does scarcity exist?
*  Well, because it's easier to want things than it is to make them.
*  It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.
*  And so because we have wants and we have limited means to meet those wants, we need to economize.
*  It's a permanent marker of the human condition.
*  We are always economizing at all times.
*  And so how people make those decisions under the conditions of scarcity is what economists
*  study.
*  So to go back to your point on empiricism in Austrian school, so it isn't that the
*  Austrians don't believe in data.
*  On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.
*  And in fact, if you think about it, as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,
*  if you have stagflation, that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.
*  The Austrian way of thinking, which is think from first principles, understand how the
*  world actually works, think about how humans act, and understand that economics is really
*  all about human action.
*  So it's not about aggregates of goods.
*  This is really the key distinction in terms of methodology.
*  For the Keynesians, it's physics envy.
*  They look at the market economy, that they could individuals in the market economy,
*  and they think that they can understand the market economy by looking at aggregates.
*  This is really the key point of what I think makes a certain branch of economics pseudoscientific,
*  is the introduction of aggregates.
*  When you introduce those aggregates, how much production takes place, how many people are
*  unemployed, the percentage of the inflation rate, and then you think that you can establish
*  scientific relationship between those aggregates, it's purely physics envy.
*  In physics, for instance, or in chemistry, you put, let's say, a container that contains
*  a gas, and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT, calculate the pressure, calculate
*  the volume, and then the temperature.
*  If you have the pressure and the volume, you can calculate the temperature because you
*  have the nR constants.
*  There's a clear relationship that has been demonstrated in the laboratory, and that we
*  can do it right now.
*  We can measure it, and we can see it, and it continues to hold.
*  All it takes is one scientist to show that this relationship does not hold, to do an
*  experiment that shows this does not hold, and it stops being a law of chemistry, and
*  it's broken.
*  Whereas in economics, what they've done is they've copied the superficial shape of this
*  without any of the scientific rigor that was used to build it.
*  There's no experiments.
*  You can't experiment on economies.
*  We don't have the ability to establish laws, and all the laws that we establish are just
*  models that get people published and get them on the media to say, my model says we need
*  to print more money.
*  But it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.
*  If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes because the world is full of examples
*  that contradict them.
*  Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny when it's human nature when you can't, when
*  there's a nearly infinite number of variables and you can't control them?
*  What's the best thing you could possibly do?
*  You do thought experiments.
*  But the problem with thought experiments, you know, Freud thinks everybody wants to
*  have sex with their mother.
*  Is he right?
*  That's the problem with Freud.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he's right.
*  Well, obviously, I'm joking on that front, but the-
*  Freud is probably under the canes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.
*  Just like Einstein, you know, a lot of general relativity, special relativity, that's a thought
*  experiment.
*  It originates in a thought experiment.
*  Now, is it true?
*  You know, nice thing about physics, you can't eventually have experimental validation.
*  The downside of economics is you really can't have experimental, like definitive experimental
*  scientific rigor of validation of a theory.
*  So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.
*  Using your intuition, it's the power of reasoning together by human nature.
*  And that's why economics cannot make the claims that physics can make.
*  So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas at this pressure, at this volume,
*  the temperature will be that much.
*  And you can make that prediction and test it a million times and you'll always get the
*  precisely correct answer.
*  With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.
*  On Twitter, and even today, you're very certain about the statements you're making.
*  Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.
*  That's the thing.
*  In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.
*  We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.
*  But we can understand how the world actually works with humility.
*  This is really the key difference that the Keynesians think they just want to copy the
*  methods of physics.
*  And then that's just, you know, going to give them the certainty of the results of physics,
*  which is like me saying I'm just going to put a red blanket on my back and jump from
*  the fourth floor because I'm Superman.
*  Well, it's not the red blanket that's going to make me Superman.
*  It does a lot more to it.
*  So humility manifests itself in economics as the belief in a free market, meaning like
*  I can't centralize, I can't do centralized control on this thing.
*  We're going to minimize the friction of the free exchange of goods.
*  So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.
*  Yes.
*  And you could arrive at it through two paths.
*  The more practical path, which most scientific minded people arrive at.
*  I came from an engineering background.
*  So I initially had this idea that what is lacking in economics is
*  mathematicization.
*  We need to have better math models.
*  We need to get all of those tools from engineering, apply them to economics, and then
*  we'll be able to plan the world economy and make it work better.
*  And then you start actually trying to solve problems, trying to actually calculate them.
*  And you realize nobody can have that ability because the difference ultimately comes down
*  to the fact we can't have experiments.
*  And the reason we can't have experiments is that you can experiment on particles of a gas.
*  You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.
*  And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.
*  And so you kick matter in a certain way, you can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.
*  Human beings are much more complex.
*  They have a will inside them.
*  And this is really the humility to understand that you are a human being and other people are
*  also human being just like you.
*  And that every person wakes up every morning and they have a million things in their mind,
*  a million things they care about, a million things they want to do.
*  And you will never be able to make the decisions for somebody else,
*  let alone for millions of other people.
*  So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion that free markets are better
*  because you realize that all of the people that think that they can centrally plan
*  markets can't actually do that.
*  And that there's really nothing scientific about them except essentially the rituals they ape
*  of the scientific process.
*  And the other path I think that makes you arrive at the Austrian perspective or the libertarian
*  perspective, I should say, is simply the notion of individuals as having their own inalienable
*  right to decide what they want to do with themselves.
*  The only way that you can give yourself the idea that you get to be planner is ultimately
*  you think you're better than other people.
*  You think your choice, your judgment, overrides mine.
*  And I don't think that's a defensible position.
*  I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.
*  I will never want to force anybody to do anything they don't want.
*  The Keynesian perspective, the central planning perspective is unlike physics,
*  which is let's force a bunch of particles to sit in a lab so that we can study them.
*  In economics, you're forcing people to do things.
*  Let's stop these people from doing this job because it's bad for the economy and let's
*  get them to do that job.
*  Let's force them to pay this price.
*  Let's tax them this much.
*  Let's prevent them from using gold as money and force them to use our credit as money.
*  So it has to rely on coercion.
*  There's no central planning without coercion.
*  And coercion is a crime, in my opinion.
*  There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.
*  Politics from an ethical perspective, your view is, I mean, perhaps broadly speaking,
*  the libertarian view is coercion is unethical.
*  Freedom is essential.
*  What are the pros and cons of government intervention in the economy?
*  So can you provide pros?
*  You just kind of provided arguments against.
*  Is there any arguments to be made for government intervention, for the role of government in
*  society?
*  Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective, what is a positive role of
*  government that you can imagine you can speak to?
*  I can repeat many other cases, but I don't find any of them compelling for the reason
*  that I mentioned, which is that ultimately they all rely on putting a gun to somebody's
*  head and using the threat of force.
*  So that's, for me, can never be justifiable.
*  Whatever the ends are, if the means are violence and the threat of violence, then the ends
*  aren't justified.
*  Everything that's good, governments will use as an excuse to justify coercion.
*  So what do you like?
*  You like motherhood and apple pie?
*  Well, government needs to ensure that motherhood works well, and we need government central
*  planning of birth.
*  We need regulations on birth, for instance.
*  We need regulations on how people give birth.
*  We need to ban people from giving birth in traditional ways that have been tried for
*  thousands of years.
*  We need to force people to do things in the modern scientific way.
*  So what about things like that all of us use infrastructure, for example, or education,
*  or, well, the economy too, right?
*  Can you make a case for the role of some large scale centralized systems, whether it's
*  government or not, that do this kind of management?
*  I guess perhaps you could say there's the economies of scale argument that some things
*  must exist at a very large scale, and therefore you would want political accountability of
*  the people who manage them.
*  This is kind of the argument that's given for infrastructure monopolies.
*  For instance, roads or electricity.
*  Let's say we live in a country.
*  We need one power plant.
*  The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.
*  And there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business.
*  So we're going to have to have one power plant.
*  And since it's only one power plant, then we can't just let anybody own it because
*  then they're going to make it too expensive.
*  So we need to have the government own it so it can make it too expensive.
*  And you don't find that case compelling?
*  Not at all.
*  I used to believe in it.
*  I was pretty much a Keynesian when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.
*  And I don't find that compelling at all because I think all these examples that they
*  mentioned of natural monopolies or economies of scale that can only fit at a scale of
*  government, it's always, you know, government bans people from opening power plants.
*  And then there's only one power plant and they need to be in charge of it.
*  But in reality, no, in reality, power plants can exist at all kinds of manners of scales
*  of operation.
*  And yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization in power plants in particular
*  because there's efficiency in generation.
*  You know, one big power plant is more efficient than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.
*  But there's also inefficiencies in centralization because the more centralized
*  and the bigger the plant is, the further away a lot of the population is going to be.
*  So you're going to be losing a lot of the electricity and transmission.
*  And you believe the free market is best in managing that dance, that balance of centralization.
*  Exactly.
*  And if we do end up in a situation where there's one power plant for an area, then, you know,
*  if the market ends up centralizing all of it into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem.
*  There are places, you know, there's a small town with only one barbershop.
*  Is that a catastrophe?
*  No, because they don't need two barbershops.
*  Now, if that barbershop started to take advantage of people, started to charge higher price,
*  well, then that's just an opportunity for others to step in and put them in their place.
*  And that's the same thing with power plants.
*  It's the same thing with everything.
*  Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.
*  From the central planning perspective, they'll present you the problem as it is,
*  and they'll tell you, well, this is bad.
*  So the fix, you know, and what we can do is better.
*  So let's stop what's bad and do what is better.
*  Two problems here.
*  Usually, the reason that the thing is bad in the first place is because it is a government monopoly.
*  It's because of government intervention.
*  But the second thing is that this notion that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong
*  and make it better is it ignores the fundamental underlying reality, which is that what you're
*  doing is you're offering only one way for this problem to be solved and making all other solutions
*  practically illegal.
*  You're taking taxpayer money.
*  You're putting guns to people's heads to take their money to use it to build, say,
*  this one solution for a power plant.
*  But you're preventing the free market process from providing us with other alternatives.
*  Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective.
*  But in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism for the solution that you propose
*  and enforce by, as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head.
*  You're accountable for that choice, for the quality of that solution by being voted out
*  if the solution is actually bad.
*  So it's just a different selection mechanism.
*  I think I personally believe it is a selection mechanism that has worked in the past.
*  It just often does not work nearly as well as a free market.
*  The question is, are there domains in which the free market gets itself into trouble?
*  So this theoretical view is that that's the point of a free market, is it doesn't,
*  if there's trouble, that's a signal and it will respond to that signal and it will respond
*  appropriately to make you try to maximize happiness.
*  The question is, is there a local optima that free markets get stuck in and need governments
*  to represent the broader scale of the people to get outside of that?
*  I think the fundamental problem here is the idea that there is a feedback mechanism
*  when there is coercion in one party, when one party can employ coercion and the other one cannot.
*  So in other words, I'm going to put a gun to your head, I'm going to take your money,
*  and I'm going to use it to buy more guns for me to put against your head.
*  But somehow, you're going to put a paper in a box and that's going to deactivate my guns.
*  Well, love requires a push and pull, a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship.
*  Yeah, I mean, good luck to anybody who's going to be dating you if you think putting a gun to
*  people's head is comparable to a relationship. All jokes. But yes, I mean, people don't often
*  think of it as government and the military as gun to the head. But that is sort of a libertarian
*  perspective because ultimately when you, you know, turtles all the way down and at the bottom there's
*  guns. Yeah. So at the bottom, if you don't want to pay, if you don't want to, you know, all right,
*  I don't want to be part of your power plant. I want to get my own generator. I don't want to do it.
*  I don't want to pay for it. You go to jail. You can't not pay for it. That's really the
*  asymmetry which the market doesn't have, which is why in my opinion, it's not as if, you know,
*  I'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea that I want a market and that the government can't work.
*  It's presented as if, you know, we're choosing between two different machines. You know, should
*  we use an Apple or a PC? And I'm just constantly choosing one of them and saying that the other
*  one can't work. It's not equivalent. It's not two machines. We're comparing between a machine and
*  a gun to the head. And we're comparing between a situation in which anybody, anywhere is free to
*  provide the service or the good. And anybody anywhere is free to buy it from them or reject
*  to buy it from them. So anyone can build a power plant. Anyone can succeed at it. Anybody can fail
*  at it. Anybody can build it in a way that I can choose to take part in or not take part in. I can
*  build my own. So we have a situation in which 10 million people, let's say, they each can freely
*  choose to provide the good or to buy the good. That cannot be considered an alternative on an equal
*  footing to a situation where one person or one entity gets to decide for everybody and those who
*  disagree go to jail. So the problem is that the alternative to governments is other large successful
*  entities that have humans in them. And human nature is such that there's corruption, manipulation,
*  and so on. I think free market depends on the honest communication of information as widely
*  as possible so people can make great rational decisions. But my fear is that the proposal is
*  that in general there's manipulation, whether it's government, whether it's companies. They're going
*  to manipulate, they're going to try to do propaganda. They're going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,
*  shut down competition by playing games, human games of different kinds. And sometimes even meaning well.
*  It's not like everybody thinks they're doing good and they're actually doing evil. So how do we
*  prevent the worst of human nature coming out in a free market as well? By not giving the worst of
*  human nature a monopoly on violence in the institution of government. That little inkling
*  of coercion, that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.
*  Yes, and it ends up just being the place where corporations, individuals, free markets, they
*  can't coerce without the resort to government. So you think about all the examples of corrupt
*  corporations doing bad things. It's always because they have certain privileges from governments.
*  As it exists, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, all of these giant corporations, they can't do anything to me
*  without government. They can't take any of my money and they can't force me to buy their stuff.
*  And so it doesn't matter to me. So if Coca-Cola is corrupted, that's a problem for Coca-Cola
*  customers. That's a problem for Coca-Cola shareholders. That's a problem for anybody
*  who deals with Coca-Cola. But as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff and isn't a shareholder,
*  I have absolutely no interest in what happens. They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care. I
*  don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder. So in this situation where you choose to
*  voluntarily associate with people and you only give your money to people you want to voluntarily
*  give the money to, so you either buy their product or invest in their production, in that situation,
*  the only way that a company can get my money is if they build the product that I value or if they
*  convince me that they are going to use it in a way that's profitable. And I may be wrong. I may
*  invest in a company that fails or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent,
*  but that's my fault. It's my fault that I gave them my money and then it turned out to be scoundrels.
*  But it's a totally different problem when we make it mandatory. It's violence. It's a crime to
*  put a gun to my head and force me to subsidize companies and force me to come at certain
*  conclusions. Do you find an interesting distinction, you mentioned Michael Malice,
*  between anarchism and libertarianism? So this particular use of violence,
*  like last resort, this policing force that libertarianism is okay with and anarchism is
*  not okay with, so basically nation states that keep you safe from the worst of war.
*  Yeah, I think to be more accurate, the distinction between anarchism and
*  minarchism, I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term that can encompass both.
*  Means a lot of things, okay. On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum, where do you...
*  No, no, I'm full anarchist. You're full anarchist.
*  Yeah, full anarchist. I mean, I don't find any justification for the use of force and I think
*  recently perhaps I've maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting senile, maybe I'm getting wise,
*  who knows, but I'm beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy. So I'm an anarchist.
*  Monarchy. Which, what is that?
*  King's royal. Oh, monarchy.
*  Yeah. And I think... Wait, are you joking or not?
*  No, I'm not joking. And I think, I mean, I think morally and intellectually, I'm an anarchist,
*  but the reality is we find ourselves in a world in which a lot of people are not. And the question
*  is, what is the thing that is going to provide you with more freedom? And I think I'm recently
*  coming around to the idea that monarchy might be the best way to provide people with the largest
*  amount of freedom because to have a free society, you need a majority perhaps or a plurality of
*  people to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas, to have a low time preference,
*  to have a preference for the future. So you need a majority of the population to not decide to go
*  and do something insane in order to continue to have a free society. When a respiratory illness
*  comes along, unfortunately, the last couple of years showed that the vast majority of people are
*  going to freak out and lose their mind and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.
*  And there's always a current thing and the media is always telling you that we need this
*  current thing as an excuse for more and more government power and more and more government
*  coercion. What's the role of kings and queens in that case of a monarchy? What's the role of a
*  leader? I think there might be a case that... So as I was saying, you need a majority of the population
*  to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case, the answer is voluntary. No matter how bad
*  the disease is, it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home. You want to stay home, stay home.
*  You want to wear a mask, take a vaccine, do whatever you want, but you can't force others
*  to do that. So you need a majority of the people to strongly believe in this principle in order
*  to get it in a democracy. Whereas in a monarchy, you really just need the king to get it. And I
*  think the reason kings are more likely to get it is that kings have a low time preference where they
*  think about things for many generations. Whereas in a democratic system, your president is likely
*  only going to be there for four years or eight years or 10 years or five years or whatever it is.
*  So the only way that all humans are self-interested, so the only way that your
*  president in a democracy can provide for themselves is to maximize the amount of exploitation that they
*  can do of the population during their brief stint. And then when he's out, you get a new one,
*  and then that one wants to start all over again. So every four years, you get a new robber. With
*  monarchy, you sign up for a multi-generational subscription to the same family. And when they
*  have the security of knowing that his great-grandson is going to be taking money from your
*  great-grandson, suddenly his interests and yours align because they both want your great-grandson
*  to be prosperous and have enough money for his great-grandson to take. So-
*  It's a monarchy with a tiny government. So anything required to really provide for a free market,
*  so for maximizing individual freedom and the freedom of the economy.
*  Yeah. And if I were a king, which is highly unlikely to ever happen, but I think if you look
*  historically, the dynasties that have succeeded had lasted for a long time. The key thing that
*  they managed to do is to basically be libertarian. The key to being a good king is to just leave
*  people alone. Let them do whatever they want. Don't rob them too much or rob them as little
*  as possible or maybe even don't rob them. And as a king, use your power only to punish people who
*  aggress against others. Don't use your power to enrich yourself and enrich your friends.
*  And that's really, if you look at smart kings, this is what they do. This is what they teach
*  their children. And the cycle of kingdoms is that the first king understands this, builds the empire
*  and the first couple of generations, they get this and the society is free, the economy is free.
*  And because of that, there's peace and prosperity. But then over time, the next generation of
*  kids become a lot more high time preference. They haven't worked hard. They don't understand the
*  meaning of hard work. So they become more likely to engage in destructive behavior. So raise taxes,
*  pass laws that require people to do things, even when they're not hurting anybody. And that ends
*  up basically eventually destroying the kingdom. Of course, power corrupts. You have to kind of
*  create human institutions that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader from expanding. So
*  going back on the original promises and the purposes of your position. And then distracting
*  using tools of technology and communication to distract the populace while you expand the power.
*  Exactly.
*  All right. You wrote the fiat standard. I think we danced around it quite a bit, but I don't know
*  if we actually defined it. So what is fiat money? What is the history of how it came to be?
*  The fascinating history of the birth of the fiat monetary system is something that really only got
*  uncovered in 2017. This is extremely, extremely interesting. In 1914, Britain joined World War I.
*  And if you remember your history books, it's famous that this was called the August Bank holiday.
*  It was just going to be a few weeks where the British troops were going to go and
*  kick European ass and come back triumphant. And most European countries believed that.
*  But then the war kept on dragging on. And of course, to finance the war,
*  the government, this is what they used to do under the gold standard, governments would
*  issue bonds. So you'd issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds, the money would be used
*  to finance the military, and then the government would pay off the bond over the next five or 10
*  or 20 years. So for World War I, the British government, the British treasury issued bonds
*  for financing the war. And this only came to light in 2017. Only a third of the bonds were
*  actually subscribed. So people, British people, and this is perhaps the greatest thing that they've
*  ever done, they decided fighting a war in Europe is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.
*  It's a stupid thing. Why should I go and fight? Because the Austrians and the Germans and the
*  Serbians are at each other's throats. I'd rather invest in something else. So they only bought a
*  third of the bond issue. And then the astonishing thing that happened, which really set the tone
*  for the next century of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation, was that the Bank of
*  England went and got two of the high ranking officials in the Bank of England to buy the other
*  remaining outstanding two-thirds of the bonds under their own name with a line of credit from
*  the Bank of England. So it wasn't their own money, but they took money essentially from the Bank of
*  England, bought two-thirds of the bonds that financed the war. And that was how England was
*  able to keep going into the war. So that's essentially what they did is what we today know
*  as quantitative easing. Back then, they printed money from the Bank of England, or printed credit,
*  gave it to those two employees. They bought the bonds. The government could fight the war.
*  Sounds like it's a nice idea. And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself, he himself said
*  he wrote a letter to the Bank of England that was uncovered recently. And he said,
*  I congratulate you on this masterly manipulation. I quote it in the book. Masterly manipulation is
*  what he called it, that they basically managed to buy the bonds using the money of the government.
*  And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works because he never could ask the
*  question of, okay, and then what? All right. So we just printed money to buy two-thirds of these
*  government bonds. What's going to happen next? What could go wrong? Not a question Keynesians
*  ask themselves because their jobs depend on not thinking about what's going to go wrong.
*  RG So a quick question about war. And as somebody who's been nonstop reading and thinking about the
*  wars of the 20th century and thinking that most of those wars were unjust, unethical, and destructive,
*  how else do you find, how would you finance a war?
*  KS Ideally you don't. No, but I mean, of course, there are sometimes, you know, you want to fight
*  for self-defense. Yeah, you finance it, taxation or bonds. RG So the people really need to want to
*  war not just with their voices, their thoughts, their tweets, or their actual financial investment.
*  KS Put up the bullets and the cost of the bullets and the bodies.
*  RG So their life and their financial well-being.
*  KS That's how it was under the gold standard mostly, because under the gold standard,
*  the government couldn't print gold. And so they had a budget, they had a certain amount of gold.
*  And that wasn't just, you know, that they couldn't infinitely increase it. They couldn't tax their
*  population at will. And it's very difficult to take money from people, you know, you go knock on
*  doors and search everybody's home, see where they're hiding their gold. It's very complicated. On the
*  other hand, when you gave them paper money, which is what the case was in 1914, you could take their
*  wealth just by printing the money. And that's what changed everything when it comes to war.
*  That's why the 20th century was the century of total war. Because under the gold standard,
*  governments fought until they ran out of their own gold. Under the fiat standard, with paper money,
*  with credit money, governments fought until they ran out of liquid wealth in the hands of all of
*  their citizens. So let's find flaws in this thinking if there's any. Okay. There's a lot of
*  pacifist type of thinking in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding. Hitler framed
*  himself as a victim of the past, of history. He never attacked anybody. Everyone's always threatening
*  to attack him. That's kind of the narrative. And he keeps expanding. He keeps sweet talking with his
*  charisma, all the countries around him into sort of embracing pacifism. Stay out of the war until
*  the war is on your doorstep. So France, just very suboptimal military strategy from the perspective
*  of many European nations in response to Hitler. They were basically hoodwinked by his words.
*  So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill, who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,
*  from some kind of economics perspective, saying, we're not going to back down. We're going to fight
*  Germany. And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons that Hitler failed in his expansion.
*  Um, that decision to fight back,
*  how, what's the right way to do that? If you're a Winston Churchill, what's the right way to do that?
*  If you're, um, to, uh, to fight back evil when violence is required. Now you could argue that,
*  um, that no war is just, but there are such a thing as a just war index. And, uh, a lot of
*  people argue if there is a just war in the 20th century, it's world war II. So how would you fund
*  your Britain, the war would, would you require Winston Churchill to convince the populace?
*  Like don't fight until they're fully convinced that this is the right thing to do. You can't
*  just make a decision for them. You have to convince them fully so that they give their life and
*  they give their money to support the war. Is that the right way to do it? I think so. And I think
*  when you have a true, um, threat and a true evil and a true force that people really do think is
*  genuine, you don't need to convince them. I mean, when, when, when it's real, people will want to
*  fight and people will want to pay to fight. And, um, I mean, I think though on this particular
*  example, I think, you know, that the best way to fight Hitler is to have not fought world war one
*  and not take out the Kaiser of Germany. If, if Britain hadn't, and Britain in the U S had not
*  gotten involved in world war one, which really is the senseless war about nothing, what, what,
*  what was in it and what was the goal from anybody fighting that war. If you look at it,
*  after world war one, there were very minor adjustments in the borders of the countries
*  that were participating. So, um, Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land, but really
*  it wasn't all that, uh, massive. And it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like Britain wanted to
*  take over Germany and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.
*  So there was no real value from that war. And that's why the British people didn't want to take part
*  in it. And that's why if they hadn't done this enormous, the criminal manipulation of, uh,
*  printing money to buy the bonds, Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war. Germany would still be
*  a kingdom and Hitler wouldn't rise. And yeah, there'd be a small changes in the borders of
*  various European countries. I struggled to see how it could have been worse. I mean, I struggled to
*  see who benefited from four years of carnage in Europe. And then this was, this came at the height
*  of civilization. You know, before that, the people of Europe had, um, had the golden era under the
*  gold standard. They were trading with one another, they traveled and technology was advancing and
*  they did not expect this war to last this long. And, you know, my favorite story from world war
*  one is the Christmas truce, um, football game, which I mentioned in my book,
*  British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict, they stopped on Christmas day and they
*  played a football game against each other. I mean, this is not a real war where it's, it's, it's,
*  it's a war for survival. Britain didn't want to end Germany. Germany didn't want to end Britain.
*  It was just Kings who were emboldened by the fact that they had a printing press playing with the
*  lives of the people and, um, take that away, take away the printing press, take away their ability
*  to print money. I think, uh, we'd have had a much, much, much better 20th century.
*  Yeah. The counterfactual history and Neil Ferguson is a historian who gets in quite a bit of a trouble
*  basically, uh, well, he's a Brit suggesting that if Britain stayed out of world war one,
*  there would be no Hitler. There would be no world war two. Yep. I agree entirely.
*  But fiat money. Yeah. So how fiat money was born? Yeah. Let's get back to that.
*  So they finance the war with that money. So what is, what could go wrong? That's where we left off.
*  Well, what could go wrong when you've just printed an enormous amount of credit and use it to buy,
*  uh, bonds? What goes wrong is that the value of the currency is going to go down. Or in other words,
*  prices of things are going to go up. So during the war prices keep going up and this is of course,
*  it's going to sound very familiar to victims of the 20th century.
*  Government tells you it's because of the war. It's not our fault. It's because of the Germans.
*  It's because of the foreigners. It's because of Putin. It's because of this. It's because of that.
*  This has always been the case. There's always, um, war is a very good cover for inflation,
*  which is caused by monetary phenomena. So then the war ends and inflation prices have more than
*  doubled over the past four years, over the four years of a, uh, world war one prices more than
*  doubled. And then the British economy is in bad trouble. Obviously, you know, it's lost a lot of
*  the labor force for four years that was out there fighting. Now those workers come back, you've got,
*  prices are up. And so people are requiring that are demanding that the government control prices
*  and the government is trying to fix the problem of inflation by doing price controls, which is
*  what they always do, which is catastrophic because it makes things worse. When you implement
*  price controls, you are, when you make, you know, you need to say, all right, well, bread can't be
*  sold for more than X, uh, price. Well, that's just preventing bread producers from producing a lot of
*  bread. And that's just making the problem worse. If you let the price rise, the extra price, it,
*  first of all, it makes people economize. So people will only buy what they need. And it provides the
*  money for the bread producers to acquire the capital and the resources they need to produce
*  more bread, which then brings the price of bread down, but price controls destroy that.
*  Then they also implement wage controls. So you want to also make sure that people have high wages.
*  So you raise people's wages artificially, you lower prices artificially, and you cause an economic
*  problem. And this, this is basically, you know, I use this historical example because it's the birth
*  of fiat because the bank of England was the most important monetary system in the world at that
*  time. And because it's the prototype that basically the entire planet copied over the last hundred
*  years, we've had this same thing happen. The government prints money because of a stupid
*  reason, because somebody in power decided this was worth destroying everybody's livelihood and
*  savings for. And then the consequences come in and then they start covering up with price controls,
*  wage controls, and then that makes things worse. And then they, and of course, throughout all that,
*  they're promising that we're going to go, oh, and also the other thing that they did,
*  which I mentioned in the chapter is they stopped people from using physical gold and they confiscated
*  the physical, well, they didn't confiscate it, but they took the physical gold and they gave people
*  paper. So I call it the fiat white paper, you know, in Bitcoin we have the white paper. The fiat white
*  paper was that the bank of England announced to all of its banks and post offices that from now on
*  you should not make payment in gold and you should take payment in gold and you should encourage all
*  your customers to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead. Is there an actual document?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice. Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff. Obviously nobody really likes to
*  talk about this stuff because, you know, they're fiat economists, so they don't want to talk about
*  the original sin, but- Well, you should, you should like republish it as the fiat white paper or
*  something like that. There's a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne. So in the 1920s,
*  I think his name is Montagu, he was the chief of the bank of England, he commissioned one of his
*  secretaries, John Osborne, to study what the bank did during the World War I and it was a study that
*  was kept under wraps, confidential, in the bank of England, only released in 2017, almost a century
*  later. What was special about 2017, by the way, it was a year, it was just a year in which
*  some of this information was released. Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements
*  of the bank of England and found this and published it and now you can download it as a PDF and find
*  all of the amazing details. So they confiscated the gold and they forced people to use the paper
*  and they promised people that as soon as the war is going to be over, this is temporary, we're going
*  to be back to using gold. And of course, if you told people in Britain, this is the real scam about
*  fiat, if you told people in Britain in 1914, hey, we're going to go off the gold standard
*  because it's better. I mean, there might've been lynchings of government officials because the
*  British pound at that point, it had been the global currency of the whole world and the fact
*  that they'd managed the bank of England had kept the British pound at a fixed rate next to gold
*  since Newton, the exchange rate, the value of the British pound was set by Isaac Newton himself.
*  He was the warden of the mint and he made the pound a specific amount of gold. And since then,
*  up until World War I, it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold. I think I might be wrong,
*  but I have it in the book. So he'd set that price and it was a matter of national pride for
*  people in England. The sterling is as good as gold because for two centuries it has been
*  stuck to gold. There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars, but for two centuries, mostly,
*  it was stuck to that. And so they went off that and then they couldn't go back because they wanted
*  to go back. They didn't have enough gold. They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war
*  and they had printed a whole bunch of money that was out there. So this begins the problem
*  for England and that begins the end of England as the world's superpower.
*  And the way they tried to fight that was to get more and more countries around the world to
*  establish central banks and have unholed British pounds. So they'd hold them, basically dumping
*  their bags like just any other shit coin. If you get people to buy your shit coin,
*  that raises the value of your shit coin. So- Can you define shit coin?
*  Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin is that it's any form of money
*  where somebody can produce it. So soft money?
*  Not necessarily, I guess. I think the difference- So there's easy money, but the shit coin is
*  something that someone can produce at a cost that is different from the market cost. So gold, nobody
*  can make gold except that they dig for it and the cost of mining gold is generally in the range of
*  the price of gold. Same is true for Bitcoin. So gold is not a shit coin?
*  Gold is not a shit coin. And the copper is?
*  I'm not so sure. I wouldn't call copper a shit coin as much as it is easy money, but I think
*  government currencies and other altcoins I think are shit coins because
*  somebody could click a button and make 10 times the supply.
*  Would it be fair to say that this began with the will for war in World War I? So the
*  march towards fiat began with a global desire for war in the 20th century. Did war start this
*  or was war a result? It's difficult to say really. I think it goes both ways. I think
*  you can't have permanent war without fiat and I also think there's a case to be made that you
*  can't really have fiat without war. So it's some kind of weird dynamical system with a chicken and
*  egg situation and they build on top of each other and there's a few individuals that figured out
*  there's a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game and it escalates and nothing gives
*  you the ability to manipulate money quite like war. When you have a war you can declare an
*  emergency, you can call all the people who oppose you traitors, you can get people to support you,
*  not because what you're doing is good but because you play on their sense of tribalism.
*  In your book you do cost benefit analysis. So you do acknowledge or think about the pros of fiat
*  currency. Can you do just that, look at the benefit and look at the cost just broadly at
*  the highest level? So the way that I write the fiat standard is that I try and
*  analyze it as an engineering system in the same way that I wrote the bitcoin standard. So with
*  the bitcoin standard I looked at bitcoin from first principles and tried to explain how it works for
*  a reader that doesn't really have much of a background in computer science, networks,
*  or economics. I thought I'll do the same with the fiat, let's just ignore the official stories
*  and look at how this thing actually works. I think it does have value in the fact that it,
*  the reason that they were able to pull it off is because it was not possible for people who don't
*  want to be part of it to use gold independently of governments. This is really the key thing.
*  Gold is just very expensive to move around and the fact that it is expensive to move around means
*  that there's inevitably going to emerge institutions where it is centralized in physical location
*  and then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold. So really the gold standard
*  is going to be the most important part of the fiat system. The fiat standard
*  intrinsically must involve credit as becoming part of the monetary system. It has to be the credit
*  and because it gets centralized it can easily be captured by the government. So to be fair,
*  the benefit of the fiat system is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around, which is
*  pretty significant. Generally moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic is going to cost somewhere
*  gold bar. So you move it a hundred times back and forth between the Atlantic, you need to pay the
*  whole gold bar, the cost of the whole gold bar to move it a hundred times across. Well, with fiat
*  money, it's essentially government credit and so it's just sending a message from one central bank
*  to another and you can move it halfway around the world. Is there also something to be said about
*  the cost in time? So you're saving, you're reducing the friction of the communication as well. Exactly.
*  Of the transactions as well. Exactly. It's faster. How big is that benefit? Because wouldn't you
*  argue that that potential is the thing that enables modern economy, both the speed and the
*  low cost, so increasing the scale and the frequency, the speed of the transactions?
*  Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard. However, it isn't as if you couldn't have
*  fast transactions built on top of gold. So you could have gold being used for final settlement
*  and you could have banks settling with one another essentially using credit. Can you define
*  settlement just for people who are outside of this world? Because we'll mention that word
*  quite a bit probably. Good question. So the way that it works is let's say right now I'm going to
*  pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card. So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card within a
*  few seconds that I've sent you the money and then that's yours. But it didn't also happen in those
*  10 seconds that my bank, which could be in another country, sent the money to your bank into your
*  account. There's a lot of infrastructure underneath that. So what actually happened is that I have an
*  account with my bank and you have an account with your bank. And when the message is communicated
*  from my app to yours, my bank crosses out the money and your bank credits you with the money.
*  And then at the end of the day, week or month, banks in the same city will settle with one
*  another. Banks in the same country will settle with one another. And banks from different countries
*  will settle with one another. So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours at the end of
*  the day or week or month. They'll tally all of the money that was sent from one bank to the other
*  and then just settle the difference. So it turns out at the end of the month, my bank had sent
*  $15 million to your bank and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank. So they give them $1 million
*  and that settles it. That finalizes the transaction. So final settlement 3D is like the,
*  you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system. And then you can think of these things
*  as being the higher layer levels. And you had a wonderful discussion about that with Michael
*  Saylor. So the final settlement is like the moment when you paper and ideas connect to physical
*  reality. Or to some representation of physical reality. Yeah. And under gold, everything was
*  tethered to physical reality because there was a market commodity at the bottom of all of this.
*  And nobody could print that market commodity. And so at the end of the month, if your bank
*  made too many payments, if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning. If you were
*  reckless, if you were insolvent, you went out of business. So there was no way to fool that.
*  But then we moved to the fiat century and everything is credit. At the end of the day,
*  the final layer is government credit. And so as long as you're friends with the government,
*  basically you never go bankrupt. So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way into
*  getting into a position where they don't get bankrupt. So in part two of the fiat standard
*  called fiat life, you describe the effects of fiat money and a bunch of things like life, food,
*  science, education. What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money on our world, on our life?
*  So it's taking a step outside of the monetary system, actually like how that affects our life
*  from this book. There's a whole bunch of things and I won't be able to go over them and I highly
*  recommend reading the book. But if I were to pick one, I would say it's the impact that it has on
*  our time preference, on our valuation of the future. So remember when we started the discussion,
*  I said a key function of money is that it serves as a store of value. And the harder the money is,
*  the better it is at providing us with a way for providing for our future. And so the harder the
*  money is, the less we discount the future. We always discount the future compared to the present.
*  So if I told you, I'm going to give you something today versus giving it to you 10 years from now,
*  the same thing, you would prefer to take it now because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next
*  10 years. So we always prefer the present to the future. There's always a discount on the future.
*  And that discount is called time preference. The degree to which we prefer the present to the
*  future is called our time preference. So the higher our time preference, the less we care about the
*  future. And the process of civilization is the process of lowering our time preference,
*  where we start caring more for the future. We start prioritizing the present less and less.
*  So we start being able to not consume everything that we have and store it. And so money is
*  essential for that. And under the gold standard, everyone in the world had the ability to provide
*  for their future by simply using the same money that they use. You would work a day and you would
*  get paid in a gold coin and you could take that gold coin and keep it safe for 10 years and know
*  that at the end of those 10 years, that gold coin would buy you slightly more than what it bought
*  you the day that you earned it. So anybody could provide for their future and anybody could have
*  very high degree of certainty that whatever they're saving is going to be there when they want it in
*  the future. Because the money supply was only increasing at one and a half percent, whereas the
*  production of goods and services was increasing for most cases, for most periods at a higher rate
*  than that. So you could buy more apples and oranges and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years
*  than you could at the beginning of the 10 years. So everybody had a way of providing for the future.
*  And with that, people lower their time preference and that is reflected across all aspects of life.
*  I think it's not just the economic thing. You see it in the savings rate, the ability to deny
*  your self-gratification today. I could take the money that I have and throw a giant party,
*  buy a sports car, buy a yacht. And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to keep it so
*  that tomorrow I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht or have a better life or give my
*  children a better life. So all of human civilization really is the process of us lowering our time
*  preference and finding harder monies that allow us to provide better for the future is how we
*  really technologically we do that. I think of the hardness of money as being the control knob for
*  our time preference. And you can see this reflected in the 20th century, where we go from the money
*  supply increases at around one and a half percent under gold to this current situation where over
*  the last 60 years around the numbers on money supply and fiat, the global fiat supply has
*  increased at around 14% per year. So we've done a 10X in the increase in the supply of money annually.
*  And 14% is a weighted average. So if you take a basic numerical average for all fiat currencies,
*  you get something like 30%. The average fiat currency increases by 30%. But if you value it
*  by the volume of each currency so that you're not giving equal weight to the Venezuelan Bolivar
*  increasing at 500% a year and the dollar increasing at 8% a year. If you do it by
*  value of the currencies so that you get the total supply of fiat, it's something like 14%.
*  Unweighted is 30%, you said? Yeah, 30%. It's insane. I'd like to see the worst ones,
*  the people that are tracking the average up. Yeah. But 14% is still an incredibly high,
*  high number. And so you're saying that that's the average over the century or the past 100 years?
*  Over the past 60 years, 1960 to 2020, we get World Bank data on that, pretty reliable data on World
*  Bank and European Union OECD data. I ran the numbers on that weighted average, something like 14%.
*  And what effect that has on time preference? The effect is now it's much, much, much harder
*  for everybody to provide for their future. Everywhere in the world, it's much harder.
*  How do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin that I could just put under my mattress and expect
*  it to be there 10 years from now? Well, gold itself isn't cutting it. Gold can't keep up with
*  inflation. And the reason for that is that gold is not being used as a money anymore in that.
*  You can't send it internationally. You can't use it to settle trade internationally, which therefore
*  means demand for it monetarily is limited. And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal.
*  And as a result of the fact that its value doesn't keep up with inflation, it becomes economical to
*  use it in industry. So we're seeing gold become like silver in that it gets used in industry. So
*  the stockpile declines. And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well. And it becomes more and
*  more of an industrial metal. And it can't protect your wealth over time very well.
*  So what do you do? Well, you could invest. And this is kind of the obvious answer that
*  Keynesians will give you is, well, you just put your money in an investment. But investment is
*  different from saving. The whole point of saving is that the thing is liquid and that the thing
*  carries little uncertainty. You just held the gold coin and it just sat there. It did nothing. It
*  didn't take risk. You knew that it was going to be there in 10 years. Investment means you give the
*  gold coin to somebody to go and do something with it. And it could work. It could not work. If it
*  works, you get a positive return. You get more gold back. If it fails, you might not get any of
*  your gold back. So taking on risk is something very different from saving. Saving is just a way
*  of buying the future. Investing is taking on a risk and you could lose everything with it. So
*  what ends up happening, and this is the Keynesian objection, I think is very wrong and bad because
*  investment is a job in itself. To figure out what to do with your money in order to beat inflation
*  is something that there are professionals out there on Wall Street that have PhDs in finance,
*  that have enormous computers, and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees
*  and math nerds that are crunching numbers and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio so
*  that you can beat inflation. And guess what? The majority of them don't beat inflation.
*  The majority of them can't beat inflation, not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,
*  but if you remember- 14%.
*  Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%. If you look at just the increase in the money supply,
*  which I think is a much better metric, and this is what's reflected on the desirable goods. If you
*  look at the price of real estate in Miami Beach, as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,
*  it goes up at around 6-7% per year on average over the last century. So that's, if you want to live
*  in a nice area, that's what's happening to real estate. If you want to go to the good universities,
*  that's what's going on. It's going up at a rate that's similar to the increase in the money supply.
*  And you can beat CPI, but CPI is designed so you can beat it, but you can't really beat
*  the appreciation in the things that you actually want to buy, in the price of good food, the
*  price of good real estate. And most investment professionals fail at doing that. So what hope
*  does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist or an athlete have in doing those things?
*  Investment is hard and saving should be easy.
*  Exactly. Saving is essential for us as a civilization. And what Fiat did is it took
*  that away from us and then it forced everybody to become an investor or more accurately a gambler,
*  because the money itself is broken, because the money itself is constantly changing in value.
*  Investing is becoming more of a crap shoot. Value investing is completely underperforming
*  compared to market analysis. You listen to the Fed and what matters to the price of
*  individual companies is monetary policy much more than it is their own performance.
*  So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed and following all of the world's central
*  banks and you need to learn macroeconomics and you need to learn what all the central
*  banks are doing and you need to understand how commodity markets work and you need to
*  understand how equity markets work and bond markets and real estate markets.
*  You need to do all of those things just in order to be able to save and earn and keep
*  the money that you've already earned. That's the criminal thing about it. I've already earned that
*  money being a doctor, being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer. I built a house for
*  somebody and I got that money and all I want to do is just make sure that I can have it 10 years
*  from now. The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer because you have to spend half
*  your time not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time learning about Japanese central
*  bank monetary policy and commodity markets and what's going to happen to copper and what's going
*  to happen to oil and what's happening in the wars and what's happening with foreign policy and
*  Russia and the US and all of those things. Under the gold standard, you didn't care about any of
*  that stuff. Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things. What this means is
*  the future, so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned, but also
*  it means that the future becomes much more uncertain. You're far less likely to provide
*  for yourself 10 years from now. I'm far less likely to find an easy way to give yourself
*  value 10 years from now and so you become more short-termist. That is reflected economically in
*  a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline, but it is also reflected in all manners
*  of decision-making. I think if you really want to see what it is, take a look at a society that
*  goes through hyperinflation and look at what happens there. How do people change under
*  hyperinflation and compare that to essentially what we see in the 20th century all over under,
*  not hyperinflation, but under low inflation. 10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time
*  is just slow motion hyperinflation. What happens in hyperinflation? Everybody gets their paychecks,
*  they run straight to the supermarket, they spend all of their money. Nobody thinks about savings.
*  Nobody thinks about the future. Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.
*  How likely are you to be planning for what you're going to be doing five years from now?
*  Very unlikely, but also it's reflected not just economically, it's also reflected in all aspects
*  of morality and all the way in which we deal with each other as human beings. When your survival is
*  precarious, how much are you invested in the notion of being a good citizen, on caring about
*  your reputation, on caring about not getting caught in a crime. All of these things become
*  harder to value. People start committing crime, people start caring less and less about the future
*  and we see it reflected in everything. I argue you see it reflected in architecture. We used to
*  build houses in the 19th century that last until today and then in the 20th century we build essentially
*  disposable cardboard boxes that get scrapped in 20 years. What can you say about potential positive
*  effects of lower time preferences? It's a balance. Basically you're talking about an average
*  kind of time preference, but there's some things in life where low time preference can be a negative
*  thing. If I want to take on risk, not for investment, for a kind of investment, but say I want to start
*  a business. I want to take something crazy, take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.
*  What can you say about that kind of leap? Taking on debt, what's the value of that within the
*  current system? What's the right approach to that within the current system? What's the right approach
*  overall from an economics perspective? It's not saving for the future. It's doing something
*  wild. Taking the money from your mattress, taking on debt and having a dream in your heart that you
*  somehow just want to do. Maybe it's not the wisest investment decision, but it's something
*  as being human. It's taking a leap into the unknown because something in your heart says to do it.
*  I think you're more likely to be taking the leap in the unknown when you have a little bit of gold
*  in the mattress than when you don't. I think this is the thing. If you look at the late 19th century,
*  and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard, that was arguably the most innovative period
*  in human history. There's qualitative evidence. Look at the world around you today. Pretty much
*  everything that we use was invented in that period. The car, the airplane, the telegraph,
*  the telephone, the camera. Pretty much modern life as late 19th century. The period between
*  1870 and 1914, because the whole world was practically on a gold standard. The whole world
*  was using the same money and the whole world could save in the same currency. That meant that a
*  bicycle shop owner, two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina could go and try and
*  fly, even as all the scientific experts in 1903 were confirming that the possibility of flight
*  has been debunked as unscientific. Lord Kelvin said, not in a million years we're going to be
*  flying. Thomas Edison said, it's never going to happen. No, I think it was Edison who said a
*  million years, but Kelvin also said, it's never going to happen. The New York Times said, it's
*  never going to happen the same month in which the Wright brothers did it. They continued to deny
*  that it happened even two years after they did it. Why could they do that? Because they had savings
*  in gold. They had the security with something that you know is going to be there, and then you can
*  take a risk with the stuff that is extra. I have say three years' expenditures in gold under my
*  mattress, and I know that I could take a risk with everything else, because whatever bad things
*  happen with all of my dreams, like even flying, think about how insane that is, I still can go
*  back to the three years of gold that I have saved. Still okay to take on debt, given the stuff,
*  the gold under the mattress? Well, this is the thing. Under the gold standard, the way that people
*  financed things was predominantly with capital, with equity. Because you had gold savings,
*  I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings, when you wanted to start a business, you could
*  use your own savings or somebody else's savings. You didn't need to get into debt. Well, you could
*  get equity from others, and you could also get debt from others. But it's directly mapped
*  to physical reality. Yeah, it's directly mapped to economic reality in that there's a hard money out
*  there. What you're spending money, you want to build your airplane factory, you need to get
*  actual resources, so you get actual gold, either yours or somebody else's. You borrow it or you
*  give them equity, but there's real resources. Now, what happened with the fiat system, and this is
*  the first part of the book, where I look at it from an engineering perspective, is essentially,
*  and I think this is like the breakthrough inside of the book, what fiat does is that it replaces
*  gold mining with credit creation. The way that we make fiat money, the way that fiat is mined into
*  existence is through credit creation. Most people think of fiat money as being something that
*  happens when government prints money, and we still use the term government's printing money,
*  but the vast majority of fiat is not physical. And in fact, fiat is not created when it is printed
*  physically, it's created when it is lent. So when you go to a bank to get a $1 million loan to buy
*  a house, that bank is not going to give you a million dollars from their own money or from
*  their depositor's money. They're going to make a fresh new million dollars. When you walk out of
*  that bank, the money supply has increased by $1 million to finance your home. So what fiat does is,
*  I mean, it was basically born out of government credit and the credit of banks that are backed
*  by the central bank and the government. So if you're part of the institutions that are allowed
*  fiat privilege, where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank, backed by the currency,
*  you are effectively creating new currency, new money every time you issue the loan.
*  That's fiat mining is credit creation. I love it. So can you say something? I mean,
*  you can't really have credit without a demand for credit. You can't really have an increase
*  in supply without a demand for it. Is there any value you place in like the humans wanting it?
*  Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit, wanting to take big leaps, big risks,
*  big entrepreneurial decisions. So is it all credit bad?
*  No, I think what's bad is, you know, anything in my opinion, anything that is consensual,
*  you know, I want to borrow money from you and we agree the terms, I can't object to that.
*  As long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that. But in the case of the fiat system,
*  it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement. Everybody who uses the currency
*  is forced to be part of that agreement. Because if you default, you know, effectively what's
*  protecting the bank from you is the fact that the government can just print a bunch of money and
*  make the bank whole. So effectively-
*  Interesting. So that little agreement between the bank and you is actually an agreement between
*  the bank, you and the entire populace that's using the currency.
*  Exactly. They're forced to provide the safety net for you and me to go and make that loan.
*  And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency. That's how the whole thing actually
*  works. So this is why, you know, I wrote the Bitcoin standard explaining Bitcoin and basically
*  the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can
*  because this is the best money that has ever been invented.
*  And we'll talk about that, why Bitcoin is the hardest money.
*  Yeah. But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard, and again, this is not financial advice,
*  I'm a lowly academic, you shouldn't listen to me on issues of money, but I think theoretically
*  and intellectually, the conclusion of the fiat system is you need to be short fiat as much as
*  you can. That's the smart winning move. So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save,
*  try and not borrow as much as you can, try and accumulate as much savings as you can.
*  That's reversed under fiat. If you're saving money, you're just subsidizing everybody else
*  taking on loans. If you're taking on loans, you're benefiting from all the people that are borrowing.
*  So the winning move under the fiat system, and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.
*  Rich people under the fiat monetary system, they don't hold assets. If you're worth a billion
*  dollars today, you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account. You've got maybe a hundred
*  thousand, a million, five million or something like that. A tiny fraction of your money is held
*  in cash. The majority is going to be held in all kinds of other hard assets, and you're going to
*  be borrowing. The richest people in the world are the biggest borrowers in the world, the most
*  powerful entities in the world, the governments are the biggest borrowers in the world.
*  That's how they are the richest and the most powerful, because every time you're borrowing,
*  you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money. So you're devaluing everybody else's money
*  and you're getting a bit of the cut. If you're going to buy a house with your savings, you're
*  accumulating the savings and they're losing value. If I were to go to buy the same house with credit,
*  I'm getting the bank to print money for me. So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.
*  And that's why it's much cheaper for everybody to buy with credit. That's why everybody buys
*  everything on credit. So when we look at the global monetary system, the thing you want to do
*  as a government is be the sexiest currency out there. So the main currency, like the dollar
*  currently is the one that has the most power in that kind of context. So you have, if you
*  try to summarize what is the global monetary system as it is today, is a bunch of fiat currencies
*  battling for position, for use outside their nation and in so doing trying to gain power in
*  the geopolitical sense. If we just zoom out, what is the global monetary system? What is it currently?
*  Outside the United States, the whole thing. Yeah, you could say that, but I think it's more
*  realistic looking at how it has actually evolved over the past few decades. It's really a dollar
*  system. It's not a system of currencies, if buying with one another, it's a dollar system.
*  And all other currencies are just basically, I like to call them dollar plus country risk.
*  It always returns home to the dollar. Yeah, there is no competition. There is no second best,
*  as Michael Saylor would say. And money is like that. Gold was a winner take all by the end of
*  the 19th century. The global monetary market is effectively a winner take all for the dollar.
*  And if we get it to Bitcoin, you'll know I also think digital currencies are also going to be a
*  winner take all situation. So money wants to be won. In fact, there is no such thing as multiple
*  currencies. Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter. Money is won. If you go back to
*  a system of several currencies, you're just reinventing barter. So in the case of the dollar
*  system, the global dollar system is built around the dollar because all central banks have dollar
*  reserves. And because all central banks use the dollar clearing mechanisms. So that's why you're
*  basically playing in the dollar system. This seems to have changed over the last couple of months.
*  With the sanctions on Russia and the confiscation of Russian reserves, it remains to be seen what
*  that's going to do and how that's going to change. But it is looking like this dollar system is
*  clearly unsustainable. It's not sustainable for the US. It's not sustainable for anybody.
*  Speaking of which, so you do an amazing podcast called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.
*  Episode 108 of that podcast is about the very thing you just mentioned. And allow me please
*  to read the description of that and then ask you a couple of questions about your thoughts in general.
*  The description reads, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US confiscated the Russian central
*  bank's significant monetary reserves and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network. Serious
*  questions are being asked about the survival of the post-war dollar-based world monetary order.
*  Will Russia, China, and other countries actually build an alternative international settlement
*  system after years of threatening to do so? Will global central banks stop accumulating US treasury
*  bonds and replace them with gold and commodities? Will we witness the birth of a new commodity of
*  gold-based monetary order? In this seminar, we use the insights from the Bitcoin Standard and the
*  Fiat Standard on temporal and spatial solubility to explain why reports of the death of the dollar
*  and the emergence of a new gold standard may be exaggerated. So I would love to get your analysis
*  on this situation. What are the fundamentals of it? What is SWIFT? What are the possible future
*  evolutions of the global monetary system? Yeah, so SWIFT is the network that the US Federal Reserve
*  uses for moving money around the world. So basically, the US government can sanction you
*  off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks, as they've done with Iran, and as they've done with
*  Afghanistan. So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe of the current monetary system is
*  that in order to be able to trade as a member, as a citizen of your country, you need your monopoly
*  local central bank to be on good terms with the US government so that they would let them operate it.
*  And this is really like on top of the aspect of the hardness of money. This is the other
*  really powerful thing about Bitcoin, which is that it's just purely a technological thing. It
*  doesn't matter if you're Russian, if you're Iranian, if you're American, if you're Chinese,
*  it's a technology. And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car. You operate it properly and it
*  works. And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing. It doesn't care about your passport. If you have
*  the private key, you click send and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go, but effectively,
*  it does go anywhere at once and the money can move without having to abide by political situations.
*  And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy, much as that might be deserved. I'm just
*  going to discuss it from a kind of technical perspective. It has to be a political system
*  with fiat because ultimately it relies on credit. And then the government is the one that has the
*  guns and the government is going to decide who gets to pay their loans anyway. And the government's
*  have to make its own rules about who gets to play and who doesn't. And so it has to be political
*  as this kind of fiat system. And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard, initially I used to be
*  much more of a gold bug. And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years saying the global
*  monetary system is going to collapse next week and we're going to go back to a gold standard.
*  And writing the fiat standard gave me a very good appreciation for why this hasn't happened
*  and why it's not very likely to happen. I think the reason is, as I said earlier,
*  just gold is very expensive to move around and perhaps more importantly, it's very expensive to
*  verify. That's really the problem with it. It's very expensive to verify that the gold that you're
*  receiving is original gold. So the only way to do this properly is to melt the gold bars down
*  and recast them, which is pretty expensive. So we have this situation now where Russia,
*  which is one of the biggest economies in the world, has been kicked off to varying degrees off the
*  global monetary system and the US has confiscated their reserves. And I don't have political opinions
*  about the war. It's not something I'm very familiar with. It's outside of my area of expertise.
*  I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it. On the one hand, whether you think the war is
*  justified or the sanctions are justified is not something I can opine on. But the implication of
*  this is that effectively the US might be shooting itself in the foot because it's telling everybody
*  in the world, your money in our system is not really your money. It's just a token to play in
*  our arcade. At any point in time, if you misbehave, we kick you out of the arcade and we take your
*  tokens. And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran, and many countries have made
*  a lot of noise about over the past decades. It got real this year, but it's been decades of China,
*  Iran, and Russia to some extent saying that we want to build an alternative to the US dollar
*  based system. And yet they haven't. And I think there's very good reasons they haven't. And the
*  reason is, what do you do with it based on? How do you build it? So you can do a credit based system
*  based on, but then who's going to be the big boss? Is it going to be China? Is it going to be Russia?
*  Is it going to be Iran? Is it going to be India? None of these countries want to be, they don't
*  want to jump out of the US based system to get into somebody else's base system. So China doesn't
*  want to use the Russian system. Russia doesn't want to use the Chinese system. And so therefore,
*  you can't use their own central bank's currencies. Don't you think they have enough leverage?
*  India, China, Russia combined with several other nations have enough leverage and incentive to
*  create their own system. So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate. Yeah, but then,
*  okay, so what are you based on? Who's going to be the boss? Who's going to be the one who can-
*  In this case, China, right? Because China is becoming increasingly an economic power in the
*  world that it's hard to deny. Yes, it's true. And it's the most likely scenario perhaps,
*  if we were to witness something like this is going to be a Chinese based system.
*  Is it possible to have like a split in what is the driving currency of the world?
*  It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable. Again, money wants to be won. And that's the kind
*  of thing that I argue in that seminar. So we could see this emerge based around the yuan. And,
*  likely, Russia is obviously going to hurt economically from what happened from the
*  confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions. So it's not going to be in a position.
*  And of course, because it's outside of the US based system, it's not in the strongest
*  negotiating position with the Chinese. So the Chinese might be able to get them to join their
*  yuan based system. But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run because these
*  governments can issue their laws and make their designs and then make their monetary systems.
*  But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people and billions of dollar based people,
*  and they're going to want to trade with one another. And the power to want to trade with
*  one another is too strong. We can't just split the world economy into two monetary systems that
*  don't trade with one another. So then they're going to want to trade with one another. Or the
*  dark possibility is the inability to trade as opposed to being a forcing function for trade,
*  it becomes a forcing function for conflict in cyberspace and potentially hot war.
*  Yes, this is the scary part of it. And this is basically how World War II happened. Because
*  there's an old historian who used to say when, I think his name is Otto Mallory, and I quote him
*  in the Bitcoin standard, if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will. If people trade with
*  one another, they have an incentive for each other's wellbeing, and then they have less of
*  an incentive to fight. And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s because of the failure
*  of the fiat system that brought about the rise of the populism, the rise of all those leaders that
*  hated each other and helped finance the war and bring it about. So that is the scary possibility.
*  And of course, you can't discount that with all of the escalation that you see, that is a possibility
*  that it could turn into a real war. But then even so, I think ultimately, you can't fight wars
*  forever. It's going to end at some point. And we're going to be back at square one, or well,
*  not square one. We're going to be back at the same dilemma of who's going to have the global
*  monetary system. And so one alternative is that what the Chinese and the Russians could do is
*  they could base it on a commodity. So a lot of people are now saying, well, they're going to
*  base it on copper and corn and agricultural commodities. And that's the analysis of
*  saleability that we discussed in the Bitcoin standard and the fiat standard. I don't think
*  that's workable. If you end up basing the monetary system on copper, as we said earlier,
*  doesn't matter how many governments say that we're going to make a new monetary system based on
*  copper grains and nickel and iron and so on. It doesn't matter. You're going to have to
*  stockpile those things in order to make a market in them. And then if you stockpile those things,
*  you're just raising their value, inviting the producers to make more, flood the market. I
*  hope they don't try this because it's going to be a devastating, devastating impact on the world
*  economy. You're going to have central banks bidding up the price of essential commodities
*  that people need for real uses in order to back their currencies with them. And then just
*  incentivizing the producers to make more and more and more of it, and then bringing the price back
*  down. So it's going to be a very expensive mistake where we raise the price of copper,
*  destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper. It's not just copper, but also food,
*  and then increase the supply beyond what we need. And the end result is copper miners make out well,
*  governments go broke, and we end up with a lot of rust and copper in government warehouses. That's
*  why I don't think it works to use commodities that are not monetary commodities. Then the question is
*  maybe gold. Can we go back on another gold standard? And Russia seems to have done that.
*  I'm not so sure. It's very difficult to get reliable information. I'm trying to look into this more,
*  but they seem to have said that they're fixing the price of gold in rubles. So they will buy and
*  sell gold at a fixed ruble rate, which effectively means you're on a gold standard. Now I'm not sure
*  how serious this is, how they managed to stick to it, but it seems to have stabilized the ruble,
*  and in fact brought it back to its pre-war level, which I found absolutely astonishing,
*  considering all the sanctions going on. But in the short run, it's obviously much better than
*  having your currency pegged to nothing. But in the long run, I also don't think gold is going to cut
*  it in the 21st century. Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move and
*  go into the digital space and the blockchain and go with Bitcoin?
*  I think the point of this discussion is that we run through all these other options. A Chinese
*  system, why it probably won't work, a commodity-based system, why it won't work,
*  and a gold-based system, why it won't work. I think they might have to learn this the wrong way,
*  the hard way. But eventually, I don't see them doing it now, but eventually I think
*  the winning move is going to be to go on a Bitcoin-based monetary system.
*  I don't know if everything always has to be the hard way.
*  I'd love it not to be, but it doesn't look like there is any kind of desire in China or in Russia
*  to switch to a Bitcoin-based system. To take a leap to Bitcoin.
*  So unfortunately, I think we're going to go through a few years, maybe many years of
*  learning the lesson the hard way of trying to accumulate these commodities and seeing
*  the limitations that make them unsuitable as money today.
*  One of the things I'm really concerned about is the tension, the amount,
*  the increasing amount of hate in the world and the increasing amount of power centers in the world
*  between which hate is making a regular appearance. Because the weapons of war are becoming more and
*  more powerful as they have been in the past many decades. I'm really concerned about nuclear war.
*  Let us see if Bitcoin can fix this. Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.
*  First rule of Bitcoin is if it's a problem, Bitcoin fixes it.
*  Well, I have some personal questions for Bitcoin then because I have some.
*  My life is pretty fucked up, so I'll have to try to see. Quick pause for bathroom breaking.
*  Sure. Let's return to the basics. What is Bitcoin? We started with what is money,
*  what is Bitcoin? We talked about hard money, inflation, fiat, the history of money,
*  the history of war in the 20th century and that takes us into the 21st century. What is Bitcoin?
*  Bitcoin is a software and it's a distributed software to operate a peer-to-peer network between
*  members who are all equal on the network. They're all peers. What this software does is that it
*  allows you to operate a payment network between those peers and that payment network has its own
*  currency. That seems like just a simple software game, but the reason this is such a big deal is
*  I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form of money ever invented. The reason for that comes
*  from two properties that this network has. The first one is that the currency is the hardest
*  money ever invented. It's the money whose supply is the most resistant to inflation. It's the first
*  monetary asset that we've ever invented that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply that cannot
*  be increased beyond a certain number. There's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins. That's
*  that's a qualitative leap forward in our technologies of money. All of our monies leak
*  essentially because people can always make more and more and more of them. The best money is the
*  one that leaks the least, which is gold because it only leaks one and a half percent. In other words,
*  your share of the gold stock is diluted by one and a half percent every year. Ideally,
*  you'd like it to be zero. Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero. It's the first
*  money that we've ever had that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply. There'll never be more
*  than 21 million Bitcoin. I think that's a huge deal because as I said earlier, money is always
*  whatever is the hardest to make and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make. Then the second
*  property, which is extremely important as well, is the fact that it operates without the need to
*  trust in anybody. It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it. It doesn't have a central authority
*  that can, as I said, it's peer to peer. It only has users. It doesn't have any admins.
*  There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin that can take your Bitcoin, that can stop you from
*  using Bitcoin, that can change the rules of Bitcoin. They can't make more of it. It's fixed.
*  It's available for anybody in the world. It's the hardest money ever invented. It is absolutely,
*  I think, an enormously, enormously significant invention because if you read the fiat standard
*  and the Bitcoin standard as well, you'll see my perspective for why I think a very large number
*  of problems in the world are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation, and caused by government
*  having access to essentially an infinite recourse to people's wealth. I think Bitcoin fixes this
*  because it allows us to have money that has the saleability of gold across time, meaning it holds
*  its value across time like gold, but much better than gold. But also, it is similar to fiat in that
*  fiat can travel quickly, but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat. So it combines gold's
*  saleability across time with fiat's saleability across space in one immutable package that nobody
*  can change and nobody can control. Can you define the word saleability? Saleability is
*  the essential property of money. It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,
*  specifically to be sold without much loss in its value. So houses are great for living in,
*  but they're not very saleable. If you want to sell a house, you can just click a button and sell a
*  house and have a giant market of people buying houses from you. You need to find somebody who
*  wants the exact house that you have with the exact specifications that you have.
*  Because houses are not identical, there's no liquid giant market for people to just buy and sell
*  identical houses from. So gold, for instance, has good saleability as money because it's a liquid
*  good, it's uniform, and people are always buying it. Fiat dollars have great saleability because
*  everybody's always buying and exchanging dollars for other goods. So if you have a $100 bill,
*  you can easily get rid of it and you'll get $100 worth of stuff for it. If you have $100 worth of
*  stuff, it's harder to get rid of it. If you have $100 worth of phone, it's not as easy to spend it
*  as a $100 bill. That's saleability. What do you mean that Bitcoin, I understand that Bitcoin is
*  the saleability of gold across time. Better even, yeah. Better, yes. Like on the order or whatever.
*  And then it has the saleability of fiat across space. What does that mean?
*  So if you remember when you asked me what is the advantage of fiat, what is the
*  advantage it offers us, it's cheaper to move fiat across space than it is to move gold. With
*  the current fiat monetary system for all of its flaws, you can send money. I could send money
*  from my bank account in the US to a bank account in China in a couple of days, or in Britain,
*  in France in a day or two, which is much faster than you could do with gold and much cheaper than
*  you could do with gold. But in reality with fiat, the reason Bitcoin improves on that is that with
*  Bitcoin, you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours. So you send the Bitcoin
*  transaction, you get six confirmations in an hour, you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on
*  average. With 12 confirmations, you're pretty definitely clearly safe on this. So within a
*  couple of hours, you could send a billion dollars across the ocean and have final settlement on them.
*  It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation that's going to need weeks and months to settle,
*  which is the case with fiat. So it is faster than fiat effectively. So it's harder than gold and
*  faster than fiat. That's a good way of putting it. One other aspect of Bitcoin, I have to ask,
*  to me on a human level, it's fascinating, is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,
*  an anonymous founder. There's no leader. So that's another aspect of the decentralization,
*  it's leaderless. Yeah. So unfortunately, it's not a monarchy. Fortunately. Or fortunately, yes.
*  Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think? And first of all, is it you?
*  It definitely is not me. I don't know who it is. If it was, would you tell me?
*  That's a trick question. I know, trick question. But I mean, everybody who knows me knows I can't
*  read the code. So you would say that even if you could. But do you think it's one person? Do you
*  think it's multiple people? Is it interesting to you? Do you think it's fundamental to the coin
*  itself to not the coin, the entirety of the concept that it's founders and animus? And how
*  much guts do you think it takes if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?
*  I've considered all these questions many times. It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer
*  to all of them. I don't know who it is. And I don't know why he or them or she are not spending
*  the coins that they most likely have. I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi is
*  the fact that he's not there. And this is what's truly astonishing about it. The most important
*  fact in Bitcoin is the fact that the creator has disappeared and the thing has continued to operate
*  now for almost 12 years without him being there, or 11 years, I think it's been since he's left.
*  And this is really the most important thing. And maybe he died or she died or they got into an
*  accident on a road trip or whatever. And that's why they haven't accessed their coins. Maybe they
*  are incapacitated for some reason. But whatever reason it is, I really think it's fate or
*  serendipity that is giving us this very vital, very, very, very vital building ingredient in
*  Bitcoin, which no other digital currency would ever recreate, which is that because it was the
*  first, it was the one that was able to establish the first mover advantage and get all the people
*  who are interested in the technology to get into it. And so that's an enormous advantage. But
*  the cherry on top or what made the whole thing really function well is the fact that the guy
*  who made it disappeared and that it continued to operate, which is just a clear illustration that
*  this is a network with no admins. And I'm tempted to think that they're incapacitated in some way,
*  probably dead or gone because I can't believe the, I don't believe any human being would have this
*  level of self-control to not get into, not want to meddle with their invention so much.
*  Even if they, you know, they might've had the self-control to like mine the first million
*  coins to get the network going and then throw away the coins or send them to an address that
*  they don't have the key to because they really just wanted the network to take off. They may
*  have no access to the coins and that's why they can't move them. I could see that happening,
*  but I find it harder to believe that they would resist the temptation to mess with the network.
*  You know, it's funny. I find that the founders of ideas are often principled and have the integrity
*  that the eventual users of those ideas don't fully have. I tend to, you know, we have the kind of
*  cynical view, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely. And we tend to in our mind
*  generalize that all humans are corruptible. And perhaps that's true to some degree, but I think
*  some people are more corruptible than others. And I find that there is, I mean, I like to think
*  that Satoshi Nakamoto is out there and, you know, just like George Washington chose to walk away.
*  And it's a principle and the principle is more powerful than the financial award or any of those
*  kinds of things. It's a principle that stands for freedom. And there's a lot of people throughout
*  history, even recent history, that are willing to die for these principles or live a life
*  full of suffering and sacrifice because they're still living a life of principle and choosing
*  that day after day after day. So, I mean, there's power to that money. What's the worth of money in
*  the end in terms of just personal financial gain versus knowing how much positive impact there is.
*  So the person that chooses to walk away like that, I think is the same kind of person that chooses to
*  live by that principle. You have people like that, you know, in Grigori Grisha Perlman in
*  mathematics who turned down the Fields Medal because he was... Yeah, that's a medal, not
*  50 billion dollars of Bitcoin. Well, that's... I know, I know, I'm joking. Well, that's actually
*  interesting. Just a brief comment. You know, when people talk about Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency
*  space, it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas. And I think there's often correlated,
*  but that good feeling you get when you win or number go up or you just somebody, you know,
*  I found 20 bucks on the street the other day and just that feeling of just like,
*  ooh, like more money. That positive feeling, that's correlated, but it is distinct from the
*  power of the idea to change the world for the better. To alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein
*  in the case of Bitcoin, the decrease in the amount of suffering in the world because of
*  the authoritarian regimes. And just because your number goes up, like that gambling feeling of like,
*  yes, yes, this is good. And I mean, short term number go up. There's a long term number go up,
*  that's more like investment and so on. And there's a short time number go up,
*  this is a good feeling that you can't, you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct from
*  the power of the idea to transform the world. And if you focus on the power of the idea,
*  maybe a billion or billions of dollars don't matter as much. At least that's what I would
*  like to believe. Perhaps, but what matters ultimately is that the thing works without him.
*  The things worked for 11 years without him. And I think this is the really important thing. If
*  they had stuck around for whatever reason and they had continued to meddle with it,
*  it's not clear to me how decentralized it could have been. This is the problem with the other
*  currencies. It's like, how do you lose control of the Frankenstein that you've created? The only way
*  that this Frankenstein continues to survive is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.
*  And so it continues to be yours. And that's the problem with all the other digital currencies.
*  If you've heard about any of the other 16,000 digital currencies out there,
*  you've only heard about it because there's a small group of people behind it that are working on it,
*  that are promoting it. And that's why, and I think, Michael Saylor's discussion with you was
*  magnificent illustration of the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins in that they are securities.
*  And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case for why this makes them categorically
*  different from Bitcoin. Bitcoin, you're buying property. I think he mentioned he's a huge fan
*  of Dogecoin, but I might be misremembering. You are misremembering. Maybe I'm quoting him out of
*  context. Let me just ask you about some possible criticisms of Bitcoin. So on centralization,
*  so there's a criticism on the mining and on the node side, or the node is not really the
*  criticism, but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized because a small number of miners
*  control a majority of the hashing power. I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000, whatever the number
*  is of computers that are full nodes that are actively connected to the network. So you could
*  argue that's decentralized because it's global, it's all across the world, but the miners,
*  it's more centralized. So if you're thinking of making a case for Bitcoin being decentralized,
*  do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized? Is the node the important thing
*  to think about? And what number of nodes counts as centralized and not?
*  The nodes are what matters because the nodes are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters.
*  I think the best way to think about it is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes,
*  and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks. So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem,
*  so they keep operating their computers until they can get a solution to the problem. And then they
*  attach that to a bunch of transactions and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify and approve
*  it. So therefore, this is, and this is, I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size
*  war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin. I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard,
*  but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail called The Block Size War by Jonathan
*  Beer. It's a great description of, in 2017, essentially the miners thought that they can
*  control Bitcoin. There was one mining company that produced the majority of the machines that
*  were on the network, and their allies had control of the machines that were out there,
*  and they controlled the majority of the hash rate, and they thought that they could change
*  Bitcoin's supply, not supply, sorry, they could change Bitcoin's block size, which is a tiny
*  little detail, technical parameter. It's not even all that big of a deal for the economics of it.
*  But they thought that they could pass this change, they could force this change on the network.
*  And the members of the network rejected it, and they weren't able to do it. So the nodes are what
*  is sovereign. The nodes are what determine the rules of the game. The miners are a service provider.
*  The miners invest capital upfront. They buy the machines, they buy the electricity, they buy the
*  storage, they buy the locations, they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money
*  based on the idea that if they behave according to what the nodes want, the nodes will reward them
*  with Bitcoin. So the miners are in no position to dictate terms for anyone. They've put up their
*  capital upfront, and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want. So therefore,
*  what really matters is the decentralization of the nodes. So you want to have as many nodes as
*  possible. You want to have a system where there's a large number of nodes. And this is, of course,
*  the biggest problem with other digital currencies is that because basically Bitcoin has cornered the
*  market on a digital currency, the only way that you can really get traction is to generate a whole
*  bunch of buzzwords about, we're doing this and we're doing that. And so other digital currencies
*  are optimized for bells and whistles and buzzwords. And that means adding computational load,
*  which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate, and therefore you have a very small number of
*  nodes. In fact, very few digital currencies are keen to publicize how many nodes there are,
*  and they don't have full nodes in the true sense. And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have
*  because de facto, you can spin up a million nodes tomorrow on AWS. It doesn't really matter. What
*  matters is de facto, do the nodes dictate the rules of consensus? And the fact that with most
*  digital currencies, you can have hard forks very frequently and they can change the supply all the
*  time means that there's a small group of people who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.
*  Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there. So one is the small group.
*  That one we could talk about. It's a tricky one. And we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto.
*  But the other one is a small number of nodes. To push back on that, as computational power
*  increases, you can argue that that enables more and more cheap computers to serve as nodes. So at
*  least it paints a future where nodes are always increasing because computational power is always
*  increasing and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. So at least there's a hope for the future
*  for greater and greater decentralization on the node front. Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,
*  it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have if the way that the currency is run is that you're
*  going to have a hard fork every few months, which is the case with most other currencies. Bitcoin is
*  the only one that's not have a hard fork. Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin
*  in a technical sense is that you could get the original software that Satoshi himself ran
*  in 2009 to start the network. And you could run it today. And it would sync with the blockchain.
*  There's one bug you need to fix. One mistake that would have only appeared, I think, in around 2013
*  or 14 or something like that, that he wasn't aware of back then. So you just need to fix this one
*  tiny little bug. And then the consensus parameters are still the same. So you're able to sync to it.
*  This is not true for most other digital currencies. I'd say probably all of them,
*  because they've all had many hard forks, which they think of as upgrades. And they market this
*  thing as, well, Bitcoin can't upgrade, but we upgrade all the time. Well, yeah, you know what
*  else upgrades all the time? Facebook, Apple, Amazon, anything that centralizes is very easy
*  to upgrade. And that's precisely why, as Michael Saylor says, these things are somebody's liability.
*  They are security. You're carrying on somebody's technical and economic liability. They can,
*  hard fork, they can 10x the supply tomorrow. Yeah. They can fall victim to the same
*  corrupting forces that governments fall victim to. Sure. And for people who don't know, yeah,
*  hard fork is a reverse incompatible change to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.
*  Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well. I'm sure all of which you love
*  dearly. Anyway, but that doesn't matter. The original Bitcoin, for the most part,
*  has not undergone any changes. And that's one of the-
*  I mean, it has undergone changes, but none in the important parameters of the network.
*  So another criticism is about energy. So the proof of work, consensus mechanism uses a lot of energy.
*  What's the response to that criticism of Bitcoin? Yes, because it's worth it.
*  Okay. The airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak. When you're going to cross the Atlantic
*  next time, what are you going to take? A kayak that is environmentally friendly, according to
*  this insane definition, or are you going to take an airplane that consumes a lot of energy?
*  So the cost benefit analysis here is such where you have to consider both the cost and the benefit.
*  Exactly. And I think it's an astonishing testament to just how far backward people's
*  scientific and technological thinking has devolved to the point where we think of energy
*  consumption as a bad thing. I think it's just- and in the Fiat standard I discussed in the whole
*  hysteria around energy, and I think it's a product of Fiat inflation because it's a way of trying to
*  covering up the fact that energy fuels that are reliable and necessary for the current world
*  are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation. And so governments are always looking
*  for excuses for why you should not be using those things. And so they promote all kinds of stupid
*  pseudosciences that tell you about why these things are bad. But really, all technology is-
*  well, not all, but the vast majority of technological innovations involve economizing
*  on human time and judgment and replacing it with machines, with reliable machines that spend a lot
*  of energy. So that's what a telephone does. Instead of having to send somebody across the
*  world to tell somebody something else or send a letter, a telephone allows you to do it. The car
*  is like that. You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy, but it allows you to travel much
*  faster and safer and more reliably. An airplane is like that. Modern telecommunication. Human
*  prosperity is an increase in the consumption of energy. And I think it is an absolutely criminal
*  thing, and I genuinely mean the word criminal, to portray energy consumption as a bad thing,
*  because it is truly depriving people of the chance to live a life that makes life better.
*  And it's truly criminal to tell poor countries that they should not consume the same energy
*  sources that are being used in rich countries on which our modern infrastructure and modern
*  life relies. That's what life is. If you reduce the consumption of energy in the US
*  to the levels that you have in poor countries today, the US would become desperately poor.
*  A lot of people would die. Cities would collapse. The quality of life would decrease significantly.
*  A high quality of life often requires, given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy.
*  Yeah, and I should be clear, it's not a quality of life in the sense that many people think of
*  this as, oh yeah, well, taking needless flights for vacations. No, no, these are the cherries on
*  top of the cake, but the substance of the cake and the real benefits of energy is the fact that
*  children, premature babies, survive in countries that have reliable 24-hour cheap electricity.
*  If your child is born premature, that you put him in an incubator, put him in an incubator or her,
*  they're highly likely to survive. If you don't have 24-hour electricity,
*  that child is not going to make it. And you see it, the level of energy consumption per
*  capita is highly correlated not just to income, but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,
*  all of the things that you care about. And Bitcoin is just another technology. It does consume a lot
*  more energy than central banks. A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this by saying, well,
*  central banks consume money and ATMs consume energy. And I think if you calculate how much
*  central banks and banks consume, I think it's a rounding error next to what Bitcoin consumes.
*  I think Bitcoin is just maybe not a rounding error, but it's still, Bitcoin is I think is
*  going to consume a lot more. And that's a good thing.
*  You know, what's humbling is to look, because even just looking into this forces me to look
*  at the energy expenditures for many of the things we take for granted. Obviously computers and
*  the digital, our digital lives, just Bitcoin becomes a rounding error relative to how much
*  energy is spent on all the computers in our world. But also like things like home appliances,
*  microwaves and hair dryers and stuff. It starts being hilarious. It's like, oh, these things that
*  are just part of our modern life, they're either the same order, at least the same order of magnitude
*  as Bitcoin. And they seem like trivial parts of life. Yeah. And this is the thing, all of the
*  people that complain about Bitcoin's energy consumption, I presume they use washing machines.
*  Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes get to consume energy? And I mean, I used
*  to live in Lebanon. Lebanon had hyperinflation. I escaped from hyperinflation. I escaped, it prevented.
*  My life could have been ruined by hyperinflation. And the reason that it wasn't ruined is because
*  I have Bitcoin. So I don't know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?
*  Yes, please.
*  So fuck your washing machine. Given a choice between my washing machine and my Bitcoin,
*  I'll choose Bitcoin. It's a technology that has already saved my life. And I think it's
*  going to save the lives of many, many, many, many more people. But of course, I don't have to choose
*  between my Bitcoin and my washing machine because we're just constantly consuming more energy. And
*  we're going to continue to consume more energy in this world. And that's just what progress is.
*  And a small remark. So in principle, I don't think this is a problem. But the other thing
*  about Bitcoin, where it is different from washing machines, Bitcoin is truly unique in this. It's
*  the only thing whose energy consumption can be produced absolutely anywhere. Your washing
*  machine needs to be in your house where you live. And you live in a city surrounded by 10 million
*  people. And they all have their washing machines. And they're all connected to the grid. And they
*  generally tend to do their laundry around the same time. And so you have to put the load of
*  the washing machine on the grid at the same time. There needs to be one power plant and all the
*  infrastructure needs to work at the same time. And the electricity is pretty expensive because
*  it's being done in a place with high demand. Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity from
*  places where it has high demand because it can buy electricity from anywhere. This is what's truly
*  mind blowing about it. You can buy what you need. The electricity you need for mining can be done
*  anywhere. So you can have a waterfall in the north of Canada, 300 miles away from any population
*  center. There's water falling. There's energy. You can put a hydroelectric dam there. And then
*  you can use that energy to operate the miners. And then the miners just need a satellite internet
*  connection. And effectively, you're selling that energy that is isolated to the grid. And because
*  of the way that Bitcoin functions, because of the difficulty adjustment, the only profitable miners
*  are the ones who can get cheap electricity. Basically, if you're mining at grid cost,
*  if you're mining at around the average electricity price in the world is around 14 cents. If you're
*  mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin, you're most likely not going to make it. If you're running your miners
*  at 14 cents, because everybody could mine at 14 cents. And so what happens is if everybody's
*  mining at 14 cents, 14 cents stops being profitable. And then only the people mining at a lower price
*  are profitable. So that's why Bitcoin mining is not competing with your washing machine.
*  This is the absurd thing about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint where, oh, no, it's a catastrophe.
*  Bitcoin is taking all the electricity as if the electricity is just one fixed pie that we all have
*  to share and fight over. And this is how I keep making fun of these stupid headlines they put out
*  where Bitcoin is consuming more electricity than Portugal. All right, well, maybe we should shut
*  down Portugal then. What the hell has Portugal given us? Obviously, it's not competing.
*  He doesn't mean that I've gotten so much criticism for saying Christiano Ronaldo is not in the top
*  five. I apologize. I love Portugal. That's another discussion we should get into.
*  Because you posted a few soccer things. I'm not. I realize how passionate people are about this.
*  Listen, it was a joke. All right. He deserves to be potential in the top five.
*  Yeah, I love Portugal. And even though I'm a Liverpool fan, I still respect Christiano
*  Ronaldo a lot. In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion where I think Christiano Ronaldo is
*  the greatest football player ever. Number one, Oberpele Amaradona, Messi, better than Messi.
*  Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top. Nobody's ever done that. He's won everything
*  everywhere. Everywhere he goes at the top, at the Champions League. Really strong argument to be
*  made for him. Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona. That's the thing.
*  So you appreciate performance long term versus the genius of the actual play on the field.
*  I mean, the genius is Ronaldo is the top scorer of all time.
*  He's the genius in the scoring, not the actual dance of the play, the creativity.
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. Messi's been absolutely mediocre since he's left Barcelona.
*  These are strong words.
*  He scored what, two goals in PSG season this year? They're out of the Champions League.
*  What about Mohamed Salah? You've posted on him.
*  Oh yeah, he's my boy.
*  Is he climbing up to be someone?
*  I think he should win the Ballon d'Or this year. He probably should have won it last year as well.
*  He's been absolutely outstanding. But I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi. They keep
*  giving him accolades. He hasn't deserved, I think, Messi the last couple of Ballon d'Ors
*  that he got. I mean, he's a great player and everything, but no, he did not deserve it last
*  year. We can agree to disagree.
*  You're a Barca fan or a Messi fan?
*  I would say, no, I wouldn't say I'm a Barca fan, but a Barca fan because of Messi.
*  I think there's certain things. So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,
*  I remember Maradona. He was the first person I saw that I was like, oh wow, this could be,
*  this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport. And for some reason, I mean,
*  something about like Diego Armando Maradona, like the way they were commentating,
*  the genius of his play, the mix of ego, and again, the performance, but being able to carry a team on
*  his shoulders, that I just fell in love with whatever he represented. And then by that,
*  Argentina. And then Messi, I saw when he was like 16, 17, when he was just like right in the early
*  days. And when you first see a person and you see the genius and you notice that, and then it turns
*  out to be actually a great player, for some reason you're invested. You're emotionally invested.
*  I don't know. So you kind of just fall in love and then you pick sides. I mean, that's the thing
*  part of the fun things about football soccer is like, you pick a guy, you pick a team,
*  and fuck everyone else. And you just have fun talking shit. I mean, there's part of it.
*  It's great because I think, obviously it's a very stupid thing to do, but I think if you don't do it
*  in football, you're going to do it in real life. Elsewhere. That's right. That's why it's very good.
*  Instead of hating people for their religion and for their skin color, hate them because they
*  support Manchester United. Exactly. So you're a Liverpool fan. Yes, yes. Hardcore, long-term.
*  But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal.
*  Energy. Yeah, energy. Bitcoin is not competing with
*  Portugal because Bitcoin is buying energy from places where we can't buy it. Because
*  all the places where we can buy energy for our washing machines, we're bidding up the price
*  enough to make it non-buyable for Bitcoin. That's why you'll see those headlines about
*  Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal. Well, if you look at Portugal, I mean,
*  they've got giant power plants in Portugal. They've got millions of people and they've
*  got enormous amounts of infrastructure. Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?
*  You don't see it in the cities. It's all isolated. It's all out away from the cities,
*  or it's connected to grids that have serious overcapacity. So Bitcoin is not out there buying
*  the expensive energy, taking energy away from people who can't afford it. It's out there buying
*  its own energy because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy that people really need.
*  So one other criticism from an investment perspective, from a gambling perspective that
*  people see is the volatility of Bitcoin. Of course, that's been somewhat decreasing over time, but
*  what's your answer to the sort of criticism that Bitcoin is too volatile? I want to stay away. It
*  doesn't seem like a safe place for me to invest either short-term or long-term.
*  There's no denying there's a volatility and there's a high oscillation in the value in the
*  short-term. So I think the safe way to approach that is in terms of position sizing. If the
*  volatility bothers you, then you're over-invested perhaps. So maybe you should reduce the size of
*  your position so that the volatility doesn't bother you. This is the short answer. Stack as
*  much as your conviction will allow you to tolerate the volatility. Of course, the reason
*  you should try and consider tolerating the volatility more is the options are you hold
*  fiat assets, which only go down relatively stable, not a lot of volatility day to day.
*  Value of your dollar doesn't change 40% overnight, 20% overnight or something like that,
*  but it does go down reliably. It's going to go down 40%. You can count on it. It might take a
*  year, two years, five years, 10 years. Compared to the things that you want to buy, it's going to go
*  down by 40% and it's not going to come back. It's going to go down another 40% and then another 40%
*  and then another 40%. So the option really is relatively short-term stability with long-term
*  decline or short-term volatility with long-term rise. That's another way in which Bitcoin teaches
*  people to have a low time preference and think about the long-term. So stack, accumulate and
*  think of it in the long-term. It's a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new. Bitcoin is currently
*  less than 1% of the global money market. So there's about $100 trillion of money out there in the
*  world, $100 trillion roughly of fiat and about $10 trillion of gold and Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.
*  One rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin, that's going to show up on the Bitcoin chart. You look
*  at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin, you see the buy. You see the news and it happens and you
*  see the pump. Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like Bitcoin, you see the drop. But a few years
*  ago, it used to be that one random millionaire would cause that pump. Now you have to be the
*  richest guy in the world to do that. In a few years, you're going to have to be the richest
*  country in the world to be able to do that to the Bitcoin price, maybe many years, maybe not a few
*  years. But as Bitcoin grows, think about it as a liquid pool of money. Currently, it's a small pool
*  next to a much larger ocean, which is the entire money market. And so one person jumps from that to
*  this small pool, they can make a big splash. As the pool grows, essentially the saleability increases
*  and the likelihood of one individual purchase affecting the price so violently increases,
*  decreases. And so over time, as the size of the market increases, I think we're going to see the
*  volatility decline more and more. Ultimately, if you look at gold, historically gold has been very,
*  very stable. It did not achieve its stability because the central bank was in charge of gold
*  supply or because there was a gold committee that decided how much gold gets produced.
*  It achieved that stability because it became the most saleable good and so therefore became the
*  good that contains the most cash balances in the world. And the end of the 19th century,
*  everybody held cash balances in gold and new production was a tiny little addition to global
*  production, to the supply. So that's what made gold the most relatively, I shouldn't say stable
*  because nothing is stable in economics, but relatively it holds onto its value and it's
*  much less volatile than national currencies. That's because it has the highest stock to flow
*  ratio and that's because its supply is a tiny fraction of the liquid market. And as the liquid
*  market grows, as the size of cash balances grows and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,
*  you get only slight changes in value. So I think as Bitcoin matures, that's going to decline.
*  So effectively, I think the end game is Bitcoin is huge. Bitcoin is worth something like,
*  I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin is not just national currencies and gold's
*  addressable market, but also government bonds. That's the really big one.
*  Yeah. So how do banks compare to gold? So you're saying it'll surpass gold with the 10 trillion?
*  Yeah.
*  What's bonds? Where's bonds stand?
*  So then there's also national currencies, which are about 100 trillion, and there's
*  government bonds, which are around $120 billion. Sorry, trillion dollars, trillion.
*  They're trillion, sorry. If we were saying billion, we meant trillion.
*  So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?
*  I've always held this is the prize. This is the main dish. Gold is the appetizer. Bonds are the
*  main dish because bonds have replaced gold. Bonds have replaced gold in people's portfolio. People
*  remember when we were saying gold was, you'd hold it as a saving, as the secure part of your
*  portfolio, and then you take risk with the equity. Currently, people do that by holding a part of
*  their portfolio in bonds. That's the part that they treat as their saving account. And then the
*  rest they use for speculation, not speculation, for investment, in which they take risk. Yeah,
*  speculation. And that's stocks and equity and other high-risk assets. I think Bitcoin is not
*  going to replace equity. There will always be equity. There will always be companies and people
*  who want to have equity. But it'll probably replace a big chunk of current equity markets,
*  because right now, if you want to save, it used to be that you hold bonds. Now, if you want to save,
*  you go into stock indexes. So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk of equity markets,
*  because currently people are using it as saving. And I think it eats all the bonds. That's my most
*  ambitious statement. Well, the question is the scale of time that happens across. But the most
*  important statement you make is about trend. Yeah. And also, let's also remember, currently bonds
*  nominally don't beat inflation. And in real terms, they don't come close to really beating
*  inflation. So currently, with bonds, you're taking on credit default risk to buy a bond, and also
*  getting less money back in real terms. Well, Bitcoin doesn't offer you returns, but in real
*  terms, it appreciates much more. And it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it
*  than any company or government. So let's make things spicy and ask if Bitcoin fails in the
*  long-term future. As Alt, you just said economics, volatility, things happen in this world. The human
*  civilization might end in this century. I hope it doesn't, but it might. There could be catastrophic
*  events. If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero, loses its number one spot. What would be the reason?
*  If you're an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now and just were to analyze the situation,
*  Bitcoin is a pretty new thing. So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves together
*  with this new monetary technology is nearly infinite. So if it fails, one of those trajectories
*  surely involves Bitcoin failing. What would be the reason? I think the most likely reason that
*  it could fail, I don't think this is likely in general, but I think it is the most likely of all
*  the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin is governments go back on a gold standard.
*  So they make, in your view, a better decision than the current system, just not the best decision.
*  Yeah. I thought you would go much darker. Interesting. So maybe because of Russia,
*  because of China and so on, because of the current war, they might reconsider the power that America
*  holds because of the monetary, because it being the primary currency, and they'll start thinking
*  about going on a gold standard. Yeah, but it would also require the US and the Europeans and everybody
*  to want to join in this system and sing Kumbaya and play nice with each other around the gold
*  standard. I think given that gold already is about 10 times larger than Bitcoin, so it has a first
*  mover advantage. If governments were to go and peg their currencies to gold again, the price of gold
*  would shoot up 5, 10X, and it would rise in value a lot more. Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill
*  Bitcoin. No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen. I imagine less unlikely than all the
*  other unlikely scenarios, because even with a nuclear war, 90% of the planet is destroyed,
*  the 10% continue to run Bitcoin. That's a quote. Okay. There's a movement,
*  a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists. I've seen you referred, at least
*  in the past, as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists, probably because of your book,
*  Bitcoin Standard, consider the Bible in general. You're one of the leaders in this space.
*  Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision that often or perhaps sometimes originates from
*  this community? Definitely not. I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions.
*  Let's just be clear. I think the rhetoric of community is, I reject this rhetoric because
*  I think it's a way for political manipulation and subversion to try and portray people as part of
*  a community and hold people responsible for other people's actions, which I think is ridiculous.
*  Some guy on the internet said something mean to somebody. This is very common. I always try and
*  not get involved in these things. Some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner says something to
*  somebody that's very wrong. Of course, it happens. Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the
*  world. A lot of these, I'd say parasites, people who don't have anything productive to do with their
*  life, outrage merchants, they'll come out and say something along the lines of, the Bitcoin
*  maximalists are toxic. They're holding Bitcoin back and they need, and of course, it's manipulative.
*  The point behind it is they want to get to you. They want to get people who are not that nobody
*  with 300 followers who said something silly. They want to get the notable people to basically
*  change their message. The idea is I'm supposed to apologize because somebody with 300 followers
*  I've never met in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner said a mean word. Then I need to apologize
*  and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric about other digital currencies and I need to do that.
*  So I am only responsible for my own actions and I don't recall regretting anything.
*  No. Okay. But let me push back or push further into that direction. Fine. Let's leave community
*  aside. Labels suck for sure, but you have a spicy way about you on Twitter. Even in this conversation,
*  you had some good strong words to say about improvement. Yeah, I mean, I've always believed
*  life is too short to mince words. One day I'm going to be dead and on my deathbed, I'm not going to
*  look back and say, I wish I was a little bit more circumspect in expressing my opinions. I'm far more
*  likely to think, you know what, I wish I said what I really think. Yes, life is too short to hold back
*  your opinion. The question is what is really your opinion? Because you're many people in one.
*  So there's a person that loves, there's kindness for the human beings, there's a person that gets
*  annoyed, there's a person that enjoys disagreement, there's a person that enjoys collaboration.
*  You can emphasize all of those different things, each of those different things weigh it differently
*  in your online interaction. There are some aspects of online interaction that encourages
*  in different communities. Online interaction is one community that encourages kind of derision and
*  mockery and so on. So you can choose if you want to engage that part of yourself or some other
*  part of yourself. Economics is another community that enjoys being very straightforward about
*  their disagreements, pretty harsh. It's fun to watch because it feels like you arrive at the
*  truth much faster because you tear each other apart. But that's a choice, that's a deliberate
*  choice. I don't want to label an entire community of people by its extremes. I don't think you should
*  do that. But there's cultural characteristics you start to notice. When you go to France,
*  that's a certain way. When you go to Britain, London is different than rural Britain. New
*  York is different than Iowa. You start to notice things. I mean, you don't want to generalize,
*  there's all kinds of people everywhere. But there's a certain way of communication on crypto,
*  Twitter in general, but also Bitcoin maximalists that I even early on received a bunch of heat.
*  What the hell? Listen, there's definitely a difference when I go to the computer science
*  community, machine learning community. It's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.
*  I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being, which is asking simple dumb questions.
*  Even when I've already spent years, sometimes decades with an idea, I like asking dumb questions
*  anyway. The crypto folks punish you for this, for curiosity, for exploration. I understand the
*  mechanism because so many other people come into that community and they might masquerade
*  as curious, but really they're trying to inject, they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin.
*  There's some scheme to make money. I understand maybe that's just the dynamics of the community
*  by nature. It's not like you respond appropriately to the amount of charlatans in the community.
*  So if the fraction of charlatans is low, maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.
*  When the fraction of charlatans is high, you have to be harsher. Perhaps, perhaps, but-
*  I think also the stakes are extremely high in this situation. And I think if you don't like
*  Bitcoiners, if you think Bitcoiners are toxic, wait until you meet fiaters. The fiat community
*  has financed world wars and genocides and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.
*  The fiat community, if you want to use that term, I don't believe that you should, but fiat has
*  destroyed the savings of pretty much anybody who's lived through the last 20th century, pretty much
*  anybody who's lived through the 20th century, no matter where you lived, Switzerland, US, Ethiopia,
*  Russia, you've gone through fiat problems. You've had hyperinflation, you've had bank confiscation.
*  There isn't a family in the world today that hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last
*  century. They all have a story about the inflation and the hyperinflation. And Bitcoin offers us a
*  way out of this. And shitcoins, altcoins are essentially fiat world's last gasp attempt to
*  try and salvage fiat, to try and salvage the idea that some people will continue to be able to print
*  money and other people will have to use that money. This is Twitter, it's a free market,
*  it's the internet. You don't have to follow anybody. That's the thing. What I find really
*  objectionable about the people who are so butthurt always about Bitcoin maximalists is you don't have
*  to click follow on people you don't like. There are 300 million Twitter accounts. And if you choose
*  to follow the accounts that say things that annoy you and then complain about the fact that they say
*  things that annoy you, I'm sorry, but you're an idiot and you don't know how to use Twitter.
*  Just follow the accounts that you like. You don't have to be part of this. You don't have to listen
*  to those people. There are a lot of Bitcoiners that don't act like this. You can just unfollow
*  the ones that you like. Since in the past year, man, time flies, I've met a lot of them and I
*  enjoy them a lot and you build that community of people that you enjoy. There are lots that
*  communicate in the way you enjoy. And it's becoming me at this point that I block with love.
*  I block very prolifically and I strongly recommend people continue to block. I think Twitter is,
*  you're not going to get to interact with 300 million accounts anyway. So you want to be
*  constantly curating the experience by getting rid of people you don't like and following people
*  that you like. And that's just how, after 10 years of using Twitter, you accumulate a block
*  list, which is very big, which I'm very happy for. I'm going to pass on to my children.
*  On your deathbed, the grandchildren will gather around and your grandfather can finally share
*  the full list. So again, it's just a Twitter account. If it bothers you so much, ask yourself
*  why it bothers you that some people are so... I'm not referring to you obviously, but I mean,
*  the people that are constantly aggravated about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter.
*  I just block immediately and I get to curate the experience that I enjoy. And I recommend people
*  do that. It's really a lot less pathetic than complaining about strangers saying things you
*  don't like, which a lot of... And of course, the reason for it is, when I say it's stupid,
*  it's not really stupid. There's an ulterior motive there. And the ulterior motive is,
*  hey, I have this shit coin that I made with five other friends of mine and I'd like to ride your
*  coattails, Bitcoiners, and I'd like you to please help me promote this shit coin. I get this
*  practically every week, whether through email or through Twitter, where, hey, this is our shit coin.
*  It's just like Bitcoin, but it's better because it does this and this and that. And
*  basically, how can we get you to promote this shit coin for us? And being straightforward and
*  forthright is a great productivity hack because you just tell those people, no, I'm not interested.
*  It's a stupid shit coin and I wish you quick and swift failure before you take a lot of people's
*  money. And that's what I genuinely think. Well, but I'll just be upfront with the
*  fact, at least for my taste, just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me. So that's
*  just my own preference. It's not a judgment on you. It's just my own preference that I'm afraid I'll
*  miss good ideas. I think when you're, me personally, when I'm too certain about things, when I'm too
*  tribal about things, I'll miss actually really strong ideas, outlier ideas, totally new ideas.
*  So that worries me. One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is, how much is at stake financially,
*  is that it's less open to good ideas. And actually by design, that it's not changing,
*  like with the hard forks and so on, that there's not a kind of curiosity about exploration of ideas.
*  Of course, in some way that curiosity can start getting injected when you start talking about
*  other layers built on top of Bitcoin, and you start talking about applications or different
*  things like the lightning network, that's where the curiosity can emerge. But still,
*  that's why with cryptocurrency in general, I just try to keep an open mind. And just the shit coin
*  as a term is just a good statement that I'm going to close my mind to. That's the way I hear it.
*  But coming out of your mouth, because you say a lot of other edgy stuff, is just more you having
*  fun. That's the way I hear it. But if I said something like that, I would feel like I'm closing
*  my mind. Let me give you the counter argument to that. How much time do you spend emailing back
*  all of these Nigerian Prince email scams that email you tell you,
*  send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million? None. None. Why are you being close minded
*  to all of these great ideas? Maybe one of them will actually send you $15 million.
*  I don't know if I know the difference between the Nigerian Prince and many other people I do
*  talk to who are colleagues and so on that are also emailing me and are also offering me things,
*  but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy. Yeah, but I mean the moment that somebody tells you,
*  hey, I'm going to give you $15 million for nothing just if you send me $5,000,
*  you're getting something for nothing. And essentially with all of the digital currencies,
*  it's the same pitch. Hey, come use this thing that will allow you to do things that
*  all of the things that they pretend that they can do that can be done with computers without having
*  digital currencies. We already have AWS that does cloud computing that does everything that
*  shitcoins pretend to do. The only difference is AWS doesn't have its own monetary system
*  tacked on top of it to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money. But don't you
*  think there's some gray area? So let me go for the historical record and let's see if you've
*  changed as a philosopher, economist, human being. You tweeted three years ago. Oh, well,
*  anyone who believes proof of stake can work is either one completely clueless
*  at how and why Bitcoin works at all, or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword to promote
*  a worthless scam like Ethereum. Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam and in general,
*  proof of stake? You either clueless if you think it's interesting. Yeah, no, I still stand by that.
*  Would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin? For sure. It's the mother asshole from which the
*  shitcoins spring. The royal, the king of the coin? Yeah. I think the key thing is, the way to think
*  about this, another tweet from a couple of years ago, which is essentially proof of work was like
*  the invention of flight. We've got in this machine and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.
*  Proof of stake is, hey, we found a great way to make airplanes cheaper and faster by not making
*  them fly, by keeping them on the ground. The invention of proof of work, the reason the entire
*  digital currency space exists is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work. If Bitcoin was
*  based on proof of stake, it would have died or been shut down from day one. But that's a hypothesis
*  and a lot of people believe that and I think they have a lot of strong support. But basically,
*  proof of work is grounded in physics in the real world. The proof of stake is more about-
*  It's politics. It's the Federal Reserve. It's exactly what we have. It's exactly what we have.
*  It's just a group of people who get to decide the rules and it's essentially a system that is,
*  it's a security, it's a company. It's not an innovation in any sense. It's a step backward
*  to what we already had, which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.
*  Now, the only reason it survives in this and the reason I call these things a scam and I have no
*  problem with calling them a scam is because they fraudulently present themselves as being
*  decentralized. They present themselves as just being a different way of doing decentralization
*  than Bitcoin when it's not. It's just they're riding Bitcoin's coattails and they're riding
*  the fact that most people don't quite understand what Bitcoin is and how it works to portray
*  themselves as a cheaper, better, more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does. It's not. It's a
*  less legally accountable way of doing what central banks do.
*  Right. The basic criticism is that there's a group of people, sometimes a very small group of people,
*  they can control the parameters of the operation of the system. Over time, you can't trust
*  it's not gold under the mattress. It doesn't have that kind of hardness.
*  It's not property. I really very strongly recommend your discussion with Sailor for
*  people who want to elaborate more on this. There's a bunch of people in charge, which means that
*  legally they should be doing this under securities law. But even as an anarchist,
*  if I don't want to care about that, the technical implication of it is this is never going to be
*  adopted as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet because you need something that
*  enemies can trade with one another. You can't have something that has a small group of people in
*  charge because A, the small group of people themselves can be corrupted and B, they can be
*  coerced. You can put a bunch of people in a room, put a gun to their head and you can change
*  everything in any of these digital currencies. That's why I think you'll find a lot more sympathy
*  among fiaters to shitcoins. The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline is a very
*  strong one because it's the same thing. You like the idea of people being in charge of money
*  and you think you're going to be the one who's going to be in charge of money. You see a lot of
*  this phenomena and you see the same people that want gold and don't like central banking,
*  they get into Bitcoin. Just to actually push back on a couple of things. One is
*  it sounds like I'm trying to be a sophisticated Brit talking about theater, but
*  for many reasons it's not making me feel good about that. Day by day things change. You used
*  to be one of those. People evolve, people learn. People that are supporters of Bitcoin might
*  eventually become supporters of Ethereum or go back to supporting fiat. We don't know. People
*  evolve for different reasons. You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened. I think every
*  single person, as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving, as wars break out,
*  and geopolitics change, as the monetary system is constantly put under stress, people will evolve.
*  We're trying to all figure it out together. That's why I like open-mindedness here, I think,
*  for people like me at least, seems essential. I know, so I expect you to be answering all
*  of the spam emails you get. I will, prince by prince by prince. I don't have a clear understanding
*  what is a good investment of my time, what is a good investment of my money. That doesn't seem
*  clear because things are good at promoting themselves. I'm not talking about the different
*  things like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on. I just mean life, dating, jobs, friendships.
*  Everybody's advertising themselves as a great investment, but you don't know. You have to keep
*  an open mind. Also, I don't be self-introspective about biases I operate under and ways I delude
*  myself. Like, hallucinations that I'm living under is breaking out of all these hallucinations.
*  It's very hard to introspect, thinking, what are the assumptions under which I lived my entire life
*  that might be actually false assumptions? That's a really difficult thought process to take. It's a
*  dangerous one. The Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. It's
*  like Alex Jones talks about this. I mean, he's got demons in his head. He has all these conspiracy
*  theories that it holds in his head, but it begins to really destroy him. It's a psychological burden
*  to carry. If you question authority, if you question government, if you question culture,
*  the way things have been done, it's really difficult. The biases you operate under,
*  it's really difficult to question them. So I think being constantly open-minded and self-critical,
*  not constantly, but a little bit every day is important, I think.
*  Rami Al-Nabari Yeah, but I mean, you're talking to somebody. I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine,
*  in the West Bank. I've changed my mind on all kinds of different things. The fact that I was even open
*  to the idea of Bitcoin has required an enormous amount of- It's a heck of a journey. So I'd much
*  rather appreciate direct arguments rather than these kind of general fluffy, you should be,
*  oh, of course, yes, you should be open-minded, but also you come up with conclusions and you
*  delete spam emails sometimes when you know that it is spam because you have to move on with your
*  life. There's an opportunity cost to considering every spam email. So-
*  Michael Krigsman Well, to me, okay, so I'll just say from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,
*  almost like a technical person, mostly, my understanding of economics is weak.
*  Proof of stake is not obviously a weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.
*  So that's not obvious to me that that goes wrong and becomes corrupted in the way that
*  governments get corrupted because it still seems decentralized. Now, your criticism of governance
*  is an interesting one. But if you put that aside, it still is a decentralized mechanism,
*  and it's more transparent than the mechanism that governments operate on.
*  Michael Krigsman It isn't. It's exactly what the Federal Reserve is. The Federal Reserve is a
*  proof of stake system. The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks. And so the rules
*  of the Federal Reserve and the regulations are determined by the ownership, which is the banks.
*  So it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is. Michael Krigsman But it's too backdoor. The
*  agreements between the banks and the Federal Reserve, it feels like a lot of those agreements
*  are made between individuals that are sort of behind the scenes. It's not hard to, it's opaque.
*  Michael Krigsman Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system will take off is if you
*  have a military to force people to use it. That's the thing. Ultimately, there's no way that it's
*  going to take off on a free market. And that's why, for all of the bluster about wanting to move to a
*  proof of stake system, Ethereum have been saying this since 2014. It's now been eight years,
*  you know, that they've been talking about it. We still haven't seen the proof of stake system
*  operational in the wild. It's vaporware for all practical. Michael Svigel Oh,
*  Artano's proof of stake? Michael Krigsman It's potential. I mean, you can do it in a centralized
*  way, but like, can it survive? Can it last for a long time? I don't think so. And I think,
*  you know, it can last perhaps initially with marketing, with centralized marketing,
*  you can promote it. But ultimately, the user demand, the people that are not interested in
*  speculating because they want to get rich on this, the people that are going to use it,
*  they're going to want to use it because they can trust that it is not going to be messed with.
*  Michael Svigel Yes. But there's also applications on top, so Lightning Network. But there's
*  applications on top. Like, well, the reason I'm interested in things like Ethereum is you might
*  think it's ridiculous. I thought it was ridiculous, but NFTs. So what's the you can have NFTs probably
*  on top of Bitcoin. Michael Krigsman But you don't because there's no marketing
*  on Bitcoin because all of these ideas get promoted on proprietary shitcoins because
*  yes, but there's the network effects of ideas of applications. So they just take off for some
*  reason. And human civilization is such that you get excited about stuff and large amounts of
*  people believe a thing and they start to get excited and actually has impact. Like the fact
*  that NFTs can have an impact on the art world or the world in general is wild to me. But it worked.
*  Michael Svigel Well, you know, David Rothkaw has an impact on the art world.
*  Michael Krigsman It doesn't say much.
*  Michael Krigsman Well, I'm saying these ideas have, you know, we're collective intelligent
*  beings and we can believe a thing and that has power that has led to major wars and all those
*  kinds of things. So it's interesting to me that NFTs took hold and the question is,
*  is there distributed DApps, is there distributed apps built on top of different blockchains
*  that might somehow transform the world? You have to kind of keep an open mind to that.
*  Because right now it's like, it's like, I'm the same place with that as I am with like virtual
*  reality. It's like, all right, this seems like a really intellectually promising set of ideas here.
*  But there's something either technically or socially not quite taking hold. Why? And I don't
*  know what the right answer is. So with virtual reality, what's the right answer? Is it just
*  technically the latency is too high? Or the games are not good enough? Or is it a fundamentally
*  flawed idea that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it? That the physical world is just
*  orders of magnitude better? Or a two dimensional display is just as good as a three dimensional
*  world? I don't know. Why is virtual reality not taken off? It's been since the 80s.
*  I don't have strong opinions on it. On the prospect of the technology. Personally, I don't want to
*  ever imagine myself having something on my eyes. I'd rather just go out into the real world.
*  But I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality. I do have on DApps and NFTs.
*  Yeah. What's your criticism of sort of DApps and NFTs? Is this a distraction? It's a way to sell
*  a flawed technology? The problem with DApps is, I mean, it's just the economics of it makes no
*  sense in the sense that currently, if you wanted to run an application, whatever the application is,
*  you want to run it on AWS, you pay a specific amount of money, you want to run it on your own
*  laptop, you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data. If you wanted to run the same
*  thing on a distributed ledger, where you're distributing the data over thousands of computers
*  worldwide, it's infinitely more expensive. And that's why we haven't seen any of these DApps
*  take off. And that's why I've said this many years ago. The only working application of
*  blockchain technology is Bitcoin. Because with Bitcoin, with a few hundred bytes of data,
*  you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value from here to China and move it safely and
*  reliably. So that power, I can't see it being justified for anything that is not as mission
*  critical as moving large amounts of value, which require very little amount of information.
*  So when you look at all of the buzzwords that Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people
*  like to use, and if you want to wonder really why we come to this kind of aggression, it's because
*  we've heard all of this. I've had all of these hucksters come to me for years. I've had people
*  in 2016 talk to me about how Ethereum blockchain technology is going to revolutionize real estate
*  deeds in India. I remember this guy, I'm not going to mention his name, but this guy was 2016,
*  and he sold a lot of shitcoins and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins based on all these silly
*  ideas. We can have blackjack on a distributed ledger. We're going to have Indian real estate
*  on a distributed ledger. And it's concerned trolling marketing. Oh, there's a problem with
*  real estate in India, real estate deeds. Blockchain fixes this. Buy my shitcoin. And then people buy
*  the shitcoin. Indian real estate isn't fixed. And the guy gets rich and they move on. But I'm still
*  waiting for a dapp to actually emerge. The promise that we keep hearing is something completely
*  world-changing, world-transforming. And the reality is not one app. There's one of my good
*  friends, Jimmy Song, eventually they refused to go ahead with it, but he wanted to bet with
*  one of the Ethereum people about these dapps. The Ethereum people are constantly saying those
*  dapps are going to grow and they're going to have so many applications and they're going to have so
*  many ideas. And the reality is all the apps that work are centralized apps. So there is no
*  Uber on the blockchain. There is no Twitter on the blockchain. There is no social media on the
*  blockchain because these are businesses and businesses require a centralized authority to
*  make decisions. You can't have it be decentralized. Yeah. Listen, you're frustrated and I could see it
*  over a few years of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.
*  I wouldn't say frustrated. I'm amused. It's water off my back.
*  No, but a man they use this and a community they use the word shitcoin is a little bit,
*  you call it amusement. And I think amusement is a way to deal with the frustration. It's a
*  channeling of frustration. Sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,
*  the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all. And that's what you mean by amusement.
*  But the fact is there's things like artificial intelligence for, what is it? How many decades?
*  Seven decades has been off and on promising to change everything. And it has failed time and
*  time again to deliver to the promise. But that doesn't mean there's something fundamental and
*  really powerful about both the small and the big things going on within the actual research and
*  development within those communities. There's a lot of exciting developments and the scale at which
*  those developments might actually have a transformative impact, the time scale is
*  unclear. It seems like we certainly over promise. We dream too big and too aggressively
*  in the AI community. But a lot of- Yeah. And I'm happy to give people the benefit of the doubt when
*  they're over promising, but not when they're making their own money. When you start making your own
*  currency, then you don't get the benefit of the doubt. Because if your idea needs you to have a
*  new currency that you print when Bitcoin is out there, then I'm going to go ahead and assume that
*  you're doing this for the money printing. It's a good time to mention that I am actually launching
*  my new coin called Lexcoin. You mean shitcoin? Yes. Oh God. I'm going to have to block you with love.
*  Okay. One thing I wanted to ask you about is the Fed's, this paper they released in January 20th,
*  the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC. What are your thoughts about that? Is it just
*  their pros and cons to this? Is it all interesting to you that they're even considering this kind of
*  thing? I used to think that it's just basically a waffle. It's meaningless. Because as it exists,
*  the dollar is a central bank digital currency. The vast majority of dollars are digital.
*  But I think the way that over the last couple of years, I've changed my mind on this. I think
*  there's some serious substance behind these ideas. What they mean effectively is the
*  disintermediation of the banking system and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve.
*  This is kind of the really dangerous idea. I think this is enormously significant. Effectively,
*  as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union, what this is, is the return of the Ghost Bank
*  on a global scale with modern technology. Under the Soviet Union, there was something called the
*  Ghost Bank or the People's Bank. That was the only bank in the country. You had an account with the
*  national bank. If you said something wrong, your money got terminated from the Ghost Bank.
*  Now, imagine that combined with the power of digital technology. You can see that this could
*  be an enormously powerful technology, really. Because if banks are out of the picture,
*  then we change the fundamental reality of fiat as being the creation of money through lending.
*  Then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat, by government fiat. We move to a system in
*  which money is just basically... It's like we have money that is pieces of paper. Every time we've
*  had fiat money that was just pieces of paper, it collapsed very quickly. With the current system,
*  money is credit, and the creation of credit is restricted to some point. The creation of credit
*  is self-correcting. I discussed this in the fiat standard. If the central bank allows banks to
*  create too much credit, that creates a bubble, and then there's a collapse in the money supply,
*  which prevents hyperinflation from happening because the money creation is self-destructive.
*  It's self-correcting. You end up with an average of like 7% per year increase because you have 10%
*  for five years, and then you get negative 20% for one year, and it's correcting. But now,
*  if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism, it's just assigning money directly,
*  we're likely going to get much faster inflation. I think that's obviously a huge problem, and perhaps
*  the even bigger problem is the enormous amount of power that it gives to governments. It allows them
*  to create an awful dystopia where you've got your money on your phone, and anything you do
*  is completely supervised and controlled through your spending. They want to introduce a new
*  lockdown, then they'll just make your money not work. Your money's broken today, you can't spend
*  money, or you can only spend money in your local supermarket for the next three months because
*  you can't leave your neighborhood. Your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.
*  This Chinese social credit score system is an example of this, and I don't know. I don't have
*  a crystal ball, so I don't know what the likelihood is of implementing something like this in the US.
*  I've discussed it with Michael Saylor. He thinks it's highly unlikely. He thinks the people who've
*  been pushing this are very far from the position of power, and the traditional monetary and financial
*  system is going to survive intact. I certainly hope so. I think this would be a terrible thing
*  if it comes to pass, but I don't think... Many people think that it is something that would
*  undermine Bitcoin. A lot of common objection to Bitcoin is, well, governments are just going to
*  launch their own digital currencies, and then Bitcoin is going to die. I think this is completely
*  missing the point. People think Bitcoin is important because it's digital. It's not.
*  National currencies can be digital. Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary,
*  and because nobody controls it. Central bank digital currencies are likely to be very
*  inflationary, and they're likely to have very strong control at the top. So if anything,
*  they are an advertisement for Bitcoin rather than a replacement for it.
*  If it's Bitcoin, if it's gold, it's a way for multiple nations to partake.
*  So if you were to imagine a future where we move from the fiat standard back to the gold standard,
*  and then to the Bitcoin standard, or skipping that, going directly to the Bitcoin standard,
*  what would it take? Is it gradual? Is it immediate? What are possible trajectories that take us...
*  Well, basically where the final sort of empirical observation is that Bitcoin overtakes
*  first gold and then bonds in terms of its monetary power in the world.
*  But just specifically from a government perspective, how do we move the United
*  States, China, Russia, India, European Union to Bitcoin standard?
*  I'm not entirely concerned about whether governments move or not. In fact, I'd be very
*  happy for them not to move as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate more and more
*  Bitcoin while it's still cheap. So the people will move and the governments will catch up
*  Yeah. And I think this is kind of what I allude to. I mean, the point of the fiat standard is
*  really a Bitcoin book. It talks about fiat most of the time, but it does so to analyze Bitcoin
*  and the rise of Bitcoin. In the final chapter, I discuss how I think this relationship plays out.
*  The way that I tend to think of it is that most likely what's going to happen is we're going to
*  have a kind of financial apartheid where there's going to be two monetary systems.
*  One is government controlled and it comes with increasing amounts of surveillance and inflation.
*  And then if you want, you can just opt out of that and get into Bitcoin. And it's likely going
*  to be difficult for governments to stop people from getting into Bitcoin for all the technical
*  reasons that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin. So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,
*  which is not inflationary and does not have a central authority that can censor it.
*  I think gradually is my hope. And I also think my most likely scenario, but maybe I am biased
*  because everybody thinks what they want is what's going to happen. I think we're just going to
*  witness the same relationship because governments make their currency so that they can devalue them.
*  And Bitcoin thrives on that. And more and more people are going to learn, more and more people
*  are going to find out. And whether it's through curiosity or self-interest or through the
*  destruction of the national currency, all roads lead to Bitcoin. So more and more people are
*  going to buy Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin is going to go up. And as it goes up, Bitcoin becomes
*  a more significant part of the world economy. And this is something that skeptics don't get.
*  A lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin, they offer up all of these theories about why
*  they think Bitcoin can't work and then they present it and they think they've delivered
*  the knockout blow as if Bitcoin needs their permission or the world is going to need their
*  permission. Well, the reality is people are going to join Bitcoin out of greed, out of self-interest.
*  Number go up technology is really what's going to get everybody in. And that's really the trojan
*  horse for fixing the world. Come for the greed and stay for the revolution. It's going to keep
*  going up because people don't like to be poor, except for most economists and academics.
*  People don't like to be poor. People don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed. And they care more
*  about their self-interest than they care about economic theories about whether this works as
*  money or not. They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation and managed to get a bigger house
*  because they bought Bitcoin five years ago. They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin and
*  start buying more Bitcoin. And this is, I think, an indomitable force that's going to continue.
*  And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean toward an apocalyptic transition. The fiat's
*  going to collapse. We're going to get hyperinflation. Everything is going to be terrible.
*  And then we're going to move to Bitcoin. And I present the case for why I think maybe that might
*  not be the case. Maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic scenario. And this was like the
*  conclusion of the fiat standard, which is once you realize that mining fiat is creating debt,
*  and Bitcoin is allowing... So in order to have fiat money, we need to have people borrow. We need
*  to have people make loans. And the problem that fiat money runs into today is that if you want to
*  save money, if you want to hold savings, you have a problem. Where do you put your savings?
*  So you put your savings in debt, in the creation of more bonds. Wherever you take your savings,
*  you create a bubble in those things. And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,
*  a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing. It's because people are looking for savings,
*  looking for a place where they can save. All of those things are crappy saving instruments
*  because they're like copper in that there's nothing to stop the people behind them to make
*  more of them. House builders can build more houses. Governments can issue more bonds.
*  Crappy fraudulent companies can list on the stock market and make more stocks.
*  Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet. We don't need to keep creating more debt.
*  We can invest in this asset that is hard and that is internationally liquid, and that nobody can
*  make more of. So there is no bubble in it. There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the
*  supply and bring the price crashing down, like with copper and real estate and bonds.
*  So Bitcoin is the way out. And this is why I think there's a good case to be made for why the fiat
*  authorities might embrace Bitcoin because they'll see it as their way out of this
*  enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in. Particularly the richest and most powerful people
*  in the world and the richest and most powerful governments in the world are the world's biggest
*  borrowers. They're the ones in a lot of debt. So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that
*  debt as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset that continues to appreciate is the peaceful
*  way that we wind down the fiat Ponzi, I think. You could see it being like a political part of a
*  political platform for future people that run for president, those kinds of things to address.
*  Obviously, it's not just for the powerful and the rich. The people are bothered by the debt.
*  The people are bothered by everything that you describe with fiat. And if you want to
*  sell yourself in a democracy as a good leader, you might want to make that part of the platform.
*  You mentioned you know Michael Malice. He just texted me asking me to ask you,
*  what do you like best about Michael Malice? If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour
*  talking about the genius of Michael Malice, what do you like? Where does one even start? Well,
*  obviously the haircut first. Yeah, he just gets sexier with age. That's for sure. That's
*  it. Do you know his ideas, his trolling and humor? Have you gotten a chance to interact with him?
*  Yes, yes. I've met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago in New York. I used to live in New York when he
*  used to live in New York. I met him a couple of times. There was a bunch of anarchists in New
*  York who used to throw a happy hour once a month. It was called the high time preference,
*  a happy hour in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe. So I met him there a couple of times and
*  we followed each other on Twitter for a while. Is there interesting that you're aware of
*  philosophical differences in your worldviews? No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.
*  I think the difference is mainly that he spends a lot of time focusing on American politics and
*  American pop culture, which I don't pay much attention to, I guess. So you look more
*  at the monetary system, the economics of it all, and just the history and just looking at zooming
*  out at the big picture of it all. Although recently he's working on a book called The White Pill,
*  and he's been, every time I see him, I mean, he's in some dark aspect of the 20th century.
*  He's just like, I just finished writing about Hall and Amor. As you might imagine, he's not
*  taking much, I believe, of a monetary perspective on things. His book, his writing, at least for
*  time, his kind of philosophical ideology perspective that's outside of the monetary system.
*  But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked. Yeah, and I don't think he would disagree.
*  But a book can only be so long, I suppose. It can only focus on so many things.
*  If you can put on your wise sage hat and give some advice to young people. I mean,
*  the past four hours have been a kind of advice, but if you can focus, and if somebody in high
*  school or college is thinking about what to do with their career, can have a successful career,
*  or to have a life they can be proud of, what would you tell them? I'd say probably the most
*  important advice that I would give is to find a way to give value to other people. This is really
*  the key thing. You need to wake up every morning and figure out how to serve others. This is
*  the key to everything you want in life. Everything that you want is on the other side of you serving
*  others. So figure out how you can serve others in a good way, how you can do it in a way that
*  they value, and you've got an incredible mechanism for figuring that out, which is the market.
*  Go out there and do things for other people. The market will tell you.
*  The market will tell you exactly. If you're young, you have the enormous advantage of being able to
*  make mistakes essentially and learn from them. So go out there, do things of value for others,
*  figuring out how you can do something that contributes the most value to other people's
*  lives. Increasingly, I think with the modern technology, this is increasingly becoming online.
*  It's I think you should consider how you can create value online because that scales beyond
*  anything that you can do in the physical world in a very, very well, maybe not beyond obviously,
*  there are profitable businesses in the physical world. But I think online is enormous potential
*  and coding I think is enormously powerful. I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend people get
*  into learning how to code. I think it's probably the thing that carries the most power. So initially,
*  we were working with our hands. We started working with machines. Machines are much more productive.
*  While code is an even higher level of productivity where you basically program the machines to produce
*  things. So a few clicks of a keyboard and you can move millions of machines around the world in
*  certain ways. So it carries an enormous amount of value. I think I always tell all young people to
*  learn to code. It's the best thing. I used to tell it to my students when I was at university,
*  tell them to drop out and go learn to code. It's probably a better use of their time and money.
*  We could probably do both. Yeah, university has an interesting function. I mean,
*  probably you and I have different perspective on this probably has to do with a little bit
*  of a different journey in terms of fields because I've stayed engineering focused for a long time
*  and there's less some of the troubles you might highlight in the education system.
*  There's less troubles of that kind in engineering because math hasn't changed for a long time. So
*  a lot of it is just doing hard things, being forced to do hard things and becoming a bit of
*  a journalist while on the side you're also becoming a specialist based on your own passion,
*  driven by your own passion. So school, at least high school, I don't know about the university,
*  but high school has a really nice, one of the only times in your life, at least in my life,
*  I was forced, but now I see given the opportunity to spend my entire day learning broadly.
*  And that's something, I don't know, the way time works, it just runs away from you. You never
*  really get a chance to do, learn quite that broadly again. That's the curse of specialization is you
*  kind of never get a chance to study biology, chemistry. If you're a physicist, time runs
*  away from you. So enjoy the broad education. But yeah, like you said, find the things that
*  valued by the market. And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff. So that's also a way
*  to get happiness. Yeah. And I'll also add the horse that I like to whip all the time is the
*  low time preference aspect of things, saving with Bitcoin. So I think my advice to young people is,
*  you know, when you're young, you think of the world in a very short term. Generally, you're
*  focused on the present and you think that everything that's happening in the present is
*  the most important thing that's ever going to happen in the history of humanity. Lower your
*  time preference, think about the future, think further down the line, think about the consequences
*  of the things you do, and then what, you know? And so you do this now, it feels good today, but then
*  what happens tomorrow? You know, you go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself, think about the hangover.
*  But more long term, think about the implication of living this kind of life. Think about every
*  decision that you make, the long term implication of it. And part of that is Bitcoin. Part of that
*  is save in Bitcoin. I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the long term. Don't buy
*  Bitcoin for the short term. You know, don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it. You know,
*  don't put your savings in Bitcoin today so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.
*  Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin for another five, 10 years or so,
*  at least four years is what I recommend for people. So keep a low time preference,
*  focus on the future and save in Bitcoin. And learn about how to buy Bitcoin, how to learn
*  about all this technology. Part of this is this conversation, but there's so much awesome material
*  out there. And thank you, by the way, for this gift of a hardware wallet. Nice. So you should
*  definitely invest in it yourself. And what would you call this? These are... Open dimes. Open dimes.
*  Yeah. So this is like USB that you can... Like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.
*  Yeah. So you don't have to worry about knowing the password. It contains the password within it,
*  and it's tamper proof. So you can save the Bitcoin on it. And... So when the apocalypse comes,
*  you need the value to be stored on an actual thing that you can have in your physical possession.
*  Yeah. That's exactly what this is. You've had a heck of a life. You've been in a bunch of places
*  in this world. A lot of places. Life is not easy in some of those places. What has been,
*  if you can take a step to maybe a bit of a dark step for a short time, what has been a
*  maybe darkest time, period, place you ever got in your mind, a dark period of your life,
*  a struggle you had to overcome, you had to survive? Well, I'm Palestinian. So that is the
*  tragedy of my life. I'm Palestinian, Jordanian. My family's suffered a lot because of this.
*  Historically, I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank. It wasn't ideal to see that.
*  People like to think of it as this intractable conflict between two bitter enemies. But
*  the reality of the matter is that it's not. A foreign ideology came in with the idea that
*  this country needs to be occupied by people from only one religion. Jews had always lived
*  in Palestine historically. At the turn of the 20th century, they were only 10% of the population.
*  But then with the birth of fiat money, incidentally, the link with all of this is that
*  when the Bank of England went off gold, a big reason why they were able to pull that off was
*  that the Rothschild banking family supported them. In exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine.
*  The Balfour Declaration was written by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,
*  telling them that they'd like to make Palestine a homeland for Jews. So obviously, that's not very
*  convenient for people who are not Jewish for whom that is a homeland. The past 80 years has been a
*  very painful struggle if you happen to not be Jewish. Obviously, Palestinians have done all
*  kinds of things, trying to fight back, and they've done all kinds of wrong things.
*  But I don't think you can escape the fundamental reality underlying this, which is that if you're
*  not Jewish, you are being moved out of the land. And so it's happened in 1947, 48. It happened in
*  1976. More land was taken over by Israel. Now you see it with the settlements. If you ignore the
*  day-to-day headlines and you ignore the media propaganda and you ignore all of this, there's
*  a very clear thing that is happening, which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology that
*  believes this land needs to be owned by people from one religion and everybody else is being
*  kicked out. And so that is the tragedy of my life. And my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from
*  Lebanon, and her family was evicted from Yaffa, which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.
*  They still have their homes in Yaffa. Their homes are being lived. They got kicked out of their
*  homes and their lands and their property. They became refugees in Lebanon. So my children,
*  it's an ongoing tragedy. It's not something that is... A lot of the people that think of it as,
*  they think Palestinians are just out there to get Israelis because they hate them, but it's
*  an inescapable tragedy. I don't have a home anywhere. Is there an escape from this tragedy
*  in the future that you see? If you zoom out across the scale of decades, will we see...
*  I hesitate to say peace, but
*  a significant decrease in human suffering in this part of the region?
*  I certainly hope so. And I think my interest in Bitcoin came from a place of desperation
*  with the situation there. Traditional politics is a dead end. I don't see what I can be doing to
*  what I can be doing to make things better there using traditional politics. And I think a good
*  friend of mine, Pierre Rochard, you may know him on Twitter, one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin,
*  in my opinion, he told me his theory is that Bitcoin is going to bring peace to the Middle
*  East because land is a shit coin. Land is a shit coin. I love it. And I think he's got a very good
*  point there that this fixation with land and the bitterness with which people have to live with
*  land is likely to decline when people are going to have a form of property that they can keep.
*  And so hopefully that will help in one way. And of course, the more obvious way is that
*  this is a conflict of governments and it's a conflict that is financed by Fiat.
*  From day one, the entirely insane notion that you could build a national and ethnic homeland. And
*  of course, this is the early 20th century. So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place
*  where all these other ethnic nationalisms of Europe were emerging. And we saw how horribly
*  these worked out. But the idea that you could... It's one thing to say we want to build a homeland
*  for Germans in Germany. It's one thing to say we want to build a homeland for Germans somewhere
*  else. And that was Palestine. That was Zionism. And that was only possible thanks to Fiat,
*  thanks to the ability of the British government and all these other governments to continue to
*  finance this colonialist effort over time. And it continues to finance war. And we see war all
*  over the world continue to escalate because the people who make the decision to escalate the war
*  are not the ones who are paying for it and they're not the ones who are fighting. They're the ones
*  who sit in offices. And in the case of most of Middle Eastern conflict, it's people who live
*  abroad. It's people who are abroad who are not part of it, who just are emotionally charged to it
*  because they watch it on TV. So you have billions of Muslims around the world and Jews around the
*  world who feel extremely emotionally attached to it. They're not the ones fighting. They're not the
*  ones paying their own money. They're just getting governments to send money and to send weapons and
*  take part. And it's fun as a spectator sport for most of these people because they don't get to
*  live in it. But I got to live in it. I saw it. I grew up there. I saw the settlement expansion.
*  And recently, a few weeks ago, I went back to Ramallah and it's amazing every time you go,
*  the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way. It's not just housing units that are going
*  up. It's an entire attempt to basically suffocate Palestinian areas and force Palestinians to leave
*  or keep them living in horrific conditions. And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,
*  I have family in Russia, since this war, echoes of similar things are happening in that part of
*  the world too. And I shudder to think about the decades to come of the hate that is brewing,
*  the suffering that is brewing based on decisions and pressures from not always people directly
*  impacted by this. So again, it feels like that military conflict is not just a creation of
*  people on the ground. It's a creation of leaders, power centers. And perhaps, again,
*  I'm not smart enough, but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.
*  I absolutely think it does. Monetary system is what allows people to just continue to treat war
*  as a spectator sport. That's really what it comes down to. It starts with World War I
*  and it's continued. And this is why I think I've said this before, I've tweeted this before,
*  and it was a pretty popular tweet, but it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea with mockery,
*  of course. But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology that's going to end World War I.
*  Once World War I started, we got into this endless conflict that's been ongoing since then.
*  If you look at all the world's conflicts today, pretty much they all trace back to World War I.
*  And it's because when that Pandora's box of government control of money was opened,
*  there was no longer a real restraint on war except complete defeat and complete destruction
*  and complete death. The war had to be total. Before that, under the gold standard,
*  kings would send professional armies to fight each other in battlefields. And as soon as it became
*  clear that one side was establishing an advantage, the fighting would stop and the kings would
*  settle, would agree to new terms, because it was extremely expensive to build a professional army
*  and you ran out of money. So it was always the smartest thing to do, is to just stop fighting
*  whenever you could. And wars would take place, countries would fight each other in the battlefield,
*  but in the cities, life went on as normal. And people within the same cities, within the cities
*  of the two countries would be trading with one another. Life would go on, but the war would be
*  there. And it was just an independent part of politics that, all right, we have a problem over
*  this piece of land, let's do it, let's take it outside. We don't fight in the civilian areas,
*  we go to the battlefield, we fight with professional armies. And in fact, sometimes the
*  conflicts would be, the armies would line up and they would just have a small contingent of the two
*  armies fight with one another. And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage, then, all right,
*  well, you won, let's move on with it. Governments were far, far, far more careful about their
*  monetary policy and their, sorry, their war policy when they couldn't print their money. And that
*  has changed with fiat. And that has allowed this new emergence of this class of what I like to call
*  chicken hawks of people who sit in offices, like the entire foreign policy establishment in
*  Washington, D.C., people who have never fought a war, whose children will never fight a war,
*  who will never pay to fight a war, who will never suffer a broken window in their house because of
*  war. Sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage that they teach at moronic fiat
*  universities about politics and geopolitics, making decisions about, you know, we need to invade that
*  country and we need to send war there. And they can do that because they have this endless money
*  printer. And that's why, you know, back under gold, if you were a warrior, you know, you went and
*  actually joined the war. And that, you know, the people who pontificated about war were the people
*  who had experience with war, the people who were sending their own children to war, the people who
*  were fighting with their own money. Now you have all these fat parasitics come sitting in Washington,
*  D.C., deciding, and Washington's just an example, but all over the world this exists. People who have
*  never fought, who will never carry the consequences, who are going to devalue the world's money
*  in order to go and have other people's children fight each other because of stupid garbage they
*  learned about politics in university. You said you value low time preference, but I have news for you
*  that one day you will die, as far as we know, you're a mortal being. Do you think about your
*  death? Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it? I've spent a lot of time
*  introspecting and thinking about these things and I value life a lot. I value my time on earth a lot.
*  And you'll see this in my dealings with people, you know, go back to Twitter, why am I so brash
*  and straightforward? It really is because life is short. Because I don't want to waste, I think,
*  I've said this before, on my tombstone, let it be written, he never let anyone waste his time twice
*  in his life. His life is short. Yeah, you can waste my time once, you can get me to do something and
*  then I realize that was a waste of time, you will never get me to waste my time twice. And so you
*  show up in my Twitter with something stupid, you're never showing up in my Twitter ever again.
*  So you're a fast learner. You give people a chance, but you're a fast learner.
*  Yeah, so I try and use my time very wisely. I'm unapologetic about it. My time is the most
*  precious thing and the way to get on my shit list forever is to try and take away my time
*  and to abuse my time. If you do that, it's the one unforgivable sin for me.
*  And I think that's really, I think that's my way of coming to terms with mortality. We're all going
*  to die. And so let's make the most out of it while we're still here. And of course, the other way you
*  come to terms with mortality is you have children. Given what you just said, doubly so, it's a huge
*  honor that you would spend your valuable time with me. This is the first time you did it,
*  so you probably regret all of it. So we'll probably never see each other again. But I'm glad you at
*  least took the chance to do it. It's a huge honor and I've been a huge fan of yours. I think you
*  have impact on the world that you probably are not even aware of. It's tremendous. A lot of people
*  love you and your work is important. Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say and
*  there's people that disagree with you, but everybody respects you. And thank you so much for spending
*  your really valuable time with me today, brother. Thank you, sir. Really appreciate it. This was not
*  a waste of time and I'd be happy to do it again. Thanks for listening to this conversation with
*  Save Dina Moose. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.
*  Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the
*  rest. It is the control of the means for all our ends. Thank you for listening and hope to see you
*  next time.
