# Ben Askren: Wrestling and MMA | Lex Fridman Podcast #242
**Lex Fridman:** [November 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tApj7Q37P2k)
*  The following is a conversation with Ben Askren, wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant,
*  opinionated, and fun personality in the world of martial arts. And yes, he occasionally likes to
*  talk a little trash. Given his wild online antics and his boxing match with Jake Paul,
*  some people may forget just how dominant he was in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of
*  his career. In wrestling, he is a two-time NCAA Division I national champion and four-time finalist.
*  In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years with a record of 19-0 before losing
*  to Jorge Masvidal with a flying knee that caught everyone by surprise. He is also into cryptocurrency,
*  disc golf, and is the co-host of Flow Wrestling Radio Live. This is the Alex Friedman Podcast
*  to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's my conversation
*  with Ben Askren. Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career, your MMA career,
*  let me ask you, I have to ask you. What did you think about the Jake Paul versus Tyron Woodley fight?
*  Well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously biased. I thought Tyron won. I had five rounds of three.
*  And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it. I thought he was more effective
*  with the striking and he was more aggressive. Jake had more volume, but that was the only thing
*  I would give him. And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way. They thought he landed more,
*  significantly more punches. I just didn't think he really did any damage. It was a split decision.
*  Split decision, yeah. Were you surprised? Well, the thing I said when I went in to fight him,
*  I said, maybe he's good, maybe he's not. We really have no idea to this point, you know?
*  And so I knew Tyron was a lot better at boxing than I was. And so I thought, okay, Tyron's,
*  I think it's a good likely that Tyron beats him up. But there's a chance that Jake's kind of good
*  at this. And I think that's kind of what played out is he's kind of good at it. Even if you saw
*  it the way I saw it, he still was impressive in his showing and he's obviously put a lot of time
*  into it. So he's, he's not bad. We'll say that much, you know? But isn't it surprising to you
*  that like a elite level athlete, combat athlete lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously,
*  but is nevertheless not elite level? I think boxing is a really specific rule set. So I'll
*  speak about Tyron, not myself. Tyron had good striking, but obviously it was his first boxing
*  match ever. And within mixed martial arts, you have the, the fear of the takedown and the fear
*  of the kick and fear of other things to go along with the punching. And so if you look at Tyron
*  throughout his MMA career, lots of times what set up his punches were like level change fakes at a
*  takedown, they dropped boom, and then something comes over the top, right? So there's many more
*  elements to worry about mixed martial arts, whereas boxing, there's only one. It was his first
*  fight. Yes, I thought Tyron was going to win. I thought this was going to happen. But like I said,
*  it's pretty evident that Jake's, he's not bad at boxing. He's pretty solid, you know,
*  he gets in there and works hard at it, I guess. Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake
*  wins? I guess Tyron? I guess Tyron. They fight again and again and again, like iteratively.
*  Yeah. So I mean, part of the thing is, okay, so Jake's corner said you need a knockout going
*  into the eighth round, right? So I think they thought, maybe they're trying to motivate him,
*  but I don't see it that way. Because if they were actually thought that he was winning,
*  why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk when Tyron has clearly has knockout power, right?
*  It's a really stupid coaching philosophy, if that's what you're thinking. So you obviously
*  are thinking, hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive. And I feel like
*  Tyron thought maybe he was winning and didn't have the urgency necessary. And so I think he
*  does a chance he turns it up a lot. Hmm. Now I would want to watch him again before I.
*  So I have this problem with my personality. Here's my personality, Lex. I have an issue
*  with not being able to give really exact answers. So I hate giving you an answer that like,
*  I don't feel like is 100% calculated. So I would like to see them go once more because I would
*  like to see, hey, can Tyron, if, because if Tyron can turn up the pace and Jake can't handle it,
*  then I think it's an eight, one or nine, two, right? If it goes the exact same way, and maybe
*  Tyron wins a close split decision, I'm saying, oh, it's probably close every single time,
*  we're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing, you know? So it's like, I feel like out of
*  one match, it's not totally indicative of what the future is going to look like. I feel like
*  Tyron would get a knockout and then you would still be in the same place. Like not not knowing,
*  not knowing what to predict. Okay. So your fight with Jake Paul, looking back, you have had a
*  little bit of time now. How would you analyze that fight?
*  Well, I mean, the fight specifically, I got cracked with an overhand right. So I mean, it kind of
*  sucks. I would say, you know, this is where I was like, I don't, I really don't care. And everyone's
*  like, why would you make it turns your reputation? It's like, well, I wanted to do it. I had enjoyable
*  time training and in the buildup. Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to get the win. But if I
*  even despite the fact that I know it's going to happen, what happened, if someone asked me to do
*  it again, I probably would have done it again, you know? And so the way I was thinking about when I
*  was starting whether to do it or not, because I got the offer. It's like, okay, is this money,
*  it can change my life. Yeah, it could, right? It's not going to double my net worth, but it's going
*  to add significantly and make my life easier. Number two is like when I was in high school,
*  we used to do boxing matches for free just because we thought it was fun. We didn't have
*  something going on Friday night. Me and my buddies would get together and we had some boxing goes
*  on base and we'd punch each other in the head. So it's like for something I think is enjoyable
*  and not going to pay me a whole bunch of money. Yeah, sure. I'll do it. Would you do you think if
*  you got the rematch, if you did the rematch, would you what are the odds you win? Okay, let's say
*  probably not very good. I think he's pretty good actually. And I'm not very good. Now it's probably
*  at a low point for me because I so when I started training for that, I was like 215 pounds, which is
*  the heaviest I've ever been. I came off my hip surgery. I literally like when I said,
*  yes, like I'll do it. Like I literally started working out like the week before for the first
*  time in my, you know, it's a surgery because I wasn't able to do anything. So could I, could I
*  perform better? Yeah. But now after watching him box, Tyrone, like if you ask me, Ben, can you be
*  Tyrone? Probably not. I don't think I can be Tyrone. So in boxing, correct, in boxing. Yeah. So my
*  chances of beating him, you know, and watching that card, it's like, damn, like kind of be fun
*  to box someone who I know sucks, who I know can beat. That's what would be fun, you know, because
*  like the training, the preparation was fun. But then obviously I got my butt kicked. That sucked.
*  You know, can I swear on this podcast? Yeah, of course. Okay. Well, I was going to drop an F-bomb,
*  I wasn't quite sure. I think that sucked is a swear. No, no, no. You could, you could drop all,
*  all of the F-bombs you want. So preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared for that fight
*  or the, the Jordan Burrows exhibition? I mean, like how did you approach it mentally, you know?
*  Well, the Burrows thing, I, I obviously it's okay. So when I retired the first time in 2017,
*  Burrows was the only current, like we'll say really elite level wrestler that I'd never trained with.
*  I was really good friends with Nebraska's head coach, still am. And I said, hey, I just want,
*  I'm going to pay my own way. I want to train with Jordan. Cause I want to see what it feels like.
*  You know, I want to get in there and mix it up. I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.
*  I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love. And so I flew myself down there in
*  January of 2018 and I spent four days training with Jordan. It was a really good time. It gave
*  me some great insight into how he thinks and you know, what a great champion he is. What was it
*  like training with him? Like what, can you get some insights? Like what the, like how hard is the,
*  the live training? Is it more drilling? Is it technical? Like how does his, it seems like his
*  style is very different than yours. So how does that match up in the room in terms of like
*  what you learn from each other, that kind of thing? We only went full live for one,
*  I think it was like a 12 or 15 minute go where we would just go wrestle. We did a bunch of simulated
*  live, but obviously he had, so I was a senior in college and he was a freshman in Nebraska.
*  And so we, our teams had dueled each other. He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time.
*  But he had followed my career. And so when I went in there, it was like, hey, I know you're really
*  good at this position. What about this position? What are you trying to do? How exactly does it
*  work? And then let's wrestle there, you know? And then, hey, what about this position? And so, you
*  know, we would spend 30 to 40 minutes talking about that position. On the ground or? It was
*  like, one was a chest strap. It wasn't for headlock. One was, I don't know, it's called,
*  we called the lightning dump, but it's a. The lightning dump? Yeah. I named, my buddy's name
*  was Lightning Luke Smith in high school and he was the first person I saw do it. So usually when I
*  see someone do something, then I named that move after them. Got it. I know, right? Great name.
*  It's a good name. Yeah. But so what I said with that is like,
*  he was still trying to be the best in the world. I was just trying to go work out with Jordan
*  Burrows because I enjoy wrestling. Yeah. Is like someone who at that point, what he has five world
*  titles at that four or five at that point a lot. And so I used to have my high school kids is like,
*  hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world, who's bringing someone in and saying,
*  how do I do this? How do I do that? What about this? What about that? And so the level of
*  inquisitiveness, that's a hard word, inquisitiveness he has is really impressive.
*  And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did because he's figuring out all these little
*  situations. And that's also one of the biggest things I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail
*  to do as they get older. Even when they get to early college age, they say, this is my style.
*  This is what I do. I'm going to lift and work out hard. And I'm, and I'm not going to add anything
*  to my game. You know, whereas you've seen many progressions in Jordan Burrows game, he just made
*  his 10th world team. And you, yeah. And I, you know, if you have a really keen eye, you've been
*  able to watch him change. You know, I've been watching him since 2007. He's changed so much
*  and obviously still maintained a world-class level almost the entire time.
*  When you say change, like what change? Cause he's, he's got that double leg.
*  Was that he like his doublet for the first time because Alex Deer, he hadn't hit in years.
*  Yeah. So that's like, when people think about Jordan Burrows, they think about the double leg
*  because in his early years fire, he had a great double leg. Right. And even in the, so in those
*  years, I would say the, the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg, wasn't his level of
*  explosiveness. It was his level of persistence. He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.
*  And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles and not a scramble. I'll say he's on you,
*  you know, and it was just, he was just super persistent with it. And I think that was probably
*  the key. And then you saw, you know, when he came out to the one of the first world championships in
*  2011, it was kind of that type of mentality. And then shortly after then, obviously everyone was
*  starting to lower their stance, getting lower. And he developed a really good like mantis go
*  behind series where he would go one way or the other way. Then he started developing a really
*  good like low single ankle pick type thing, you know, and then his hand, his hand fighting got
*  really tremendous, like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good. And now I just comment
*  at the 21 trials, like a few of the defensive sequences you got into, it's like, holy shit,
*  just not from an athletic standpoint, but from a technical standpoint, the things he
*  were doing were just tremendous. So I've seen him as someone like who's continued to reinvent
*  themselves over the course of the last 10, 12 years. Especially in the, as a junior and senior
*  in college, you're exceptionally dominant. If you were to face him at the peak, both of your
*  peaks of NCAA wrestling, could you, could you beat him? And if you can beat him, of course you can
*  beat him. How do you solve the Jordan Boros problem? Well, so for a folk style wrestling
*  standpoint, folk style. So, you know, he, he had some competitive matches as juniors, senior year,
*  he had a two, one win over, or maybe it's three, two over Michael Chandler, who was my teammate,
*  who's fighting in the UFC now. He had a two and one over Tyler Caldwell. So I think you can glean
*  some insight into that. You know, he got ridden, he got so mad about this up on a podcast. So
*  during Corona, we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about. Yeah. And we
*  were doing like the last 10 years, best 165s. And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.
*  Oh, wow. He got so mad. You want to come on the podcast the next day. So hopefully he doesn't
*  listen to this. Fuck you, man. You know, but you know, when was this? This is during Corona.
*  Corona last year. He got mad. We were talking about before the trials. Yeah, correct. Yeah. So,
*  Michael Chandler wrote them for two minutes plus and that was his junior year, not his senior year.
*  Sure. Right. But it's close. So I think there's some things there. I think the interesting thing
*  would be if I would have stuck around, right? So I chose to go into mixed martial arts after
*  2008, I would have been 74 and he would have been 74. So we would have had to wrestle. And then
*  I think that the freestyle Jordan Burrows puzzle is a lot more difficult to solve than the folk
*  style Jordan Burrows puzzle. And I think he would acknowledge that he's much better at freestyle
*  than he was at folk style. Although he was very good, he's better. This is like raw
*  speed, explosiveness, present a problem to you. Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really
*  excel on the mat in kind of either style. In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,
*  but in folk style, like his whole, like his entire college career, I think he has like 10 pins,
*  which is almost nothing, you know? So he was getting no value off the top position. He was
*  good enough on most people to get off bottom without it being an issue, but it wasn't like,
*  oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have to be careful. There's a lot of things here.
*  You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there. Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't want
*  to say never, but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare, very, very rare.
*  And he does have a lace transition, so he gets a lot of points there. So, and obviously freestyle
*  is, it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right? Where we're only doing takedowns.
*  Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials, to Kyle Dake?
*  Oh, Kyle's so, so he's so good, right? I mean, I think his performance in the Olympics was,
*  his loss to him was shocking to, I mean, the winners didn't happen to Kyle Dake. You know,
*  he's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever, and obviously he was on the
*  losing side for a while, and now he's on the winning side. But I think a lot of people thought
*  it was a coin flip, and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like
*  it's not a coin flip. It feels, now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake is going to win that
*  match significantly more times than he isn't, is what it feels like.
*  Yeah. I forgot which trials it was. Was it four years ago? Where Kyle Dake threw him,
*  like he, you saw inklings of like, oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.
*  Yeah. So at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw, but then he lost one of the matches
*  decisively, and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms.
*  So in actually in 16, at the trials we had, so Jake Herbert was number one seed, he was former,
*  as Guy Russell, I was a former world silver medalist. So you had David Taylor, who had not
*  made a team yet, who is now a world champion, Olympic champion. You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,
*  who was a two-time world champion now, and you had Jayden Cox in the bracket, who had not made
*  any teams yet, but is now, what, a four-time world medalist, two-time world champion. So, and then
*  obviously, Jayden came out on top of that, won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.
*  So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16, and Kyle's contention the whole time,
*  and they argued about this. So I actually did a little bit of backstabbing. Well, it's not,
*  it's not backstabbing. And both of them or just one? I didn't tell any of them. Okay. So Jordan
*  got mad. We talked about this fake match during Corona, right? We had to make up something to
*  talk about. Yeah, of course. There's obviously no matches. So we talked about this fake match.
*  Do you stand behind that statement, by the way? Listen, here's what I said. Kyle Dake's a four-time
*  NCAA champion. Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner. I said Kyle Dake wins 2-1 on a minute and six
*  ride time, which, I mean, is literally, we're talking as close as it gets, as close as it gets
*  for Kyle Dake, who's a four-time NCAA champion. Sorry, sorry, we're talking
*  over Jordan Burrows. Over Jordan Burrows. In a folk style match. In a folk style match.
*  Hypothetical. Completely hypothetical. Now or in college? In college. Both of them at their
*  peaks at 165 pounds. So completely hypothetical. And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed
*  at me for picking Kyle Dake. He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.
*  So I said, F that, that's dumb. We had to pick a winner. We had to do something hypothetical.
*  So I called Kyle Dake and I said, hey Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case in the
*  morning. If he's gonna do that, why don't you come in and argue your case? So no one else knew
*  Kyle was coming on the podcast. So they both show up and they went at it. But one of the
*  contentions Kyle had for years, and there's still this rule, if you win a world level medal,
*  the following year, you sit out until the very end of the American trials. And they do a best two or
*  three. So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan, he had to come through a tournament
*  on Saturday. Okay. Probably three matches. And then on Sunday he would wrestle Jordan in a best two
*  out of three. Right? So his contention was I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage because I have
*  to compete on Saturday and then compete on, which it's a fair argument. It really is. But I also see
*  USA wrestling's point is like, if someone wins a world medal, we're going to reward them because
*  we want that person on the team again. So it's crazy though that you're like Kyle Dake had to
*  wrestle because he's not wrestling bums in that. Yeah. And yeah, I don't know. I don't know how
*  wrestlers do it because you have to go to war like three matches and then face Jordan Borrows.
*  Yeah. Especially a few of those years with, you know, Dake had the name Andrew Howe, but
*  those were really competitive matches. David Taylor had really competitive matches with him. Isaiah
*  Martinez even got in there, DeRanger. So he had some really competitive matches before he ever got
*  to Jordan Borrows. So I never answered your initial question was how did I feel? So the Jordan
*  Borrows match, I was not in wrestling shape at all. Meaning wrestling's heavily dependent, especially
*  neutral positions, heavily dependent on timing and other things. I was wrestling very, very minimally
*  because I started fighting again. So like my athletic shape was great, but it was mainly for
*  fighting, I wasn't wrestling. So I think they were actually trying to do Borrows Dake at the Beat the
*  Streets. It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year. In New York? In New York City.
*  They usually raise like a million dollars. They started all these programs in New York City, which
*  I really wonder what they're doing with the money now because they probably can't have the kids
*  wrestling because New York's crazy. Anyways. I think New York figures out a way what to do with the
*  money. Hence Michael Mouse complaining that they're corrupt and all that. But it goes to the Beat the
*  Streets organization who then starts the clubs in New York. So I don't know what to do with the money.
*  Anyways, so I was called like, I don't know, two weeks before the event and said, hey, you know,
*  someone told us to wrestle Jordan Borrows. It fell out. Would you wrestle him? I said, yeah, sure.
*  Why not? You know, and it's like, listen, I trained with them for four days the year before. I had a
*  pretty good idea how the match was going to go. It wasn't going to go so well for me, but it's like,
*  okay, you're missing a main event. I can bring because of where I'm at right now in my life,
*  I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling. I can help you guys raise a bunch of money for Beat the
*  Streets. My goal is I think I thought I could get one takedown or turn on him was kind of my goal
*  for the match. I didn't get there. It wasn't kind of hard. He went hard. Yeah. That asshole gave me
*  a point. Yeah. I said, this is bullshit Jordan. I told him during the match, like this is bullshit.
*  You're fucking going too hard right now. Yeah. I'm not a wrestler. I'm not a wrestler anymore. I'm
*  a fighter. I'm coming in here. So yeah, so I had a really good idea. I mean, we wrestled together.
*  I think in a hit, he'll probably get mad because I think in the live go, we did like the 12 or 15
*  minutes, I think I actually scored a takedown in that, I believe maybe or maybe it was a turn.
*  He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever. Yeah. So I knew what was going to happen. I knew
*  what the outcome was going to be. I knew I could probably, I was hoping to stay competitive and
*  maybe lose like 10-2 or something like, yeah. Well, let's walk back because I think
*  I originally brought it up in terms of how prepared were you against Jake Paul versus
*  Jordan Baros. So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise? Yeah, I worked hard. Yeah, I did. But it was,
*  I told you, I started training for my, I mean, once I had my hip surgery, they said, you know,
*  for the first six weeks you can't even walk. And it was hard for me to listen to him because by week
*  four, four and a half, five, I was feeling pretty good. I want to get rid of my crutches, but I'm
*  like, you know what, this is for the rest of my life. And if you get the, so if you get the real
*  hip replacement, there's no wrestling, there's no nothing. Right. So that's the next step. So,
*  okay, I'm going to take this here. So I do my crutches for the six weeks. The next six weeks,
*  it's still like really low weight bearing, can't necessarily do anything, you know? So then I get
*  done with the three months, which is like January and I'm like, okay, I should start working out.
*  So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay, I'm now I'm fat, I'm fucking fat. I'm
*  going to get in better shape because I haven't been able to do anything. So I'm actually start
*  working out and then that happened. Right. So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months and
*  it gives me a good reason to get back in shape. And, you know, I knew I wasn't going to be a
*  full-time boxer. So it's like, okay, how do I put a boxing camp together? So I found, you know,
*  I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes, he came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing for
*  three months. I found a couple of his guy, K9 out of Michigan. He came over three weeks. He was
*  great. I went to Freddie Roche for a week. So I kind of like, you know, try to get as many good
*  as ideas as I could. And my thought was like, okay, well, if this dude sucks, I can just be tough and,
*  you know, block a few punches, get him tired and then beat him up. If he's good, that's probably
*  not much of my do-but in the next three months because I'm, I was never good at boxing in the
*  first place. All of my stand-up in mixed martial arts was predicated on how do I get through the
*  two or three punches that are going to come at me in the time I need to get ahold of them?
*  You know, it's only, you only have to make two or three of them miss and then boom, you're on top
*  of them, at least for me. That was all my striking was predicated on. It wasn't about, hey, I'm going
*  to do damage on the feet in order to make something else happen. It was like, how do I clear this
*  barrier, get ahold of you? And if you, I actually did the math one time. I think I got to take down
*  the knockout. If you include the knockout round against Miles Vidal, I got to take down in every
*  round except two. So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA, I got to take down.
*  Wow. Somewhere, somewhere in there. Okay. So you're hunting the take down once you, once,
*  right away, once you get, get your hands on them, you get to take down. Yeah. Okay. But the incredible
*  thing about you, I just recently talked, spent a couple of days with Jimmy Pedro and he talked
*  about his guys and just champions in general, hating to lose more than they love winning.
*  And the way you talked about losing, you lost very few times in your career, like later you
*  were dominating both the wrestling and MMA, but the way you took these losses against people that
*  are, I don't know, below elite level. It's fair. I was going to get pissy, but it's completely fair.
*  I thought he was a bum too. No, that's not what I meant. I'm in trouble. It's okay. No, it's good.
*  No, no, no, no. But like what, can you explain the psychology behind that? Like the, what,
*  is there a system behind this? Is there a philosophy behind this? Well, so I wasn't very good
*  in the beginning. I think that's where it all starts from. So I didn't start getting good
*  until the age of like 13. I started at five. I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.
*  Didn't really get good until 13. It's still at 13. I'm, I'm starting, I'm great. I'm getting
*  better, right? I'm pretty good. So I actually, I've actually, I have writing this book on sports
*  psych, but this, it's, I got, well, I got someone to write it for me kind of thing. Cause I've had
*  this philosophy for years that there's, there has to be this balance between two things, right? So
*  on the one hand, in this category, on the one hand, you have hating to lose a great champion has to
*  hate to lose, like you said, right? But on this other hand, you have to have someone who seeks out
*  challenges, right? Cause if you don't have that, you're never going to reach your full potential
*  either. And so you have to balance these two balls at the same time. Right? And so like, for me,
*  I always, and this is maybe because I wasn't good, but I was always like, let me go find the best
*  people to wrestle all the time. Let me go find, I would like literally like seven days ago when I
*  was starting to get better, it was like, and this is on the internet. Well, there's no one was using
*  the internet. It was like a wrestling magazine and like, Hey dad, there's a tournament here.
*  I think that are the kids going to be there? Can you take me two hours across the state today?
*  Please. You would wrestle like in competition against them, not in competition. Yeah. Yeah.
*  In competition. Hey, I heard there's this tournament. Here's the magazine says this tournament.
*  Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow? You, you weren't trying to win. You were trying
*  to get the experience. I was trying to wrestle the best guys. Maybe I win, maybe I lose. There's no,
*  when you still do a competition, there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss. You're just
*  doing competition. Right? So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys
*  of which I thought maybe I could come out on top. Right? So like eighth grade year,
*  I won way, what, you know, I probably lost a handful of times in the state of Wisconsin. It's
*  probably really, really minimal amount of times I lost, you know, but it was just about getting
*  the challenge. And it's like some, some kids and not kids in my club, cause I'll push them very
*  hard on this are scared of challenging themselves. They like being the big fish in the small pond.
*  They're not willing to go say, I'm going to, I want to go get that guy and I want to get that guy
*  and I want to get that guy. And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me is like,
*  I always just love the challenge. I enjoy competing thoroughly. Right? And I understood from
*  a young age because it wasn't a good losing is a part of it. You're not always going to win.
*  And that was kind of it. It's like, Hey, sometimes, you know, and for my MMA career,
*  I never planned it to go that way, but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.
*  And like, that's, that's pretty rare. I didn't plan for that to happen. That was just what
*  happened. Okay. But you also didn't lose like the second part of your college career. My 87,
*  I lost, I won my last 87 matches. Yeah. So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing.
*  You just, I don't like losing. I still don't like it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But you don't,
*  you don't seem to, you, you seem to kind of shrug it off a little bit.
*  Okay. So like specifically with these two instances that you bring up with the Mazda at all,
*  it feels definitely so, okay. All right. Let's go, let's go deep. Let's go. So the Mazda one,
*  it feels different because, um, so let's, for people who don't know, uh, Mazda loss was your
*  first loss in MMA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you know, it was a dramatic loss and there was
*  this kind of buildup as you were potentially one of the greats of all time coming into this fight.
*  And so there's pressure, all of that. So the, no, I mean, I, I was thoroughly enjoying it. I don't,
*  I didn't feel the pressure. So the Mazda fight is, he got one fucking move on me. It's not like he
*  beat me. And if we do that again, I think I win at that point in my life. For sure. I think I win
*  way, way, way more times than I lose. He knew that too. That's why he didn't want, he didn't
*  want to sound the sound of the bottom agreement. That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so
*  mad. Cause I had to continue to taunt him in order to get him to sign. Right. Um, so that one hurt
*  because, uh, as a real don't know my, my referrals go through fast. I did three fights in like, uh,
*  smaller leagues. I got signed by Bellator. I was undefeated for three and a half years. I was nine
*  and oh, um, when I got done with that in 2012, 2013, um, I, at that point in my head, I was just
*  going to transition to the UFC cause that's where you go. I was ranked like six in the world. I
*  hadn't really had a competitive match at the end of the Bellator thing. And Dana White for a reason
*  is still unknown to me. We still haven't had this conversation. I wish I could ask him. I should
*  ask him sometime, um, chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC. He just said, I went to his office,
*  and he really said, we're not interested. We're not going to make you an offer.
*  Did you, did you mention something to, uh, about him, about the UFC? That was a year before that.
*  That was the year before that. That might play a role in it, I think. So, uh, yes, what happened
*  the year before that was, uh, I called him a liar, which, but listen, I'm right on this one. Cause
*  he said, you can't test for drugs. Cause I'm, I'm all natural, which you could tell by my physique.
*  Um, and I was always put off by the fact that so many people cheated and I was very vocal about
*  that. And so he had made some statement like, Oh, well, there's no way you can test. I said,
*  bullshit. You, you very specifically said, you saw that does it for all other sports worldwide.
*  You can do it. And then it's funny cause I hired you saw that a couple of years later.
*  So I think he took some offense to that, but that was like a year and almost a year and a half,
*  I think somewhere later. Um, it's not like he holds a grudge or anything.
*  Yeah. So I, so I literally go to Vegas. Um, it's a long story. You can read about it other places.
*  I, so I got released from a belt. It's not like this is a negotiation. I got released from my
*  belt or contract. I said, I'm out of here. I'm going, I'm going to go to the UC. I go to Vegas
*  and then I was told, Hey, there's no offer for you. Tough shit. You know? So then I ended up
*  signing with one championship. I spent what? Three and a half years there. I won the belt in my second
*  fight and retain the title the entire time. And then I just, I think dominating people. Yeah. I
*  didn't have a competitive fight. And so, um, I retired 18 and all never, never get in for someone
*  who loves a challenge, never getting to really challenge myself was incredibly frustrating.
*  And I left the door open. I said, if I ever get the chance to prove them in this world,
*  I'd love to come back. So somehow a year later I get traded trades have never happened. And this
*  is the one and only trade ever. I got, I was been retired for a year. I got traded. I get to come
*  back. I fight Robbie Lauer, the first fight I win. And then essentially they're saying, okay,
*  if you fight, uh, you know, if you beat George, you're going to get the title shot against Marty.
*  And, um, it's like, this is, this is what I've been working for the entire, I've been trying to
*  prove I was the best part of the world for the last 10 years and I have not been afforded this
*  opportunity. Um, so when I lost to George, that was, that was hard because I, it was something that
*  I had waited for, for a really, really long time. It was something that I, you know, I thought I
*  could compete for it. I never got the opportunity to do. So that one was hard. Um, at the same time
*  from like just a competitive logistic, and it's like, he got me with one move. It wasn't like he
*  beat my ass for 15 minutes and I got beat a bunch of different ways. So that was like, fuck, like
*  if I get it again, I could have done it, but I'm not, I'm not, they're not going to let me have it
*  again. It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year or the next week or whatever,
*  you know, you lose a big 10, you go to nationals two weeks later. Does that loss change you in
*  any way, your psychology? I don't, I don't think so. It's the first loss. I mean, had I, had I
*  had a longer MMA career post that, there definitely would have been a lot of time spent
*  getting better at the end, the entry point to the takedown, right? Which I'd already spent time there.
*  Um, I don't, I, and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip, the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't
*  do was preventing me from doing some things. And it's why, if you look at the fight, I'm like bent
*  over as they go for the double leg. Yeah. So what happened for people who don't know you went in for
*  a double leg and he went, he did a flying knee and then caught you well. Specifically the way he did
*  that knee was kind of different than the way anyone had thrown flying knees before. Most people go
*  more just from a stand straight vertical, whereas he took a few like running steps and went more,
*  you know, the trajectory of the angle was different. Um, so I think that's kind of probably why it
*  caught, you know, I think a lot of things in combat, well, probably everything, but I
*  focus specifically on combat, have been subconsciously like our brain is reading what's coming at us
*  and, and lost time to stuff we've seen before so we can judge how to move correctly. And you misread
*  because it's something you haven't seen before. Had not seen him come at that specific angle. Yeah.
*  So that loss was really hard. With the Burroughs one, I told you, I knew I was going to lose. So
*  it was like, whatever, you know, I'm, I'm taking this because I want to put this sport of wrestling
*  out there in a big way. I want to help them raise a lot of money. We sold at Madison Square Garden,
*  Hulu theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money. So my goals were accomplished.
*  Jake Paul fight. I took it because they paid me a bunch of money. I thought it was going to be fun.
*  Did I have any illusion? I was a great boxer. No illusions whatsoever. Would I have preferred to win?
*  Absolutely. But you know, like I told everyone, whether I win or lose on Saturday night, I'm
*  going to be back coaching wrestling on Monday because that's what I enjoy doing. And I was back
*  coaching wrestling on Monday. And once I'm out, these middle school kids give me a little bit
*  shit about it. And that's it. But where were you in terms of your shape and how you felt
*  in the Mazda fight? Would you say you're on the, I mean, it's a difficult question to ask of,
*  of a world-class athlete, but like, were you past peak? Oh yeah. So I don't know. I don't know why
*  guys like to lie about that. I mean, the peak for me was really evidently in my late twenties.
*  Um, and maybe they are all fueled by extra supplements. I don't know. But for me,
*  that was evident, but you get this, so you get this crosshair where, um, your, if you're smart,
*  like, you know, like I mentioned, Joan Bros was, you're still gaining wisdom. You're gaining
*  strategy, gaining a lot of things, right? And so while your physicality may go down, your overall
*  skill level still may be rising, especially in MMA, because people usually start later because
*  they're gaining wisdom, strategy, all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right? They're
*  getting all these things. So their actual competitive peak, despite their athletic peak
*  going down, might still be a few years past that, right? Because these things are crossing. Um, no,
*  so I felt, I felt I was great. Obviously the hip was an issue. Um, it's funny because so that
*  I knew I had a lot of pain here and I knew it was because of this. And it was like, okay,
*  whenever I'm done, I'll just get it taken care of, whatever. Uh, but I, every time I train,
*  I have pain kind of like all up my back. And the day after the surgery, I woke up and there was no
*  pain on the right side of my, the surgery was on the left side. There's no pain on the right side
*  of my back. I'm like, that's fucking weird. Like every, every morning I wake up, there's a lot of
*  pain there, you know? Um, I'm like, okay, well I'm on pain pills. Maybe it'll, maybe it'll come back
*  tomorrow. And that's cause I never, never been back since my hip change. So it was weird cause
*  it was like this, I thought this was affecting this, but it was affecting all the way across
*  my whole back. So, you know, if I get to get a new hip, honestly, if I, if I, I don't know if this is
*  going to change the competitive outcome whatsoever. If I had known how good the hip replacement was
*  going to be, I would have done it the second I retired from one championship in November of 2017.
*  I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1. Just from a lifestyle standpoint,
*  I could only sleep in one position. I, there was a lot of things I couldn't do. I was in a lot of
*  pain. Um, so I would have done that a lot earlier, but no, from a athletic point,
*  I was ready. This shit goes wrong sometimes. I don't know how to ask this, but you know, Joe Rogan, me
*  had a, had a sense about you similar to like, uh, Phaidor that you are potentially one of the
*  greatest ever. Yeah. Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now of being in the top 10
*  yeah, of all time? I didn't prove it. I don't deserve it.
*  You had to, I mean, I didn't, I didn't prove it. I mean, so it's like, uh,
*  had I, had I somehow gotten to convince Dana White, we go and convince him in 2013 to make
*  me an offer and I didn't even need a good offer. I needed any offer. Had I gotten the offer then,
*  maybe the outcome's different, right? But given, I would never expect anyone to think of me that way.
*  I didn't prove it. I know, I know what I was and I'm good with that. And yeah, other people
*  never got to see that. Do you think, well, you don't know, you can't know fully, right? Do you
*  think if you, uh, went to the UFC at that time instead of one championship, I think it would
*  have a lot of success. Yeah. I mean, there's obviously certain guys, there's a lot of guys
*  I've trained with that I had a lot of really good results against. And, um, obviously Walter wait
*  Tyron was a champion for a long time there. So I was around Tyron was a champion. Anthony was a
*  champion at lightweight. I was, you know, same gym as him and we had a lot of people coming through.
*  Yeah. I faced time. Would I have fought him? I don't think so. I mean, so he was still the
*  champion when I came into the UFC and we said, no, we're not going to fight. All right. Hey,
*  so he can't change history, right? So once something happens, you got to accept for what it is and
*  move forward and, and obviously hope you can continue to keep accomplishing great things,
*  which for me, obviously my athletic career is over. So now it's going to be through my
*  wrestling academies and you know, who knows what else I get, get into. Oh, you might do exhibition
*  matches and all that kind of stuff, right? Wrestling and stuff. No, uh, I don't think so. So
*  here's my thing with the wrestling matches is like just for fun. If you said, Hey Ben, just for fun.
*  Would you love to go wrestle someone? Yeah, I would. I would. Right. I love, I love wrestling.
*  I get in there. I love, you know, I love like, so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.
*  He's in college, he got in Keegan O'Toole. He just won a junior world title this year.
*  And so when, when I'm doing private lessons, I have such a thing about the development of the
*  athletes. Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time it's like, I'm just going to help them
*  with whatever they need help with. And it's still wrestling and it's fun, but it's helping them,
*  you know, for like for Keegan Kozak this summer and he's trained for the junior world title.
*  So to be able to just shake hands sometimes and say like, I'm going to try to kick your ass.
*  Should you try to kick my ass? You know, like just to go like, it's so much fun and I don't
*  get to do that very much. So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches? And the answer is,
*  yeah. The problem, unfortunately for me, and maybe you could talk me off the lights here is like,
*  because of where I've gotten to in my career, if I choose to do a wrestling match, it's going to,
*  people are going to be really excited about it. It's going to pull up and it's like,
*  I just want to wrestle just to wrestle. I'd rather just like go in a room where no one can
*  watch and just wrestle and just enjoy it. Well, you could also wrestle. So there's different
*  kinds of wrestling. There's wrestling where there's an event and like, you know, there's a buildup
*  and then an announcement. And you can also do like a Khabib style, like in the room, there's cameras
*  and you're kind of going. Wait, Khabib does that? No, in... Marcel did that. He whipped my ass a few
*  times. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I've seen Khabib in some videos. It's not like set up. It's just
*  people going hard and then it's more fun. Yeah. You know, and it's also more like
*  presenting the beauty of the sport. Yeah, for sure. And like, and there's no winning or losing,
*  really, in that context. Yeah. Like you're just, you're always joking around a little bit,
*  even when you go super hard. So I feel like, especially in the modern day with the internet,
*  that's a compelling way to do. So I've thought about, this is the one thing I've thought about
*  doing because I told you about my buddy was the content thing. It's called Rockfin. I thought
*  about doing, you know, the old really famous Gracie challenge. Yeah. Okay. So I thought about
*  doing the Ashron challenge. Do you want to hear my rule set? Yeah. I'm not sure I'm going to do this.
*  People are going to show up here like in Wisconsin. I have to select you. I'll start with a thousand
*  bucks, right? Okay. 30 minutes. You pin me or I pin you. That's it. No points, no nothing. We just
*  wrestle. Camera, that's it, right? Camera in the room. Maybe there's a referee because we don't
*  want there to be content over the pin. So one pin, just one pin, 30 minutes, 30 minutes. Okay.
*  If I pin you, you don't get shit. You go home, right? Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand
*  dollars, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 and so on. If you make it the distance and I don't pin you and you
*  don't pin me, I'll pay for your travel and give you 500 bucks, right? Just a kind of consolation
*  prize for showing up. If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is. Wait, who's adding to
*  the jackpot? I am. It's my money. But then what's the incentive to keep winning for you?
*  Because the jackpot... Well, because I would put the content somewhere and people would watch it.
*  Oh, so you're going to make money. Yeah, so you'd make money that way. It's not exponentially growing,
*  right? It's just going up by like... Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people that
*  could pin me. So I would either just not choose those people or wait till I get a really large
*  audience and people get really excited. In that case, I'm making a lot of money. So what do you
*  think? How many matches would go with you? Like, Kaldek shows up. I don't think he could pin me.
*  Yeah. I mean, like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me, but he can't pin me. He was never a pinner.
*  Yeah. He ain't got to pin me. There's only a few people who have the skill level to do so, right?
*  It takes a lot. So pinning was one of my specialties. I had the fourth most of all time and I won the
*  pinning award the last two years. So you think you can get down on points and just pin them?
*  This is actually one of the issues I have with Jiu-Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo
*  thing. I actually think the Eddie Bravo thing is kind of... People get so mad at me. Sorry, Jiu-Jitsu.
*  I think it's bullshit. You want me to tell you why it's bullshit? Yeah. So like if Jordan Burrows
*  whoops my ass and the score is 16 to 2, but he can't pin me, then I get to go to overtime and
*  get a cradle on him? I'm probably going to pin him. So I'm better than Jordan Burrows? Nah,
*  that ain't right. He just whooped my ass. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, if we can go the whole...
*  They do submission only. So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for what? It's eight minutes,
*  10 minutes? I don't know what's the length of an Eddie Bravo match. Yeah, I don't know.
*  Something like that. Yeah. So we go 10 minutes. Me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes. He's going to
*  outscore me significantly. He will not pin me. I promise you that. Okay. So now we go to the
*  overtime. Strong words, but yeah. Jordan Burrows is not going to... He's going to beat me. I will
*  give you that. Kyle Dague won't pin you either. No. Okay. They will both beat me on points very badly.
*  David Taylor, he might pin me because he's a very good pinner also. They'll beat me very badly. They
*  will not pin me. But now we get to overtime and we get to pick like... So in Eddie Bravo, you get
*  rear naked choke or an arm bar. Okay. Give me a cradle. I'll probably pin him. Okay. A good cradle.
*  If you can say cradle or maybe give them... They're probably not going to pin me. Maybe there's a
*  chance, but probably not because that's just not their specialty. So for people who don't know,
*  Eddie Bravo thing is when it goes into overtime, you get a dominant position on a person and you
*  get to... Yeah. Basically put them in a cradle. This is the wrestling equivalent, but you take
*  their back. Maybe an arm bar. Yeah. Like a wrestling arm bar. Yeah. And I don't think that's very fair
*  because if someone whoops your ass, they whoop your ass. And so I think the reason why Jiu-Jitsu
*  people accept that rule set is that I don't think... I think they know this, but would admit it. I don't
*  think their point scoring system adequately rewards what people value. So in wrestling,
*  we value takedowns because it gets closer to the pin. And the most valuable scoring is a near fall
*  near to the pin because that's the ultimate goal of the sport. Whereas in Jiu-Jitsu, for example,
*  if I were to get a takedown... So if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn't pull guard,
*  I would probably get the takedown. Now, if somehow he didn't submit me, which he probably would,
*  but say he got close to 12 submissions, but somehow I slipped out of all of them.
*  Now I went to Zero, that's ridiculous. He should very clearly win because he almost submitted.
*  You know what I'm saying? And I realized the difficulty. I realized the difficulty in
*  rewarding near submissions, but that is the most valuable thing is getting close to finishing the
*  match. And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that. But okay, so this isn't
*  about the sport. This is about the Ben Askren challenge that we're talking about.
*  Okay. Why 30 minutes? Why not unlimited time? Why do I go until whenever?
*  Well, because then it's just a cardio thing. Because at some point, then someone would just
*  have to fall over dead, right? There's no more skill level involved. It's just who can stand
*  up the longest. You honestly don't think... 30 minutes is a cardio thing too. How do you think
*  that's actually going to look? Kyle Dade going against you for 30 minutes. So it's going to be
*  kind of boring for the most part. What position are you going to be stuck in?
*  Well, because you just can't have a gigantic amount of action for 30 minutes. So I related...
*  Because some of my kids, when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like, well, but I can't do
*  that for seven minutes. And I'm like, well, say if I had you do hand cleans at a relatively heavy
*  weight as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes. Your pace will slow down,
*  right? So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step here because in wrestling,
*  you're competing against someone. So if you're here at 100 and you go to 80, but they go to 70,
*  that's great. And then you go to 60, but they go to 40, this is even better, right? Because the gap
*  is growing. So we don't necessarily... If we get tired, that's fine. If they get more tired,
*  that's better. So I think most people would know that. So they would kind of slow it down.
*  But yeah, I think it's 30... I mean, I've wrestled 30 minutes ago. I've wrestled
*  hour long goes. You're not going to get so tired, you're going to fall over in that time period. But
*  at some point, if it's unlimited, someone will get so tired or dehydrated that they're just going to
*  freaking fall over. Yeah. But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic? You think the
*  other person is always going to be going for the pin and thereby make it dynamic. Well, if they're
*  working that hard, then they might exhaust themselves, right? And obviously then if you're
*  being that dynamic, then you're adding risk to yourself too, because you are doing that.
*  Well, I love this. This is a great idea. Well, I think I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums,
*  or not as great people in the beginning. And then I would start bringing in better people,
*  because they would be enticed by $20,000, the possibility to win. And not much fanfare,
*  just a camera and just... Camera. That's it. In my wrestling room. Yeah. Like the Gracie Challenge.
*  Yeah. And so then maybe you have like, for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds
*  of the most fun things that happen, and then you can watch the entire 30 minutes if you want to.
*  Yeah. I think most people, if they're not really, really elite, I'm probably going to pin them.
*  If they're not really elite. So yeah. But I don't know. That's something I've been thinking about.
*  This has been fun for me to think about. And obviously it plays in my skill sets,
*  because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also. So yeah. So like you said,
*  you weren't very good in your early days until 13, 14. What was the switch? You became... You
*  started to dominate people. In your college career, you dominated. And obviously you just
*  stopped losing at some point. Yeah. So well, I would say, so even when I didn't lose in collegiate
*  competition, I would go in the summers and try to make the world team. So I would lose some,
*  not a lot, right? Minimally. Okay. So when I'm five, I start playing all sports. I know you
*  moved to America at what age? 13. Okay. So at least I don't know what it was for you, but in America,
*  at my age, you usually played a sport every season, right? So that's what I did in the beginning.
*  I had minimal success in wrestling. I was kind of chunky. And then in fifth grade, I don't... And
*  I can't tell you, I wanted to be better. And I told my parents, and this is funny because now
*  I look at other 11 year olds and very few of them are this mature. And I actually think emotional
*  maturity is kind of one of the key indicators of how long-term successful someone's going to be.
*  And at age 11, I said, I don't want to play baseball. And I like baseball, but I don't want
*  to play baseball because I want to wrestle more because I want to get better at wrestling. So at
*  age 11, I quit baseball so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May. Because that was
*  all that existed at that point in time. You couldn't wrestle in June, July or any of those other months.
*  What was that desire to get better? What is it? So it's not about winning?
*  I don't know where it came from. I just want to get better. I want to get better. I want to be
*  good at this. I want to be really good at this. So when you're looking at kids now as a coach,
*  you're looking for that. Somebody who says, you know what? I kind of suck. I want to get better.
*  And I want to try to also inspire that. I mean, honestly, I think as a coach, that's probably my
*  biggest job is to get a kid and get them to believe I can do this. Because if I can do this,
*  what can I do? I can do that. I can do that too. And there's so many kids who unfortunately have
*  shitty parents or bad teachers that tell them, you suck. You can't be anything. So I think my
*  biggest goal as a coach is to get someone to believe they can do it. So actually some of the
*  ones that believe they can do it, they're the most fun, but they're not the ones who need it the most.
*  The ones who think they can are the ones that need me the most. They need someone to f-ck, let's go.
*  So I don't know what inspired me. I'm not sure. So at age 11, 5th grade, I quit. So then I started
*  having more success, you know, when I'm like say placing at the state tournament.
*  In high school?
*  So you're right. So 6th grade, I placed at like the state, local youth state tournament, you know?
*  So I'm like having more success. 7th grade was the first year I won the youth state tournament.
*  So I'm getting better. 8th grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good. But like when I went to
*  the national tournament, I was still having really minimal success. My freshman year, I decided to
*  quit football. Same reason. It's like, well, I need to put more time into this. My parents,
*  we got, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement. So, you know, there's no, so we have a year-round
*  club and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity to go to a club year-round.
*  So we had a mat in my basement. I had to go find, hey, you want to come wrestle? Yeah, to find
*  partners for myself.
*  What did you do? Did you drill? Did you live wrestle? What did you do in that basement?
*  So actually, I think you'll enjoy this. I think the start of my scrambling was kind of based
*  around that. So I got kind of, I think it's probably my freshman sophomore. I'm kind of,
*  the years are a little fuzzy, right? It's been a while. But probably my freshman,
*  sophomore, junior year, I found two kids who were really consistent, who would come out,
*  like you would come out on, he'd come out on Tuesday and this dude would come out on Wednesday,
*  right? And they would come every week and they were really consistent partners for me
*  to have in the summer. But they weren't nearly as good as me. They were way worse. So it's like,
*  okay, how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling for them to come back? If I just
*  whooped their ass, they're not going to come back. So it was like, I would let them get as close as
*  they could, as I thought they could do a takedown before not getting it and then try to like escape
*  or get out. So obviously if I let them get really close, sometimes they get it, so they're
*  enjoying it. I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right? I have no idea.
*  And that was kind of like the start because I had to figure my way out of bad positions because I
*  had to try to make it entertaining for them where they still got something out of it and they wanted
*  to come back the next week. And I also got something out of it. Yeah, I love this. Yeah.
*  Because that relationship is so important with that. Like that, I've had a few drilling partners,
*  training partners that were really important to my life. And I always wondered why it's difficult
*  to find them. Yeah. Like I, if anyone's listening to this, I'm looking for a judo person in the
*  Austin area, actually. Getting the reps with people is hard, even in jujitsu.
*  It's just like people want to do the fun stuff. They don't want to really put in the work.
*  And it takes a certain kind of personality. And then you also have to make it fun for the other
*  person, just like you said, if there's a skill mismatch, but also if you have an interest
*  mismatch in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do, all that kind of stuff, you have to
*  figure out ways to make it fun. It's tricky. So you did. So yeah, I think I did that and no one told
*  me. I get frustrated because now we have, just in my academy, we probably have 50, 60 high school
*  kids only that are year round. They're year round. Maybe they're not as consistent in the summer,
*  or whatever, but they're there. So when they don't have a great partner, they start whining. It's
*  like, you little bitches. Some days they get really mad about it because it's like, I had no
*  partners. I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week. You guys, there's still
*  22 people in the room. I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you, but like go work out with
*  that dude. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So what was the switch, the change? Or was it gradual? Or what's
*  it? Okay. Yeah. So it was the ninth grade I quit football because I want to get really serious.
*  What position in football? I was actually a nose tackle. But at that point, so I was also,
*  the other thing I kind of left out here, I was really fat growing up. Yeah. In sixth grade,
*  I also decided, okay, I'm really fat. And if I want to be competitive wrestling, I shouldn't be
*  fat because weight matters. I went from 130 pounds to a hundred pounds in sixth grade.
*  So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119. So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade.
*  So I was pretty small too, but I was also slow, unfortunately. So they put me in a nose tackle.
*  I, you know, I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it. So that's where you
*  wrestled 119? My freshman year, yeah. So yeah, so then I still, I started having a lot of success
*  state-wise, but not nationally. It's my national success day, it comes to like my junior year in
*  high school. But yeah, I was like grinding and getting better the whole time. And then senior
*  year, I started having a lot of success nationally and I got recruited. And then, but then even when
*  my freshman year of college, I, this is where I love competing, I would go every weekend. Because
*  if you take the emotions out of competition, all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,
*  and then figuring out what you need to work on. Right? If we take all the emotion out of it,
*  that's what it is. So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman, which is incredibly rare.
*  I had 10 losses. So it's not like, and like to not, not so great guys, you know? So like my skill
*  level still at that point was not that great. And then the next year I came out and I made
*  the NCAA finals. So my, my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year to the, to the real
*  freshman year. So a few questions. Where did the funk style wrestling, the creative style get
*  developed? At which stage? So I, so I think like looking retroactively, there was no, there was no
*  intention to start when I was in high school with those kids, but I think that's kind of like,
*  well, what was happening, right? So what I would really say is I had one influential coach my
*  retro year of college named Mike Ironman, a great guy. But then the second thing was it was just
*  out of necessity. I had this burning desire to be the best. And when I was getting my ass kicked
*  every day in the room, cause we had, you know, the tire room was there. We had All American 157,
*  we had All American 184. So I was not having a ton of success. And very quickly I realized from
*  like a more traditional athletic perspective, strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with
*  anyone. I was way worse. So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this? You know,
*  I want to do this. How do I do this? There's gotta be a way, you know? So Mike Ironman showed me a
*  couple of things, but then it was just like this creative expansion for the next, you know, through
*  say three to five years. And then even now it's like, I don't know, there's something, and maybe
*  you feel this way about judo or there's something that's like fun about the way the body moves and
*  works and, and, and exploring something new and thinking about, Hey, wrestling's been happening
*  at a relative high level for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America. And there's still new things
*  being developed. And so when you see something new, you're like, Oh damn, like that's great. Or like
*  Jason North may have to win Dixie. I'm like, how did I not think of that shit? Like, why did I think
*  that's so easy? I should, I should have thought of that, you know? So there's this like obsession
*  with the sport of wrestling and positions where I actually think sometimes think I would have
*  smartphones because I may have been distracted by my smartphone. Maybe I wouldn't have been
*  because I was so obsessed, but maybe, but you know, some days I had, I couldn't finish the
*  single leg on the specific person or, or they, maybe they were finishing on me and it was like
*  go home. And I was just fucking obsessed about that one position. Like, okay, how do, what,
*  what am I missing here? And not just accepting like that, whatever the coach does is the answer,
*  but like, what am I missing? What ways can my body move that no one's told me it can move yet?
*  Where can my arms go? Right. Where can I do all these things? And so I would just obsess about
*  these things. And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day and you say, oh, well,
*  maybe this, you know, and maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't, maybe it works twice and then it doesn't
*  work the next time. And so you kind of like have this creative process and it's like, you know,
*  there's a lot of things that are on the cutting room floor that never made it to the light because
*  you thought they were gonna be good and they failed and they sucked. And then, you know,
*  to the point where like my senior year, I got to this point where the people, then they were just
*  figures, figures would wrestle in my head about positions I was thinking about. I wouldn't tell
*  them what to do. They would just go in my head and then like some of that's it. That's it. That
*  just happened. That's the move. And then I go try to practice it. Sure enough. Boom. That's the move.
*  That's exactly what you have. Alpha zero playing learning chess. You have,
*  it's called self plays. You have what did the figures have? Like no faces. They were just like,
*  did they have a human form or is it just like stick figures essentially?
*  It was not like humans. It was more like stick figures. It wouldn't stick figures exactly like
*  they were. They had some volume? Yeah. It was like a gray person and they had, you know,
*  three dimensions essentially because I had to see how the things moved. And yeah.
*  I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind and Google are. I don't know if you've seen,
*  but there's something called reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence where
*  they've done it for like sumo wrestling. You have these two stick figures that don't even know how
*  to get up at first and they figure out how to stand on their two feet and then they figure out
*  how to push the other person off of the pedestal. But what about like when you look at the boss in
*  the name? Sometimes they have trouble with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff. So are
*  they doing that same program or no? No, no, no, no. Everything Boston Dynamics is doing
*  is hard coded. So it's not learning all the sophisticated movements and strategies,
*  like high level strategies and movement. That's all something that Boston Dynamics is not doing.
*  If it does it like the parkour stuff, that's all hard coded. And the people like project and think
*  these robots have discovered how to move in sophisticated ways they haven't.
*  Well, that's why when you and John were talking about the grappling robot. I mean,
*  the one thing I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chess, if a chess piece moves,
*  the horse can move like an L. It can only move like an L. It doesn't matter if it moves at two
*  meters per second or seven meters per second. It can only move there. Whereas like a single leg,
*  I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities. I can shoot at different angles.
*  I can shoot with different amounts of force. I can shoot with my head up versus my head.
*  All these things are going to matter. We're talking about a human being defending the single leg.
*  All of those things are going to matter. And that's where human beings who wrestle are
*  calculating those things subconsciously. They're obviously not consciously calculating in their
*  head, oh, the force is coming at me at this, so I need to do that. They're just doing it.
*  It feels. But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely, if you're doing a robot that you're
*  wrestling, you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves and the power that it's
*  able to deliver. So that presumably, they'll be the limitations. So then it'll be just the same
*  exactly as a human. But then, so if we go human, max force, or Jordan Rose double, max force,
*  that's the highest we get. Then we go down from there. Even within that, it's like sometimes,
*  I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of, we'll say 20 is the number, right? I don't know,
*  I'll shoot at 20 because I feel sometimes I shoot at 15. Sometimes I shoot at 12, right? Because you
*  feel something in your opponent that makes you do it differently. So they would have to learn how,
*  and then all these different things. And sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.
*  So the robot would have to learn all these different incoming inputs to the system and then
*  create this reaction. Oh no, no, no. 100%. So this would be all continuous. So unlike chess,
*  it would not be. It's just chess is discrete. It's one and you move. It's a very specific set of
*  moves. Now here you would, those are all variables you control and they're continuous variables. So
*  the speed, the force, there's actuators. So there's all these joints, right? Yeah.
*  You can move. I mean, it's just an optimization problem. It's kind of fascinating. So I've been
*  fascinated thinking about it since you guys talked about it. It was a long time ago. I listened to
*  it probably three to four weeks ago and I've kind of been obsessing about it ever since.
*  It just changes when, so unlike boxing, for example, or striking, once you grab a hold of
*  somebody, it changes. You're now one body. So it's very complicated. It's not just shooting a
*  double leg without like maybe doing like, like faking a double leg and then shooting the double
*  leg. That's very doable with robotics, but then like do a clinch and from there doing like a
*  Russian tie like that. That's, I think that's way harder than people realize in terms of how many
*  things are involved, like the force of the grip, the leverage you're providing with all the different
*  parts of the shoulder and the arm and the torso, the twist, how much of your weight are you
*  allocating, like leaning on the other person, like taking weight off of one of your legs and the other
*  leg, all of that. I think that's the really interesting thing about humans is we're able to
*  do all of this calculation. Subconsciously. Yeah, subconsciously. Yeah, and that's what I've been
*  thinking about since we, it's like how many things, even these high school athletes who are like
*  getting medium good are subconsciously thinking about all the time or not even, not even thinking
*  about, sorry, reacting to. But then even like for me, I'm a few orders of magnitude better than
*  some of these kids that play. And so when I go like super hard, it's like I can feel their weight
*  moving in the wrong direction. And so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever is kind
*  of easy sometimes, you know, because they're not feeling it the right way, right? Or their timing's
*  just a little bit off or the way they're grabbing the hip, maybe they should be up a little higher
*  right? These really small things. Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of for a robot.
*  It's just there's so many things. The big problem is ethically. I don't know how many people are
*  willing to train with a robot because you're going to get hurt. Well, can you make a robot
*  train the robot or no? Yes, but then it's expensive. So because they're going to get. Put the padding on
*  that thing. I know, but then but then it's not. You know, it is. Then you're not capturing the full.
*  Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them or something for that effect? You could.
*  I mean, you could. Yeah, you could. I mean, you're talking about robots that are.
*  These are humanoid robots. So we're talking about five hundred thousand million dollar robots.
*  So you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money because you have to have them wrestle
*  for like a lot to get better. Yeah, to get better. And then the open question is.
*  How long does it take to get good enough to be a human?
*  I don't think I don't think we understand. I don't know.
*  I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is. Yeah. Like, is it a really hard problem?
*  Like what's harder, chess or wrestling? Wrestling by far. Not even close. That's yeah. That's the sense.
*  So because there's an infinite amount of moves, right? And possibilities. So once I shoot the
*  single leg, now you have X amount of choices. Once you make your choice. Now I have a choice.
*  X amount of choices. Now you have X amount of choices on the defense and we can just keep going
*  back and forth. Right. And this number becomes. Yeah, but the same happens with chess. Correct.
*  But then in wrestling, you have to make these movements very instantaneously. Right.
*  Because I should say, like, I'm not going to wait and say, what's your defense? Yeah.
*  Right. It's being instantaneously. And then also, again, based on the force and the vectors and
*  the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust. So really, you know, if you're saying,
*  why can't you just single leg? It's not like moving chess. It's not one move. Right. It's
*  if you want to talk about different forces and stuff, it could be hundreds or thousands
*  different moves based on how hard I shoot it, the angle, the direction, all of those things.
*  Yeah. But wait a minute. So robots can do this kind of stuff really fast. You would.
*  People probably know the physiology of this, but it's the reaction speed for human is maybe
*  a hundred milliseconds, something like that. I don't know from sensation to, to, to like from
*  the signal traveling up to your brain and down. I don't know what that number is,
*  but robots certainly could do way faster. It you would actually have to like constrain the speed.
*  Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people. Right. So, yeah, theoretically,
*  they could eventually be wrestlers. But you asked what was hard wrestling a chess. Yeah.
*  I think wrestling is because of the time component in it and then the end and the physicality of,
*  you know, is it this force or that force, you know, cause if, if I'm going to say,
*  say we're in a seatbelt side by side, right. A wrestling seatbelt, not what you do.
*  Based on the pressure you're giving me, I might do a bunch of things. Right. And so like to an
*  untrained eye, they might both look like the same thing from you to a trained feel. It's like,
*  well, in one case it's really evident. I should go this way. Another case is really evident. I
*  should go that way. So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,
*  the AI systems, so human versus human plays a certain way together. They actually haven't
*  considered a really large number of strategies that AI systems discover. So one possibility
*  with the robot, they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns. That's what I'm saying.
*  That like will dominate no matter what the human does. You think that, so you think there's that,
*  so this, I mean, so I was talking about the wrestling so fun is there's even after 80,
*  90 years, there's this continuous evolution. So you think-
*  There'll be some like low single type thing, like John Smith type of situation.
*  Well, like a down block go behind is something that has really, I would say really in the last
*  five-ish years has really been evolved. What's a go behind?
*  Down block go behind. So when you shoot, well, they just head inside or head outside
*  matters, but there's one for both. You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, like boom.
*  And then, so that was kind of in existence when I was in college, right. You down block them and
*  you stop, but usually you hit on this side of their head, right. And now immediately as you
*  shoot, I attack that shoulder and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right. And so like
*  that in its current incarnation, it absolutely wasn't wrong. When I was in college, I would say
*  it probably became popular five to seven years ago. So yeah, there's these big things that are
*  happening. Now, I really want a robot because I want to be ahead of the game. I want to know
*  what I'm missing. I mean, one interesting thing you have with AlphaZero that plays chess is
*  it sacrifices pieces much more than humans do. So it'll give you a piece and not only does it
*  give you a piece, it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay. So because it knows that
*  that's better for the long term. So like humans rarely sacrifice without getting the piece back,
*  like two or three moves after. AlphaZero can wait like five moves. So basically you'll have, you
*  potentially with wrestling, you might have a robot that like puts itself in bad positions,
*  but in a certain kind of way that will actually lure the opponent in to trap. Exactly. That's what
*  my style is based on. You basically narrow, one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices. You
*  put yourself in a bad position, but it narrows a set of choices. For them because they're not used
*  to it. Yeah, they're not used to it. And then you drag them into your, yeah. So, but there's also
*  the problem is there's mechanical issues. Like it's actually just difficult to build robots that
*  are able to sense because we have sensation throughout our body. Yeah. It's just difficult
*  to build that kind of robot. It's expensive. You start talking about multi-million dollars
*  and then people start asking questions. Why did you invest all of this money?
*  It could be a better investment. Okay. So I mentioned John Smith. He is, if people don't
*  know, one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever. He's also creative like you.
*  He spoke really highly of you. What do you think about that guy? Did you guys ever work together?
*  Not really. So you know what, when I was a senior and I had the people wrestling in my head,
*  I was lucky enough to be doing, I was pretty much graduated. So I did an independent study
*  with the sports I call, I was potentially going to go to grad school for sports psych. Well,
*  I actually did nine credits and then I decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I continued learning
*  on my own, but I had an independent study with the guy who was the head of USA track and field
*  sports psych. So the class was I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour and he was
*  fascinated by me. So he didn't even make me do homework. It was like the greatest three credits
*  ever. We just talked. I learned so much. It was so awesome. So one time it came up that I had these
*  robot or people wrestling in my head. And he said, well, who else do you think? I said,
*  John Smith happened. So I went and got John Smith's number and called him and said, hey,
*  you ever had these people wrestling in your head? And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped
*  coaching, they went away. Same thing happened to me. So they started coaching. They went away.
*  So if I really force myself now and I'm like, you know, I see some in practice and it's really
*  higher level because high school wrestling, I don't want to make you guys feel bad, but it's like,
*  it's a little bit lower level, right? So if like Keegan, for example, who won the journal, if he's
*  struggling with a problem or asked me a question and I can force myself to like see the body's
*  moving and think about it again, you know, kind of like I was in early age, but it won't just,
*  it won't just flow there anymore. So he said it went away. And for me, it went away also.
*  By the way, if you can pause on the, on the, on the bodies in your head, what,
*  like, how are they generating new ideas? Are they just kind of, I don't know. You tell me.
*  So it's just, they're just like scrambling in your head. It would be specifically based on a
*  problem I was struggling with or a specific position, you know, kind of it goes in for a
*  single and then, and then go from there. Yeah. So I'm sitting in geography class and, you know,
*  I don't have to work that hard because it's easy. Right. And yeah, I'm just sitting there like,
*  kind of acting like I'm looking at the board and these guys are wrestling and I'm watching
*  them wrestle. And yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution. Is there somebody you
*  looked up to style wise? Not Gable, John Smith. Yeah. All these like, like legend status people.
*  Probably Gable, or it's a cable, John Smith, but after the fact. So the problem with wrestling in
*  my era was you couldn't watch it. There was no, there was no access, right? It wasn't, it wasn't
*  really available. Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith, Matt, they're kind of hard
*  to find, right? There's a couple of them on YouTube, but I've obviously seen all of those,
*  but in my era there was, there really wasn't any of it. So it was hard to be a fan of something.
*  And that's why wrestling has his, the fans are going like this because now, you know,
*  you flip on the flow app and you can watch, you know, something that's happening in Europe,
*  right? We can do this easily so we can be a fan of people. So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than
*  I was then because there just was no access. So now I can watch them when I like and say, oh shit,
*  like that guy's wrestling. Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle, you know,
*  that type of thing. You know, and a quick rant, it's really frustrating that you can't watch the
*  Olympics. Oh my God. So frustrating. I've been, I think I'm going to go to war on that point. Go
*  to NBC's headquarters. I'll go with you. You got a soldier here. I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro.
*  He was surprised by this too. Most matches you can't see, even you talk about like a
*  come back, Gable steals and you can't see the full match. You get like a crappy highlight.
*  So the two, the two biggest things in really the three, the NC championship is ESPN. Yeah.
*  The world Olympic trials are on NBC and the Olympics are NBC. And these things, these companies
*  are so big, they don't have a department dedicated to selling their rights to that footage. Right?
*  So the rights to wrestling footage, which no one really cares all that much about except a niche,
*  are the exact same as track and field or, or basketball in the Olympics. So yes, all of this
*  stuff is completely inaccessible to us. The, the NCA's, the Olympic trials in the Olympics,
*  you can't go watch old film on it. It sucks. Yeah. Old, the current film. Yeah. So you can't even
*  watch the Gable match? The Gable steals? No, they did a, you know, they do something that I know is
*  the fuck out of me. What? Okay. They, they, they, they do like a three or two minute highlight.
*  So it's like they capture the most important thing, but like it's all about the buildup.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat and the nerves and you walk out
*  and like that, I mean, I don't know, uh, you miss then, then when the triumph happens or the
*  heartbreak happens, it has that much more power. Yeah. If you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN,
*  I'm happy to join that. I think this bullshit. IOC. Well, I mean, is the IOC on that or is it?
*  IOC is selling the, for the Olympics is the one that's making. Well, so NBC broadcasts,
*  so they obviously have the live rights. You would think they would have recorded if they, I mean,
*  they're the ones recording it. You would think they keep the rights when you think. No, no, no.
*  I, they're getting a license of it. They're getting exclusive like license, but like the,
*  you know, for example, uh, I've had this talk to Travis Stevens, the GDO player, and there's a
*  really sort of famous match. It's a heartbreak in his career from, uh, 2012 Olympics where he
*  goes against the German, Oli Bischoff, whatever it's a 20 minute match to go to war. And that's not
*  available anywhere, but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private. The reason I know this is
*  on the IOC channel. So they've uploaded all of these matches. They haven't even put it up.
*  So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won, got put public and I don't know if it was private,
*  it got put up on YouTube. Uh, I was learning to it the week of my Jake Paul fight. It was so dumb.
*  I'm like, why the, this is every 13 years later, this is bullshit. Like this should have been up.
*  So, uh, I mean, well, okay. So what about Olympic trials footage? That has to be the USOC then or NBC?
*  Uh, so I know, okay, so I know flow, right? Cause I work with them. I know if flow buys your event
*  or whatever, right? They buy the rights generally in the contract, they'll have rights to both live
*  stream it and then use that footage at any point moving forward. So those matches live on flows
*  website. That's why I would be surprised that if NBC didn't have something similar flow does a
*  pretty good job of providing like, uh, a place where you can watch all these matches. NBC does
*  not. Yeah. And, and also there's an argument with flow as well, but certainly with Olympics,
*  there's a difference between what flow does and what the Olympics represent. Like it feels like
*  the Olympics, which is what the charter says should be as accessible as possible. Like,
*  you should really lower the barrier for entry for the Olympics. You know, that's what the
*  charter says, but those people in the IOC, those reasons, the worst people ever. They're very bad.
*  They're not bad. They just lost touch of the dream they once had when they joined the IOC.
*  Well, I would argue, I would argue all the way back to these are rich fat cats who like,
*  I get so mad about the NCA, which finally now got rid of this term bullshit term amateurism.
*  It's like, well, there's some holy grail where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,
*  but the people who own the IOC are the people who own the institutions,
*  college institutions are making boatloads of money off of you. That's crap.
*  So you competed in, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics. Did you believe you can win gold?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So your mental game was on point.
*  Yeah, I was ready.
*  So what went wrong?
*  This wasn't good enough. That was what I said.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, so at that point in time, it was my first year of international competition. So when
*  I came out in 2007, it was my first time making 74 kilograms, which is pretty small for me.
*  I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around and I was having success in America.
*  I was beating everyone. I don't want to say easy, but yeah, I was doing really well.
*  I went international one time and there was one match I got cheated on. The Russians,
*  they're cheaters. I think she was Ukraine, not Russia. I lost one real match where I actually
*  lost. It was to Dennis Sargush who had gone to win three world titles, but he was behind the
*  tee of that year and it was competitive. So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world.
*  I beat a bunch of other guys who were good and had passed decent results. So I knew I was right there.
*  Unfortunately, I ran this guy, Ivan Fundora, and I had someone do scouting reports for him,
*  actually my high school coach who coaches for our academy, John Messimerick.
*  Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup. I got him and I lost him second round. So I wasn't good
*  enough. Had I decided to keep wrestling, I probably would have gotten better, but at that point,
*  I just wasn't in the cards. So in your division was, like you said, Satiev, that guy is special.
*  He's very special. So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier who I
*  enjoyed watching. It was kind of after the fact because it was hard to access footage,
*  but he was a lot of fun to watch. What do you think made him great?
*  A lot of people talk about him as potentially one of the greatest ever. Absolutely. So he won
*  six and three, six worlds, three Olympics, nine total, which there's only one or two people above
*  that. So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him, but from what I've seen, his
*  feel is different. He was just ahead of his time and the feel and the touch he had for certain
*  moves and different things, because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing. He's
*  taller than skinnier, which is, it can work in wrestling, but he is less represented.
*  Yeah, he was special. So good. Do you take any inspiration from
*  what you've seen in the wrestling world? Let's talk about Dagestan in general. What do you think
*  makes those wrestlers great? Yeah, it's fascinating. Have you read the book The Talent Code? Yeah,
*  it's great. And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots all around the world. So now,
*  obviously with our wrestling academies, we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.
*  I got to assume they didn't cover Dagestan in that book specifically, but I got to assume a
*  lot of the same principles that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling. They did South
*  Korea and women's golf. They did Curacao and baseball. They picked a lot of these other
*  places that were really elite. I think it was maybe Moscow and women's tennis also.
*  I think all these things that make any group great or organization is probably the same things that's
*  happening there. Well, the hardship, I mean, is there something specific about wrestling that can
*  create so many great champions? From that area, so obviously they all love it. It's a big deal.
*  Wrestling specifically is a big deal there. They do Sambo also, obviously. So that's part of it.
*  A lot of the kids are doing it. They obviously have a rough tumble, tough life. Getting a lot of fights.
*  And then I think that also that a lot of them, it is a way out, right? The elite level athletes
*  in that part of the world from my understanding are really well compensated compared to what the
*  average person makes and if you really well, so people see it as a way out. Whereas like, and then
*  honestly, if America is getting better, but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA was because
*  I didn't want to be poor my whole life. You know what I'm saying? It sucks. It's like, well,
*  I don't want to make $20,000 for the next 48 years. So I'm going to go do something else.
*  If I could have made even, and I need to be rich, right? If I could have made a hundred thousand
*  dollars or seventy thousand dollars wrestling, I probably would have kept wrestling.
*  So I think, I think it's those factors. And obviously now they have a really like a bunch
*  of really good people in one area. So there's probably, it's been going on for a long time.
*  So there's probably been a bunch of like adults and coaches that are coming back and helping that
*  progress. So yeah, a lot of those things that happen. So I'm definitely going to travel there
*  to talk to them because I can speak Russian. It makes it makes it very, makes me uniquely qualified
*  to, uh, my brother can speak a little bit of Russian. Your brother can? Yeah. Okay. Like a
*  little bit like, uh, no, no, no, no, no. Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me overstep.
*  I think he would be able to have a conversation with you. I think. Okay. Okay. Probably not like
*  you. What's the, uh, what's the reason he knows Russian? He, I don't know why he got obsessed with
*  languages. And so his college degree is actually, um, what do they call it? Interdis where you have
*  three miners. So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish and maybe Japanese. I'm messing
*  up. It's definitely, is Russian and Spanish are for sure. I don't know what the third one is.
*  No, but yeah, the Augustan it's, it's really fascinating. But the, uh, the emphasis on
*  technique, the lighter drilling, like they don't really go super hard. Yeah. And I only spent a
*  couple. So I was there, I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008. That was where the world cup was.
*  We had to train there for like two days afterwards. So, um, I didn't get to dig deep, did dig deep into
*  what was going on or anything. But yeah, I mean, I think sparring has a sparring is very beneficial
*  for wrestling. Um, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right? Sparring in wrestling is, so I always
*  just describe it to be really simple. Uh, if we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance. If we're
*  going as hard as we can, that's a hundred percent. There's all this gray area in the middle that's
*  sparring, right? And so, you know, if you have a good relationship, like, you know, it's because
*  it calls me and my brother, we can just go and we know where each other's at. We don't even have to
*  talk about it, right? But like in my residence hall, we'll say, okay, hey, I want you guys to go
*  50% in this position or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot and this is for him.
*  So I want him to go 70 and defensive guy, I want you to go 40. So you're not, you're not supposed
*  to be trying to win here. You're going to go a little later. I want you to give it, give them
*  some looks, you know? Um, so I think, I think it has really taken hold of America. I think it's
*  been beneficial for success and I think that's, I mean, America's doing better than we've ever done
*  historically. Well, that's 70 and 40. That's like an art form to find that right place. Cause, uh,
*  like what the really good people I've trained with, they go much closer to a hundred percent
*  speed wise or like, but without like forcing things. Yeah. You would when you're going,
*  it's some weird combination of things that like, if you truly earn a technique,
*  then you're given that technique. But like, if you don't, you don't. And then it becomes
*  much less injury prone. It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic, you know, get stuck in positions.
*  It's just a lot of movement. Yeah. The one thing, so you, you and John talked about, uh, you know,
*  like different ways to learn and get better. And so I think John, obviously innovated within the
*  sport of jujitsu. Um, and so for us, when, and maybe there's just a differentiator for us.
*  I think about it. So, so I can drop, you have this academy and you sent me this plan that you have
*  a really well thought through plan for how to develop a good wrestler. So, but I, so I think
*  it's, um, so for me, there's four categories, right? There's the teaching, which is like,
*  you don't know shit. I'm, you're coming in and I'm showing you the move and you're literally going
*  out there and you're trying to me. That's not even drilling. That's like teaching, like you're
*  trying to learn something. So obviously in someone's earlier periods, they're spending
*  a lot of time in that phase because they literally don't even know how to move their bodies the right
*  way. Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling because you need to, you absolutely have
*  to get those reps to become really proficient in that movement and then the sparring and then the
*  right. And so like, I think obviously by the time you get to the kind of, I don't want to end point,
*  right? But further on the time you spend teaching is so I don't want to say I'm sorry in the
*  learn learning teaching phase is not insignificant, but it's so much smaller because to someone who's
*  really good, who have coached for 10 years, I don't have to give this big, long drawn out explanation.
*  I just have to say, Hey, move, move your hand a little differently or just do this, right? We don't
*  have to spend any time there. So I think that's like something that consumes for the younger kids,
*  say five through 12 or 13, we're consuming a massive amount of time there on that teaching
*  learning phase. And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot, but that makes total sense, right?
*  Yeah. It's funny because when you look at like Jiu Jitsu schools, they spend a lot of time in
*  the teaching learning and then the live, it feels like there's not enough drilling. I like how you
*  draw a distinction there because it feels like you're always starting from scratch. Like people
*  have like very crappy short term memory. Like they're not like the way teaching is done is you show
*  a technique from scratch and it seems disjoint. It is for sure. Especially if you have a class
*  that's been with you for a while, you don't have to start from scratch. You can say, Hey, let's
*  focus on this one little thing here or let's after we do this, let's do that. You know, and you kind
*  of put, start putting it all together. And then with Jiu Jitsu, the thing that I really struggle
*  with was a couple of things. It was, and this is not speaking for all the Jiu Jitsu, my personal
*  experience through the sport. And I actually found my, so when I unretired, I found someone really
*  great that I loved and I really wish it was Mark Layman. I don't know if you know him at all. I
*  wish I would have found him earlier because he was just tremendous. But number one, there's no
*  drilling. So it's like in wrestling, I can boil down to, I can probably name you the best six
*  moves, right? So we need, as younger people, single leg, right? Single leg is going to be the most
*  proficient takedown. It always has been, I don't know, probably always will be unless they figure
*  out something different. The robot. The robot figures out something different. We're going to
*  shoot a lot of single legs. Why? Because we're going to, because everyone's going to do that,
*  right? We're going to shoot a lot of single legs. So just like say an arm bar or some type of sweep,
*  why can't we go get 50 reps there? Hey, we, I mean, by the time I've been in your jujitsu school for
*  two years, I better know a fucking arm bar. I better know it. So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.
*  Just tell me to go hit 50 reps. And then if one, I'm hitting my reps, if there's something I'm
*  doing wrong, then just say, hey Ben, move your leg a little bit that way or raise your hips up a
*  little more, right? Like correct as you're drilling. So you're getting all these reps at it. So you're
*  becoming more proficient. And then the other thing I really struggled with was to your point during
*  live so many times, it's just this five minute go, go, go. And that's not the most efficient way to
*  learn because when you have two people, especially when they're focused on winning and you say go,
*  they're going to go to wherever they do best. Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something,
*  I don't want you doing what you do best all the time. I need you doing some other things, right?
*  If you have a great single leg, but you can't shoot to the other side of the body,
*  we need to work on that, right? You need to start shooting the other side. There's some sense that
*  it's not like you should be told what to work on, but you should be told to work on the thing that
*  you want to work on. Meaning, cause I don't know, maybe you can comment on this, but everybody
*  develops a different game as you get better and better. There's a set of things you need to be
*  working on. So I actually have, especially when I'm training very seriously, I'll have
*  a specific technique to have in mind. And I have a sheet of paper on the side where I
*  my head keep counting off how many times I put myself in that position and pulled off the
*  technique. And that's all I care about in like training. So I'll just, whatever it is, if it's
*  a guillotine, it's a guillotine, arm drag, arm drag, but I want to make sure I don't, I love numbers.
*  I'll say like, I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags and I'm not getting off the mat until I do.
*  And that, you know, if it takes- And it's drilling our live contest.
*  So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now is the live contest. But drilling, obviously,
*  drilling, I can't find a drilling part. Like it's so hard to find drilling partners. Even-
*  So boring.
*  It's annoying to me that this is boring. And there's nothing more annoying to me than the look of
*  boredom on another person's face when we're drilling. Do you really think drilling's that
*  beneficial to you? Cause you said it to Josh. Yes. Really?
*  Yeah. So he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes. Why?
*  Why am I an idiot or why is this drilling beneficial?
*  Let's go with two trick finishes. Why is this so beneficial?
*  I think for me, there's a meditative aspect to it where the more you drill,
*  the more you start noticing the details. Let me push back a little bit here.
*  I'm not going to push back all the way. Cause every time I was wrestling, I'll want to
*  high-crouch and whatever, right? But even so, say like at a high level when I'm really wrestling
*  10 years ago, even during that drill portion, if we talk about the resistance of our opponent from
*  zero to 100, it's very likely that my partner at that point, because there's people I'm really
*  comfortable with, they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right? They're probably giving me a
*  certain look with the sprawl or, you know, I got to get through their hands if I don't set it up
*  right, they might put their arm down. So it's like we are drilling because we're wrestling at a
*  really low resistance level, but there's a little bit of sparring. Oh yeah, the 20%.
*  That's not really drilling. I think it's drilling. I think literally you're shooting and I'm just
*  going boom, boom, boom. You're going to be a dummy. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
*  type of thing. No, it's very hard to be a dummy that doesn't do 20%. So you're going to do 20%.
*  That's like sparring a little bit then. No, but they're not really resisting. They're
*  just giving you the right frame. They're giving you the right movement and they're being an
*  intelligent dummy essentially. But also the really important component of this is you pick the
*  techniques for which it's beneficial. If the technique has dynamic elements to it, you don't
*  want to be doing that with... I'm saying there's certain moves and I like those moves and I select
*  the game base in those moves. So are you drilling to get better or are you drilling just to work out?
*  No, to get better. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I believe you can become like
*  exceptionally good very fast by drilling. But how? First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.
*  Have you actually drilled 10,000 times? Absolutely. Millions. You haven't drilled millions.
*  Hundreds of thousands likely. I think you're just saying numbers. I don't think you know what a
*  hundred thousand... The number is freaking astronomical. It's way more than 10,000. I don't think you know what a hundred
*  thousand feels like. Dude, there was a 10-year period where I wrestled every single day. That's
*  3,000 days. So you're telling me 10,000, that's only three of them a day. I do way more than that.
*  Three of them. Probably 30 of them a day. That's 100,000. Yeah. Yeah, hundreds of thousands.
*  I doubt you did 30 a day for particular techniques. I did. For sure, 100%. There's no doubt.
*  All right. Because some days I might do 100, right? So 30 is not very many. Especially if we count all
*  reps, if we're counting drilling and live. So our college coaches would make us just drill a lot,
*  and I always hated it. So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar. You shoot a high crotch,
*  we'll start. Coach wants to drill a high crotch. Okay, we'll start. You shoot the high crotch,
*  that's great. Then I'm going to sit the corner, or I'm going to give you my hip, or I'm going to try
*  something. So then you have to react. And I would argue that all skill level past the beginner stuff
*  is some necessity of that, right? I'm going to do this, then what are you going to do?
*  It's back and forth. I shoot a single leg, what are you going to do? I shoot a high crotch,
*  what are you going to do? And you have to start unconsciously programming these things in your
*  head because if you're conscious to think about it, it's going to be too slow to actually hit it
*  in a match. But the drilling is the unconscious programming. But the simple movement, the first
*  simple movement, that single leg, or the high crotch, or arm drag, whatever. I feel like
*  the amount you're going to get better at it is so minuscule compared to the amount you're going to
*  gain at doing other things around it. No, but that's the key word, you feel.
*  Okay. That's your opinion. I think if we did a study on it, that I would be proven correct.
*  No, perhaps. So first of all, your brain as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,
*  it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling. It's obvious that you're such
*  a creative energy that you're just not going to be somebody who's going to enjoy that. So enjoyment
*  is probably, having an active mind is really important. So the question is, do you have the
*  kind of makeup that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy? And I have that mind.
*  But do you really think, okay, so if you're, let's pick a technique, what technique do you want to
*  drill a lot? I would do jiu-jitsu or wrestling. Whatever you want.
*  It's hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes. Let me think, just guard pass.
*  Okay. So you have a guard pass and you get it to be, I'd say, nine and a half out of 10, right?
*  Just from a technical standpoint. Don't you think you need some resistance to feel? Because
*  essentially all benefit after that is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me? And if
*  they shift that way, do I need to sink here or move there? So it's like, I actually think we're
*  agreeing, but maybe terminology wise. Well, the split is the important thing. Like how much of each.
*  I think it is sparring. I think it's a very light touch spar is what you're talking about,
*  which is, in my opinion, really isn't drilling. And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency,
*  I don't think brings much value. No, but that's what I'm trying to tell you is I think it does.
*  I think if you're doing that same movement, I think you begin to learn more over time.
*  Like you're saying like once you get the basic proficiency, then there's diminishing returns.
*  I don't think so. I don't think so. I think everything has diminishing returns when you're
*  learning a technique. But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling, if you can have way more
*  gains over here, why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8? If this other area, if you're spending so
*  much time here, there's other areas left unexplored. You can make gigantic gains over there. No, but
*  you're going to lose. I think a lot depends on your style. I think a lot is determined by how good you
*  are at one thing. And so if you want to become a master of a particular thing and then make your
*  whole game where it's all pulled into that system, then I don't know. I think one is too small of a
*  number. Yeah, small. I feel like you can't be easily this like... Yeah, you want to funnel.
*  You want to create funnels. Funnels, right? Where everything goes into a few positions. And then it's
*  all field. Where ideally you win 100%. Yeah. But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy
*  80% of the time and 20% of the time live rolling with people worse than you.
*  Like a little bit worse than you or a lot worse than you. Yeah. So I think, so I definitely think,
*  so my buildup would be teach. So we're talking about complex technique, right? So by the time
*  we're talking about, let's say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient, he's probably done
*  the drilling part. So then now it's like, okay, if I want to get something new to you, I'll probably
*  tell you, you'll probably be able to do the basic premise within five to 10 minutes if they're good,
*  right? Do this. Okay, they do it. Then it's like, okay, so now here's from here, what we're going to
*  do. We're going to go light sparring. So I know you have success because I need you to complete
*  the task in order to get better at it. That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up,
*  is they just want to go to the toughest person. But if you go to the toughest person, you're not
*  going to actually execute on any skills. You're going to get a workout and I need you to execute
*  because I need you to get good at this in order to get good at it. You have to get all the way
*  through the technique. Why do you need them to complete just so they gain confidence in the
*  technique or they go through all the stuff? They have to feel all the way through. Like if I said,
*  learn a high crotch when you're drilling, but stop halfway every time, but you're not actually
*  going to be able to do it because you're going to stop and you don't have the feel. So, you know,
*  try it on someone, spar lightly, get it. Do it on someone who's not as good as you get it. Then kind
*  of work your way up the ladder so you can get it on someone your own skill level or maybe better
*  than you in a live competition. So it's like, I don't know, I feel like that basic drilling,
*  so a kid like Keegan who I've probably worked with a few times, I feel like if there's something new,
*  I could literally tell him, this is what I want you to do and he has such a great feel. He could
*  go drill it proficiently within probably a minute or two. But then to hit it on someone high level,
*  that's going to take quite a while longer. And that's a mix of drilling and sparring on
*  people a little bit worse than you. Yeah. And then equal and then better. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
*  Because there's just, with grappling, there's such like a feel component to the pressure,
*  the movement, all these things. And there's still so many things you can throw at someone out of one
*  position, not just moves, but moves at different levels of force or whatever. Are you and these
*  kids developing like a big picture strategy of like, what are the main setups and take downs
*  and just like a whole system? So I kind of sent you our technique book, right? And how we kind
*  of go at approach it. So I think in wrestling, you're going to need, you're going to need a
*  handful of things just off the word go, right? You're going to, so I think on our feet, I need
*  to be able to take this side of the body. I need to be able to take that side of the body. I need
*  to be able to bring you underneath me. I need to be able to go around you. Right now we can accomplish
*  those different ways, but we should have all of those weapons. If we want to be really good
*  some way, right? So if I neglect one of those, so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down,
*  right? From headlock you. Now, if I have a good shot and you're smart, you're just going to lower
*  your stance. So my shot is not going to be as successful and I have the inability to pull you
*  down. Right? So I kind of need all of those so I can, as they get better, I can point those things
*  out. On bottom, my folks out bottom, there's certain things like you have to be good at leg,
*  right? Defense, right? You have to, I mean, in high level, or you're just going to, you're going to,
*  when you get in, you're just going to get stuck there. Not going to be able to escape.
*  But besides that, yeah, there's a, there's a multitude of things that you can choose from.
*  And I'm going to, depending on your body style and what you're good and bad at, I'm going to
*  probably develop something a little different. I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,
*  you'd be better as a knee slide, whatever. Yeah, top kind of same thing.
*  I have to ask you about Khabib. So I remember a while ago, Rogan said that that's the perfect
*  fight for Khabib. You are. So let me ask two questions. The first, do you think you can beat
*  him in an MMA match when you're at your peak? Yeah, I don't like, yeah, I mean, this is one of
*  people like, will get really mad at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, how would you do it? How
*  would you solve that puzzle? Yeah. I mean, we would grapple and I think I would be better than him,
*  but I, you know, I, as I feel weird saying this, people are like, yeah, right. You're full of shit,
*  you know? And, but that's no, no one out grappled them, right? I mean, nobody did. And maybe I'm
*  wrong in this, but I, if we look at the best possible candidates, I'm definitely one of them.
*  I have a small size advantage too. So in a wrestling match, so we can just reduce that
*  MMA match to a wrestling match. What do you think is the right strategy on him? Like,
*  do you understand his style that the, the, the, his wrestling style, the pressure he applies,
*  do you understand how the hell he makes it happen? Yeah. I mean, he never, unfortunately fought any
*  real, who I would say really, really high level wrestlers. I was actually really disappointed
*  how bad Justin Gagee's wrestling was because Justin Gagee had some solid success,
*  but his wrestling was really bad in that fight. Gagee had success in CWA? Yeah. I think he was
*  seventh place maybe or somewhere. He was definitely all American. It was lower though. So yeah, I
*  would like to see how he dealt with someone who was like, who I think, oh man, this guy's a really
*  high level wrestler. Cause you know, we saw, and this is early in his career, but you know,
*  Glaston Tebow did give him some issues earlier in his career. So I would like to see him in that
*  situation and see how he does. I would love to like, you know, like I just love wrestling
*  grappling. Like, yeah, I'd love this. Someone said, Hey Ben, you know, Kabib wants to roll with you.
*  Okay. I'm there tomorrow. It sounds like a blast. Let's go. He's probably competitive as hell.
*  Yeah. You're still competitive? I know when to be and when not to be like, you know,
*  save from going to high school kids are not going to be competitive cause then I'm just being a dick.
*  How would you take them down? What? What are we talking about? Real wrestling, wrestling, wrestling?
*  Wrestling, wrestling. I would probably try to text single legs and stuff. Single legs. Yeah.
*  Haven't, okay. No, no, no, I've, no, I've honestly, I don't have the slightest clue. I'd have to feel,
*  I'd feel them out. Um, but single legs, my best take on that. People talk about his wrestling being
*  really good. People that train with him. So, okay. So I, I grilled someone, I will not say who on the
*  Ed Ruth thing. Cause Ed Ruth is very elite and folks that wrestling never became that great at
*  fighting. Unfortunately. Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Kabib. They were on the same team for a while.
*  Yeah. Okay. And there was rumors that could be beat him up. And I said, I, I sure can't believe that.
*  And I've heard that that was if they were just straight wrestling, Ed would get slightly the
*  better of it. Well, Ed is like one of the greats. He's great. He's really good. Yeah. So that was
*  what I heard. But in an MMA setting, because of all the tools that could be able to get them.
*  I don't know. But I, but I agree. I agree with Rogan on this one. That would have been good to
*  see. Yeah. I'm fun. So yeah. If Kabib wants to work out, I'd love it. I love, I love wrestling and
*  grappling. I don't do much Jiu-Jitsu cause I just don't have time for it anymore. I'm at the wrestling
*  academy like every single day. Uh, but I, you know, I love Jiu-Jitsu. Well, I did it. And
*  you know, if I didn't have wrestling academies, I probably would still be doing Jiu-Jitsu. Yeah. You
*  did well in Jiu-Jitsu as well. But let me ask you a ridiculous question. Who's the greatest of all
*  time, freestyle or folk style? Oh, wrestling. Wrestling. Hmm. Well, I, I will say my knowledge
*  past like the year 2000 is really not that great because you can't- In which direction? Sorry.
*  After 2000? No, no before. Cause you can't find any film or anything, you know? And so you hear of all
*  these- So you need evidence. You need direct evidence. I want to be able to watch them and see
*  them and feel the times and feel their opponents and you know, all those things to really like,
*  I hate giving bad answers, you know? So, um, I would, I, there's just not enough footage of any
*  of those people. You know, we took, we go back to someone like Alexander Medved. Like you can't
*  find footage. You can't find anything on him, you know? It's like, who is he wrestling? I mean,
*  I'm not sure. So, um, post 2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle. So, um- Americans,
*  Tsitiev has the probably the best argument post 2000. I think, sad July of, um-
*  If you had the Russian tank, that guy is- Yeah. So who's, who's better? Snyder or Sad July?
*  So Sad July just won at the Olympics. I understand this. I understand how that works,
*  but they're pretty close, right? Not really. Not, not that match, but in general the matchup.
*  So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17. Sad July pinned him the following year,
*  but then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19, um, and then just lost. I don't want, I don't want
*  to say fairly decisively, but it was, it was six to three and there was a late takedown. He kind of
*  gave it up and maybe if it was really competitive, maybe he wouldn't have, um, they're going to
*  wrestle again in like two weeks here. So that, you know, yeah, you, I mean, you have to say
*  Sad July at this point. There's nothing else to say unless Kyle proves us otherwise.
*  Yeah. Not enough people talk about Sad July. Okay. Why you think that guy should go to MMA?
*  You think Kyle should go to MMA? Some of these guys. Yeah, they're making enough money wrestling
*  where they don't really feel the need to. It's terrifying though, as a heavyweight,
*  Sad July probably it's like, it's like could be, but heavyweight. Well, I don't know if you
*  remember, do you remember Bilal Mokhov? So Bilal Mokhov actually was the Russian representative in
*  both styles of 2016, Greco and freestyle. Um, and he was to my knowledge, the only person the UFC's
*  ever signed that was zero in modern era, signed that was zero and zero. And then he actually never
*  ended up fighting, but weird, right? So yeah, I don't know what the story is. Cause sometimes
*  I have Russia. I mean, I maybe have better sources than I do. Sometimes it feels like dudes just
*  disappear. Like they're a world champ or Olympic champ. And then all of a sudden you're like, wait,
*  I don't understand. Where'd he go? You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.
*  So what'd I say? I forgot, but I think steroids, I think somebody's going to show up to your door.
*  I'm worried. I honestly, I've said enough bad things where I would be kind of a looker on my
*  shoulder if I went to the bathroom or something. I for one love the Russians. What about Icarus?
*  How does that make you feel? What about it? It's fake news. Oh, really? I'm just kidding.
*  Maybe it is. I don't know. I don't know anymore.
*  Yeah. You know, it's troublesome, man. I hate cheating in all of its forms.
*  Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo that stood out to you,
*  Gable Stevenson, like anything like that? Yeah. No, I think America's coming to the
*  point where we're going to compete with Russia every single year in wrestling, which obviously,
*  you know, long, long time ago, many, many years we did. We were great. And then kind of after that
*  Soviet Union period, I think there was a lot of poverty in that area. And that kind of led the
*  wrestling team going down a little bit. And then obviously a lot of those regions, the way they
*  found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea, I believe, and they've been really kind of on the upswing
*  for the last 20 years. And now America really since 2012 has been on the upswing in wrestling.
*  And we're kind of really competing with them and they're not sending a couple of their best guys.
*  So for those who don't know, the Olympics got put back in the air. So they are hosting the 2021
*  World Championships, despite the fact that we just had the Olympics two months ago. So it's happening
*  next week in Oslo, Norway. So like Russia is not sending their number one at 57 and number 165. So
*  it's like America's probably going to win. I think I don't want to guarantee anything,
*  but there's a really good chance. So America gave any of the Olympics that meddled the
*  opportunity to not even have to wrestle off. They just got to keep the spot since it was two months
*  later if they meddled. So the only one who's not is Gable. Gable is moving on. We have a pretty good
*  guy behind him named Nick Wistowski, he's a world medalist. But then he's a world champion in the
*  79 spot. Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot. Who's a world champion also. So we have a-
*  It's a hell of a team. Pretty good squad. Yeah. Pretty good squad. Pretty happy. Okay.
*  So given your run in Bellatorian and won championship, that was like one of the most
*  dominant runs in MMA. What would you say was like key to your dominance in that long undefeated
*  streak? Huh. Probably consistency would be one. The fact that I just, I lived and trained the same
*  way no matter where my life was. Whereas a lot of fighters, once they start making money for the
*  first time, they have all these obligations and they travel and they really enjoy making money.
*  And that's kind of why some of them fall off. So you had like the same process, like the same
*  camp and- Yeah, I stayed at my house. I didn't vacation. Yeah, everything. Just, you know,
*  and so that was a big part of it. Obviously the style thing is like no one could, there was only
*  a few people who could stop my style. And I think I continue to get better as a mixed martial artist.
*  And I wasn't as innovative in mixed martial arts, but there was a handful of things that I
*  innovated, you know, specifically in the top position where I spent a lot of time where it was
*  just like, there was just, once I got on top of you, it was like in a spider web and there was just
*  kind of no way out, you know, you'd never felt the certain things I was doing. And so people just,
*  they gave up eventually. How's the level of wrestling in MMA would you say?
*  So I saw somewhere like champions, the most popular martial art for current UFC champions
*  are all wrestling. So we just lost a bunch of the bells. Wrestling as a sport, right? But yeah,
*  one point we had, I think it was eight of nine maybe or something to that effect. And I think
*  it's not just wrestling, not just the actual martial art of wrestling that contributes to
*  our success in mixed martial arts, but other things like the way we're systemized. So most
*  kids have, have went through the high school program and the college program and they know
*  how to show up on time and they know how to work hard. So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever,
*  they know how to show up on time and they know how to work hard. And that's going to get you a
*  really long way. Just those two things, right? Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline.
*  Those things. Then I think you throw on top of that, the fact that most of us have competed
*  1500 to 2000 times, probably by the time we get to 20 something, like that's a huge advantage too.
*  Most of these other people from other disciplines maybe have competed a hundred, if that, right?
*  So we have this competitive process down really, really, really, really well. Plus the way cut.
*  The way cut. There's all these things, right? The factor into it. I think the fact that we're
*  really open-minded, like I think if you would, I don't pick on Jiu-Jitsu again, but like how many
*  Jiu-Jitsu guys have became highly proficient in wrestling versus how many wrestling guys have
*  became highly proficient in Jiu-Jitsu. I think that number swings one way and not that much the other
*  way, you know? So we're open to adapting and learning. And for some reason, like Jiu-Jitsu
*  people, how many of them have got high level wrestling or even mediocre wrestling? The number
*  is really small. Like they refuse to, it's really frustrating. Like why won't they do it? Like,
*  it's really frustrating. Like why won't they do this? This is obviously a part of it. You know,
*  if like, I don't pick on specific guys, but there's certain guys in the history of MMA where you're
*  like, listen, man, I mean, Damien Maia, who I, who's my last fight is a great example of somebody
*  who actually did get proficient wrestling, right? But there's some of these Jiu-Jitsu guys who's like,
*  if you just got on top, you would submit him. Why can't you learn a freaking takedown? Like,
*  holy moly. Like just learn how to take someone down. Once you get them down, they will not get up
*  and you win the fight. Like it's so easy, you know, but they refuse.
*  How complicated is that journey? So like Donaher that you mentioned, Craig Jones,
*  they're big on wrestling as part of Jiu-Jitsu now. Like wrestling, not just on the feet,
*  but wrestling from the bottom coming up and all that kind of stuff. So how difficult is that whole
*  skill set, would you say, for a Jiu-Jitsu person to learn? Not that hard. If they really put their
*  mind to it. Cause they already like, when you grapple, and this is any grappling art, like
*  there's a certain part of it that you kind of get and it can, it might not be the exact same thing,
*  but you understand how your body moves and how to feel certain pressures and you can adapt yourself
*  pretty quickly, you know? So I don't think there's a certain level of stubbornness where they didn't
*  want to, certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason. I think a lot of times in MMA,
*  it's the I'm so macho, I can stand and bang thing, you know, where they want to show how macho they
*  are. But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they, there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly
*  proficient in Jiu-Jitsu and really adapted and it doesn't go the other way. And then I guess the
*  other thing there too is they can both steal from each other, right? As any martial art can steal
*  from another. And like, I feel like Jiu-Jitsu didn't do enough stealing from wrestling. Like,
*  they should have looked at all the wrestling possibles and said, well, why don't we steal that
*  and that and that, you know, and like, hey, let's take that over and maybe we'd make a little tweak
*  because it's different, but there's something we can definitely use there. So like in wrestling,
*  for example, you know, there's a one arm guillotine in Jiu-Jitsu, right? Okay. So there's a move called,
*  well, it's got a hard name, it's like the oldest move in wrestling because it's what they did,
*  the cows where they go around the chin and they throw them on the back. How do we call that one?
*  I don't know. Sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one? Yeah. Would you take a cow and
*  grab it with it and throw it to the side? No, but in wrestling, in wrestling. I don't know.
*  Okay. Are you putting it under? Yeah. So you can grab their chin and then you go under their arm
*  and then throw them on their back. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. So we call that the honey badger,
*  but it's got different names wherever you go. It's got different names. So I would always,
*  I would say like, pre-Jiu-Jitsu, I was average at it. Like I could do it, but against good people,
*  you never get it for, because they would get the back of their head up and they're too strong
*  where you couldn't collapse them by going over their neck, right? Because the forces weren't
*  right. So then in Jiu-Jitsu, you learn the one-arm guillotine where you grab their chin and this is
*  more of running along the side of their head and then you go here and you choke them, right?
*  Much more efficient way to move their head because the fulcrum is way down here and their head can
*  move into that, right? So once I learned that in Jiu-Jitsu, I'm like, wait, I can do this in
*  wrestling. So now once I learned how to grab their chin the right way and I do the honey badger,
*  no one ever gets out. I just had to steal that Jiu-Jitsu, put it in wrestling and boom, there we
*  go. But very few people steal any direction. That takes creativity. Really? And open mind.
*  It's so easy because it's already done. You just got to steal that. I mean, same with Judo. If
*  you're a Gi Jiu-Jitsu person, there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing because
*  Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves on the transition, which is something Jiu-Jitsu does
*  not do because you have something from the takedown to from the takedown, but also just in general,
*  just in the transition, the concept of transition, the like Jiu-Jitsu is very much about like we're
*  in this position, then we're in this position, then we're in this position. The Judo is much more
*  in when there's chaos of any kind. That's when you need to strike. And to learn that, I mean,
*  that's why people like Travis Stevens and Judoca when they go to Jiu-Jitsu, they can dominate, but
*  Jiu-Jitsu people should steal that. They're too stubborn. Yeah, but so is every wrestler are stubborn too.
*  No way. There would never be any stubborn wrestlers. Well, I mean, I was surprised,
*  you know, all these coaches, John Smith, Dan Gable, they don't really have interest in MMA
*  or Jiu-Jitsu and so on. But you would think somebody like a John Smith would like
*  put on a white belt and roll around. Yeah, I think he's just too focused on, you know,
*  what he's a coach and what he's doing. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's
*  younger, he would have a lot of fun. We actually have a really good wrestler making his MMA debut
*  tomorrow. I don't know if you've heard of Bo Nicol, I'm sure you've heard of him, third high level.
*  I think he's going to have a lot of success. I mean, some people might say that like Jiu-Jitsu
*  makes you a little comfortable being in your back and for a wrestler that could be like really bad.
*  I hate that take. Yeah, but that's the Dan Gable take. It's so stupid. It's so stupid. For God's
*  sakes, we know the fucking rules. Just wrestling, you don't go to your back. In Jiu-Jitsu, you can.
*  It's like whatever. Yeah. You know, but like Jiu-Jitsu, for example, so I coached when I was
*  at Rufus, I coached the wrestling for a long, I don't know, three, four, five years. So I've been
*  taking a Jiu-Jitsu guy and teaching them a wrestling technique where you needed to use your feet.
*  To teach Jiu-Jitsu guys, so easy, so simple, because they already understand the concept,
*  butterfly guard, etc., etc., etc., right? To take a wrestler who's never done any of it and teach
*  him how to use his feet. Oh my God, it's such a beast. It's so hard, you know, because they just,
*  that's not a weapon they're thinking about using. So it's like, we understand the rules. It's like
*  freestyle focus on wrestling and freestyle form the mat. I can lock my hands. You don't see people
*  locking their hands all the time in folk style just because they did freestyle. It's like they
*  get it. There's a rule. They understand it. So the notion that somehow you get comfort on your back.
*  But pinning, that's like a, it has a special meaning. Yeah. But I actually think, so Jiu-Jitsu,
*  you don't actually want to be flat, flat very often, right? You don't want to be.
*  I always wondered this because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments and I did, I would
*  put myself in butterfly guard and I wasn't going against good people. So which is why I was doing
*  all these things. But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling where you're
*  butterfly guard. So I think there's a few places where I use it. But so specifically the elevator
*  series was my main series at bottom. It is, it's not butterfly guard. It's a butterfly guard,
*  like grip with your foot. So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot, boom, and I elevate
*  you over. Right. And then also sometimes like, I think Keegan does this too from watching me,
*  but like a double leg. Sometimes if I'm accepting, so freestyle obviously you're going to give a
*  point to folks out, except that you've already got me. And as I go down, I'm just going to butterfly
*  guard you off, you know, and then I'm going to try to flip my hip back to the mat and get it end up
*  in a wizard position. Like I've used that quite a few times where it is kind of like a bailout
*  mechanism that gives me back to maybe not a great position, but obviously much better than being
*  taken down. Beautiful. Yeah. Let me ask you quickly about crypto because you're also, you have a show,
*  you have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency. Why are you interested in cryptocurrency? Is it
*  just a financial investment or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it? Philosophy. So I,
*  my friend told me about it in 2017. I was actually, I went to, I was, I was,
*  my friend met me in Shanghai. I fought in one championship. And he told me, and the second he
*  told me, I'm like, I'm so in, cause I had read Ron Paul and the fed, I had read, I, you know,
*  kind of had an understanding how the fed is unfair. And so we told him about crypto, this decentralized
*  system that no one has control over. It just made sense. And so like we've had the podcast with
*  Michael sailor on it. And I love the way he said, it's like, who do you trust more with your money?
*  Do you trust the politicians or do you trust engineers? I think that's an easy choice. I don't
*  even think, I don't even think I have to think about that. I don't trust politicians, no matter
*  what country they come from, China, America, wherever I don't trust them. So what about into
*  in 2017, what was it? Bitcoin? Are you, what do you, what do you find? Which ones do you find
*  interesting? Yeah, there's all kinds of ideas. So there's the, the, the more sort of primal mechanism
*  of proof of work and Bitcoin. And then there's smart contracts, ideas, and there's all kinds
*  of innovations across the different. So I can't say I've been super deep where I understand the
*  technical components of a lot of minor, I understand what Bitcoin can do for people. And so that's
*  probably the one I've, I've focused the most on. And I actually, I think I was talking about, I was
*  trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin because he hates it also, what he did last night.
*  And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves, people in America are so American-centric,
*  they don't understand it. So like high levels of inflation that hasn't happened in, it's starting
*  to happen, it hasn't happened in America in a long time, right? But someone in Venezuela is like,
*  oh, I get that, you know, or remittance payments, right? Remittance payments to, you see it. So I
*  saw this in, when I was spending all the time in Singapore, Singapore is obviously a really wealthy
*  country. And so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino, and they would all go on Sundays,
*  they would go to these places to ship stuff back to their families. And through Western Union,
*  Western Union gouges the shit out of these people. I mean, they're taking 8, 10, 12% of whatever
*  they're sending. Then it takes five days and the person's gonna go pick it up. Whereas Bitcoin,
*  I could send you Bitcoin person to person, right? So like American people don't understand that.
*  American people don't really understand the unbanked, right? A decent portion of the world
*  is unbanked, they don't have access to it. And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world
*  doesn't have access to internet. So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,
*  and we can send money person to person. So there's a whole bunch of those problems where Americans
*  don't really think about that are really obvious that this solves. So I think that's the key one,
*  obviously, the fact that the value goes up is really outstanding also. But if you look at it,
*  I got in in 2017. So I got to watch it go up. I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid.
*  And then the majority of my time was spent through the bear market. And so I had to love it for the
*  principles that provided not the fact that actually, I actually lost money in the beginning and now I'm
*  way up. But yeah, so I- And you're just holding.
*  You're just holding. I think at the top of this bull market, I'll probably sell a very small
*  portion. So you mean like right now there's a bull market?
*  Yeah, most people think in the next three to six months, we'll be at the top of the market.
*  So probably when that happens, I'll probably sell a little bit.
*  You got to huddle it then. You got to huddle. Well, yeah. So here's what I am. So my podcast,
*  one of my podcast co-hosts, he's like super rich, like super rich. So he has lost touch with the
*  every man. So here's my argument to him. It's really simple. And listen, I'm doing well for
*  myself in life. But if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right? One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last
*  year. And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000, which is right around what a lot of people think
*  the peak is going to be. They bought one Bitcoin and they are living in a $200,000 house. So to take
*  half of that, right? You started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000
*  and pay off your house, your remaining house payment. That's life changing to someone. It
*  really is. And so you still have a Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin goes to a million, you're still going to
*  have half a million and you're going to feel really, really rich with that half a million dollars
*  because you bought it for F and $2,500, you know? Yeah. So yeah. So I would encourage anyone who's
*  not uber rich to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them because it could change your
*  life. And if you hold it and it goes down, you're going to feel the pain of that. Like sometimes
*  if you're more constrained financially, it's much more psychologically difficult to ride the
*  ups and downs. Yeah, it is for sure. They have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin.
*  Actually, we said the guy, one of the main guys on our podcast is called on chain metrics. So all,
*  all wallet transactions are visible, you know? And so they have these, all these fun categories.
*  I love, so I actually, I think you said you don't like numbers, but I like numbers. I love numbers.
*  I love numbers also. So they have all these different categories. Like you can see how long
*  a wallet has held a Bitcoin, right? Or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet. And so what
*  they've seen during this, the downturn, right? So April, it kind of peaked and went down is
*  that the, the whales are still buys the whales. The people have a thousand or more are still buying.
*  They've said the main group of sellers is the ones who held it from zero to three months.
*  So like they don't have money. They bought it because they thought it was going up.
*  And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it. Right. Whereas anyone's held for a long time is generally
*  still holding on to it. That's interesting. That's a good indicator, right? For the whole space.
*  Yeah. Well, let me ask you for some advice. You've been through one heck of a career,
*  one heck of a life. What advice would you give to a young person today?
*  Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling is really a microcosm of what your life's going to be. And
*  that's why one of the things that I stress to kids is like, if we can go through this now and figure,
*  I have a couple of kids who are struggling with certain things right now. If you can figure out
*  this now in wrestling, it's going to be a lot better figure out now and get over this mental hump
*  than when you're 32 and you have two kids and right and your job's not going well. It's going
*  to be a lot worse. It could be a lot more painful then. Let's let's fucking figure it out now.
*  So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons we can learn from wrestling, whether it's
*  persistence or perseverance or work ethic or, you know, I said wrestlers show up on time and
*  they work hard, right? These things, if we can learn these things at an early age, those are
*  generally those characteristics will generally carry on throughout our life. And those are
*  the things that are going to make us really successful. So, you know, I would say find a
*  great coach, someone who's going to spend a lot of time and put a lot of time into you and make
*  sure they have a lot of wisdom and steal all the wisdom that you can from them. And then if you can
*  be successful at one thing, generally whatever that recipe was that took you to be successful
*  at that, apply it to everything else, right? Apply it to the rest of your life. Apply it to
*  getting a wife that you enjoy. Apply it to living in a place you want to live,
*  doing a job you want to do, right? There's so many possibilities and you just have to be bold
*  enough to go take those chances. It's interesting because like early on in life is when you have
*  much more time. Like people don't realize it's time to learn the lessons. Like somehow later in life
*  you get busier responsibilities and all that kind of stuff. Like high school is a magical time.
*  You know, college. Yeah, there's so much time to learn. You don't even have kids yet.
*  Yeah, I don't have kids. It still fills up. Well, no, I'm purpose and I did something that
*  many people don't seem to be able to do. I walked away from a lot of responsibilities just
*  by saying goodbye. But you know, meetings, like everybody around me at MIT was like,
*  meetings fill the day and then you have more projects and you do a great job and you become
*  successful and then the more meetings fill the day and more responsibilities as opposed to like,
*  wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things? And instead, do I want to
*  find one or two things to really focus on? And that's what I choose. But like that becomes harder
*  and harder and harder as you get older. No, I mean, I'm sure. And also the more success you have,
*  you become sought after other places too. I'm sure that's happening with you. And it's hard to
*  keep saying no, no, no. It is. It's hard. Yeah. You're known for roasting people with a single
*  boom roasted line. So any ideas? Maybe you want to mention malice, but any ideas come to mind
*  when you look at me? Man, you know what? If I was going to boom roast someone, I would want to kind
*  of like research their career and dissect them and figure out their biggest negative. Get to the core.
*  And I didn't have that notion with you. I figured I got a general sense of, okay, he's really
*  successful. He's super sharp. He's really interested in some really interesting things. I bet we'll
*  have a great conversation, but I had no intention to roast you. Yeah. There you go. What about malice?
*  You had dinner with him last night. Hmm. For him. Oh man. How'd you get to know him, by the way?
*  Just Twitter. Where's the most magical place in the world, right? I always tell people it's the
*  greatest source of information if you know how to use it. He's insane on Twitter, actually.
*  So I had to unfollow him on Twitter because he- It was too intense? No, it's too much. It fills up.
*  I want to be able to consume the content. So if I want to see something he says, I can go to his
*  page, right? But it's just too much for my timeline. I want to be able to consume who I follow. So I
*  try to not follow a lot of people because I want to be able to consume them. And he was too much.
*  He fights the trolls, which I don't know why you'd ever fight the trolls. There's just too many of
*  them. Well, he's a troll himself. He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls. He's the king
*  troll. There's a million of them. So even if you kill a hundred thousand, there's still not a hundred
*  thousand left. There's just too many. You just gotta ignore them. It's like the Nightwalker or whatever.
*  Well, I'll take it because you had nothing- you couldn't roast GSP out of respect,
*  too. So I'm just going to take that as a sign of respect. What do you say bad about GSP?
*  Now I try to roast his hair. Like, why are you trying to grow hair now after all these years?
*  He looked good bald. Everyone loved him with his head shaved. That looks kind of strange. It's like,
*  why you got hair now? Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life. So he was here
*  and he wore a black suit and tie. Oh, really? Yeah. We did the podcast with him, just mirror image of me.
*  And then we also did- I haven't released it yet, but just a video together and I was doing
*  martial arts stuff in a suit and tie. That was quite- that's like,
*  certain moments in your life are just like, I can't believe I was part of that.
*  Yeah, with GSP, so yeah, I don't think I made the indroce move out.
*  I mean, maybe the Matt Sarah thing would be the one that you could get him with.
*  I would be really fascinated to really dig deep from a sports psychology standpoint
*  because he always talks about how much fear he had when he was competing. And I find that to be
*  interesting because obviously- so it's almost like to me, it's almost like, was he successful
*  despite that? Not because of that, right? And because anxiety usually loses really negative
*  performance for the majority of people. And what was it about him that the anxiety wasn't super
*  negative? You know what I'm saying? Like, it's very interesting. I wonder that too. So I have-
*  I wonder that about him, but I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting, especially with people.
*  Just about everything, yeah. I wonder if that's helpful or not. It feels like it's very helpful.
*  Well, I think- so okay, I think in two different ways. So I think probably your everyday life,
*  okay, is different than like in a performance or a competition. You have to be like super in the
*  moment of what you're doing. So anything that's pulling you away, like, oh my gosh, you know,
*  high school kids, right? That coach. Oh my gosh, that girl's in the stands. If I get beat,
*  then- and they're actually, they're actively thinking about this other thing when this is
*  going on. And I need a hundred percent of your focus right here. Well, he's never- I don't think
*  he has anxiety in the ring. That's the point. I think like, I have the same thing. Like, if I have
*  a really high performance thing that I have to do, I don't know, a lecture in front of a lot of people.
*  Yeah, that'd be a great example. That- there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead, days ahead,
*  hours ahead. So you have a system to get rid of it then? As you perform? No, maybe, but it's just
*  the body gets rid of it somehow. Yeah, there's not a system. Subconscious system. Yeah, it's-
*  So you don't actually have anxiety while you're performing. So that's like- so then that problem,
*  somehow that problem has solved itself, right? The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening
*  while the wrestling match is happening, that's the real issue. Yeah, but it's- it like sneaks in
*  there too. That's the difference between MMA and wrestling is there's no breaks in wrestling,
*  right? Yes. I guess there is. You can look at the crowd a little bit, like you can look, so maybe-
*  Out of bounds, maybe. But like the- there's other things we have to perform. Well, there's more breaks,
*  like a lecture. You can catch yourself thinking, like in this conversation, you know? Yeah. Like,
*  I've said a bunch of stuff where I think, why the hell did you say that? That's dumb, right? That's
*  the anxiety because there's a pause and that could be- I don't know, I think it just pushes me to be
*  better, but maybe I could be way better if I let go of that. It's scary to think that JSP, if you let
*  go of that. But he- See, he didn't- But he'd have been better. Or did he have a- like you're saying,
*  like you don't necessarily feel those- so I think certain people that I've coached, like they would
*  describe how they would feel literally during the wrestling match, right? And you're saying,
*  like during the speech performance, it's mostly gone. Yep. And that's- so that's- it'd be
*  interesting to see if like, you know, he talked a lot about that, but if it was all the way,
*  somehow gone. And that means he would have a mechanism for it. So like, I had a really bad
*  performance my freshman year of high school at Nationals because I had the ability to be anxious.
*  And one of my coaches talked about, like- and a lot of A-type personalities are kind of that way,
*  because they're trying to consider all possibilities at the same time. And while
*  we're actually performing or competing, it's negative performance, right? So he said he would
*  always- leading up to the match within say an hour, his thing was talking about fishing. He would get
*  someone to talk about fishing with him because it would stop him thinking about the match and
*  being uber anxious. So I kind of really took it to heart and it really helped me as I would always
*  like have someone to talk to and just goof around about whatever. So I'm not thinking about this
*  thing. And then once I step in, it's time to go. So I didn't have this like anxious buildup.
*  Now it's how for me, I took it away. But like me, you know, like you said, you have
*  a way to get it away, obviously, because it's-
*  Yeah, I guess so. I guess there's a little tricks you come up with. Yeah. You start thinking about
*  it's not fishing. Maybe I should try the fishing thing. But-
*  I hate fishing. So boring.
*  Well, maybe it's good to think about that. All right, Ben, this is like I told you, I'm a big fan.
*  I'm a big fan of your wrestling, your fighting, your personality. Thank you for coming down. Thank
*  you for talking today. Appreciate it. Huge honor. Bam. Let's go wrestle.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ben Askren. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Muhammad Ali. Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of
*  his soul and come up with an extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match is even.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
