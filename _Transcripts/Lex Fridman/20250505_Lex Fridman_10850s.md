# Janna Levin: Black Holes, Wormholes, Aliens, Paradoxes & Extra Dimensions | Lex Fridman Podcast #468
**Lex Fridman:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84)
*  black holes curve space and time around them in the way that we've been describing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=0.0s)]
*  Things fall along the curves in space. If the black holes move around, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3.92s)]
*  the curves have to follow them, right? But they can't travel faster than the speed of light either. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7.84s)]
*  So what happens is black holes, let's say, move around. Maybe I've got two black holes in orbit [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=13.84s)]
*  around each other. That can happen. It takes a while. A wave is created in the actual shape of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=18.16s)]
*  space. And that wave follows the black holes as black holes are undulating. Eventually, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=23.36s)]
*  those two black holes will merge. And as we were talking about, it doesn't take an infinite time, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=28.88s)]
*  even though there's time dilation, because they're both so big. They're really deforming [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=33.92s)]
*  space-time a lot. I don't have a little tiny marble falling across an event horizon. I have [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=37.68s)]
*  two event horizons. And in the simulations, you can see it bobble and they merge together. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=42.32s)]
*  And they make one bigger black hole. And then it radiates in the gravitational waves. It radiates [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=47.92s)]
*  away all those imperfections. And it settles down to one quiescent, perfectly silent black [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=53.12s)]
*  hole that's spinning. Beautiful stuff. And it emits E equals MC squared energy. So the mass of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  the final black hole will be less than the sum of the two starter black holes. And that energy is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=64.96s)]
*  radiated away in this ringing of space-time. It's really important to emphasize that it's not light. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=71.6s)]
*  None of this has to do literally with light that we can detect with the normal things that detect [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=78.64s)]
*  light. X-rays form a light, gamma rays are a formal light, infrared, optical, this whole [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=85.04s)]
*  electromagnetic spectrum. None of it is emitted as light. It's completely dark. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=90.4s)]
*  It's only emitted in the rippling of the shape of space. A lot of times, it's likened closer to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  sound. Technically, we've kind of argued. I mean, I haven't done an anatomical calculation. But if [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=98.88s)]
*  you're near enough to two colliding black holes, they actually ring space-time in the human auditory [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=103.84s)]
*  range. The frequency is actually in the human auditory range that the shape of space could [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=109.12s)]
*  squeeze and stretch your eardrum, even in vacuum. And you could hear, literally hear these waves [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=114.72s)]
*  ringing. The following is a conversation with Jana Levin, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  specializing in black holes, cosmology of extra dimensions, topology of the universe, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=130.08s)]
*  and gravitational waves in space-time. She has also written some incredible books, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=135.36s)]
*  including How the Universe Got Its Spots on the Topic of the Shape and the Size of the Universe, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=141.44s)]
*  A Madman's Dream of Turing Machines on the Topic of Genius, Madness, and the Limits of Knowledge, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=147.04s)]
*  Black Hole Blues, and Other Songs from Outer Space on the Topic of LIGO and the Detection of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=154.4s)]
*  Gravitational Waves, and Black Hole Survival Guide, all about black holes. This was a fun [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  and fascinating conversation. This is the Lex Freedom Podcast. To support it, please check out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=171.68s)]
*  our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jana Levin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=176.96s)]
*  I should say that you sent me a message about not starting early in the morning, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=183.52s)]
*  and that made me feel like we're kindred spirits. You wrote to me, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  when the great physicist Sidney Coleman was asked to attend a 9 a.m. meeting, his reply was, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=192.0s)]
*  I can't stay up that late. Yeah, classic. Sidney was beloved. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=198.0s)]
*  I think all the best thoughts, honestly, maybe the worst thoughts, too, are all come at night. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=203.84s)]
*  There's something about the night. Maybe it's the silence. Maybe it's the peace all around. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=208.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the darkness. And you just, you can be with yourself and you can think deeply. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=212.88s)]
*  I feel like there's stolen hours in the middle of the night because it's not busy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  Your gadgets aren't pinging. There's really no pressure to do anything, but I'm often awake [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  in the middle of the night. And so it's sort of like these extra hours of the day. I think we were [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=228.32s)]
*  exchanging messages at four in the morning. Okay. So in that way, many other ways, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=233.6s)]
*  we're kindred spirits. So let's go. In one of the coolest objects in the universe, black holes, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=238.48s)]
*  what are they? And maybe even a good way to start is to talk about how are they formed? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=245.04s)]
*  Yeah. In a way, people often confuse how they're formed with the concept of the black hole in the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=252.16s)]
*  first place. So when black holes were first proposed, Einstein was very surprised that such [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=258.4s)]
*  a solution could be found so quickly, but really thought nature would protect us from their [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=265.28s)]
*  formation. And then nature thinks of a way. Nature thinks of a way to make these crazy objects, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  which is to kill off a few stars. But then I think that there's a confusion that dead stars, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=274.4s)]
*  these very, very massive stars that die, are synonymous with the phenomenon of black hole. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=279.84s)]
*  And it's really not the case. Black holes are more general and more fundamental than just the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=286.0s)]
*  death state of a star. But even the history of how people realize that stars could form black holes [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=292.56s)]
*  is quite fascinating because the entire idea really just started as a thought experiment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=300.64s)]
*  If you think of it's 1915, 1916, when Einstein fully describes relativity in a way that's the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=305.36s)]
*  canonical formulation. It was a lot of changing back and forth before then. And it's World War [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=312.8s)]
*  I and he gets a message from the Eastern Front, from a friend of his, Carl Schorchild, who solved [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Einstein's equations. Between sitting in the trenches and like cannon fire, it was joked [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=324.8s)]
*  that he was calculating ballistic trajectories. He's also perusing the proceedings of the Prussian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=332.48s)]
*  Academy of Sciences, as you do. And he was an astronomer who had enlisted in his 40s. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=337.84s)]
*  And he finds this really remarkable solution to Einstein's equations. And it's the first [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  exact solution. He doesn't call it a black hole. It's not called a black hole for decades. But [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  what I love about what Schorchild did is it's a thought experiment. It's not about observations. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=355.2s)]
*  It's not about making these things in nature. It's really just about the idea. He sets up this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=360.32s)]
*  completely untenable situation. He says, imagine I crush all the mass of a star to a point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=367.12s)]
*  Don't ask how that's done, because that's really absurd. But let's just pretend. And let's just [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  imagine that that's a scenario. And then he wants to decide what happens to space-time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=379.36s)]
*  if I set up this confounding but somehow very simple scenario. And really what Einstein's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=385.12s)]
*  equations were telling everybody at the time was that matter and energy curves space and time. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=391.28s)]
*  And then curved space-time tells matter and energy how to fall once the space-time is shaped. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=397.52s)]
*  So he finds this beautiful solution. And the most amazing thing about his solution is he finds this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=402.4s)]
*  demarcation, which is the event horizon, which is the region beyond which not even light can escape. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  And if you were to ask me today, all these decades, over 100 years later, I would say [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=415.2s)]
*  that is the black hole. The black hole is not the mass crushed to a point. The black hole is the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=419.6s)]
*  event horizon. And the event horizon is really just a point in space-time or a region at space-time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  It's actually, in this case, a surface in space-time. And it marks a separation in events, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  which is why it's called an event horizon. Everything outside is causally separated from [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=439.36s)]
*  the inside insofar as what's inside the event horizon can't affect events outside. What's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=443.92s)]
*  outside can affect events inside. I can throw a probe into a black hole and cause something [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=450.72s)]
*  to happen on the inside. But the opposite isn't true. Somebody who fell in can't send a probe out. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=456.48s)]
*  And this one-way aspect really is what's profound about the black hole. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=462.0s)]
*  Sometimes we talk about the black holes being nothing because at the event horizon, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=468.0s)]
*  there's really nothing there. Sometimes when we think about black holes, we want to imagine a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=471.68s)]
*  really dense dead star. But if you go up to the event horizon, it's an empty region of space-time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=477.2s)]
*  It's more of a place than it is a thing. And Einstein found this fascinating. He helped get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  the work published, but he really didn't think these would form in nature. I doubt Karl [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=490.72s)]
*  Schwarzschild did either. I think they thought they were solving theoretical mathematical problems, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=496.08s)]
*  but not describing what turned out to be the end state of gravitational collapse. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=504.8s)]
*  And maybe the purpose of the thought experiment was to find the limitations of the theory. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  So you find the most extreme versions in order to understand where it breaks down. And it just so [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=515.92s)]
*  happens in this case that might actually predict these extreme kinds of objects. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=522.64s)]
*  It does both. So it also describes the sun from far away. So the same solution does a great job [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=528.72s)]
*  helping us understand the Earth's orbit around the sun. It's incredible. It does a great job. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=536.72s)]
*  It's almost overkill. You don't really need to be that precise as relativity. And yes, it predicts [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=540.8s)]
*  the phenomenon of black holes, but it doesn't really explain how nature would form them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=548.16s)]
*  But then it also, on top of that, does signal the breakdown of the theory. I mean, you're quite [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=552.08s)]
*  right about that. It actually says, oh man, but you go all the way towards the center and yeah, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  this doesn't sound right anymore. Sometimes I liken it to, you know, it's like a dying man [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=562.4000000000001s)]
*  marking in the dirt that something's gone wrong here, right? It's signaling that there's some [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  culprit, there's something wrong in the theory. And even Roger Penrose, who did this general work [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=575.76s)]
*  trying to understand the formation of black holes from gravitational collapse, he thought, oh yeah, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=583.04s)]
*  there's a singularity that's inevitable. There's no way around it once you form a black hole. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=589.68s)]
*  But he said, this is probably just a shortcoming of the fact that we've forgotten to include [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=597.04s)]
*  quantum mechanics and that when we do, we'll understand this differently. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=601.44s)]
*  So according to him, the closer you get to the singularity, the more quantum mechanics [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=607.7600000000001s)]
*  comes into play and therefore there is no singularity, there's something else. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  I think everybody would say that. I think everybody would say the closer you get to the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  singularity, for sure you have to include quantum mechanics. You just can't consistently talk about [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=618.96s)]
*  magnifying such small scales, having such enormous ruptures and curvatures [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=624.56s)]
*  and energy scales and not include quantum mechanics. That's just inconsistent with the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=632.4s)]
*  world as we understand it. So you've described the brain breaking idea that a black hole is [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=636.64s)]
*  not so much a super dense matter as it's sometimes described, but it's more [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  akin to a region of space-time, but even more so just nothing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=649.28s)]
*  It's nothing. That's the thing you seem to like to say. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=656.16s)]
*  I do. I do like to say that black holes are no thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=659.04s)]
*  No thing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=663.36s)]
*  They're nothing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=663.76s)]
*  Okay. So what does that mean? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=664.48s)]
*  That's what I mean. That's the more profound aspect of the black hole. So you asked originally, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=666.24s)]
*  how do they form? I think that even when you try to form them in messy astrophysical systems, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=671.76s)]
*  there's still nothing at the end of the day left behind. This was a very big surprise, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=679.52s)]
*  even though Einstein accepted that this was a true prediction. He didn't think [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  that they'd be made. It was quite astounding that people like Oppenheimer, actually it's probably [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=690.16s)]
*  Oppenheimer's most important theoretical work, who were thinking about nuclear physics and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=696.24s)]
*  quantum mechanics, but in the context of these kind of utopian questions, why do stars shine? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=701.84s)]
*  Why is the sun radiant and hot and this amazing source of light? It was people like Oppenheimer [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=708.08s)]
*  who began to ask the question, well, could stars collapse to form black holes? Could they [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=714.0s)]
*  become so dense that eventually not even light would escape? That's why I think people think [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=721.44s)]
*  that black holes are these dense objects. That's often how it's described. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  But actually what happens is these very massive stars, they're burning thermonuclear fuel. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=734.0s)]
*  They're earth-fulls of thermonuclear fuel they're burning and emitting energy in E equals mc squared [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=738.32s)]
*  energy. So it's fusing, it's a fusion bomb. It's a constantly going thermonuclear bomb. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=745.92s)]
*  Eventually it's going to run out of fuel. It's going to run out of hydrogen, helium stuff to fuse. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  It hits an iron core. Iron to go past iron with fusion is actually energetically expensive. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=757.52s)]
*  So it's no longer going to do that so easily. So suddenly it's run out of fuel. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=764.56s)]
*  If the star is very, very, very massive, much more massive than our sun, maybe 20, 30 times [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=769.12s)]
*  the mass of our sun, it'll collapse under its own weight. And that collapse is incredibly fast [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=773.76s)]
*  and dramatic and it creates a shockwave. So that's the supernova explosion. So a lot of these, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=780.4s)]
*  they rebound because once they crunch, they've reached a new critical capacity where they can [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=785.12s)]
*  reignite to higher elements, heavier elements. And that sets off a bomb essentially. So the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=792.4s)]
*  star explodes, helpfully, because that's why you and I are here, because stars send their material [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=799.04s)]
*  back out into space and you and I get to be made of carbon and oxygen and all this good stuff. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  We're not just hydrogen. So the suns do that for us. And then what's left sometimes ends at a [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  neutron star, which is a very cool object, very fascinating object, super dense, but bigger than [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=817.5999999999999s)]
*  a black hole, meaning it's not compact enough to become a black hole. It's an actual thing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=824.8s)]
*  A neutron star is a real thing. It's like a giant neutron. Literally electrons get [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  jammed into the protons and make this giant nucleus and this superconducting matter, very strange, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=835.92s)]
*  amazing objects. But if it's heavier than that, the core, and that's heavier than twice the mass [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=841.68s)]
*  of the sun, it will become a black hole. And Oppenheimer wrote this beautiful paper in 1939 [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=847.84s)]
*  with his student saying that they believed that the end state of gravitational collapse is actually [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=856.4s)]
*  a black hole. This is stunning and really a visionary conclusion. Now the paper is published [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=863.44s)]
*  the same day the Nazis advance on Poland. And so it does not get a lot of fanfare in the newspapers. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=871.36s)]
*  We think there's a lot of drama today on social media. Imagine that. Here's a guy who predicts [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=879.12s)]
*  how actually in nature would be the formation of this most radical object that broke even [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=885.52s)]
*  Einstein's brain while one of the most evil, if not the most evil humans in history starting [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=892.0s)]
*  the first steps of a global war. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=900.24s)]
*  DR. JAN GILKINSON What I also love about that lesson is how agnostic science is. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=902.0s)]
*  Because he was asking these utopian questions, as were other people at the time, about the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=906.16s)]
*  nuclear physics and stars. You might know this play Copenhagen by Michael Frayn. There's this line [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=910.32s)]
*  that he attributes to Bohr. Bohr was the great thinker of early foundations of quantum mechanics, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=915.84s)]
*  Danish physicist, where Bohr says to his wife, nobody's thought of a way to kill people using [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=923.12s)]
*  quantum mechanics. Now, of course, then there's the nuclear bomb. And what I love about this was [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=929.12s)]
*  the pressure scientists were under to do something with this nuclear physics and to enter this race [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=935.76s)]
*  over a nuclear weapon. But really, at the same time, 1939, really Oppenheimer's thinking about [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=942.32s)]
*  black holes. There's even a small line in Chris Nolan's film. It's very hard to catch. There's [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=949.28s)]
*  a reference to it in the film where they're joking, well, I guess nobody's going to pay [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=955.36s)]
*  attention to your paper now because of the Nazi advance on Poland. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=959.12s)]
*  DR. JAN GILKINSON That's the other remarkable thing about Oppenheimer is he's also a central [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=964.16s)]
*  figure in the construction of the bomb. So it's theory and experiment clashing together [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=967.92s)]
*  with the geopolitics. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  DR. JAN GILKINSON Exactly. Of course, Oppenheimer, now known as the father of the atomic bomb, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=974.72s)]
*  he talks about destroyers of worlds. But it's the same technology. And that's what I mean by [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=981.2s)]
*  science is agnostic, right? It's the same technology, overcoming a critical mass, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=986.8s)]
*  igniting thermonuclear fusion. Eventually, there was a fission. The original bomb was a fission [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=992.24s)]
*  bomb. And fission was first shown by Lise Meitner, who showed that a certain uranium, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=997.6s)]
*  when you bombarded it with protons, broke into smaller pieces that were less than the uranium. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1002.64s)]
*  Some of that mass, that E equals MC squared energy, had escaped. And it was the first kind [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  of concrete demonstration of this, Einstein's most famous equation. So all of this comes together. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1015.12s)]
*  But the story of... They still weren't called black holes. This is 1939. And they had these [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1021.5200000000001s)]
*  very long-winded ways of describing the end state, the catastrophic end state of gravitational [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1028.0800000000002s)]
*  collapse. But what you have to imagine is as this star collapses... So what's the sun? The sun's a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1032.88s)]
*  million and a half kilometers across. So imagine a star much bigger than the sun, much bigger radius, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1039.2800000000002s)]
*  and it's so heavy, it collapses, it supernovas, what's left is still maybe 10 times the mass of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1045.92s)]
*  the sun, just what's left in that core. And it continues to collapse. And when that reaches about [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1051.5200000000002s)]
*  60 kilometers across, just imagine 10 times the mass of the sun, city-sized. That is a really dense [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1057.04s)]
*  object. And now the black hole essentially has begun to form, meaning the curve in space-time [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  is so tremendous that not even light can escape. The event horizon forms, but the event horizon [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1070.24s)]
*  is almost imprinted on the space-time because the star can't sit there in that dense state [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1076.32s)]
*  any more than it can race outward at the speed of light, because even light is forced to rain [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1083.04s)]
*  inwards. So the star continues to fall. And that's the magic part. The star leaves the event horizon [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1087.68s)]
*  behind and it continues to fall. And it falls into the interior of the black hole, where it goes, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1094.16s)]
*  nobody really knows, but it's gone from sight. It goes dark. There's this quote by John Wheeler, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  who's like granddaddy of American relativity, and he has a line that's something to the effect. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1109.52s)]
*  The star, like the Cheshire cat, fades from view. One leaves behind, only its grin. The other, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  only its gravitational attraction. And he was giving a lecture. It's actually above Tom's [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1121.44s)]
*  restaurant from Seinfeld near Columbia in New York. There was a place, or there still is a place [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1126.96s)]
*  there where people were giving lectures about astrophysics and it's 1967. Wheeler is exhaustively [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1134.72s)]
*  saying this loaded term, the end state of catastrophic gravitational collapse. And rumor [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1142.24s)]
*  is that someone shouts from the back row, well, how about black hole? And apparently he then foists [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1148.8s)]
*  this term on the world. Wheeler had a way of doing that. Well, I love terms like that. Big bang, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1155.2s)]
*  black hole. There's some, I mean, it's just pointing out the elephant in the room and calling [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1160.96s)]
*  it an elephant. It is a black hole. That's a pretty accurate and deep description. I just wanted to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1167.2s)]
*  point out that just looking for the first time, it's a 1939 paper from Oppenheimer. It's like [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1173.92s)]
*  two pages, it's like three pages. Oh yeah, it's gorgeous. The simplicity of some of these, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1178.64s)]
*  that's so gangster. Just revolutionize all of physics with this. Einstein did that multiple [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1184.0s)]
*  times in a simple year. When all thermonuclear sources of energy are exhausted, a sufficiently [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1189.68s)]
*  heavy star will collapse. That's an opener. Unless fission due to rotation, the radiation of mass [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1195.04s)]
*  or the blowing off of mass by radiation reduce the star's mass to orders of that of the sun. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1201.76s)]
*  This contraction will continue indefinitely. And it goes on that way. Yeah. Now I have to say Wheeler, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1207.52s)]
*  who actually coins the term black hole, gives Oppenheimer quite a terrible time about this. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1213.44s)]
*  He thinks he's wrong. And they entered what has sometimes been described as kind of a bitter, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1219.2s)]
*  I don't know if you would actually say feud, but they were bad feelings. And Wheeler actually spent [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1225.68s)]
*  decades saying Oppenheimer was wrong. And eventually with his computer work, that early work that [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1232.24s)]
*  Wheeler was doing, the computer is when he was also trying to understand nuclear weapons and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  in peacetime found themselves returning again to these astrophysical questions, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1245.36s)]
*  decided that actually Oppenheimer had been right. He thought it was too simplistic, too idealized, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1251.52s)]
*  a setup that they had used. And that if you looked at something that was more realistic [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1257.84s)]
*  and more complicated, that it just simply, it just would go away. And in fact, he draws [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1262.08s)]
*  the opposite conclusion. And there's a story that Oppenheimer was sitting outside of the auditorium [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1267.2s)]
*  when Wheeler was coming forth with his declaration that in fact, black holes were the likely end [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1272.4s)]
*  state of gravitational collapse for very, very heavy stars. And when asked about it, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1279.68s)]
*  Oppenheimer sort of said, well, I've moved on to other things. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1285.0400000000002s)]
*  Because you've written in many places about the human beings behind the science. I have to ask [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1288.24s)]
*  you about this, about nuclear weapons. Where is the greatest of physicists coming together to create [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1293.2s)]
*  this most terrifying and powerful of a technology? And now I get to talk to world leaders for [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1298.56s)]
*  homeless technology is part of the tools that is used perhaps implicitly on the chessboard [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1304.32s)]
*  of geopolitics. What can you say as a person who's a physicist and who have studied the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1312.48s)]
*  physicist and written about the physicist, the humans behind this, about this moment in human [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1318.8s)]
*  history, when physicists came together and created this weapon that's powerful enough to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1323.2s)]
*  destroy all of human civilization? I think it's an excruciating moment in the history of science. And [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1331.2s)]
*  people talk about Heisenberg, who stayed in Germany and worked for the Nazis in their own attempt [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1341.52s)]
*  to build the bomb. There was this kind of hopeful talk that maybe Heisenberg had intentionally [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1349.44s)]
*  derailed the nuclear weapons program. But I think that's been largely discredited that he would have [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  made the bomb, could he? Had he not made some really kind of simple errors in his original [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1361.52s)]
*  estimates about how much material would be required or how they would get over the energy [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1367.28s)]
*  barriers. And that's a terrifying thought. I don't know that any of us can really put [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1371.52s)]
*  ourselves in that position of imagining that we're faced with that quandary, having to take the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1379.2s)]
*  initiative to participate in thinking of a way that quantum mechanics can kill people. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1385.12s)]
*  And then making the bomb, I think overwhelmingly physicists today feel we should not continue in [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1389.6s)]
*  the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Very few theoretical physicists want to see this continue. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1397.2s)]
*  That moment in history, the Soviet Union had incredible scientists, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1404.0s)]
*  Nazi Germany had incredible scientists, and the United States had incredible scientists. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1407.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's very easy to imagine that one of those three would have created the bomb first, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1412.32s)]
*  not the United States. And how different would the world be, the game theory of that? I think [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1418.88s)]
*  say the probability is 33% that it was the United States. If the Soviet Union had the bomb, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1427.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that they would have used it in a much more terrifying way in the European theater and [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1435.76s)]
*  maybe turn on the United States. And obviously with Hitler, he would have used it. I think there's no [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1442.64s)]
*  question he would have used it to kill hundreds of millions of people. In the game theory version, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1447.92s)]
*  this was the least harmful outcome. Yes. But there is no outcome with no bomb that any game theorist [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1455.04s)]
*  I think would play. But I think if we just remove the geopolitics and the ideology and the evil [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1463.76s)]
*  dictators, all of those people are just scientists. I think they don't necessarily even think about [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  the ideology. And so it's a deep lesson about the connection between great science and the annoying, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1477.84s)]
*  sometimes evil politicians that use that science for means that are either good or bad. And the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1486.8s)]
*  scientists perhaps don't, boy, do they even have control of how that science is used? It's hard. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't have control, right? Once it's made, it's no longer scientific reasoning that dictates [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1500.56s)]
*  the use or it's restraint. But I will say that I do believe that it wasn't a thirty, one third down [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1506.72s)]
*  the line because America was different. And I think that's something we have to think about right now [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1516.4s)]
*  in this particular climate. So many scientists fled here. They fled to here. Americans weren't [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  fleeing to Nazi Germany. They came here and they were motivated by, it's more than a patriotism. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1528.88s)]
*  I mean, it was a patriotism, obviously, but it was sort of more than that. It was really understanding [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  the threat of Europe, what was going on in Europe and how quickly it turned, how quickly this [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1545.0400000000002s)]
*  free-spirited Berlin culture was suddenly in this repressive and terrifying regime. So I think that [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1554.32s)]
*  it was a much higher chance that it happened here in America. Yeah. There's something about the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  American system. It's cliche to say, but the freedom, all the different individual freedoms [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1568.6399999999999s)]
*  that enable a very vibrant, at its best, a very vibrant scientific community. That's really exciting [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1575.2s)]
*  to scientists. And it's very valuable to maintain that, the vibrancy of the debate, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1580.48s)]
*  of the funding of those mechanisms. Absolutely. The world flocked here and that won't be the case if [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1587.2s)]
*  we no longer have intellectual freedom. Yeah. There's something interesting to think about, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1594.0s)]
*  the tension, the Cold War between China and the United States in the 21st century. Some of those [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1599.6s)]
*  same questions, some of those ideas will rise up again. And we want to make sure that there's a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1603.92s)]
*  vibrant, free exchange of scientific ideas. I believe most Nobel Prizes come from the United [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1609.52s)]
*  States, right? Oh, yeah. I don't have the number, but I- [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1616.16s)]
*  But it's disproportionately so. It's disproportionately so. In fact, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1619.44s)]
*  a lot of them from particle physics came from the Bronx, and they were European immigrants. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1622.48s)]
*  How do we explain this? Right? Led Europe precisely because [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1629.52s)]
*  of the geopolitics we're describing. Yeah. And so instead of being Nobel Prize winners from [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1632.72s)]
*  the Soviet Union or from the Eastern Bloc, they were from the Bronx. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1637.04s)]
*  And that's the thing you write about and we'll return to time and time again, that science is [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  done by humans. And some of those humans are fascinating. There's tensions, there's battles, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  there's some are loners, some are great collaborators, some are tormented, some are easy [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1650.8s)]
*  going, all this kind of stuff. And that's the beautiful thing about it. We forget sometimes [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1656.48s)]
*  is that it's humans and humans are messy and complicated and beautiful and all of that. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1659.76s)]
*  Yeah. So what were we talking about? Oh. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1664.64s)]
*  The stars collapsing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1667.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay. So can we just return to the collapse of a star that forms a black hole? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1669.8400000000001s)]
*  At which point does the super dense thing become nothing if we can just like linger on this concept? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So if I were falling into a black hole and I tried really fast, right as I crossed [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1684.72s)]
*  this empty region, but this demarcation, I happened to know where it was. I calculated [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1691.52s)]
*  because there's no line there. There's no sign that it's there. There's no signpost. I could [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1697.6s)]
*  emit a little light pulse and try to send it outward exactly at the event horizon. So it's [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1704.08s)]
*  racing outward at the speed of light. It can hover there because from my perspective, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1708.24s)]
*  it's very strange. The space time is like a waterfall raining in and I'm being dragged in [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1713.12s)]
*  with that waterfall. I can't stop at the event horizon. It comes, it goes. It's behind me [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1718.0s)]
*  really quickly. That light beam can try to sit there because it's like a fish swimming against [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1722.64s)]
*  the Niagara, swimming against a waterfall. It's like stuck there. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1729.04s)]
*  But it's like stuck there. And so that's one way you can have a little signpost. If you fly by, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1732.24s)]
*  you think it's moving at the speed of light. It flies past you at the speed of light, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1737.76s)]
*  but it's sitting right there at the event horizon. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1741.36s)]
*  So you're falling back across the event horizon right at that point. You shoot outwards [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1743.12s)]
*  a photon. And it's just stuck there. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1747.92s)]
*  It just gets stuck there. Now it's very unstable. So the star can't sit there is the point. It just [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1750.4s)]
*  can't. So it rains inward with this waterfall. But from the outside, all we should ever really [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1756.96s)]
*  care about is the event horizon because I can't know what happens to it. It could be pure matter [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1762.96s)]
*  and anti-matter thrown together, which annihilates into photons on the inside and loses all its mass [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  into the energy of light. Won't matter to me because I can't know anything about what [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1773.92s)]
*  happened on the inside. Okay. Can we just like linger on this? So what models do we have about [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1778.0800000000002s)]
*  what happens on the inside of the black hole at that moment? So I guess that one of the intuitions, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1782.5600000000002s)]
*  one of the big reminders that you're giving to us is like, hey, we know very little [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1786.48s)]
*  about what can happen on the inside of a black hole. And that's why we have to be careful about [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  making, it's better to think about the black hole as an event horizon, but what can we know [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  and what do we know about the physics of space-time inside black hole? I don't mind being [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1803.76s)]
*  incautious about thinking about what the math tells us. So I'm not such an observer. I'm very [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1810.72s)]
*  theoretical in my work. It's really pen on paper a lot. These are thought experiments that I think [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1819.2s)]
*  we can perform and contemplate whether or not we'll ever know is another question. And so one of [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1824.16s)]
*  the most beautiful things that we suspect happens on the inside of a black hole is that space and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1832.4s)]
*  time in some sense swap places. So while I'm on the outside of the black hole, let's say I'm in [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  a nice comfortable space station. This black hole is maybe 10 times the mass of the sun, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1844.88s)]
*  60 kilometers across. I could be a hundred kilometers out. That's very, very close. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  Orbit in quite safely. No big deal. You know, hanging out. I don't bug the black hole. Black [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1855.52s)]
*  hole doesn't bug me. It won't suck me up like a vacuum or anything crazy. But my astronaut friend [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1861.28s)]
*  jumps in. As they cross the event horizon, what I'm calling space, I'm looking on the outside at this [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1868.48s)]
*  spherical shadow of the black hole cast by maybe light around it. It's a shadow because everything [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  gets too close, falls in. It's just contrast against a bright sky. I think, oh, there's a [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1883.44s)]
*  center of a sphere. And in the center of the sphere is the singularity. It's a point in space [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1890.32s)]
*  from my perspective. But from the perspective of the astronaut who falls in, it's actually a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1895.12s)]
*  point in time. So their notions of space and time have rotated so completely that what I'm calling [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1900.32s)]
*  a direction in space towards the center of the black hole, like the center of a physical sphere, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1908.08s)]
*  they're going to tell me what they can't tell me, but they're going to come to the conclusion, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  oh, no, that's not a location in space. That's a location in time. In other words, the singularity [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1916.56s)]
*  ends up in their future. And they can no more avoid the singularity than they can avoid time [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1923.6s)]
*  coming their way. So there's no shenanigans you can do once you're inside the black hole to try [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1930.1599999999999s)]
*  to skirt it, the singularity. You can't set yourself up in orbit around it. You can't try [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1935.84s)]
*  to fire rockets and stay away from it because it's in your future. And there's an inevitable [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1942.08s)]
*  moment when you will hit it. Usually for a stellar mass black hole, we think it's microseconds. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1947.6s)]
*  Microseconds to get from the event horizon to the singularity. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1953.28s)]
*  To the singularity. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. So that's describing from your astronaut friends' perspective. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1956.32s)]
*  Yes. From their perspective, the singularity is in their future. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1964.96s)]
*  But from your perspective, what do you see when your friend falls into the black hole and you're [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1968.56s)]
*  chilling outside and watching? So one way to think about this [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1975.04s)]
*  is to think that as you're approaching the black hole, the astronaut's space time is rotating [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1980.24s)]
*  relative to your space time. So let's say right now, my left is your right. We're not shocked by [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1989.04s)]
*  the fact that there's this relativity in left and right. It's completely understood. And I can [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=1996.24s)]
*  perform a spatial rotation to align my left with your left. Right now, I've completely rotated left [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2000.56s)]
*  out. If I just want to draw a kind of compass diagram, not a compass diagram, but you know, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2008.16s)]
*  at the top of maps, there's a north, south, east, west. But now time is up, down, and one direction [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2015.84s)]
*  of space is, let's say, east, west. As you approach the black hole, it's as though you're [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2021.92s)]
*  rotating in space time is one way of thinking about it. So what is the effect of that? The [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2026.3200000000002s)]
*  effect of that is as this astronaut gets closer and closer to the event horizon, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2032.8000000000002s)]
*  part of their space is rotated into my time and part of their time is rotated into my space. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2038.48s)]
*  So in other words, their clocks seem to be less aligned with my time. And the overall effect is [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2046.4s)]
*  that their time seems to dilate. The spacing between ticks on the clock of their watch, let's say, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2054.32s)]
*  on the face of their watch is elongated, dilated relative to mine. And it seems to me that their [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2062.2400000000002s)]
*  watches are running slowly, even though they were made in the same factory as mine. They were both [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2070.0s)]
*  synchronized beautifully and they're excellent Swiss watches. It seems as though time is elapsing [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2074.24s)]
*  more slowly for my companion. And likewise for them, it seems like mine's going really fast. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2080.08s)]
*  So years could elapse in my space station. My plants come and go. They die. I age faster. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2088.3199999999997s)]
*  I've got gray hair. And they're falling in and it's been minutes in their frame of reference. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2095.52s)]
*  Flowers and their little rocket ship haven't rotted. They don't have gray hair. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2101.52s)]
*  Their biological clocks have slowed down relative to ours. Eventually at the event horizon, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2107.12s)]
*  it's so extreme, it's so slow, it's as though their clocks have stopped altogether from my point of [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2113.52s)]
*  view. And that's to say that it's as though their time is completely rotated into my space. And this [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2119.28s)]
*  is connected with the idea that inside the black hole space and time have switched places. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2126.56s)]
*  So I might see them hover there for millennia. Other astronauts could be born on my space station. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2134.08s)]
*  Generations could be populated there watching this poor astronaut never fall in. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2142.4s)]
*  So basically the time almost comes to a standstill, but we still, they do fall in. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2149.12s)]
*  Right. They do fall in eventually. Now that's because they have some mass of their own. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2157.2s)]
*  So they're not a perfectly light particle. And so they deform the event horizon a little bit. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2162.24s)]
*  You will actually see the event horizon bobble and absorb the astronauts. So in some finite time, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2169.04s)]
*  the astronaut will actually fall in. So it's like this weird space-time bubble that we have around [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2176.24s)]
*  us. And then there's a very big space-time curvature bubble thing from the black hole. And [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  there's a nice swirly type situation going on. That's how you get sucked up. So if you're a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2189.52s)]
*  perfect infinitely small particle, you would just be- Take longer and longer. And probably just be [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2194.3999999999996s)]
*  stuck there or something. But no, there's quantum mechanics. Eventually you'll fall in. Any [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2200.4799999999996s)]
*  perturbation will only go one way. It's unstable in one direction, in one direction only. But [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2205.2s)]
*  it's really important to remember that from the point of view of the astronaut, not much time has [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2212.56s)]
*  passed at all. You just sail right across as far as you're concerned and nothing dramatic happens. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2218.08s)]
*  Or you might not even realize you've come to the event horizon. You might not even realize you've [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2223.8399999999997s)]
*  crossed the event horizon because there's nothing there. This is an empty region of space-time. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2228.88s)]
*  There's no marker to tell you you've reached this very dangerous point of no return. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2235.92s)]
*  You can fire your rockets like hell when you're on the outside and maybe even escape. But once [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2241.12s)]
*  you get to that point, there's no amount of energy. All the energy in the universe will not save you [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2247.44s)]
*  from this demise. There's different size black holes. And maybe can we talk about the experience [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2253.44s)]
*  that you have falling into a black hole, depending on what the size of the black hole is? Because [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2261.12s)]
*  as I understand, the bigger it is, the less drastic the experience of falling into it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2266.32s)]
*  Yeah, that might surprise people. The bigger it is, the less noticeable it is that you've [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2275.92s)]
*  crossed the event horizon. One way to think about it is curvature is less noticeable [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2282.56s)]
*  the bigger it is. So if I'm standing on a basketball, I'm very aware I'm balancing on [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2288.72s)]
*  a curved surface. My two feet are in different locations and I really notice. But on the Earth, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2293.68s)]
*  you actually have to be kind of clever to deduce that the Earth is curved. The bigger the planet, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2299.84s)]
*  the less you're going to notice the curvature, the global curvature. And it's the same thing [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  with a black hole, huge, huge black hole. It just kind of feels like just flat. You don't really [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2310.64s)]
*  notice. I'm trying to figure out how the physics, because if you don't notice. And there's nothing [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  there. But the physics is weird. In your frame of reference. Well, so another cool thing. So I'd [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2320.7999999999997s)]
*  like to dispel this. Yeah. Do you need a minute? You're holding your head. There's a sense like [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2329.04s)]
*  you should be able to know when you're inside of a black hole when you've crossed the event horizon. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2337.52s)]
*  But no, from your frame of reference, you might not be able to know. Yeah, at first, at least you [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  might not realize what's happened. There are some hints. For instance, black holes are dark from the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2348.64s)]
*  outside, but they're not necessarily dark on the inside. So this is a kind of fascinating that your [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2354.7200000000003s)]
*  experience could be that it's quite bright inside the black hole because all the light from the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2363.36s)]
*  galaxy can be shining in behind you. And it's focusing down because you're all approaching [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2368.2400000000002s)]
*  this really focused region in the interior. And so you actually see a bright white flash of light [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2375.1200000000003s)]
*  as you approach the singularity. I kind of, I joke that it's a, it's like a near death experience. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2381.6s)]
*  We see the light at the end of the tunnel. So you would see millennia pass on earth. You could see [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  the evolution of the entire galaxy, you know, one big bright flash of light. So it's like a [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2392.64s)]
*  near death experience, but it's a definitely a total death experience. It goes pretty fast. But [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2398.56s)]
*  you looking out, you looking out, everything's going super fast. Yeah. The clocks on the earth, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2402.64s)]
*  on the space station seem to be progressing very rapidly relative to yours. The light can catch up [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  to you and you get this bright beam of light as you see the evolution of the galaxy unfold. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2416.96s)]
*  And I mean, it sort of depends on the size of the black hole and how long you have to hang around. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2424.08s)]
*  The bigger the black hole, the longer it takes you to expire in the center. Obviously the human [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  sensory system, we're not able to process that information correctly. Right. It would be a [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2437.04s)]
*  microsecond and then right there would be too fast. Yeah. But it would be, wow, it'd be so [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2441.92s)]
*  cool to get that information. But a big black hole, you could actually, you know, hang around for [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2446.88s)]
*  some months. So yeah, what's, how are small black holes or supermassive black holes formed? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2451.92s)]
*  Just so people would kind of load that in. Are they all, is it always a star? No. So this is [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2460.48s)]
*  also why it's important to think of black holes more abstractly. They are something very profound [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2468.32s)]
*  in the universe and there are probably multiple ways to make black holes. Making them with stars [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2474.96s)]
*  is most plentiful. There could be hundreds of millions, maybe even a billion black holes in our [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2481.92s)]
*  Milky Way galaxy alone. That many stars, it's only about 1% of stars that will [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2486.8s)]
*  end their lives in a death state that is a black hole. But we now see, and this was really quite a [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2492.64s)]
*  surprise, that there are supermassive black holes. They're billions or even hundreds of billions of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2500.4s)]
*  times the mass of the sun and millions to tens of billions, maybe even hundreds of billions. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2507.84s)]
*  So extremely massive. We don't think that the universe has had enough time to make them from [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2514.48s)]
*  stars that just merge. We know that two black holes can merge and make a bigger black hole, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2520.64s)]
*  and then those can merge and make a bigger black hole. We don't think there's been enough time for [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2526.88s)]
*  that. So it's suspected that they're formed very early, maybe even a hundred, a few hundred million [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2530.8s)]
*  years after the Big Bang, and that they're formed directly by collapsing out of primordial stuff. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2537.76s)]
*  That there's a direct collapse right into the black hole. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2545.4399999999996s)]
*  So like in the very early universe, these are primordial black holes from the stars, not quite [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2549.12s)]
*  weight. How do you get from that soup black holes right away? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. So it's odd, but it's weirdly easier to make a big black hole out of something that's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2561.2s)]
*  just the density of air, if it's really, really as big as what we're talking about. So in some sense, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  if they're just allowed to directly collapse very early in the universe's history, they can do that [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2573.68s)]
*  more easily. And it's so much so that we think that there's one of these supermassive black [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2578.64s)]
*  holes in the center of every galaxy. So they're not rare, and we know where they are. They're in [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2585.2s)]
*  the nuclei of galaxies. So they're bound to the very early formation of entire galaxies in a [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2590.96s)]
*  really surprising and deeply connected way. I wonder if the chicken or the egg, is it [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2598.64s)]
*  like how critical, how essential are the supermassive black holes to the formation of galaxies? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2605.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's ongoing, right? It's ongoing. Which came first, the black hole or the galaxy? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2610.96s)]
*  Probably big early stars, which were just made out of hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2617.52s)]
*  There wasn't anything else, not much of anything else. Those early stars were forming, and then [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2625.6s)]
*  maybe the black holes and kind of the galaxies were like these gassy clouds around them. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2631.28s)]
*  But there's probably a deep relationship between the black hole powering jets, these jets blowing [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2637.36s)]
*  material out of the galaxy that shaped galaxies, maybe kind of curbed their growth. And so I think [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2644.6400000000003s)]
*  the mechanisms are still ongoing, attempts to understand exactly the ordering of these things. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2653.92s)]
*  Can we get back to space-time? Just going back to the beginning of the 20th century, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2661.52s)]
*  how do you imagine space-time? How do we as human beings supposed to visualize and think about [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2666.56s)]
*  space-time where time is just another dimension in this 4D space that combines space and time? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2670.8s)]
*  Because we've been talking about morphing in all kinds of different ways, the curvature of space-time. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2678.16s)]
*  How do you, how are we supposed to conceive of it? How do you think of it? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2682.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  Time is just another dimension. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2687.36s)]
*  There are different ways we can think about it. We can imagine drawing a map of space and treating [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2689.2000000000003s)]
*  time as another direction in that map. But we're limited because as three-dimensional beings, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  we can't really draw four dimensions, which is what I'd require. Three spatial, because I'm pretty [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2703.76s)]
*  sure there's at least three. I think there's probably more, but I'm happy just talking about [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2708.8s)]
*  the large dimensions, the three we see up down, right? East-west, north-south, three spatial [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  dimensions. And time is the fourth. Nobody can really visualize it. But we know mathematically [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2723.52s)]
*  how to unpack it on paper. I can mathematically suppress one of the spatial dimensions and then [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  I can draw it pretty well. Now, the problem is that we'd call it a Euclidean space-time. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2738.64s)]
*  Euclidean space-time is when all the dimensions are orthogonal and are treated equally. Time is [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2744.56s)]
*  not another Euclidean dimension. It's actually a Minkowski in space-time. But it means that the [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2750.24s)]
*  space-time, we're misrepresenting it when we draw it, but we're misrepresenting it in a way that we [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2757.12s)]
*  deeply understand. I can give you an example. The Earth, I can project onto a flat sheet of paper. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2763.28s)]
*  I am now misrepresenting a map of the Earth. And I know that, but I understand the rules for how to [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2769.28s)]
*  add distances on this misrepresentation because the Earth is not a flat sheet of paper. It's a [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2775.52s)]
*  sphere. And as long as I understand the rules for how I get from the North Pole to the South Pole, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  that I'm moving along really a great arc and I understand that the distance is not the distance [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2787.92s)]
*  I would measure on a flat sheet of paper, then I can do a really great job with a map and understanding [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2793.28s)]
*  the rules of addition, multiplication, and the geometries, not the geometry of a flat sheet of [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2798.88s)]
*  paper. I can do the same thing with space-time. I can draw it on a flat sheet of paper, but I know [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2803.44s)]
*  that it's not actually a flat Euclidean space. And so my rules for measuring distances are different [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2808.08s)]
*  than the rules I would use that, for instance, Cartesian rules of geometry. I would know to use [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2815.44s)]
*  the correct rules from Minkowski space-time. And that will allow me to calculate how long [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2822.0s)]
*  time has elapsed, which is now a kind of a length, a space-time length on my map [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2830.96s)]
*  between two relative observers, and I will get the correct answer. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2838.6400000000003s)]
*  But only if I use these different rules. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2842.48s)]
*  So then what does, according to general relativity, does objects with mass do to the space-time? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2845.0400000000004s)]
*  Right, exactly. So Einstein struggled for this completely general theory, not a specific solution [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2853.36s)]
*  like a black hole or an expanding space-time or galaxies make lenses or those are all solutions. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2860.88s)]
*  That's why what he did was so enormous. It's an entire paradigm that says over here is matter [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2867.92s)]
*  and energy. I'm going to call that the right-hand side of the equation. Everything on the right-hand [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2874.48s)]
*  side of Einstein's equations is how matter and energy are distributed in space-time. On the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2880.4s)]
*  left-hand side tells you how space and time deform in response to that matter and energy. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2885.76s)]
*  And it can be impossible to solve some of those equations. What was so amazing about what [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2893.04s)]
*  Schwarzschild did is he found this very elegant simple solution within like a month of reading [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2898.24s)]
*  this final formulation. But Einstein didn't go through and try to find all the solutions. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2904.64s)]
*  He sort of gave it to us, right? He shared this and then lots of people since have been scrambling [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2909.84s)]
*  to try to, I can predict the curvature of the space-time if I tell you how the matter and energy [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2916.88s)]
*  is laid out. If it's all compact in a spherical system like a sun or even a black hole, I can [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2922.72s)]
*  understand the curves in the space-time around it. I can solve for the shape of the space-time. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2928.72s)]
*  I can also say, well, what if the universe is full of gas or light and it's all kind of uniform [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2934.72s)]
*  everywhere and I'll find a different equally surprising solution, which is that the universe [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2939.6s)]
*  would expand in response to that, that it's not static, that the distances between galaxies would [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2944.9599999999996s)]
*  grow. This was a huge surprise to Einstein. So all of these consequences of his theory [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2951.44s)]
*  came with revelations that were not at all obvious when he first wrote down the general theory. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2959.52s)]
*  And he was afraid to take the consequences of that theory seriously, which is a... [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2966.96s)]
*  Often. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2971.6s)]
*  The theory itself in its scope and grandeur and power is scary so I can understand. Then there's [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2972.2400000000002s)]
*  the edges of the theory where it falls apart, the consequences of the theory that are extreme. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2980.88s)]
*  It's hard to take seriously. So you can empathize. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2986.24s)]
*  Yeah. He very much resisted the expansion. So if you think about 1905 when he's writing [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2989.92s)]
*  these sequence of unbelievable papers as a 25-year-old who can't get a job as a physicist, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=2996.56s)]
*  and he writes all of these remarkable papers on relativity and quantum mechanics. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3002.16s)]
*  And then even in 1915, 16, he does not know that there are other galaxies out there. This was not [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3006.8s)]
*  known. People had mused about it. There were these smudges on the sky that people [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3013.6800000000003s)]
*  contemplated. What if there are other island universes? Going back to Kant thought about this. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3021.04s)]
*  But it wasn't until Hubble, it really wasn't until the late 20s, that it's confirmed that [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3026.0s)]
*  there are other galaxies. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3032.1600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3033.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3034.08s)]
*  And he didn't obviously... There's so much we think of now that he didn't think of. So [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3034.96s)]
*  there's no Big Bang, static universe. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3041.92s)]
*  Right. But these are all connected. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3045.12s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. So he's operating on very little information. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3047.28s)]
*  Very little information. That's absolutely true. Actually, one of the things I like to point out [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3052.4s)]
*  is the idea of relativity was foisted on people in this kind of cultural way. But there's many [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3057.68s)]
*  ways in which you could call it a theory of absolutism. And the way Einstein got there [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3064.64s)]
*  with so little information is by adhering to certain very strict absolutes, like the absolute [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3072.3199999999997s)]
*  limit of the speed of light and the absolute constancy of the speed of light, which was [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3080.16s)]
*  completely bizarre when it was first discovered, really. That was observed through experiments, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3086.0s)]
*  trying to figure out what would the relative speed of light be. It's the only... Really, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3092.64s)]
*  only massless particles have this property that they have an absolute speed. And if you think [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3100.3199999999997s)]
*  about it, it's incredibly strange. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3103.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's really strange. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3105.52s)]
*  Incredibly strange. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3106.3199999999997s)]
*  And then so from a theoretical perspective, he takes that seriously. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3107.04s)]
*  He takes it very seriously. And everyone else is trying to come up with models to make it go away, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3112.64s)]
*  to make the speed of light be a little bit more reasonable, like everything else in the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3118.56s)]
*  universe. If I run at a car, two cars coming at each other, they're coming at each other faster [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3122.16s)]
*  than if one of them stops. It's really a basic observation of reality, right? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3127.6s)]
*  Here, this is saying that if I'm racing at a light beam and you're standing still relative to the [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3132.08s)]
*  source, we'll measure the same exact speed of light. Very strange. And he gets to relativity [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3139.2799999999997s)]
*  by saying, well, what's speed? Speed is distance, it's space over time. It's how far you travel. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3145.44s)]
*  It's the space you travel in a certain duration of time. And he said, well, I bet something must [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3154.2400000000002s)]
*  be wrong then with space and time. So this is an enormous leap. He's willing to give up [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3158.88s)]
*  the absolute character of space and time in favor of keeping the speed of light constant. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3164.56s)]
*  How was he able to intuit a world of curved space-time? I think it's one of the most special [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3172.16s)]
*  leaps in human history, right? It's amazing. It's very, very, very difficult to make that kind of [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3182.16s)]
*  leap. I'll tell you, it took me, I think, a long time to... I can't say this is how he got there [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3192.16s)]
*  exactly. It's not as though I studied the historical accounts or his description of [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3198.64s)]
*  his internal states. This is more having learned the subject, how I try to tell people how to get [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3206.0s)]
*  there in a few short steps. One is to start with the equivalence principle, which he called the [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3213.04s)]
*  happiest thought of his life. The equivalence principle comes pretty early on in his thinking. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3219.12s)]
*  It starts with something like this. Like right now, I think I'm feeling gravity because I'm [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3228.72s)]
*  sitting in this chair and I feel the pressure of the chair and it's stopping me from falling and [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3233.44s)]
*  lie down in a bed and I feel heavy on the bed. And I think of that as gravity. And [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  Einstein has a beautiful ability to remove all of these extraneous factors, including atoms. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3242.64s)]
*  So let's imagine instead that you're in an elevator and you feel heavy on your feet [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3251.2799999999997s)]
*  because the floor of the elevator is resisting your fall. But I want to remove the elevator. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3256.48s)]
*  What does the elevator have to do with fundamental properties of gravity? So I cut the cable. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3261.68s)]
*  Now I'm falling, but the elevator is falling at the same rate as me. So now I'm floating [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3267.36s)]
*  in the elevator. And if this happened to me, if I woke up in this state of falling or floating in [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3273.6s)]
*  the elevator, I might not know if I was in empty space, just floating, or if I was falling around [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3280.0s)]
*  the earth. They're equivalent situations. I would not be able to tell the difference. I'm actually, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3286.64s)]
*  when I get rid of the elevator in this way by cutting the cable, I'm actually experiencing [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3293.36s)]
*  weightlessness. And that weightlessness is the purest experience of gravity. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3298.88s)]
*  And so this idea of falling is actually fundamental. It's how we talk about it all the time. The earth [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3304.96s)]
*  is in a free fall around the sun. It's actually falling. It's not firing engines. It's just [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
*  falling all the time, but it's just cruising so fast. So actually, yeah, oh God, you said somebody [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3316.96s)]
*  profound. So one of them is really one of the ways to experience space-time is to be falling. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3321.44s)]
*  To be falling. That is the purest experience of gravity. The experience of gravity, unfettered, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3329.92s)]
*  uninterrupted by atoms, is weightlessness. That observation, no, it has an unhappy ending, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3336.0s)]
*  the elevator story, because of atoms again. That's the fault of the atoms in your body [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3343.28s)]
*  interacting electromagnetically with the crust of the earth or the bottom of the building or whatever [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3349.2000000000003s)]
*  it is. But this period of free fall, so the first observation is that that is the purest [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3354.56s)]
*  experience of gravity. Now I can convince you that things fall along curved paths, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3360.16s)]
*  because I could take a pen and if I throw it, we both know it's going to follow an arc. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3364.72s)]
*  And it's going to follow an arc until atoms interfere again and it hits the ground. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3372.16s)]
*  But while it's in free fall, experiencing gravity at its purest, it's going to follow [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3376.7999999999997s)]
*  an arc until atoms interfere again and it hits the ground. So it's experiencing gravity at its [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3382.8s)]
*  purest. What the Einsteinian description would say is it is following the natural curve in space-time [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  inscribed by the earth. So the earth's mass and shape curves the paths in space and then those [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3396.96s)]
*  curves are going to follow the earth. So the earth has found itself on a free fall that happens to [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3406.48s)]
*  be a closed circle, but it's actually falling. The International Space Station uses this principle [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3414.0s)]
*  all the time. They get the space station up there and then they turn off the engines. Can you imagine [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3419.76s)]
*  how expensive it would be if they had to fuel that thing at all times? They turn off the engines. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3424.0s)]
*  They're just falling. And they're not that far up. There are certainly people sometimes say, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3429.12s)]
*  oh, they're so far away they don't feel gravity. Oh, absolutely. If you stopped the space station, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3435.76s)]
*  it's going like 17,500 miles an hour, something like that. If you were to stop that, it would [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3440.5600000000004s)]
*  drop like a stone right to the earth. So they're in a state of constant free fall and they're [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3447.84s)]
*  falling along a curved path. And that curved path is a result of curving space-time. And that [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3453.84s)]
*  particular curved path is calculated in such a way that it curves onto itself so you're orbiting. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3460.1600000000003s)]
*  It has to be cruising at a certain speed. So once you get it at that cruising speed, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3465.7599999999998s)]
*  you turn off the engines. But yeah, to be able to visualize at the beginning of the 20th century [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3470.8799999999997s)]
*  that free falling in curved space-time, boy, the human mind is capable of things. I mean, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3478.3999999999996s)]
*  some of that is constructing thought experiments that collide with our understanding of reality. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3490.0s)]
*  Maybe in the collisions and the contradictions, you try to think of extreme thought experiments [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3498.0s)]
*  that exacerbate that contradiction and see like, okay, what is actually, is there another model [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3504.88s)]
*  that can incorporate this? But to be able to do that, I mean, it's kind of inspiring because [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3510.96s)]
*  there's probably another general relativity out there. Not just in physics, in all lines of work, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3516.48s)]
*  in all scientific pursuits, there's certain theories where you're like, okay, I just explained [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3523.84s)]
*  like a big elephant in the room here that everybody just kind of didn't even think about. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3531.36s)]
*  There could be, for stuff we know about in physics, there could be stuff like that for [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3537.12s)]
*  the origin of life on earth. Everyone's like, yeah, okay. Everyone's like in polite company, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3543.36s)]
*  it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Somehow it started. Nobody knows. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3548.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. I find it wild that that's so elusive. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3555.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's strange. In the lab, you can't replicate. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3557.6800000000003s)]
*  It's strange that it's so elusive. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3560.0s)]
*  I think it's a general relativity thing. There's going to be some thing, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3561.2000000000003s)]
*  it's going to involve aliens in warm holes and dimensions that we don't quite understand, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3564.7200000000003s)]
*  or some field that's bigger than, it's possible, maybe not. It's possible that it's a field [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3569.68s)]
*  that will feel fundamentally different from chemistry and biology. It'll be maybe through [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3577.7599999999998s)]
*  physics. Again, maybe the key to the origin of life is in physics. And the same there, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3583.44s)]
*  it's like a weird neighbor, is consciousness. It's like, all right. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3588.56s)]
*  A weird neighbor, yeah. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3592.8799999999997s)]
*  Nobody knows how. We all know that we're conscious. We have a subjective experience of things. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3594.4s)]
*  Nobody understands that. The people have ideas and so on. But it's such a dark, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3601.84s)]
*  sort of we're entering a dark room where a bunch of people are whispering about like, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3608.88s)]
*  hey, what's in this room? But nobody understands that. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3613.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3617.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3617.76s)]
*  We're entering a dark room where a bunch of people are whispering about like, hey, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3618.4s)]
*  what's in this room? But nobody has a effing clue. And then somebody comes along with a [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3622.48s)]
*  general relativity kind of conception where it reconceives everything. And you're like, ah. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3629.04s)]
*  It's like a watershed moment. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3634.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3636.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3636.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And it's there. And until- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3637.6000000000004s)]
*  It's there. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3639.04s)]
*  We're living in a time until that theory comes along. It'll be obvious in retrospect, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3639.44s)]
*  right now where- [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3646.0s)]
*  Right. Well, this, it was obvious to no one that space time was curved, but [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3647.28s)]
*  even Newton understood something wasn't right. So he knew there was something missing. And I think [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3653.84s)]
*  that's always fascinating when we're in a situation where we're pressure testing our own ideas. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3660.56s)]
*  He did something remarkable, Newton did with his theory of gravity, just understanding that the [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3667.28s)]
*  same phenomenon was at work with the earth around the sun as the apple falling from the tree. That's [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3673.04s)]
*  insane. That's a huge leap. Understanding that mass, inertial mass, what makes something hard [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3678.88s)]
*  to push around is the same thing that feels gravity, at least in the Newtonian picture, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3684.48s)]
*  in that simple way. Unbelievable leap. Absolutely genius. But he didn't like [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3690.08s)]
*  that the apple fell from the tree, even though the earth wasn't touching it. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3697.12s)]
*  Yeah. The action, the distance thing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3701.6s)]
*  The action at a distance thing. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3703.36s)]
*  That is weird too. That is a really weird one. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3704.64s)]
*  It's really weird. But see, Einstein solves that. Relativity solves that. Because it says [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3708.0s)]
*  the earth created the curve in space. The apple wants to fall freely along it. The problem is [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3715.68s)]
*  the tree's in the way. The tree's the problem. The tree's actually accelerating the apple. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3721.84s)]
*  It's keeping it away from its natural state of weightlessness in a gravitational field. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3727.68s)]
*  As soon as the tree lets go of it, the apple will simply fall along the curve that exists. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3732.96s)]
*  I would love it if somebody went back to Newton's time. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3738.3199999999997s)]
*  And told him all this? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3741.6s)]
*  Probably some hippie would be like, gravity is just the curvature in space time, man. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3742.48s)]
*  I wonder if he would be able to... I don't think... Every idea has its time. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3749.9199999999996s)]
*  He might not even be able to load that in. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3755.2s)]
*  Sometimes even the greatest geniuses, you can't. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3761.4399999999996s)]
*  It's too out of context. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3763.9199999999996s)]
*  You need to be standing on the shoulders of giants and on the shoulders of those giants and so on. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3766.72s)]
*  I heard that Newton used that as an unkind remark to his competitor hook. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3771.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh no. The people talk shit even back then. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3776.72s)]
*  You're trash talking. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3780.4799999999996s)]
*  I love it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3781.68s)]
*  It's one of the hilarious things about humans in general, but scientists too, like these huge minds. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3784.3199999999997s)]
*  There's these moments in history where you'll see this in universities, but everywhere else too. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3791.2799999999997s)]
*  You have gigantic minds, obviously, also coupled with everybody has an ego. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3798.64s)]
*  Sometimes it's just the same soap opera that played out amongst humans everywhere else. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3804.72s)]
*  So you're thinking about the biggest cosmological objects and forces and ideas, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3811.2s)]
*  and you're still jealous. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3816.72s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3820.08s)]

*  I know. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3822.64s)]
*  This chair, this... Or maybe you got married to this person that I was always in love with. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3823.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3831.3599999999997s)]
*  There's a betrayal or something. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3831.6s)]
*  The one woman in the department. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3833.04s)]
*  The one woman in the department. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3834.16s)]
*  Yeah. But that is also the fuel of innovation, that jealousy, that tension. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3836.32s)]
*  You know the expression. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3843.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure the battles are so bitter in academia because the stakes are so low. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3844.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a beautiful way to phrase it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3848.32s)]
*  But also we shouldn't forget that I love seeing that even in academia because it's humanity. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3850.7200000000003s)]
*  There is a degree to academia where the reason you're able to think about some of these grand [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3859.36s)]
*  ideas is because you still allow yourself to be childlike. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3864.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3868.96s)]
*  There's a childlike nature to be asking the question. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3869.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3872.1600000000003s)]
*  Children can also be like... [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3872.56s)]
*  Children. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3874.88s)]
*  Children. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3875.36s)]
*  So like you don't... I think when in a corporate context and maybe the world forces you to behave, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3877.04s)]
*  you're supposed to be a certain kind of way, there's some aspects and it's a really beautiful [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3884.7200000000003s)]
*  aspect to preserve and to celebrate in academia is like you're just allowed to be childlike in [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3889.2s)]
*  your curiosity and your exploration. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3897.2799999999997s)]
*  You're just exploring, asking the biggest questions. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3899.7599999999998s)]
*  The best scientists I know often ask the simplest questions. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3903.2799999999997s)]
*  They're really... First of all, there's probably some confidence there. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3908.16s)]
*  But also they're never going to lie to themselves that they understand something that they don't [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3913.36s)]
*  understand. So even this idea that Newton didn't understand the apple falling from the tree, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3919.92s)]
*  had he lived another couple hundred of years, he would have invented relativity because he [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3926.48s)]
*  never would have lied to himself that he understood it. He would have kept asking this very simple [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3930.96s)]
*  question. And I think that there is this childlike beauty to that. Absolutely. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3935.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Just some of the topics. I don't know why I'm stuck to those two topics of origin of life [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3942.32s)]
*  and consciousness. But there's some of the most brilliant people I know are stuck just like with [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3946.48s)]
*  Newton and Einstein. They're stuck on that. This doesn't make sense. I know a bunch of brilliant [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3952.4s)]
*  biologists, physicists, chemists that are thinking about the origin of life. They're like, this [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3957.36s)]
*  doesn't... I know how evolution works. I know how the biological systems work, how genetic [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3960.96s)]
*  information propagates. But this part, the singularity at the beginning doesn't make sense. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3967.6s)]
*  We don't understand. We can't create it in a lab. Every single day they're bothered by it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3972.56s)]
*  And that being bothered by that tension, by that gap in knowledge is... Yeah, that's the catalyst. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3979.44s)]
*  That's the fuel for the discovery. Yeah, absolutely. The discovery is going to come [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3985.92s)]
*  because somebody couldn't sleep at night and couldn't rest. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3992.56s)]
*  So in that way, I think black holes are a portal into some of the biggest mysteries of our [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=3997.52s)]
*  universe. So it's a good terrain I wish to explore these ideas. So can you speak about some of the [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4003.12s)]
*  mysteries that the black holes present us with? Yeah, I think it's important to separate the [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4009.84s)]
*  idea that there are these astrophysical states that become black holes from being synonymous [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4017.28s)]
*  with black holes because black holes are kind of this larger idea and they might have been made [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4024.8s)]
*  primordially when the Big Bang happened. And there's something flawless about black holes [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4031.6800000000003s)]
*  that makes them fundamental unlike anything else. So they're flawless in the sense that [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4039.2s)]
*  you can completely understand a black hole by looking at just its charge, electric charge, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4047.04s)]
*  its mass, and its spin. And every black hole with that charge, mass, and spin is identical [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4051.9199999999996s)]
*  to every other black hole. You can't be like, oh, that one's mine. I recognize it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4058.16s)]
*  It has this little feature and that's how I know it's mine. They're featureless. You try to put [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4062.8799999999997s)]
*  Mount Everest on a black hole and it will shake it off in these gravitational waves. It will radiate [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4068.56s)]
*  away this imperfection until it settles down to be a perfect black hole again. So there's something [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4074.4s)]
*  about them that is unlike, and another reason why I don't like to call them objects in a traditional [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4082.0s)]
*  sense, unlike anything else in the universe that's macroscopic. It's kind of a little bit more like a [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4086.64s)]
*  fundamental particle. So an electron is described by a certain short list of properties, charge, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4092.96s)]
*  mass, spin, maybe some other quantum numbers. That's what it means to be an electron. There's [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4100.0s)]
*  no electron that's a little bit different. You can't recognize your electron. They're all [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4106.8s)]
*  identical in that sense. And so in some very abstract way, black holes share something in [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4111.76s)]
*  common with microscopic fundamental particles. And so what they tell us about the fundamental laws [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4119.44s)]
*  of physics can be very profound. And it's why even theoretical physicists, mathematical physicists, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4128.16s)]
*  not just astronomers who use telescopes, they rely on the black hole as a terrain to perform [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4137.839999999999s)]
*  their thought experiments. And it's because there's something fundamental about them. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4145.36s)]
*  Yeah. General relativity means quantum mechanics, means singularity. And sadly, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4151.36s)]
*  heartbreakingly so, it's out of reach for experiment at this moment, but within reach for theoretical. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4157.759999999999s)]
*  It's in reach for thought experiments. Which are quite beautiful. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4164.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, on that topic, I have to ask you about the paradox, the information paradox of black [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4169.44s)]
*  holes. What is it? So this is what catapulted Hawking's fame. When he was a young researcher, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  he was thinking about black holes and wanted to just add a little smidge of quantum mechanics, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4184.24s)]
*  just a little smidge. You know, I wasn't going for full blown quantum gravity, but kind of just asking, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  well, what if I allowed this nothing, this vacuum, this empty space around the event horizon, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4197.12s)]
*  the star is gone, there's nothing there. What if I allowed it to possess sort of ordinary quantum [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4204.8s)]
*  properties, just a little tiny bit, you know, nothing dramatic. Don't go crazy. And one of the [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4209.599999999999s)]
*  properties of the vacuum that is intriguing is this idea that you can never see the vacuum is [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4216.24s)]
*  actually completely empty. We talked about Heisenberg, you know, the Heisenberg uncertainty [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4223.76s)]
*  principle really kicked off a lot of quantum mechanical thinking. It says that you can never [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4228.24s)]
*  exactly know a particle's position simultaneously with its motion, with its momentum. You can know [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4232.400000000001s)]
*  one or the other pretty precisely, but not both precisely. And the uncertainty isn't a lack of [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4238.96s)]
*  ability that will technologically overcome. It's foundational. So in some sense, when it's in a [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4245.2s)]
*  precise location, it is fundamentally no longer in a precise motion. And that uncertainty principle [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4250.72s)]
*  means I can't precisely say a particle is exactly here, but it also means I can't say it's not. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4256.96s)]
*  Okay. And so it led to this idea that what do I mean by a vacuum? Because I can't 100% precisely [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4263.76s)]
*  know. In fact, there's not really meaningful to say that there's zero particles here. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4272.0s)]
*  And so what you can say, however, is you can say, well, maybe particles kind of froth around in this [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4277.68s)]
*  seething quantum sea of the vacuum. Maybe two particles come into existence and they're [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4284.24s)]
*  entangled in such a way that they cancel out each other's properties. So they have the properties of [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4291.52s)]
*  the vacuum. They don't destroy the kind of properties of the vacuum because they cancel [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4297.6s)]
*  out each other's spin, maybe each other's charge, maybe things like that. But they kind of froth [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4303.44s)]
*  around. They come, they go, they come, they go. And that's what we really think is the best that [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4308.48s)]
*  empty space can do in a quantum mechanical universe. Now, if you add an event horizon, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4313.919999999999s)]
*  which as we said is really fundamentally what a black hole is, that's the most important [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4319.36s)]
*  feature of a black hole. The event horizon, if the particles are created slightly on either side of [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4325.28s)]
*  that event horizon, now you have a real problem. Okay. Now the pair has been separated by this [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4333.28s)]
*  event horizon. Now they can both fall in, that's okay. But if one falls in and the other doesn't, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4340.719999999999s)]
*  it's stuck. It can't go back into the vacuum because now it has a charge or it has a spin [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  or it has something. It's no longer the property of that vacuum it came from. It needs its pair to [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4353.759999999999s)]
*  disappear. Now it's stuck. It exists. It's like you've made it real. So in a sense, the black hole [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4359.04s)]
*  steals one of these virtual particles and forces the other to live. And if it'll escape, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4366.32s)]
*  radiate out to infinity and look like to an observer far away that the black hole is actually [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4376.16s)]
*  radiated a particle. Now the particle did not emanate from inside. It came from the vacuum. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4383.52s)]
*  It stole it from empty space, from the nothingness that is the black hole. Now the reason why this is [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4388.96s)]
*  very tricky is because in the process, because of the separation on either side of the event horizon, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4395.68s)]
*  the particle it absorbs, it has to do with the switching of space and time that we talked about. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4402.96s)]
*  But the particle it absorbs, well, from the outside you might say, oh, it had negative [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4408.0s)]
*  momentum. It was falling in from the inside. You say, well, this is actually motion and time. This [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4412.16s)]
*  is energy. It has negative energy. And it absorbs negative energy. Its mass goes down. Black hole [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4416.48s)]
*  gets a little lighter. And as it continues to do this, the black hole really begins to evaporate. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4423.44s)]
*  It does more than just radiate. It evaporates away. And it's intriguing because Hawking said, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4429.76s)]
*  look, this is going to look thermal, meaning featureless. It's going to have no information [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4438.64s)]
*  in it. It's going to be the most informationless possibility you could possibly come up with when [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4443.92s)]
*  you're radiating particles. It's just going to look like a thermal distribution of particles, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4448.56s)]
*  like a hot body. And the temperature is going to only tell you about the mass, which you could [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4452.08s)]
*  tell from outside the black hole anyway. You know the mass of the black hole from the outside. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4457.200000000001s)]
*  So it's not telling you anything about the black hole. It's got no information about the black hole. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4461.04s)]
*  Now you have a real problem. And when he first said it, a lot of people describe [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4465.68s)]
*  that not everyone understood how really naughty he was being. He did. But some people who love [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4469.84s)]
*  quantum mechanics were really annoyed. People like Lenny Suskind, George Atouft, Nobel Prize winner, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4479.04s)]
*  they were mad because it suggested something was fundamentally wrong with quantum mechanics, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4486.400000000001s)]
*  if it was right. And the reason why it says there's something fundamentally wrong with [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4491.28s)]
*  quantum mechanics is because quantum mechanics does not allow this. It does not allow [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4495.599999999999s)]
*  quantum information to simply evaporate away and poof out of the universe and cease to exist. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4500.4s)]
*  It's a violation of something called unitarity. But really the idea is it's the loss of quantum [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4507.44s)]
*  information that's intolerable. Quantum mechanics was built to preserve information. It's one of the [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4512.08s)]
*  sacred principles. As sacred as conservation of energy. In this example, more sacred [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4516.88s)]
*  because you can violate conservation of energy with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle a little [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4522.16s)]
*  tiny bit. But so sacred that it created what became coined as the black hole wars where people [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4525.84s)]
*  were saying, look, general relativity is wrong. Something's wrong with our thinking about the [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4535.36s)]
*  event horizon or quantum mechanics isn't what we think it is. But the two are not getting along [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4540.72s)]
*  anymore. And just to tell you how dramatic it is. So the temperature goes down with the mass of the [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4547.68s)]
*  black hole, heavier black hole, the cooler it is. So we don't see black holes evaporate. They're [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4553.04s)]
*  way too big. But as they get smaller and smaller, they get hotter and hotter. So as the black hole [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4558.400000000001s)]
*  nears the end of this cycle of evaporating away, it takes a very long time, much longer [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4564.4800000000005s)]
*  than the age of the universe. It will be as though the curtain, the event horizon is yanked up. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4569.36s)]
*  Like it'll literally explode away. Just boom. And the event horizon in principle would be yanked up. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4574.400000000001s)]
*  Everything's gone. All that information that went into the black hole, all that sacred quantum stuff, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4582.32s)]
*  gone. Poof. Okay. Because it's not in the radiation. Because the radiation has no information. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4587.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And so it was an incredibly productive debate. Because in it are the signs of what will [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4592.4s)]
*  make gravity and quantum mechanics play nice together. Some quantum theory of gravity. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4604.0s)]
*  Whatever these clues are, and they're hard to assemble. If you want a quantum gravity theory, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4610.08s)]
*  it has to correctly predict the temperature of a black hole, the entropy of a black hole. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4615.2s)]
*  It has to have all of these correct features. The black hole is the place [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4619.68s)]
*  on which we can test quantum gravity. But it still has not been resolved. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4623.92s)]
*  It has not been fully resolved. I looked up all the different ideas for the resolution. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4627.84s)]
*  So there's the information loss, which is what you refer to. It's perhaps the simplest, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4632.08s)]
*  yes, most radical resolution is that information is truly lost. This would mean quantum mechanics, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4637.12s)]
*  as we currently understand it specifically, unitarity is incomplete or incorrect under [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4642.96s)]
*  these extreme gravitational conditions. I'm unhappy with that. I would not be happy [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4647.76s)]
*  with information loss. I love that it's telling us that there's this crisis, because I do think [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4651.6s)]
*  it's giving us the clues. And we have to take them seriously. For you, the gut is like... [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4656.400000000001s)]
*  Unitarity is going to be preserved. Preserved. The quantum mechanics is holding strong. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4662.8s)]
*  We have to come to the rescue. Lenny Suskind, in his book, Black Hole Wars, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4666.64s)]
*  says his subtitle is, My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4670.8s)]
*  Quantum mechanics. I love it. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4676.88s)]
*  Something to that effect. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4678.08s)]
*  So then from string theory, one of the resolutions is called Fuzzballs. I love physics so much. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4679.28s)]
*  Originating from string theory, this proposal suggests that black holes aren't singularities [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4684.639999999999s)]
*  surrounded by empty space and an event horizon. Instead, they are horizonless, complex, tangled [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4689.28s)]
*  objects, aka fuzzballs, made of strings and brains roughly the size of the would-be event horizon. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4695.28s)]
*  There's no single point of infinite density and no true horizon to cross. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4702.32s)]
*  In some sense, it says there's no interior to the black hole, nothing of a cross. So I gave you this [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4706.48s)]
*  very nice story that there's no drama. Sometimes that's how it's described at the event horizon, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4710.4s)]
*  and you fall through and there's nothing there. This other idea says, well, hold on a second, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4714.48s)]
*  if it's really strings, as I get close to this magnifying quality and slowing time down near [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4720.0s)]
*  the event horizon, it is as though I put a magnifying glass on things and now the strings [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4726.48s)]
*  aren't so microscopic, they kind of smear around, and then they get caught like a tangle [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4730.8s)]
*  around the event horizon and they just actually never fall through. I don't think that either, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4736.0s)]
*  but it was interesting. So it's just adding a very large number of extra complex degrees of freedom. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4741.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. There are no teeny tiny marbles to fall through. But it's similar to what we already [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4748.88s)]
*  have with quantum mechanics. It's just giving a deeper, more complicated- It's really saying [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4753.28s)]
*  the interior's just not there ever, nothing falls in. So the information gets out because [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4757.44s)]
*  it never went in in the first place. Oh, interesting. So there is a strong statement [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4761.2s)]
*  there. There's a strong statement there, yeah. Okay. Soft hair challenges the classical no hair [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4764.16s)]
*  theorem by suggesting that black holes do possess subtle quantum quote hair. This isn't classical [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4768.799999999999s)]
*  hair like charge, but very low energy quantum excitations, soft gravitons or photons at the [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4775.04s)]
*  event horizon that can store information about what fell in. Worth trying, but I also don't think [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4782.4s)]
*  that that's the case. So the no hair theorems are formal proofs that the black hole is this [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4789.12s)]
*  featureless perfect fundamental particle that we talked about, that all you can ever tell about [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4799.12s)]
*  the black hole is its electrical charge, its mass and its spin, and that it cannot possess other [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4803.2s)]
*  features. It has no hair is one way of describing it. And those are mathematical proofs in the [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4809.6s)]
*  context of general relativity. So the idea is, well, therefore I can know nothing about what [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4815.52s)]
*  goes into the black hole, so the information is lost. But if they could have hair, I could say [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4819.68s)]
*  that's my black hole because it'd have features that I could distinguish and it could encode the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4824.320000000001s)]
*  information that went in in this way. And the event horizon isn't so serious, isn't such a stark [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4829.52s)]
*  demarcation between events inside and outside where I can't know what happened inside or outside. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4834.240000000001s)]
*  I don't think that's the resolution either, but it was worth a try. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4840.56s)]
*  Okay, the pros and cons of that one. The pros, it works within the framework of [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4843.04s)]
*  quantum field theory incurred space-time, potentially requiring less radical [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4847.360000000001s)]
*  modifications than fuzzballs or information loss. Recent work by Hawking, Perry, Stromminger [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4850.72s)]
*  revitalizes this idea. The cons is that the precise mechanism by which information is encoded and [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4856.64s)]
*  transferred to the radiation is still debated and technically challenging to work out fully. And indeed, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4861.84s)]
*  it needs to store a vast amount of information. Okay, another one, this is a weird one, boy, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4867.360000000001s)]
*  is er equals EPR. This is probably it, though. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4873.92s)]
*  Oh, boy. So er equals EPR is Einstein-Rosen bridge equals Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen bridge posits a deep [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4877.6s)]
*  connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry, specifically Einstein-Rosen [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4886.56s)]
*  bridge, commonly known as wormholes. It suggests that entangled particles are connected by a [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4893.36s)]
*  non-traversable wormhole, so tiny wormholes connected. Okay. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4899.2s)]
*  I can say that this is not a situation we can follow the chalk. We can't start at the [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4904.32s)]
*  beginning and calculate to the end. So it's still a conjecture. I think it's very profound, though. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4910.48s)]
*  I kind of imagine Juan Maldicena, who's part of this with Lenny Suskin, they were kind of like, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4918.08s)]
*  it's like er equals EPR. They couldn't even formulate it properly. It was like an intuition [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4923.599999999999s)]
*  that they had kind of landed on and now are trying to formalize. But to take a step back, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4928.24s)]
*  one way of thinking about er equals EPR, you have to talk about holography first. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4934.72s)]
*  And holography, both Juan Maldicena really formalized it, Lenny Suskin suggested it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4939.5199999999995s)]
*  The idea of a black hole hologram is that all of the information in the black hole, whatever it is, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4944.48s)]
*  whatever entropy as a measure of information, whatever the entropy of the black hole is, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4950.0s)]
*  which is telling you how much information is hidden in there, how much information [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4955.12s)]
*  you don't have direct access to in some sense, is completely encoded in the area of the black hole. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4958.08s)]
*  Meaning as the area grows, the entropy grows. It does not grow as a volume. This actually turns [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4965.36s)]
*  out to be really, really important. If I tried to pack a lot of information into a volume, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4971.84s)]
*  more information than I could pack, let's say, on the surface of a black hole, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4978.56s)]
*  I would simply make a black hole and I would find out, oh, I can't have more information than I can [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4982.0s)]
*  fit on the surface. So Lenny coined this a hologram. People who take it very seriously say, well, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4987.6s)]
*  again, maybe the interior of the black hole just doesn't exist. It's a holographic projection [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4993.68s)]
*  of this two-dimensional surface. In fact, maybe I should take it all the way and say, so are we. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=4998.16s)]
*  The whole universe is a holographic projection of a lower dimensional surface. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5003.28s)]
*  People have struggled, nobody's really landed it, to find a universe version of it. Oh, maybe there's [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5008.8s)]
*  a boundary to the universe where all the information is encoded and this entire three-dimensional [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5014.48s)]
*  reality is so compelling and so convincing is actually just a holographic projection. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5020.08s)]
*  Juan Maldicena did something absolutely brilliant. It's the most highly cited paper in the history [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5025.44s)]
*  of physics. It was published in the late 90s. It has a very opaque title that would not lead you to [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5030.4s)]
*  believe it's as revelatory as it is, but he was able to show that a universe like in a box [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5037.36s)]
*  with gravity in it, it's not the same universe we observed, doesn't matter. It's just a hypothetical [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5044.88s)]
*  called an anti-dissider space. This universe in a box, it has gravity, it has black holes, it has [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5049.2s)]
*  everything gravity can do in it. On its boundary is a theory with no gravity, a universe that can [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5053.36s)]
*  be described with no gravity at all, so no black holes and no information loss problem, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5061.92s)]
*  and they're equivalent. That the interior universe in a box is a holographic projection [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5068.64s)]
*  of this quantum mechanics on the boundary. Pure quantum mechanics, purely unitary, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5076.08s)]
*  no loss of information. None of this stuff could possibly be true. There can't be loss of information [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5081.92s)]
*  if this dictionary really works, if the interior is a hologram, a projection of the boundary. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5088.8s)]
*  I know that's a lot. Yeah. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5096.0s)]
*  There's some mathematics there, there's physics, and then there's trying to [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5100.32s)]
*  conceive of what that actually means practically for us. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5103.76s)]
*  Well, what it would mean for us is that information can't be lost even if we don't know how to show it [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5107.76s)]
*  in the description in which there are black holes. It means it can't possibly be lost [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5114.8s)]
*  because it's equivalent to this description with no gravity in it at all, no event horizons, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5119.28s)]
*  no black holes, just quantum mechanics. It really strongly suggested that quantum mechanics was [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5126.88s)]
*  going to win in this battle, but it didn't show exactly how it was going to win. Then comes ER [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5135.12s)]
*  equals EPR, a visual way to imagine what this means. ER has to do with little wormholes. EPR, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5141.2s)]
*  Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen has to do with quantum entanglement. The idea was, well, maybe the stuff [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5149.04s)]
*  that's interior to the black hole is quantum entangled like EPR, quantum entangled with the [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5155.2s)]
*  Hawking radiation outside the black hole that's escaping. That quantum entanglement is what [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5163.44s)]
*  allows you to extract the information because it's not actually physically moving from the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5169.28s)]
*  interior to the exterior. It's just subtle quantum entanglement. In fact, I can kind of think of [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5174.5599999999995s)]
*  the entire black hole. If I look at it, it looks like a solid shadow cast on the sky, some region [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5181.759999999999s)]
*  of space time. If I look at it very closely, I will see, oh no, it's actually sewn from these [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5188.08s)]
*  quantum wormholes like embroidered. When I get up close, it's almost as though the event horizon [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5194.16s)]
*  isn't the fundamental feature on the space time. The fundamental feature is the quantum entanglement [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5204.24s)]
*  embroidering the event horizon. The embroidering is just tiny wormholes. The quantum entanglement [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5211.76s)]
*  is when two particles are connected at arbitrary distances. They're connected by a wormhole. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5219.04s)]
*  In this case, they would be connected by a wormhole. The reason why that's helpful, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5226.24s)]
*  it helps you connect the interior to the exterior without trying to pass through the event horizon. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5231.2s)]
*  The cons of this theory is highly conceptual and abstract. The exact mechanism for information [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5238.16s)]
*  retrieval via these non-traversable wormholes is not fully understood, primarily explored in [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5245.28s)]
*  theoretical toy models. Whoa, Jim and I are going hard. Theoretical toy models like the [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5252.24s)]
*  Antidissidus Space-Time rather than realistic black holes. True. We do what we can do in baby steps. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5259.76s)]
*  Another idea to resolve the information paradox is Firewalls proposed by Amiri Marov, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5270.0s)]
*  Polchinsky, and Sully. Amps. This is a more drastic scenario arising from analyzing the [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5278.0s)]
*  entanglement requirements of Hawking radiation to preserve unitarity and avoid information loss. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5284.16s)]
*  They argued that the entanglement structure requires the event horizon not to be smooth, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5290.48s)]
*  not to be the smooth and remarkable place predicted by general relativity, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5296.72s)]
*  the equivalence principle. Instead, it must be a highly energetic region, a quote, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5300.5599999999995s)]
*  firewall that incinerates anything attempting to cross it. Okay, so yeah, that's a nice solution. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5306.24s)]
*  Just destroy everything that crosses this. Do you find this at all a convincing resolution [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5312.16s)]
*  to the information firewall? I would say the firewall papers were fascinating and were very [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5318.32s)]
*  provocative and very important in making progress. I don't even think the authors of those papers [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5323.6s)]
*  thought firewalls were real. I think they were saying, look, we've been brushing too much under [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5327.92s)]
*  the rug. And if you look at the evaporation process, it's even worse than what you thought [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5333.200000000001s)]
*  previously. It's so bad that I can't get away with some of these prior solutions that I thought I [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5340.08s)]
*  could get away with. There was a kind of duality idea or a complementarity idea that, oh, well, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5345.52s)]
*  maybe one person thinks they fell in and one person thinks they never fell in, and that's okay. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5350.96s)]
*  No big deal. They exposed flaws in these kind of approaches, and it actually reinvigorated the [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5356.16s)]
*  campaign to find a solution. So it stopped it from stalling. I don't think anyone really believes [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5363.68s)]
*  at the event horizon you'll find a firewall. But it did lead to things like the entangled wormholes [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5371.04s)]
*  embroidering a black hole, which was born out of an attempt to address the concerns that AMPS raised. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5377.6s)]
*  So it did lead to progress. So for you, the resolution would- [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5388.0s)]
*  I'm going back to the vacuum, the empty space, the beautiful event horizon. I'll give up locality, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5392.4800000000005s)]
*  meaning that I will allow things to be connected non-locally by a wormhole. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5402.48s)]
*  So that is the weirdest thing you're willing to allow for, which is arbitrary distance connection [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5408.4s)]
*  of particles through a wormhole. But quantum mechanics must be preserved. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5414.799999999999s)]
*  I'll entertain pretty weird things, but I think that's the one that sounds promising. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5418.799999999999s)]
*  The implications are so dramatic because this is why you start to hear things like, wait a minute, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5425.12s)]
*  if the event horizon only exists when it's sewn out of these quantum threads, does that mean that [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5430.4s)]
*  gravity is fundamentally quantum mechanics? Not that gravity and quantum mechanics get along, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5436.32s)]
*  and I have a quantum gravity theory, and I now know how to quantize gravity. Actually, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5441.92s)]
*  something much more dramatic. Gravity is just kind of emerging from this quantum description, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5445.28s)]
*  that gravity isn't fundamental. And what is the only thing that we have when we go rock bottom, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5451.759999999999s)]
*  when we go deeper and deeper, smaller and smaller, is quantum mechanics. So all of this, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5459.2s)]
*  space-time looks nice and smooth and continuous, but if I look at the quantum realm, I'll see [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5464.72s)]
*  everything sewn together out of quantum threads. And that space-time is not a smooth continuum all [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5469.76s)]
*  the way down. Now, people already thought that, but they thought it kind of came in chunks of [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5477.28s)]
*  space-time. Instead, maybe it's just quantum mechanics all the way down. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5481.679999999999s)]
*  Quantum threads, so these entangled particles connected by wormholes. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5485.84s)]
*  So that's how you would, how would you even visualize a black hole in that way? So it's all, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5492.8s)]
*  I mean, it's all sort of from our perspective in terms of detecting things, the light goes [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5501.679999999999s)]
*  going in, it's all still the same. But when you zoom in a lot- [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5505.84s)]
*  When you zoom in a lot to the quantum mechanical scale at which you're seeing the Hawking radiation, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5509.36s)]
*  you would be noticing that there's some entanglement between the radiation that I [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5515.76s)]
*  could not explain before and the interior of the black hole. So it's now no longer a perfectly [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5520.72s)]
*  thermal spectrum with no features that only depends on the mass. It actually has a way to [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5528.0s)]
*  have an imprint of the information interior to the black hole in the particles that escape. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5534.16s)]
*  And so now, in principle, I could sit there for a very long time, it might take longer than the [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5541.6s)]
*  age of the universe, and collect all the Hawking radiation and see that it actually had details in [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5546.88s)]
*  it that are going to explain to me what was interior to the black hole, so the information [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5552.0s)]
*  is no longer lost. So yeah, so information is not being destroyed, so in theory you should be able [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5556.56s)]
*  to get information. Now, I can't do that anymore than I can recover the words on that piece of [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5561.6s)]
*  paper once it's been burnt, but that's a practical limitation, not a fundamental one. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5566.400000000001s)]
*  It's just too hard. But when I burn a piece of paper, technically the information is all there [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5571.28s)]
*  somewhere. It's in the smoke, it's in the currents, it's in the molecules, it's in the [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5576.32s)]
*  ink molecules, but in principle, if I had took the age of the universe, I could probably reconstruct, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5580.639999999999s)]
*  I should be able to, in principle, reconstruct the piece of paper and all the words on it. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5586.48s)]
*  Do you think a theory of everything that unifies general relativity quantum mechanics is possible? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5592.0s)]
*  We're like skirting around it. Yeah, we're skirting around it. I think that this is the way to find [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5597.76s)]
*  that out. It's going to be on the train of black holes that we figure out if that's possible. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5602.8s)]
*  I think that this is suggesting that there might not be a theory of quantum gravity, that gravity [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5609.92s)]
*  will emerge at a macroscopic level out of quantum phenomena. Now, we don't know how to do that yet, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5615.6s)]
*  but these are all hints. Emerge. So a lot of the mathematics of anything that emerges from complex [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5622.240000000001s)]
*  systems is very difficult to... The transition is very difficult, right? So if that's the case, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5628.72s)]
*  there might not be a simple clean equation that connects everything. There are examples of [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5634.8s)]
*  emergent phenomena which are very simple and clean. I can just take electromagnetic scattering, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5640.0s)]
*  which is law of physics where particles scatter just by electromagnetically, and I have a lot of [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5645.200000000001s)]
*  them and I have a lot of them in this room and they come to some average, well, I call that [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5651.12s)]
*  temperature. And that one number, the fact that there's one number describing all of these [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5655.28s)]
*  gazillions of particles is an emergent quantity. There's no particle that carries around this [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5661.84s)]
*  fundamental property called temperature. It emerges from the collective behavior of tons [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5668.48s)]
*  and tons of particles. In some sense, temperature is not a fundamental quantity. It's not a [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5673.92s)]
*  fundamental law of nature, right? It's just what happens from the collective behavior. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5677.92s)]
*  And that's what we'd be saying. We'd be saying, oh, this emerges from the collective behavior of [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5685.68s)]
*  lots and lots and lots of quantum interactions. So when do you think we would have some breakthroughs [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5692.32s)]
*  on the path towards theory of everything showing that it's impossible or impossible, all that kind [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5700.0s)]
*  of stuff? If you look at the 21st century, say you move 100 years into the future and looking back, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5706.8s)]
*  when do you think the breakthroughs will come? So I'll give you some hard problems. I guess my [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5712.96s)]
*  question is how hard is this problem? What does your gut say? Because finding the origin of life, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5717.76s)]
*  figuring out consciousness, solving some of the major diseases, then there's the theory of [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5724.08s)]
*  everything, understanding this, resolving the information paradox. So these puzzles that are [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5728.88s)]
*  before us as a human civilization, physics, this feels like really one of the big ones. Of course, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5734.48s)]
*  there could be other breakthroughs in physics that don't solve this. Yeah, we could discover [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5741.599999999999s)]
*  dark matter, dark energy. We could discover extra spatial dimensions. We could discover that those [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5749.12s)]
*  three things are linked, that there's like a dark sector to the universe that's hiding in these extra [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5754.639999999999s)]
*  dimensions. And that's something that I love to work on. I think it's really fascinating. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5759.04s)]
*  All of those would also be clues about this question, but they wouldn't solve this problem. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5764.48s)]
*  I think it's impossible to predict. There has been real progress, and the progress, as we've said, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5772.08s)]
*  comes from the childlike curiosity of saying, well, I don't actually understand this. I'm going to [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5777.5199999999995s)]
*  keep leaning on it because I don't understand it. And then suddenly you realize nobody really [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5782.5599999999995s)]
*  understood it. So I don't know. Do I think it's a harder problem than the problem of the origin of [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5787.36s)]
*  life? I think it's technically a harder problem, but I don't know. Maybe the breakthrough will come. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5793.92s)]
*  So when you mentioned discovering extra dimensions, what do you mean? What could that possibly mean? [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5801.68s)]
*  Well, we know that there are three spatial dimensions. We like to talk about time as [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5812.4s)]
*  a dimension. We can argue about whether that's the right thing to do. But we don't know why there [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5817.76s)]
*  are only three. It very well could be that there are extra spatial dimensions, that there's like a [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5822.88s)]
*  little origami of these tightly rolled up dimensions. Not all of them, not all the models [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5829.36s)]
*  require that they're small, but most do. String theory requires extra dimensions to make sense, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5835.2s)]
*  but even if you feel very hostile towards string theory, there are lots of reasons to consider [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5841.52s)]
*  the viability of extra dimensions. And we think that they can trap little quantum energies in such [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5851.04s)]
*  a way that might align with the dark energy. The numerology is not perfect. It's a little bit subtle. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5858.56s)]
*  It's hard to stabilize them. It's possible that there are these kind of quantum excitations that [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5865.36s)]
*  look a lot like dark matter. It's kind of an interesting idea that in the Big Bang, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5873.2s)]
*  the universe was born with lots of these dimensions. They were all kind of wrapped up in [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5878.56s)]
*  the early universe. And what we're really trying to understand is why did three get so big? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5883.92s)]
*  And why did the others stay so small? Is it possible to have some kind of natural [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5892.160000000001s)]
*  selection of dimensions kind of situation? Yeah, there is actually. And people have worked on that. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  Is there a reason why it's easier to unravel three? Some people think about strings and brains [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5901.52s)]
*  wrapping up in the extra dimensions, causing a kind of constriction, but preferentially loosening [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5909.360000000001s)]
*  up in three. Sometimes we look at exactly models like that, which have to do with the origami [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5914.64s)]
*  being resistant to change in a certain way that only allows three to unravel and keeps the others [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5921.4400000000005s)]
*  really taught. But then there are other ideas that we're actually living on a three-dimensional [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5927.76s)]
*  membrane that moves through these higher dimensions. And so the reason we don't notice [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5933.280000000001s)]
*  them isn't because they're small. Maybe they're not small at all, but it's because we're stuck [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5938.64s)]
*  to this membrane. So we're unaware of these extra directions. Is it possible that there's other [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5942.4800000000005s)]
*  intelligent alien civilizations out there that are operating on a different membrane? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5948.96s)]
*  This is a bit of an out there question, but I ask it more kind of seriously. Is it possible, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5955.36s)]
*  do you think, from a physics perspective to exist on a slice of what the universe is capable of? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5960.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it is certainly mathematically possible on paper to imagine a higher dimensional universe [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5969.36s)]
*  with more than one membrane. And if things are mathematically possible, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5978.64s)]
*  I often wonder if nature will try it out. Just how people get into the strange territory of [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5984.320000000001s)]
*  talking about a multiverse. Because if you start to say, one of the aspirations was in the same way [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5991.76s)]
*  that we identified the law of electroweak theory of matter, that it was a single description and [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=5997.52s)]
*  exactly landed on the description that matched observations, people were hoping the same thing [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6005.2s)]
*  would happen for a kind of theory that also incorporated gravity. There would be this one [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6011.04s)]
*  beautiful law, but instead they got a proliferation. All of which did okay or did equally badly. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6017.36s)]
*  They suddenly had trouble finding, not only finding a single one, but sort of, that would just [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6024.48s)]
*  beg a new question, which is, well, why that one? If nature can do something, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6030.88s)]
*  won't she do anything she can try? Maybe we really are just one example in an infinite sea of possible [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6037.2s)]
*  universes with slightly different laws of physics. If I can do some of these things on paper, like [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6045.44s)]
*  imagine a higher dimensional space in which I'm confined to a brain and there's another brain, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6051.84s)]
*  or maybe a whole array of them, maybe nature's tried that out somewhere. Maybe that's been [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6056.72s)]
*  tried out here. Then yes, is it possible that there's life and civilizations on those other [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6062.400000000001s)]
*  brains? Yeah, but we can't communicate with them. They'd be like in a shadow space. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6068.8s)]
*  Can you seriously say we can't communicate with them? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6073.92s)]
*  No, that's fair. I'm limited in my communication because I'm glued to the brain, but some things [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6077.2s)]
*  can move. We call the bulk through the bulk. Gravity, for instance, a gravitational wave. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6081.92s)]
*  I could design a gravitational communication system and I could send gravitational waves [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6087.76s)]
*  through the bulk. How SETI is doing with light into space, I could send signals into the bulk, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6094.4s)]
*  telling them where we are and what we do and singing songs. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6103.76s)]
*  Sending gravitational waves is very expensive. We don't know how to do it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6107.76s)]
*  Very expensive, very hard to localize. They tend to be long wavelength and very hard to do. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6110.56s)]
*  A lot of energy moving around. Is it possible that the membranes are [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6116.080000000001s)]
*  quote unquote hairy in other ways, like some kind of weird quantum thing? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6121.04s)]
*  It is possible that there's other things that live in the bulk. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6124.56s)]
*  Last night I was calculating away looking at something that lives in the bulk. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6128.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, this is fascinating. Can we take a little bit more seriously about the whole one? When I [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6133.4400000000005s)]
*  look out there at the stars, I, from a basic intuition, cannot possibly imagine there's not [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6138.56s)]
*  just alien civilizations everywhere. Life is so damn good. Like you said, nature tries stuff out. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6150.0s)]
*  Yeah, nature's an experimenter. And I just can't, just basic sort of [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6157.4400000000005s)]
*  observation. Life, you said somewhere that you like extremophiles. Life just figures [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6164.16s)]
*  shit out. It just finds a way to survive. Now there could be something magical about the origin [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6172.08s)]
*  of life, the first spark, but I can't even see that. It's over and over and over. I bet, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6177.68s)]
*  actually, once the story is fully told and figured out, life originated on Earth almost right away [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6182.64s)]
*  and did that so like billions of times in multiple places, just over and over and over and over. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6189.52s)]
*  That seems to be the thing that just, whatever is the life force behind this whole thing seems to [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6197.200000000001s)]
*  create life, seems to be a creator of different sorts. From the very original primordial soup [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6206.8s)]
*  of things, it just creates stuff. I just can't imagine, but we don't see the aliens. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6215.04s)]
*  We don't even have to go to something as crazy as extra dimensions and brain worlds and all of that. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6220.88s)]
*  What's happening right now in the past 30 years in astronomy, looking at real objects, is that the [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6224.96s)]
*  number of exoplanets outside our solar system has absolutely proliferated. There are probably more [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6232.08s)]
*  planets in the Milky Way galaxy than there are stars. Now we have a real quandary. I don't think [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6239.36s)]
*  it's quandary. I think it's really exciting. It becomes impossible. What you just said I totally [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6245.44s)]
*  agree with. It becomes impossible to imagine that life was not sparked somewhere else in our Milky [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6250.0s)]
*  Way galaxy and maybe even in our local neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy, maybe within a few hundred [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6256.0s)]
*  light years of our solar system. My gut says some crazy amount of [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6261.599999999999s)]
*  solar systems have life, bacterial life somewhere. At some point in their history, they had some [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6269.759999999999s)]
*  bacterial type of life. Something like bacteria, maybe it's totally different kinds of life. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6279.92s)]
*  Then I'm just facing with the question, why have we not clearly seen alien civilizations? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6284.719999999999s)]
*  I don't find any great filter answer convincing. There's just no way I can imagine an [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6291.92s)]
*  advanced alien civilization not avoiding its own destruction. I could see a lot of them getting into [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6302.24s)]
*  trouble. I could see how we humans are really like 50-50 here. Well, isn't that kind of a poly? Just [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6306.96s)]
*  take that statement. We've only been around for a couple hundred thousand years tops. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6313.76s)]
*  You know, that is not very long and we're at a 50-50. I mean, that's unbelievable. I mean, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6319.6s)]
*  it's indisputable that we have created the means at least potentially for our own destruction. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6326.24s)]
*  Will we learn from our mistakes? Will we avert course and save ourselves? One hopes so, right? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6333.28s)]
*  But even the concept that it's conceivable, whales have not invented a way to kill themselves, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6340.32s)]
*  to wipe out all whales and earth and life on earth. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6346.96s)]
*  That's one way to see it. But I actually see it as a feature, not a bug when you look at the entirety [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6351.5199999999995s)]
*  of the universe, because it does seem that the mechanism of evolution constantly creates. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6355.84s)]
*  You want to operate on the verge of destruction, it seems like. I mean, the predator and prey [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6365.84s)]
*  dynamic is really effective at accelerating evolution and development. It seems like us [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6370.32s)]
*  being able to destroy ourselves is a really powerful way to give us a chance to really [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6378.24s)]
*  get our shit together and to flourish, to develop, to innovate, to go out amongst the stars or 50-50 [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6384.08s)]
*  destroy ourselves. Which I think me as a human is a horrible thing, but if there's a lot of other [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6390.639999999999s)]
*  alien civilizations, that's a pretty cool thing. You want to give everybody nuclear weapons, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6396.64s)]
*  half of them will figure it out, half of them won't. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6402.0s)]
*  You mean all these civilizations. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6403.92s)]
*  All these civilizations. And then the ones that figure it out will figure out some incredible [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6406.400000000001s)]
*  technologies about how to expand, how to develop and all that kind of stuff. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6410.56s)]
*  Right. You could use a kind of evolutionary Darwinian natural selection on that where [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6414.08s)]
*  survival isn't just in a harsh, naturally induced climate change, but it's because of a nuclear [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6419.76s)]
*  holocaust. And then something will be created that is now impervious to that, that now knows how to [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6425.6s)]
*  survive. Yep, exactly. So why haven't we seen them? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6433.68s)]
*  Right. Well, because that's a pretty big bar. So if you look at the, just to say, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6436.320000000001s)]
*  for comparison, dinosaurs, 250 million years, I mean, maybe not very bright. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6441.52s)]
*  They didn't invent fire, didn't write sonnets. They didn't contemplate the origin of the [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6449.2s)]
*  universe, but they lived. And in a benign situation without confronting their own [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6456.08s)]
*  demise at their own hands, paws, hooves. So it's just a sheer numbers game. That's a long time, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6464.16s)]
*  250 million years. I do think though that life can flourish without wanting to manipulate [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6471.28s)]
*  its environment and that we do see many examples of species on earth that are very long lived, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6478.32s)]
*  very, very long lived and have very different states of consciousness. They have the jellyfish [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6486.32s)]
*  does not even have a localized brain. I don't think they have a heart or blood. I mean, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6494.16s)]
*  they're really different from us. Okay. And that's what I think we have to start thinking [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6498.88s)]
*  about when we think about aliens. Those species have lived for a very, very long time. They even [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6502.72s)]
*  show some evidence of immortality. You can wound one badly and there are certain jellyfish that [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6508.400000000001s)]
*  will go back into a kind of pre-state and start over. So I think we're very attached to imagining [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6514.64s)]
*  creatures like us that manipulate technology. And I think we have to be way more imaginative [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6522.72s)]
*  if we're going to really take seriously life in the universe. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6531.04s)]
*  Yeah. They might not prioritize conquest and expansion. They might not be violent. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6533.92s)]
*  They might not be violent. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6541.04s)]
*  They might be solitary. They might not be social. They might not move in groups. They might not want [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6544.48s)]
*  to leave records. They might again, not have a localized brain or have a completely different [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6549.12s)]
*  nervous system. I think all we can say about life is it has something to do with moving electrons [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6556.5599999999995s)]
*  around. And neurologically, we move electrons through our nervous system. Our brain has [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6561.679999999999s)]
*  electrical configurations. We metabolize food and that has to do with getting energy, electrical [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6569.5199999999995s)]
*  energy in some sense out of what we're eating. We have organisms on the earth that can eat rocks. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6578.32s)]
*  It's quite amazing. Minerals. I mean, talk about extremophiles. They can metabolize things that [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6583.28s)]
*  were impossible to metabolize. And so again, I think we have to kind of open our minds to [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6589.92s)]
*  how strange that could be and how different from us. And we are the only example even here on earth [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6596.48s)]
*  that does manipulate its environment in that extreme way. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6604.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, can you think of life as, because you said electrons, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6609.200000000001s)]
*  is there some degree of information processing required? So like, it does something interesting [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6614.08s)]
*  in quotes with information. I think there are arguments like that. How entropy is changing from [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6621.76s)]
*  the beginning of the universe to today, how life lowers entropy by organizing things, but it costs [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6628.72s)]
*  more as a whole system. So the whole entropy of the whole system goes up. But of course, I [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6636.96s)]
*  organized things today and reduced the entropy of certain things in order to get up and get here. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6644.08s)]
*  And even having this conversation, organizing thoughts out of the cloud of information, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6651.04s)]
*  but it comes at the cost of the entire system increasing entropy. So I do think there's probably [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6656.8s)]
*  a very interesting way to talk about life in this way. I'm sure somebody has. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6662.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It creates local pockets of low entropy. And then the kind of mechanism, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6666.64s)]
*  the kind of object, the kind of life form that could do that probably can take arbitrary [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6672.24s)]
*  forms. And you can think now, if you're going to reduce it all to information, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6678.08s)]
*  now you can start to think about physics. And then the realm of physics with the multiverse [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6681.6s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff, you could start to think about, okay, how do I detect [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6686.88s)]
*  those pockets of low entropy? Yeah. I mean, people have tried to make arguments like that. Like, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6692.88s)]
*  can I look for entropic arguments that might suggest we've done this before? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6698.56s)]
*  The Big Bang has happened before. So is it possible that there's some kind of physics [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6707.92s)]
*  explanation why we haven't seen the aliens? Like we said, membranes. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6713.28s)]
*  I don't think membranes is going to explain why we don't see them in the Milky Way. I think that [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6717.5199999999995s)]
*  is just a problem we're stuck with. Whether or not there are extra dimensions or whether or not [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6721.44s)]
*  there's life in another membrane, I think we know that even just in our galaxy, which is a very [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6725.759999999999s)]
*  small part of the universe, 300 billion stars, something like that, a whole kind of variety of [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6732.24s)]
*  possibilities to be explored by nature in the same way that we're describing. And I think you're [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6739.76s)]
*  absolutely right. When life was kicked off, first sparked here on earth, it was voracious. Now it [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6744.96s)]
*  took a really long time though to get to multicellularity. I think that's interesting. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6752.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6756.96s)]
*  It's weird. It took a really, really long time to become multicellular, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6757.68s)]
*  but it did not take long just to start. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6762.8s)]
*  Yeah. What do you think is the hardest thing on the chain of leaps that got to humans? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6767.28s)]
*  I would say multicellularity, which is strictly an energy problem, I think, again, it's just like, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6774.5599999999995s)]
*  can electrons flow the right way? And is it energetically favorable for multicellularity [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6782.719999999999s)]
*  to exist? Because if it's energetically expensive, it's not going to succeed. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6793.6s)]
*  And if it's energetically favorable, it's going to take off. It's really just... [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6798.0s)]
*  And that's why I also think that going from inanimate to animate is probably gray. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6802.400000000001s)]
*  Like the transition is gray. At what point we call something fully alive. Famously, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6813.2s)]
*  it's hard to make a nice list of bullet points that need to be met in order to declare something [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6820.48s)]
*  alive. Is a virus alive? I don't know. Is a prion alive? They seem to do some things, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6826.24s)]
*  but they kind of rely on stealing other DNA and replicating and I don't know. I guess they're [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6833.44s)]
*  not alive. But the point is that really at the end of the day, I really think it's just... You asked [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6839.36s)]
*  if it's just physics. I think it's just these rules of energetics. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6844.0s)]
*  And the gray area between the non-living and the living is way simpler just on Earth. And you said [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6848.8s)]
*  it's already complicated on Earth, but it's probably even more complicated elsewhere, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6854.96s)]
*  where the chemistry could be anything. Carbon is really cool and really useful. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6858.16s)]
*  Yes. Because it finds a lot... It's nice. It finds a lot of ways to combine with other things and [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6862.8s)]
*  that's complexity and complexity is the kind of thing you need for life. You can't have a very [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6868.0s)]
*  simple linear chain and expect to get life. But I don't know, maybe sulfur would do okay. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6873.6s)]
*  Okay. As we get progressively towards crazier and crazier ideas, so we talked about these [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6879.120000000001s)]
*  microscopic wormholes, which my mind is still blown away by that. But if we talk about a little [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6883.84s)]
*  bit more seriously about wormholes in general, also called the Einstein Rosen bridges, to what [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6890.64s)]
*  degree do you think they're actually possible as a thing to study creeping towards the possibility [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6897.84s)]
*  maybe centuries from now of engineering ways of using them, of creating wormholes and using them [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6907.28s)]
*  for transportation of human-like organisms? I think wormholes are a perfectly valid [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6915.360000000001s)]
*  construction to consider. They're just a curve in space time. Topologically, which has to do with [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6921.04s)]
*  the connectedness of the space is a little tricky because we know that Einstein's description is [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6929.68s)]
*  completely in terms of local curves and distortions, expansion, contraction, but it doesn't say anything [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6934.72s)]
*  about the global connectedness of the space because he knew that it could be globally connected on the [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6940.64s)]
*  largest scales. This kind of origami that we're talking about, that you could travel in a straight [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6946.72s)]
*  line through the universe, leave our galaxy behind, watch the Virgo cluster drift behind us and travel [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6951.76s)]
*  in a straight line as possible and find ourselves coming back again to the Virgo cluster and [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6958.4800000000005s)]
*  eventually the Milky Way and eventually the Earth, that we could find ourselves on a connected [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6962.56s)]
*  compact space time. Topologically, there's something we know for sure, something beyond [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6967.76s)]
*  Einstein's theory that has to explain that to us. Now, wormholes are a little funky because [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6975.44s)]
*  they're topological. They create these handles and holes in these sneaky, by topological, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6980.24s)]
*  I mean these connected spaces. Yes, like Swiss cheese or something. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6985.28s)]
*  Like Swiss cheese. Right. I could have two flat sheets that are connected by a wormhole, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6990.16s)]
*  but then wrap around on the largest scale, all this cool stuff. There's nothing wrong with it [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=6998.0s)]
*  as far as I can see. There's nothing abusive towards the laws about a wormhole, but we can [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7004.56s)]
*  reverse engineer. We were saying, oh look, if I know how matter and energy are distributed, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7010.56s)]
*  I can predict how space time is curved. I can reverse engineer. I can say, I want to build [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7015.6s)]
*  a curved space time like a wormhole. What matter and energy do I need to do that? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7020.320000000001s)]
*  It's a simple process and it's kind of thing Kip Thorne worked on, very imaginative, creative person. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7024.8s)]
*  And the problem was that he said, oh, here's the bummer. The matter and energy you need [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7032.0s)]
*  doesn't seem to be like anything we've ever seen before. It has to have negative energy. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7039.28s)]
*  That's not great. There are some conjectures that we shouldn't allow things that have that kind of [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7044.88s)]
*  a property that have negative energies. Only things that have positive energies are going to [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7051.68s)]
*  be stable and long lived. But we actually know of quantum examples of negative energy. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7057.6s)]
*  It's not that crazy. There's something called the Casimir effect. You have two metal plates and [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7062.96s)]
*  put them really close together. You can see this kind of quantum fluctuation between the plates. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7068.080000000001s)]
*  It's called a Casimir energy and that can have a negative energy. It can actually cause the [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7072.8s)]
*  place to attract a repel depending on how they're configured. And so you could kind of imagine [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7078.8s)]
*  doing something like that, like having wormholes propped up by these kinds of quantum energies. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7084.32s)]
*  And people have thought of imaginative configurations to try to keep them propped up. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7091.84s)]
*  Are we at the point of me saying, oh, this is an engineering problem? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7098.16s)]
*  I'm not saying that quite yet, but it's certainly plausible. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7101.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So you have to get a lot of this kind of weird matter. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7105.759999999999s)]
*  You need a lot of this weird matter to send a person through. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7110.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7113.76s)]
*  That's going to be really telling. So I'm not saying it's simply an engineering problem, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7114.400000000001s)]
*  but it's all within the realm of plausible physics, I think. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7118.72s)]
*  I think that's super interesting. I think it's obviously intricately and deeply connected to [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7123.52s)]
*  black holes. Is it fair to think of wormholes as just two black holes that are connected somehow? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7127.6s)]
*  People have looked at that. They tend to be non-traversable wormholes. They're not trying [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7134.16s)]
*  to prop them open. But yeah, I mean, some of this ER equals EPR quantum entanglement, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7138.56s)]
*  they're trying to connect black holes. It's really cool. Again, it's not quite following [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7147.120000000001s)]
*  the chalk. And by that, I mean, we can't exactly start at a concrete place, calculate all the way [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7155.120000000001s)]
*  to the end yet. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7160.240000000001s)]
*  So if I may read off some of the ideas that Kip Thornes had about how to artificially construct [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7161.68s)]
*  wormholes. So the first method involves quantum mechanics and the concept of quantum foam. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7166.32s)]
*  And this is the thing we've been talking about. Now, to create a wormhole, these tiny wormholes [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7170.96s)]
*  would need to be enlarged and stabilized to be useful for travel. But the exact method of doing [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7175.759999999999s)]
*  this remains entirely theoretical. No shit. You think so? So these tiny wormholes that are [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7182.32s)]
*  basically for the quantum entanglement of the particles, somehow enlarged. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7187.84s)]
*  Man, playing with the topology of the Swiss cheese would be so interesting. Even to get a hint. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7194.32s)]
*  That would be like top three, if not one of maybe even number one question for me to ask. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7202.4s)]
*  If I got a chance to ask an omniscient being of like a question that I can get answered to, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7207.4400000000005s)]
*  maybe with some visualization, like the shape, the topology of the universe. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7214.72s)]
*  But like I need some details. Because unfortunately I'll get an answer that I can't possibly come [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7220.400000000001s)]
*  ahead. Right. It's a hyperbolic manifold that's identified across the Earth. Exactly. You need [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7224.96s)]
*  to be able to ask a follow-up question. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that would be so interesting. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7231.12s)]
*  Anyway, classical quantum strategy. The second approach combines classical physics with quantum [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7235.84s)]
*  effects. This method would require an advanced civilization to manipulate quantum gravity effects [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7240.4800000000005s)]
*  in ways we don't yet understand. There's a lot of- In ways we don't understand. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7246.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of- And then there's exotic matter requirements. There's a lot of- [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7249.6s)]
*  But I can tell you, I'm pretty sure all of them have in common the feature that they're saying, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7253.28s)]
*  here's what I want my wormhole to look like first. So it's like saying I want to build a building [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7259.2s)]
*  first. So they construct, there's an architecture of the space-time that they're after. And then [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7264.320000000001s)]
*  they reverse the Einstein equations to say, what must matter and energy? What are the conditions [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7273.2s)]
*  that I impose on matter and energy to build this architecture? Which is unfortunately a very early [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7279.280000000001s)]
*  step of figuring out things. Right. But it's important because it's how they realized, oh wow, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7284.64s)]
*  they have to have these negative energies. They have to violate certain energy conditions that [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7289.6s)]
*  we often assume are true. And then you either say, oh, well then I'll be able to do this, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7294.16s)]
*  or say, oh, well then all bets are off, they'll never exist. Or you look a little harder and you [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7300.56s)]
*  say, well, I can violate that energy condition without it being that big a deal. And again, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7307.6s)]
*  quantum mechanics often does violate those energy conditions. So do you think the studying of black [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7313.360000000001s)]
*  holes and some of the topics we've been talking about will allow us to travel faster than the [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7318.0s)]
*  speed of light or travel close to the speed of light or do some kind of really innovative [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7323.4400000000005s)]
*  breakthroughs on the propulsion technology we use for traveling in space? Yeah. I mean, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7327.52s)]
*  sometimes I assign in an advanced general relativity class the assignment of inventing [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7332.56s)]
*  a warp drive. And it's kind of similar. So the idea is here's a place you want to get to. And [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7337.200000000001s)]
*  can you contract the space time between you with something antithetical to dark energy, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7344.72s)]
*  the opposite, and skip across and then push it back out again? That's all you can do that in [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7353.92s)]
*  the context of general relativity. Now, I can't find the energy that has these properties, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7361.28s)]
*  but I also can't find dark energy. So we've already been confronted with something that [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7367.04s)]
*  we look at the space time, the space time is expanding ever faster. We say, what could possibly [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7372.719999999999s)]
*  do that? We don't know what it is, but I can tell you about its pressure. I can tell you certain [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7379.12s)]
*  features about it. And I just call it dark energy, but I actually have no idea. It's just that name [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7383.84s)]
*  is just a proxy for what this it should be called invisible because it's not actually dark. It's in [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7388.96s)]
*  this room. It's not hard to see through. It's not dark. It's literally invisible. So maybe that was [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7393.2s)]
*  a misnomer, but the point being, I still don't fundamentally know what it is. That's not so [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7398.96s)]
*  terrible. That's the state of the world that we're actually in. So maybe warp drive is just kind of [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7404.24s)]
*  like a version of that. I don't know what form of matter can do that yet, but at least I can [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7408.56s)]
*  identify the features that are needed. So figuring out what dark energy is might land some clues. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7414.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it actually, it might. It is positive energy and a negative pressure, which is kind of like a [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7420.56s)]
*  rubber band sort of quality. We think of pressure as pushing things outward and dark energy has a [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7429.4400000000005s)]
*  very strange sort of quality that as things move outward, you feel more energy as opposed to less [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7434.08s)]
*  energy. The energy doesn't get lower. It gets more. But it doesn't have the right features for [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7439.44s)]
*  the wormhole, but those are some pretty surprising features. We again can conjecture like, oh, hey, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7445.12s)]
*  you know, the quantum energy of the vacuum kind of behaves that way. That would be a great resolution [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7452.4s)]
*  to the dark energy problem. It's just the energy of empty space and it's the quantum energy of [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7457.36s)]
*  empty space. That's an excellent answer. The problem is, is by all our methods and all the [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7461.68s)]
*  understanding we have, that energy is either really, really huge, huge, way bigger than what we see today, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7468.08s)]
*  or it's like zero. So that's a numbers problem. We can't naturally fine tune the energy of empty [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7476.8s)]
*  space to give us this really weird value so that we just happen to be seeing it today. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7485.76s)]
*  But again, we can think of a kind of dark energy that exists. So the question is just why is it [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7490.400000000001s)]
*  it becomes why is it such such a weird value? Not how is this conceivable because we can't conceive [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7496.56s)]
*  of it. Yeah, but if it's a weird value, that means there is a phenomena we don't understand. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7504.08s)]
*  Yes, there's absolutely a phenomenon. Nobody's going to say they're happy with that. We're all [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7508.56s)]
*  going to say there's something we don't understand, which is why we look to the extra dimensions, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7512.88s)]
*  because then you can say, oh, maybe it has to do with the size of the extra dimensions or the way [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7516.64s)]
*  that they're wrapped up. And so maybe it's foisted on us because of the topology, the connectedness [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7520.56s)]
*  of the higher dimensional space. These are all things that we're exploring. Nobody's landed one [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7528.56s)]
*  that's so compelling that your friends like it as much as you do. What do you think would lead to [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7533.4400000000005s)]
*  the breakthroughs on dark matter and dark energy? I think dark matter might be [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7541.28s)]
*  less peculiar than dark energy. My hope is that they're tied together. That would be very [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7549.2s)]
*  gratifying. These aren't just separate problems coming from different sectors, but that they're [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7556.16s)]
*  actually connected. That the reason the dark matter is where it is in terms of how much it's [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7561.679999999999s)]
*  contributing to the universe is connected with why the dark energy is showing up right now. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7568.8s)]
*  I would love that. That would be a solution like no other. Like I said, if it revealed something [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7574.72s)]
*  about dark dimensions, that would be a happy day. Correct me if I'm wrong, but dark matter [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7580.96s)]
*  could be localized in space. Yes, dark matter is localized in space. It clumps. It doesn't clump a [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7586.72s)]
*  lot, but it's around the galaxy. It's in a halo around the galaxy. People get increasingly [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7592.64s)]
*  more confident that it doesn't. It's really compelling. You see these images of galaxies, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7598.8s)]
*  that clusters that pass through each other. You can see where the light is. The luminous [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7607.92s)]
*  matter is distributed. Then by looking at the gravitational lensing, which shows you where the [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7613.280000000001s)]
*  actual mass is distributed so that light bends around the most massive parts in a particular way. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7619.84s)]
*  You can reconstruct where the mass is gravitationally quite separate from looking [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7625.44s)]
*  at the luminous matter, which is not dark. They are separate because the stuff as they pass through [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7630.719999999999s)]
*  each other, the interacting stuff, the luminous stuff collides and gets stuck. You can see it [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7637.839999999999s)]
*  colliding and lighting up. The dark stuff, which by definition it's dark because it doesn't interact, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7644.16s)]
*  passes right through each other. It's so compelling. There's lots of other [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7650.160000000001s)]
*  observations, but that one is just before you just look at it, you can see that the mass is [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7657.6s)]
*  distributed differently than the interacting luminous matter. Dark energy is harder to get a [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7664.8s)]
*  hold of. Dark energy is much harder to get a hold of. The Higgs field could have also explained [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7670.88s)]
*  dark energy. If you've heard of the God particle, I don't know if you know the [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7677.68s)]
*  originally Leon Letterman co-authored a book and he wanted to call it the goddamn particle [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7683.200000000001s)]
*  because they couldn't find it. His publisher convinced him to call it the God particle. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7687.76s)]
*  He said they managed to offend two groups, those that believed in God and those that didn't. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7695.6s)]
*  That's a good line too. He was very funny. He's very witty. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7701.4400000000005s)]
*  Higgs turned out to be... [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7706.16s)]
*  Higgs, great discovery. Unbelievable. There it was, build this massive collider in CERN [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7708.16s)]
*  in Switzerland and there it is. Unbelievable. Kind of where you expect it to be. Now, the reason I [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7715.679999999999s)]
*  say it could be dark energy is because the Higgs particle, like a particle of light, also has a [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7721.04s)]
*  field, like an electromagnetic field. Light can have this field that's distributed through all [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7727.92s)]
*  space, electric magnetic field and you shake it around and it creates little particles. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7733.28s)]
*  So the Higgs field is actually more important than the Higgs particle, [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7737.92s)]
*  the complement to the Higgs particle because that's what you and I connect with to get mass [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7742.48s)]
*  in our atoms. So the idea is that our atoms are interacting with this gooey field that's everywhere [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7748.5599999999995s)]
*  and that's what's giving us this experience of inertial mass. But we don't actually... [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7756.24s)]
*  There's not a lot of quanta lying around. There's not a lot of Higgs particles lying around [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7761.52s)]
*  because they decay. So it's the field that's really important and that field could act like [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7764.88s)]
*  a dark energy. It's just not in the right place, meaning it's not at the right... The energy's too [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7770.080000000001s)]
*  high to explain this tiny, tiny value today. And again, we're back to this mismatch. It's not that [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7778.0s)]
*  we can't conceive of forms of dark energy. It's that we can't make one where we're finding it. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7784.160000000001s)]
*  So I wonder if you can comment on something that I've heard recently. There's some people who say, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7791.2s)]
*  people outside of physics, say that dark matter and dark energy is just something physicists made [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7799.36s)]
*  up to put a label on the fact that they don't understand a very large fraction of the universe [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7803.92s)]
*  and how it operates. Is there some truth to that? What's your response to that? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7812.24s)]
*  There's some truth to it, but it's really missing a huge point, which is that if we did not understand [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7815.679999999999s)]
*  the universe as incredibly precisely as we do, it's stunning that there's modern, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7820.96s)]
*  precision cosmology. It's absolutely incredible. When COBE, which is an experiment that measured [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7826.32s)]
*  the light left over from the Big Bang in the 80s, first revealed its observations, I mean, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7833.12s)]
*  there was applause. People were cheering. It was unbelievable. We had predicted and measured [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7840.0s)]
*  the light left over from the Big Bang. Because of all the precision that's happened since then, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7847.92s)]
*  that's how we're able to confront that there's things that we don't know. That's how we're able [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7854.48s)]
*  to confront it. Wow, this is really everything everybody has ever seen and ever will see as far [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7859.839999999999s)]
*  as we understand makes up less than 5% of what's out there. So I would say, yes, we're just giving [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7866.32s)]
*  proxy names to things we don't understand, but to dismiss that as some kind of, oh, they just don't [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7873.52s)]
*  know, that it is actually quite the opposite. It is a stunning achievement to be able to stare that [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7879.280000000001s)]
*  down and to have that so precise and so compelling that we're able to know that there's dark energy [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7884.080000000001s)]
*  and dark matter. I don't think those are disputed anymore. And they were up until recently. They're [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7893.120000000001s)]
*  still disputed. I think we're still at such early stages where we're not really even at a good [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7899.44s)]
*  explanation. You've mentioned a few. Well, I can think of examples of dark matter that exist that [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7905.12s)]
*  we really know for sure are real versions of dark matter, like Nechinos. Right now, they're radiating [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7911.12s)]
*  through us. That's very well confirmed. And they're technically dark. They don't interact with light. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7916.4s)]
*  And so we can't see them. Right now, they're raining through us. If we could see [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7924.0s)]
*  the dark matter in this room, we absolutely know is coming from the sun, it would be wild, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7928.0s)]
*  be a rainstorm. But they're just invisible to us. Mostly, they pass through our bodies. Mostly, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7933.5199999999995s)]
*  they pass through the earth. Occasionally, they get caught in some fancy detector experiment that [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7940.08s)]
*  somebody built specifically to catch solar adrenos. So dark matter is known to exist. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7945.2s)]
*  It's just, again, there's not enough of it. It's not the right mass to be the dark matter [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7951.92s)]
*  that makes up this missing component. I wanted to say that I was recently fascinated by the [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7958.4s)]
*  Flat Earth people because there's been a split in the community. First of all, the community's [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7963.76s)]
*  fascinating study of human psychology, but they did this experiment where I forgot who funded it. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7971.12s)]
*  But they sent physicists and Flat Earthers to Antarctica. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7981.28s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7988.08s)]
*  And this split happened because half of them got converted into Round Earthers. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7988.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow. Well, good for them. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7992.5599999999995s)]
*  But then the other half just went that it was all a sigh out. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7994.16s)]
*  Really? That's fascinating. Did somebody film that? That'd be a great documentary. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=7997.76s)]
*  Yeah, they did. They made a whole thing. This is just at the end of last year, there's a big... [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8001.36s)]
*  I mean, meaning because I think that's such a clean study of conspiracy theories. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8006.08s)]
*  Because there's so many conspiracy theories that have some inkling of truth in them. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8011.44s)]
*  There's some elements about the way governments operate or human psychology that it's too messy. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8020.16s)]
*  Flat Earth to me is just clean. It's like spaghetti moss or something. It's just a cleanly wrong [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8026.72s)]
*  thing. It's a nice way to discuss how a large number of people can believe a thing. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8032.72s)]
*  Yeah. Why do they want to believe a thing? What's very interesting is trying to use rational [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8039.2s)]
*  arguments. That makes it even more confounding to me. I would understand more somebody who just said, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8046.88s)]
*  look, I have faith and I believe these things and it's not about reason and it's not about logic. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8054.320000000001s)]
*  I don't relate to it, but okay. But to say I'm going to use reason and logic [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8061.76s)]
*  and to prove to you this completely orthogonal conclusion, that I find really interesting. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8067.92s)]
*  There's some kind of romance about reason and logic. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8074.72s)]
*  Yeah. But also there's questioning of institutions. That's really interesting [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8079.52s)]
*  and important to understand. Well, I mean, I actually appreciate [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8084.0s)]
*  the skeptics stance. Scientists also have to be skeptics. We have to be childlike, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8090.08s)]
*  naive and somewhat in some sense really open to anything. Right? Otherwise, you're not going to be [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8097.04s)]
*  a flexible. You're not going to be at the forefront, but also to be skeptical. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8102.24s)]
*  I have respect for it. I guess that's exactly what I'm saying is more confusing because [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8108.4s)]
*  to invoke skepticism and then to want to use rational argument, what is the other component [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8113.280000000001s)]
*  that's going into this? Because as you said, this is something that's easily verified. I mean, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8121.280000000001s)]
*  we have people in space. So you have to believe a lot more machinery [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8126.08s)]
*  that's a lot more difficult to justify, explain as a wild conspiracy. So there's something about [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8133.200000000001s)]
*  the conspiracy that stirs a positive emotion. I think one of the most incredible things I have [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8138.96s)]
*  to talk to you about this, one of the most incredible things that humans have ever accomplished is LIGO. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8145.04s)]
*  We have to talk about gravitational waves and the very fact that we're able to detect gravitational [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8152.4s)]
*  waves from the early universe is f-ing wild. It's crazy. Yeah. Can you explain what gravitational [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8157.28s)]
*  waves are? And we should mention you wrote a book about the humans, about the whole journey of [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8165.68s)]
*  detecting gravitational waves and LIGO, Black Hole Blues is the book, but can you talk about [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8171.68s)]
*  gravitational waves and how the hell we're able to actually do it? Let's just start with the idea of [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8176.320000000001s)]
*  gravitational laser. I have to move around a lot of mass to make anything interesting happening [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8182.0s)]
*  in gravity. I mean, if you think about it, gravity is incredibly weak. I mean, right now, the whole [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8188.240000000001s)]
*  earth is pulling on me and I can still get out of this chair and walk around. That's insane. The [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8191.84s)]
*  whole earth. Gravity is weak, right? So to get something going on in gravity, I need big objects [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8197.28s)]
*  and things like black holes. So the idea is if black holes curve space and time around them in [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8205.44s)]
*  the way that we've been describing, things fall along the curves in space. If the black holes move [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8211.12s)]
*  around, the curves have to follow them, right? But they can't travel faster than the speed of light [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8215.68s)]
*  either. So what happens is black holes, let's say, move around. Maybe I've got two black holes in [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8221.84s)]
*  orbit around each other. That can happen. It takes a while. A wave is created in the actual shape of [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8226.640000000001s)]
*  space and that wave follows the black holes. Those black holes are undulating. Eventually, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8232.16s)]
*  those two black holes will merge. And as we were talking about, it doesn't take an infinite time, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8237.68s)]
*  even though there's time dilation, because they're both so big. They're really deforming [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8242.8s)]
*  space-time a lot. I don't have a little tidy marble falling across an event horizon. I have [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8246.48s)]
*  two event horizons. And in the simulations, you can see it bobble and they merge together. They [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8251.119999999999s)]
*  make one bigger black hole and then it radiates in the gravitational waves. It radiates away all [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8256.96s)]
*  those imperfections and it settles down to one quiescent, perfectly silent black hole that's [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8262.4s)]
*  spinning. Beautiful stuff. And it emits E equals MC squared energy. So the mass of the final black [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8268.88s)]
*  hole will be less than the sum of the two starter black holes. And that energy is radiated away in [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8274.72s)]
*  this ringing of space-time. It's really important to emphasize that it's not light. None of this has [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8281.359999999999s)]
*  to do literally with light that we can detect with normal things that detect light. X-rays [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8288.4s)]
*  form a light, gamma rays are a form of light, infrared, optical, this whole electromagnetic [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8294.88s)]
*  spectrum. None of it is emitted as light. It's completely dark. It's only emitted in the rippling [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8300.08s)]
*  of the shape of space. A lot of times it's likened closer to sound. Technically, we've kind of argued, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8304.72s)]
*  I mean, I haven't done an anatomical calculation, but if you're near enough to two colliding black [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8309.679999999998s)]
*  holes, they actually ring space-time in the human auditory range. The frequency is actually in the [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8315.199999999999s)]
*  human auditory range that the shape of space could squeeze and stretch your eardrum, even in [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8320.64s)]
*  vacuum. And you could hear, literally hear these waves ringing. So the idea is that they're closer [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8325.92s)]
*  to something that you would want to map as a sound than something as a picture. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8344.24s)]
*  Sorry. So what do you think it would feel like to ride the gravitational waves? So like to exist, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8350.72s)]
*  to exist? Because you mentioned eardrums. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8357.6s)]
*  When you could literally bob around, like your orbit would change, right? If you were orbiting [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8360.56s)]
*  these black holes, two black holes, you'd be on a kind of complicated orbit, but your orbit would [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8365.84s)]
*  get tossed about. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8370.72s)]
*  Well, how would the experience be? Because you're inside space-time. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8372.72s)]
*  Yes, I see. So the black hole is experienced within space-time as a squeezing and stretching. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8376.4s)]
*  So you would feel it as a sort of squeezing and stretching, and you would also find your location [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8383.04s)]
*  change. Where you would fall would be redirected. So it's literally like a squeezing and stretching. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8387.36s)]
*  That's the way to think about it. And it's very detailed, the sort of nature of this. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8395.12s)]
*  But for many years, people thought, well, these gravitational waves kind of have to exist for [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8404.0s)]
*  these intuitive reasons I've described, as space-time's curved. I move the curve, the wave [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8408.0s)]
*  has to propagate through that curved space-time. But people didn't know if they really carried [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8412.240000000002s)]
*  energy. The arguments went on and back and forth and papers written and decades. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8417.68s)]
*  But I like this sound more than an analogy, because I liken the black holes as mallets on the [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8425.28s)]
*  drum. The drum is space-time. As they move, they bang on the drum of space-time, and it rings. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8431.6s)]
*  Remarkably, those gravitational waves, things don't interfere with them very much. So they can [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8439.36s)]
*  travel for two billion years, light years in distance, two billion years in time, and get to [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8444.480000000001s)]
*  us kind of as they were when they were emitted. Quieter, more diffuse. Maybe they've stretched out [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8450.88s)]
*  a little bit from the expansion of the universe, but they're pretty preserved. And so the idea of [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8457.759999999998s)]
*  LIGO, this instrument, is to build a gigantic musical instrument. It's kind of like building [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8463.359999999999s)]
*  an electric guitar, where the electric guitar is recording the shape of the string, and it plays [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8469.599999999999s)]
*  it back to you through an amplifier. LIGO is trying to record the shape of the ringing drum, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8476.16s)]
*  and they literally listen to it in the control room. Just sort of hums and wobbles. And they're [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8482.24s)]
*  like trying to play this recording drum back to you. As opposed to taking a snapshot, it's like [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8487.92s)]
*  in time. Yeah, but to construct this guitar, it has to be very large and extremely precise. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8493.119999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable. I can't believe they succeeded. Honestly, I can't believe they succeeded. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8501.6s)]
*  It was so insane. It was such a crazy thing to even attempt. It took them 50 years. Really, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8505.92s)]
*  that's people who started in their 30s and 40s who were in their 80s when it succeeded. Imagine that [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8512.880000000001s)]
*  tenacity, the unbelievable commitment. But the sensitivity that we're talking about is we have [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8519.2s)]
*  this musical instrument, the four kilometers, spanning four kilometers in a kind of L shape [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8526.56s)]
*  with these tunnels where there's the largest holes in the earth's atmosphere because they [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8532.4s)]
*  pulled a vacuum in these tunnels to build this instrument. And they're measuring, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8537.44s)]
*  they're trying to record the wobbling of space-time as it passes, this sort of undulation [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8543.76s)]
*  that amounts to less than one ten-thousandth the variation in a proton over the four kilometers. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8550.0s)]
*  It's an insane, insane achievement. I love great engineering. I don't know how they did it. I [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8559.28s)]
*  followed them around just for fun. I'm very theoretical. I don't build things. I'm always [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8566.24s)]
*  super impressed that people can translate something on the page and it looks like wires. I'm always [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8573.6s)]
*  surprised at what it looks like. But I walked the tunnels with Ray Weiss, who won the Nobel Prize [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8581.76s)]
*  along with Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish, one of the project managers. I walked the tunnels with Ray. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8587.44s)]
*  It was a delight. Ray's one of the most delightful people. Kip is one of the most wonderful people [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8592.0s)]
*  I've ever known. Ray said to me, the reason why it was called Black Hole Blues is because [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8596.640000000001s)]
*  about a month before they succeeded, he said to me, if we don't detect black holes, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8603.92s)]
*  this whole thing's a failure. We've led this country down this wrong path. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8609.28s)]
*  He really felt like this tremendous responsibility for this project to succeed. It weighed on him. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8616.96s)]
*  It was just quite tremendous, the scientific integrity. The first instruments he built, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8626.08s)]
*  he was building outside of MIT on a tabletop. His colleague said, you're not going to get tenure. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8633.84s)]
*  You're never going to succeed. They just kept going. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8640.64s)]
*  People like that, huge teams, huge collaborations, is how the world moves forward. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8646.24s)]
*  It's an example. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8655.6s)]
*  There's a building cynicism about bureaucracies when a large number of people, especially [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8657.68s)]
*  connected to government, can be productive. Bureaucracies slow everything down. It's nice to see [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8662.64s)]
*  an incredibly unlikely, exceptionally difficult engineering project like this succeed. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8667.92s)]
*  I understand why there's this weight on his shoulders. I'm grateful that there's great leaders [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8674.24s)]
*  that push it forward like that. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8681.36s)]
*  Yeah. It really is. You see so many moments when they could have stumbled. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8683.12s)]
*  They built a first-generation machine just after 2000. It wasn't a surprise to them, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8689.28s)]
*  but it detected nothing, crickets. Crickets. They have the wherewithal to keep going. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8695.679999999998s)]
*  Second generation, they're about to turn the machine on, quote unquote. It's a little bit [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8702.4s)]
*  of a simplification, but do their first science run. They decide to postpone [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8707.519999999999s)]
*  because they feel they're not ready yet. September 14th in 2015. The experimentalists are out there. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8713.599999999999s)]
*  They're in the middle of the night. They're working all night long. They're banging on the [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8720.24s)]
*  thing, literally driving trucks, slamming the brakes on to see the noise that it creates. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8724.16s)]
*  So they're really messing with the machine, really interfering with it just to calibrate [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8730.48s)]
*  how much noise can this thing tolerate. I guess the story is as they get tired. There's an [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8734.4s)]
*  instrument in Louisiana and there's one in Washington state, and they go home. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8739.44s)]
*  Put their tools down, they go home. They leave the instrument locked though, mercifully. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8743.36s)]
*  And it's something like within the span of an hour of them driving back to their humble abodes [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8749.44s)]
*  that they have in these remote regions where they built these instruments, this gravitational wave [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8755.28s)]
*  washes over. I think it hits Louisiana first. It travels across the US, brings the instrument [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8761.92s)]
*  in Washington state. It began over a billion and a half years ago before multicellular organisms [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8768.720000000001s)]
*  had emerged on the earth. Just imagine this from a distant view, this collision course. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8775.68s)]
*  It's the centenary. It's the year Einstein published General Relativity. So it was this, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8784.320000000002s)]
*  you know, a hundred years. Just think about where that signal was when Einstein in 1915 [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8791.2s)]
*  wrote down the general theory of relativity. It was on its way here. It was almost here. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8800.320000000002s)]
*  What do you think is cooler, Einstein's General Relativity or LIGO? [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8805.28s)]
*  Well, I can't disparage my friends, but of course, relativity is just so all-encompassing. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8815.76s)]
*  No, but hold on a second. All-encompassing, super powerful leap of a theory. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8820.480000000001s)]
*  They built it. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8828.480000000001s)]
*  They built it. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8829.6s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8830.560000000001s)]
*  The greatest engineering. Yeah. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8831.2s)]
*  Humans getting together and building the thing, that's really ultimately what [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8837.6s)]
*  impacts the world, right? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8843.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, as I said, my admiration for Ray and Kip and the entire team is enormous. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8845.36s)]
*  And just imagining Ray had been out there on site, he had just left to go back home, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8852.960000000001s)]
*  wakes up in the middle of the night and sees it. Can you imagine? And there's a signal. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8860.16s)]
*  There's something in the log. He's like, what the hell is that? [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8866.400000000001s)]
*  So speaking of the human story, you also wrote the book of Mad Men Dreams of Touring Machines. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8870.880000000001s)]
*  It connects two geniuses of the 20th century, Alan Turing and Girdle. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8875.92s)]
*  What specific threads connect these two minds? [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8880.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I was really mesmerized by these two characters. People know of Alan Turing for [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8884.16s)]
*  having ideated about the computer, being the person to really imagine that. But his work began [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8892.32s)]
*  with thinking about Girdle's work. That's where it began. And it began with this phenomenon of [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8900.880000000001s)]
*  undecidable propositions or unprovable propositions. So [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8908.0s)]
*  there was something huge that happened in mathematics. People imagined that any problem [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8914.64s)]
*  in math could technically be proven to be true. It doesn't mean human beings are going to prove [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8920.32s)]
*  every fact about everything in mathematics, but it should be provable, right? I mean, it seems kind of, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8925.84s)]
*  it's not that wild supposition. And everyone believed this, all the great mathematicians. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8931.28s)]
*  Hilbert was a call of his to prove that and go to a very strange character, very unusual. He was a [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8935.68s)]
*  Platonist. He literally believed that mathematical objects had an existential reality. He wasn't so [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8945.52s)]
*  sure about this reality, this reality he struggled with. He was distrustful, a physical reality, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8953.04s)]
*  but he absolutely took very seriously platonic reality. And often his own way of thinking and [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8959.52s)]
*  he proved that there were facts, even among the numbers, that could never be proven to be true. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8965.52s)]
*  To think about that, how wild that is that even a fact about numbers seems very simple, [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8972.32s)]
*  could be true and unprovable, could never exist as a theorem, for instance, in mathematics, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8980.800000000001s)]
*  unreachable. This incompleteness result was very disturbing. Essentially, it's equivalent to saying [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8987.04s)]
*  there's no theory of everything for mathematics. It was very disturbing to people, but it was very [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8994.32s)]
*  profound. And Alan Turing got involved in this because he was thinking about uncomputable numbers. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=8999.52s)]
*  And that led him, what's an uncomputable number? A number like 0.175, it just goes on forever with [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9010.56s)]
*  no pattern. And I can't even figure out how to generate it. There's no rule for making that [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9017.44s)]
*  number. And he was able to prove that there were such things as these effectively unknowable numbers. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9023.68s)]
*  And that might not sound like a big deal, it was actually really quite profound. He was relating to [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9030.08s)]
*  Godel intellectually in the space of ideas. But he goes a very different path, almost philosophically [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9035.68s)]
*  the opposite direction. He starts to think about machines. He starts to think about mechanizing [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9042.880000000001s)]
*  thought. He starts to think, what is a proof? How does a mathematician reason? What does it mean to [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9049.52s)]
*  reason at all? What does it mean to think? And he begins to imagine inventing a machine [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9054.560000000001s)]
*  that will execute certain orders, mechanize thought in a specific way. Well, maybe I can [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9060.08s)]
*  get a machine, I can imagine a machine that does this kind of thinking. And that he can prove that [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9067.6s)]
*  even a machine could not compute these uncomputable numbers. But where he ends up is the idea of a [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9072.560000000001s)]
*  universal machine that computes, essentially can take different software and execute different jobs. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9079.12s)]
*  We don't have a different computer to connect to the internet than we do to write papers. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9087.28s)]
*  It's one machine and one piece of hardware, but it can do all of these, this huge variety [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9092.720000000001s)]
*  of tasks. And so he really does invent the computer, essentially. And famously, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9099.76s)]
*  he uses that thinking in a very primitive form in the war effort where he's recruited to help [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9106.48s)]
*  break the German enigma code, which is heavily encrypted and largely believed to be uncrackable [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9113.439999999999s)]
*  code. And people believe that Turing and his very small group actually turned the tide of the war [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9119.92s)]
*  in favor of the allies precisely by using a combination of this thinking and just sheer [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9127.359999999999s)]
*  ingenuity and some luck. But the other profound revelation that Turing has is that, well, maybe [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9133.2s)]
*  we're just machines, right? And just biological machines. And this is a huge shift for him. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9142.800000000001s)]
*  It feels very different from Godel, who doesn't really believe in reality and thinks numbers are [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9150.16s)]
*  platonic realities. And Turing kind of thinking, we're kind of like, we're actually machines and [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9156.560000000001s)]
*  we could be replicated. So of course, Turing's influence is still widely felt. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9161.44s)]
*  On many levels. So as to the- [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9168.08s)]
*  On many levels, yeah. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9169.6s)]
*  In complexity theory, in theoretical computer science, in mathematics, but also in philosophy [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9170.720000000001s)]
*  with his famous Turing test paper. So like you said, conceiving, like, what is the connection [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9175.28s)]
*  that I guess Godel never really made between mathematics and humanity Turing did? But I think [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9181.36s)]
*  there's another connection to those two peoples that they're both in their own way kind of [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9189.279999999999s)]
*  tormented humans. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9193.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. They were very tormented. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9194.0s)]
*  What aspect of that contributed to who they are and what ideas they developed? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9196.72s)]
*  I mean, I think so much. I don't want to promote the kind of trite trope of the mad genius. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9203.519999999999s)]
*  If you're brilliant, you are insane. I don't think that. I don't think if you're insane, [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9215.599999999999s)]
*  you're brilliant. But I do think if somebody who's very brilliant, who also chooses not to go for [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9219.839999999998s)]
*  regular gratification in life, they don't go for money. They don't necessarily value [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9229.039999999999s)]
*  creature comforts. They're not leveraging for fame. I mean, they're really after something [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9236.8s)]
*  different. I think that can lead to a kind of runaway instability, actually, sometimes. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9243.52s)]
*  They're already outside of kind of social norms. They're already outside of normal connections [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9250.720000000001s)]
*  with people. They've already made that break. And I think that makes them more vulnerable. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9256.08s)]
*  So Godel did have a wife and in strong relationships, as far as I understand, [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9263.6s)]
*  and was a successful mathematician and ended up at the Institute for Advanced Study where he [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9269.28s)]
*  walked with Einstein to the Institute every day. And they talked about and he proved certain really [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9274.400000000001s)]
*  unusual things in relativity. You made reference to these rotating galaxies we were talking and [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9280.720000000001s)]
*  actually Godel had a model of a rotating universe that you could travel backwards in time. It was [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9286.0s)]
*  mathematically correct. Showed Einstein that within relativity, you could time travel. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9291.44s)]
*  He was just an unbelievably influential and brilliant man, but he was probably a paranoid [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9297.119999999999s)]
*  schizophrenic. He did have breaks with reality. He was, I think, quite distrustful and feared [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9304.32s)]
*  the government, feared his food was being poisoned, and ultimately literally starved himself to death. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9316.24s)]
*  And it's such an extreme outcome for such a facile mind, for such a brilliant mind. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9323.439999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to sort of not to glorify romanticized madness or suffering, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9333.759999999998s)]
*  but to me, you flip that around and just be inspired by the peculiar maladies of a human mind, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9340.0s)]
*  of a human mind, how they can be leveraged and channeled creatively. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9348.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9353.039999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of us, obviously probably every human has those peculiar qualities. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9353.76s)]
*  You know, I talk to people sometimes about just my own psychology and I'm extremely self-critical [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9360.48s)]
*  and I'm drawn to the beauty in people, but because I make myself vulnerable to the world, [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9367.44s)]
*  that can really be hurt by people and that thing, okay, you can lay that out. That's [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9374.72s)]
*  this particular human, okay? And you know, there's a bunch of people that will say, well, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9379.039999999999s)]
*  many of those things you don't want to do. Maybe don't be so self-critical. Maybe don't be so open [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9386.32s)]
*  to the world. Maybe have a little bit more reason about how you interact with the outside world. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9392.32s)]
*  It's like, yeah, maybe, or maybe be that and be that fully and channel that into a productive [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9399.2s)]
*  life into we're all going to die in the time we have on this earth. Make the best of the [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9405.84s)]
*  particular weirdness that you have and maybe you'll create something special in this world [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9414.880000000001s)]
*  and in the end it might destroy you. And I think a lot of these stories are that it's not that, [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9421.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9426.160000000002s)]
*  It's not like saying, Oh, because in order to achieve anything great, you have to suffer. No, [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9427.619999999999s)]
*  if you're already suffering, if you're already weird, if you're already somehow don't quite [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9433.7s)]
*  fit in your particular environment, your particular part of society, use that somehow, [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9440.74s)]
*  use the tension of that, the friction of that to create something. I mean, that's what I, you know, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9446.34s)]
*  Nietzsche who suffered a lot from even like stupid stuff, like stomach issues, like, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9450.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9457.14s)]
*  That can be everything. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9457.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9458.74s)]
*  Migraines. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9459.539999999999s)]
*  Psychosomatic or psychophysical. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9460.42s)]
*  And all of those things. That can somehow be channeled into a productive life. It should be [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9462.9s)]
*  inspiring. A lot of us suffer in different ways. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9473.06s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a big believer in the tragic flaw, actually. I think the Greeks would have been [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9475.619999999999s)]
*  really had that right. You're describing it. What makes us great is ultimately our downfall. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9480.26s)]
*  Maybe that's just inevitable. The choice could be not to be great. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9486.98s)]
*  And I guess that's sort of what I mean by they had already broken from a traditional path [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9492.82s)]
*  because they decided to pursue something so elusive and that would isolate them to some [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9498.98s)]
*  extent inevitably. And that could fail. Right. And whose rewards were hard to predict even. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9508.02s)]
*  And I do think that all the character traits that went into their accomplishments were the same [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9517.7s)]
*  traits that went into their demise. And I think you're right. You could say, well, you know, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9525.220000000001s)]
*  Lex, maybe you should not be so empathetic. Hold yourself, cut yourself off a little bit, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9531.140000000001s)]
*  protect yourself. Right. But isn't that exactly what you're bringing? One of the elements that [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9536.5s)]
*  you're bringing that makes something extraordinary in a space that lots of people try to break through. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9541.62s)]
*  Yeah. And we should mention that for every girl entering, there's millions of people [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9547.46s)]
*  who have tried and who have destroyed themselves and without reason. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9553.62s)]
*  I would find it impossible to not pursue a discovery that I could imagine my way [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9558.66s)]
*  through if I can really see how to get there. I cannot imagine abandoning it for some other reason, [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9569.06s)]
*  fear that would be misused, which is real fear. Right. I mean, it's a real concern. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9579.14s)]
*  I don't think in my work, since I'm doing extra dimensions in the early universe, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9585.06s)]
*  or black holes, you know, I feel pretty safe. But I mean, who knows, right? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9589.78s)]
*  Boar couldn't think of a way to use quantum mechanics to kill people. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9595.140000000001s)]
*  I cannot imagine pulling back and saying, nope, I'm not going to finish this. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9600.26s)]
*  You know, I'll give you a common example of an exceptionally brilliant person, Terence Towell. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9604.74s)]
*  Brilliant. Brilliant mathematician. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9609.460000000001s)]
*  Brilliant. Mm-hmm. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9611.06s)]
*  He is better than out of all the brilliant people I've ever met in the world. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9612.18s)]
*  He's better than anybody else at working on a hard problem and then realizing when it's for now, [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9616.5s)]
*  a little too hard. Oh, that I can do. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9625.14s)]
*  Stepping away. Yeah. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9628.42s)]
*  And he's like, OK, this is now a weekend problem. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9629.54s)]
*  Because he has seen too much for him. Everyone's different. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9633.7s)]
*  But Gregorio Perlman or Andrew Wiles, who give themselves completely for many years, [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9638.18s)]
*  over to a problem. And for every Gregorio Perlman. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9645.78s)]
*  And they might not have cracked it. Yep. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9649.06s)]
*  So you choose your life story. I totally agree. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9651.220000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to say sometimes I take too long to come to that conclusion, [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9654.34s)]
*  but I will proudly say, as most theoretical physicists should, that I kill most my ideas myself. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9659.140000000001s)]
*  OK. So you have to walk away. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9665.7s)]
*  I am absolutely able to say, oh, that's just not. I mean, I'm not going to deny that sometimes I [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9667.14s)]
*  maybe take a while to come to that conclusion longer than I should, but I will. I absolutely [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9673.619999999999s)]
*  will. I will drop it. And that is any self-respecting physicist should be able to do that. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9678.74s)]
*  The problem was with somebody like Andrew Wiles, you were describing to prove Fermat's last theorem. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9684.9s)]
*  It took him seven years. Was that the number? Something like that. He went up into his [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9691.06s)]
*  mother's attic or something and did not emerge for seven years. Is that maybe he did. He was on the [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9694.98s)]
*  right track. He wasn't wrong. And but that's so it could have been interminable. He still might not [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9700.82s)]
*  have gotten there in the end. And so that's the really difficult space to be in, where [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9706.34s)]
*  you're not wrong. You are onto something, but it's just asymptotically approaching that solution. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9713.38s)]
*  You're never actually going to land it. That happens. And he had a really, I would break me [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9720.02s)]
*  straight up, break me. He had he had a proof. Yes. He announced it and they somebody found a mistake [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9727.060000000001s)]
*  in it. That would just break me. Yeah. Because you announced everybody gets excited. Right. And now [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9733.78s)]
*  you you you realize that it's a failure and to go back. It's taking a year for people to check it. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9739.94s)]
*  It's not the kind of thing you look over in an afternoon. And then to have the will to have the [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9744.42s)]
*  confidence and the patience to go back. Unbelievable. Stregurously go through work through [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9749.54s)]
*  it. But then there's another great story. Gary Perlman, who spent seven years and turned down the [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9754.02s)]
*  Fields Medal. He did it all alone. Now, after he turned on the Fields Medal and the Millennial Prize [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9759.94s)]
*  proving the Poincare Conjecture, he just walked away. Yeah. Now, that's a very different psychology. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9765.94s)]
*  That's wired differently. Doesn't care about money, doesn't care about fame, doesn't care about [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9773.060000000001s)]
*  anything else. Yeah. In fact, where is he now? In St. Petersburg, Russia, trying to trying to get a [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9776.9s)]
*  conversation with him. It turns out when you walk away and you're a recluse and you enjoy that, [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9782.98s)]
*  you also don't want to take weird dude in the tie. So it turns out I'm trying. I'm trying. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9788.74s)]
*  Well, if you look at someone like Turing, his his eccentricities were completely different. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9796.58s)]
*  Right. It's not as though there's some mold and I really don't like it when it's portrayed that way. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9804.1s)]
*  These are really individuals who were still lost in their own minds, but in very different ways. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9808.9s)]
*  Turing was openly gay really during this time. He was working during the World War. Just so we [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9816.66s)]
*  understand the era. It was illegal in Britain at the time. He kind of refused to conceal himself. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9825.7s)]
*  There was a time when the kind of attitude was, well, we're just going to ignore it. But he had [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9841.7s)]
*  been robbed by somebody that he had picked up somewhere. I think it was in Manchester. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9847.94s)]
*  It was such a small thing. I don't know what they took. It took like nothing. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9854.5s)]
*  It was nothing, but he couldn't tolerate. He goes to the police and he tells them. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9858.74s)]
*  And then he's arrested. He's the criminal because it involved this homosexual act. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9866.58s)]
*  Now here you have somebody who made a major contribution to the allies winning the war. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9872.26s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. Not to mention the genius, mathematical genius. He saved the lives of the [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9879.779999999999s)]
*  people that were doing this to him. They essentially chemically castrated him as a punishment. That was [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9887.699999999999s)]
*  his sentence. He became very depressed and suicidal. The story is he was obsessed with [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9896.259999999998s)]
*  Snow White, which was recently released. He used to chant one of the little, I don't know if you [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9905.22s)]
*  would call them, poem songs, Dip the Apple in the Brew, Let the Sleeping Death Soop Through. It was [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9913.06s)]
*  a chant from Snow White. The belief is that he dipped an apple in cyanide and bit from the poison [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9920.179999999998s)]
*  apple. Now I don't know if this is apocryphal, but people think that the apple on the Macintosh [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9928.34s)]
*  with the bite out of it is a reference to Turing. Now some people deny this. But some people say he [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9932.74s)]
*  did that so his mother could believe that maybe it was an accident. But yeah, quite a terrible end. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9940.82s)]
*  Yeah, but two of the greatest humans ever. I think the reason why I tie them together, [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9948.98s)]
*  not just because ultimately their work is so connected, but because there's this [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9958.42s)]
*  impossibility of understanding them. There's this impossibility of proving something about their [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9963.86s)]
*  lives. That even if you try to write factual biography, there's something that eludes you. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9969.86s)]
*  I felt like that's fundamental to the mathematics, the incompleteness, the undecidable, [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9975.38s)]
*  the uncomputable. So structurally it was about what we can know and what we can believe to be [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9981.54s)]
*  true but can't ever really know. Yeah, limitations of formal systems, limitations of- Exactly. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9990.26s)]
*  Biography, limitations of fiction and nonfiction. Limitations. So there's so many layers to you. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=9995.54s)]
*  So one of which there's this romantic notion of just understanding humans, exploring humans, [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10002.660000000002s)]
*  and there's the exploring science, there's the exploring the very rigorous detailed [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10008.66s)]
*  physics and cosmology of things. So there's the kind of artistry. So I saw that you're the Chief [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10014.26s)]
*  Science Officer of Pioneer Works, which is mostly like an artist type of situation. It's a place in [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10020.9s)]
*  Brooklyn. Can you explain to me what that is and what role does art play in your life? Yeah, I can [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10026.42s)]
*  start with Pioneer Works. Pioneer Works in some sense, it was inevitable that I would land at [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10033.94s)]
*  Pioneer Works. It felt like I was marching there for many years and just it came together again, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10038.66s)]
*  like this collision. It was founded by this artist Dustin Yellen, very utopian idea. He bought this [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10044.26s)]
*  building, this old iron works factory called Pioneer Iron Works in Brooklyn. It was in complete [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10049.78s)]
*  disrepair, but a beautiful old building from the late 1800s. And he wanted to make this kind of [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10055.22s)]
*  collage. Dustin's definitely a collage artist, works in glass, very big pieces, very imaginative [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10064.42s)]
*  and wild and narrative and into nature and consciousness. And I think he wanted to do that [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10071.06s)]
*  with people. He wanted a place of a collage, a living example of artists and scientists. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10077.06s)]
*  And it was founded by Dustin and Gabriel Florence was the founding artistic director. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10085.46s)]
*  It was started just before Hurricane Sandy. I don't know if people feel as strongly about [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10091.619999999999s)]
*  Hurricane Sandy as New Yorkers do, but it was a real moment around 2012, 2013, sort of paused the [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10096.019999999999s)]
*  project. And you can even see the kind of waterline on the brick of where Sandy was. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10101.94s)]
*  I came in and collided with these two shortly after that. And it really was like a collision. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10107.300000000001s)]
*  I'm science, you know, their art, Gabe makes everything, builds everything with his bare [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10114.34s)]
*  hands. Dustin's a dreamer. They love science. They really wanted science, but science is hard [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10119.78s)]
*  to access. I have always loved the translation of science in literature, in art. I love fiction [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10124.5s)]
*  writers, like really literary fiction writers who dabble thinking about science. And I very firmly [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10134.1s)]
*  believe science is part of culture. I know it to be true. I don't think of myself as doing outreach [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10140.74s)]
*  or education. I don't like those labels. I'm doing culture. An artist in their [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10146.82s)]
*  studio working out problems, understanding materials, building a body of work. Nobody [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10156.98s)]
*  says to them when they exhibit, why are you doing outreach or are you doing education? [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10162.02s)]
*  You know, it's the logical extension. So I feel that if you've had the privilege of knowing some [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10166.42s)]
*  of these people or seeing a little bit from the summit, if you've had a little glimpse yourself, [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10175.14s)]
*  that you bring it back to the world. So we, boom, exploded. PioneerX became science [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10180.82s)]
*  and art. It's not artists who all do science or scientists who do art. It's real, hardcore [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10188.099999999999s)]
*  scientists talking about science and a lot of live events. We have a magazine called Broadcast [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10194.82s)]
*  where we feature all of the disciplines rubbing together, artists working on all kinds of things. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10199.06s)]
*  When I first started doing events there, my first guest, like you, I was talking to people. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10204.66s)]
*  And this was like, I know how to talk to people because I know these guys. And I've been on the [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10210.42s)]
*  interviewee side so much that I know exactly, it was like fully formed for me how to do those [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10214.9s)]
*  conversations. Yeah, you're extremely good at that also. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10219.7s)]
*  You learn how to do it too, though. I mean, I don't think the first one I did, I think I've [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10225.14s)]
*  learned, right? And you acquire, you get better. It's really interesting. And I love to study. I [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10228.42s)]
*  think you do too. I really look into the material and that and I love science. I really do. I want [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10234.26s)]
*  to talk to a CRISPR biologist because I don't understand it and I want to understand it. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10240.98s)]
*  And I saw there's a bunch of cool events and very, very fascinating variety of humans. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10246.02s)]
*  Yes, we have a really fascinating variety of humans. That's a good way of putting it. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10251.86s)]
*  Yeah, so you put in my mental map of like, it's a cool place to go and visit when in New York. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10256.82s)]
*  Yes, you have to come see us. I think you would love it. Also, I should mention fashion. I've [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10263.38s)]
*  seen you do a bunch of talks and there's a lot of fashion. Oh, my gosh. Appreciation of fashion [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10268.66s)]
*  going on. You're giving me an opportunity to give a shout out to Andrea Lara, who's a designer who [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10273.539999999999s)]
*  makes these amazing jumpsuits that I often wear in a lot of my events. She has a jumpsuit design [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10281.779999999999s)]
*  line called Risen Division and she just makes these incredible, they're fantastic. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10289.06s)]
*  We also design patches for all of our events. So there are these string theory patches and [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10293.699999999999s)]
*  consciousness patches. We should show this as overlays. Hopefully there'll be nice pictures [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10298.019999999999s)]
*  floating about everywhere. So I think all of this is just, I just like to experiment with life. I [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10303.539999999999s)]
*  think making the magazine was a big wild experiment. You said with life? With life. Nice. Yeah. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10309.22s)]
*  Yeah. This kind of idea that we were just describing is I find it hard to stop the [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10314.66s)]
*  momentum if I think something can, I could make something. I have to try to make it. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10320.58s)]
*  To me, this is the closest I come to experimentation and collaboration because even though I [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10328.98s)]
*  collaborate theoretically, I have great collaborators, Brian Green, Massimo Parati, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10333.94s)]
*  Dan Cabot. These are my really close collaborators. A lot of theoretical physics is alone and [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10338.66s)]
*  you're in your mind a lot. This is something that really was built, this triad of Dustin, Gabe, [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10345.46s)]
*  and I and all our amazing people who work there and our amazing board. We really are doing it [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10352.98s)]
*  together. You take one element out and it starts to change shape. And that's a very interesting [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10357.86s)]
*  experience, I think, and making things is an interesting experience. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10364.9s)]
*  Since you mentioned literature, is there books that had an impact on your life, whether it's [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10369.46s)]
*  literature, fiction, nonfiction? I love fiction, which I think people expect me to read a lot of [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10373.779999999999s)]
*  sort of sci-fi or nonfiction. I mostly read fiction. I had a syllabus of great fiction writers that had [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10382.34s)]
*  science in it. I love that syllabus. Can you ever make that public or no? [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10390.1s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose I could. But I can tell you some of them as they come to mind. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10395.62s)]
*  Katsuo Ishiguro, who won the Nobel Prize, wrote Remains of the Day, probably most famously. His [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10399.94s)]
*  book Never Let Me Go. It's unbelievable, totally devastating, stunning. I say I really love [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10405.380000000001s)]
*  literature. So when people can do that with these very abstract themes, it's sort of my favorite [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10413.38s)]
*  space for literature. Martin Amis wrote a book that runs backwards, Times Arrow. I love some of his [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10419.539999999999s)]
*  other books even more, but Times Arrow is pretty clever. Do you like it when these non-traditional [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10425.939999999999s)]
*  mechanisms are applied to tell a story that's fundamentally human, that there's some dramatic [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10433.14s)]
*  language? I really appreciate that. Even Orwell is amazing. Hitchens writing on Orwell is amazing. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10440.42s)]
*  There were some plays on the syllabus. I have to think of what else was in there, but [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10451.7s)]
*  there was one book that I think was kind of surprising that I think is an absolute [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10456.1s)]
*  masterpiece, which is The Road. You might say, in what sense is The Road a science? [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10458.98s)]
*  Well, first of all, Cormac McCarthy absolutely loves scientists and science. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10463.7s)]
*  You can feel this very subtle influence in that book. It's a really remarkable, [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10467.619999999999s)]
*  precise, stunning, ethereal, all of these things at once. There's no who, what, where, when, or how. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10477.94s)]
*  You might guess it's a nuclear event that kicks off the book. A lot of people know The Road, [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10486.9s)]
*  from the movie, but really the book is magnificent. It's very, very abstract, [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10491.939999999999s)]
*  but there's a sense to me in which science is structuring. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10497.699999999999s)]
*  Still fundamentally, that book is about human story. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10501.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. The boy. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10505.06s)]
*  The science plays a role in creating the world. Within it, there's still, really, it's a different [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10507.3s)]
*  way to explore human dynamics in a way that's maybe lands some clarity and depth that maybe a more [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10514.42s)]
*  direct telling of the story will not. Yeah. Even surreal worlds, I mean, to me, I don't know why, [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10524.42s)]
*  but I returned to Orwell's Animal Farm a lot. It's another art form to be able to tell a simple story [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10532.1s)]
*  with some surreal elements. Well, just simple language. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10541.3s)]
*  Oh, Animal Farm's incredible. In fact, some of the, I've kind of played with, you know, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10546.66s)]
*  some animals are more equal than others. There are, in Godel, Turing's work, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10551.859999999999s)]
*  there were some infinities that are bigger than others. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10556.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's certain books just kind of inject themselves into our culture in a way that just [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10560.9s)]
*  reverberates and, I don't know, creates culture, not just influences. It's quite incredible how [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10566.9s)]
*  writing and literature can do that. Yeah. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10577.06s)]
*  If you could have one definitive answer to one single question, this is the thing I mentioned [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10580.9s)]
*  to you. This is so hard. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10584.42s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there's an oracle and you get to talk to that oracle. You can ask multiple questions, [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10585.300000000001s)]
*  but it has to be on that topic so it could just clarify. What mystery of the universe would you [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10592.02s)]
*  want that oracle to help you with? You know, it's funny. I should say the obvious thing, [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10598.5s)]
*  but I feel like, I almost feel like it would be greedy. I think of a complicated response to this. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10603.94s)]
*  The obvious thing for me to say would be I want to understand quantum gravity or [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10609.380000000001s)]
*  if gravity is emergent. It's not even something I work on day to day. I mostly just [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10613.060000000001s)]
*  look with interest at what others are doing. If I think I can jump in, I would, but I'm not jumping [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10619.86s)]
*  into the fray. Obviously, that's the big one. There is a sort of sense that with that will come [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10624.5s)]
*  the answers to all these other things. My complicated relationship is that, well, [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10631.300000000001s)]
*  you know, part of the scientific disposition isn't having stuff you don't know the answer to. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10635.7s)]
*  I mean, we're not going to have all the answers, I hope, because then, sort of, then what? [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10641.94s)]
*  And what? Right? It's sort of dystopian. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10647.06s)]
*  I totally agree with you. There's some, I like the mysteries we have. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10650.1s)]
*  I kind of had this assumption that there will always be mysteries, [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10655.539999999999s)]
*  so you want to keep solving them. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10658.42s)]
*  They will lead to more. In the same way that relativity led to black holes, [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10660.02s)]
*  black holes led to the information loss paradox or the Big Bang or what happened before or the [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10663.86s)]
*  multiverse. It's because we learned so much, we were able to escalate to the next level [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10668.58s)]
*  of abstraction. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10674.42s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, we should mention that if you're talking to this oracle, even if you ask the [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10675.7s)]
*  obvious question about quantum gravity, I almost guarantee you with 100% probability that even if [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10679.86s)]
*  all your questions are answered, it's impossible to get to the end of your questions. It says, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10687.22s)]
*  you know, the oracle will say, no, you can't unify. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10695.38s)]
*  Then you say, well, wait. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10698.98s)]
*  And then you say emergent. And then the oracle say, well, everything you think is fundamental [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10700.66s)]
*  is not, it's emergent. It's like, okay, well, this is, we need to, more questions. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10706.9s)]
*  I mean, it's been 100 years more since relativity and we're still picking it apart. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10713.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And there will be, there may be new ones. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10717.7s)]
*  You write that eventually all our history in this universe will be erased. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10722.9s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10727.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tough thought. But again, I think there's a way in which we can come to terms with [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10730.34s)]
*  that, that that's kind of poetic. You know, you build something in the sand and then you erase it. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10736.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10746.02s)]
*  Which, so I think it's just a reminder that we have to be concerned about our immediate [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10746.1s)]
*  experience too, right? How we are to those around us, how they are to us. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10752.42s)]
*  What we leave behind in the near term, what we leave behind in the long term. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10760.1s)]
*  Have we contributed and did we, you know, did we contribute overall net positive? [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10764.74s)]
*  Eventually, I think it's kind of hard to imagine, but yes, all of these Nobel prizes, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10775.060000000001s)]
*  all of these mathematical proofs, all of these conversations, all of these ideas, [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10782.18s)]
*  all the influence we have on each other, even the AI eventually will expire. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10786.74s)]
*  Well, at the very least, we can focus on drawing something beautiful in the sand. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10792.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10798.34s)]
*  Before it's washed away. Well, this was an incredible conversation. I'm truly grateful [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10798.82s)]
*  for the work you do. And me for your work. Thanks so much for having me. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10803.94s)]
*  Thank you for talking to me. Yeah, lots of fun. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10807.78s)]
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Johanna Levin. To support this podcast, [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10811.06s)]
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10815.14s)]
*  Albert Einstein on the topic of relativity. When you're courting a nice girl, an hour seems like [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10820.34s)]
*  a second. When you sit on a red hot cinder, a second seems like an hour. That's relativity. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10828.42s)]
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m4iJIw_84&t=10837.859999999999s)]
