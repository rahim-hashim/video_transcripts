# Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration & Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458
**Lex Fridman:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0)
*  I mean, look, we're adding a trillion dollars to the national debt every 100 days right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's now passing the size of the Defense Department budget and it's compounding. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3.68s)]
*  And it's pretty soon it's going to be adding a trillion dollars every 90 days. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7.36s)]
*  And then it's going to be adding a trillion dollars every 80 days. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9.68s)]
*  And then it's going to be a trillion dollars every 70 days. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11.68s)]
*  And then if this doesn't get fixed at some point, we enter a hyperinflationary [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=14.0s)]
*  spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=17.12s)]
*  The following is a conversation with Mark Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=22.32s)]
*  Mark is a visionary tech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=28.16s)]
*  internet and the tech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential voices in the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=46.64s)]
*  tech world, including at the intersection of technology and politics. This is the Lex Friedman [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=53.28s)]
*  podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=60.32s)]
*  here's Mark Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the best [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=66.16s)]
*  possible one to two years, 2025, 26, for tech, for big tech and small tech, what would it be? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=74.16s)]
*  What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario trajectory for America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=82.0s)]
*  The roaring 20s. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=88.4s)]
*  The roaring 20s. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=89.28s)]
*  The roaring 20s. I mean, look, a couple of things. It is remarkable over the last several years with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=90.16s)]
*  all of the issues, including not just everything in politics, but also COVID and every other thing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=94.72s)]
*  that's happened. It's really amazing. The United States just kept growing. If you just look at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=99.44s)]
*  economic growth charts, the US just kept growing and very significantly many other countries [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=102.32s)]
*  stopped growing. So Canada stopped growing, the UK has stopped growing, Germany has stopped growing, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=105.6s)]
*  and some of those countries may be actually going backwards at this point. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=110.16s)]
*  And there's a very long discussion to be had about what's wrong with those countries. And there's, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=113.6s)]
*  of course, plenty of things that are wrong with our country, but the US is just flat out primed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=118.08s)]
*  for growth. And I think that's a consequence of many factors, some of which are lucky and some of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=122.88s)]
*  which through hard work. And so the lucky part is just, number one, we just have incredible physical [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=130.0s)]
*  security by being our own continent. We have incredible natural resources. There's this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=134.64s)]
*  running joke now that whenever it looks like the US is going to run out of some rare earth material, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=140.32s)]
*  some farmer in North Dakota kicks over a hay bale and finds a $2 trillion deposit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=144.64s)]
*  We're just blessed with geography and with natural resources. We can be energy independent [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  anytime we want. This last administration decided they didn't want to be, they wanted to turn off [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=155.92s)]
*  American energy. This new administration has declared that they have a goal of turning it on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=160.32s)]
*  in a dramatic way. There's no question we can be energy dependent. We can be a giant net energy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=163.76s)]
*  exporter. It's purely a question of choice. And I think the new administration is going to do that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=168.72s)]
*  Oh, and then I would say two other things. One is we are the beneficiaries. And you're an example [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  of this. We're the beneficiary of 50, 100, 200 years of the basically most aggressive driven, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  smartest people in the world, most capable people moving to the US and raising their kids here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=185.76s)]
*  And so we just have by far the most dynamic population, most aggressive, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=190.24s)]
*  we're the most aggressive set of characters certainly in any Western country and have been [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=196.48s)]
*  for a long time and certainly are today. And then finally, I would just say, look, we are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=200.72s)]
*  overwhelmingly the advanced technology leader. We have our issues and we have a particular [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=204.72s)]
*  issue with manufacturing, which we could talk about, but for anything in software, anything in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=210.32s)]
*  AI, anything in all these advanced biotech, all these advanced areas of technology, we're by far [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=214.72s)]
*  the leader. Again, in part, because many of the best scientists and engineers in those fields come [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=220.16s)]
*  to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for just a monster boom. I could see economic [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=224.72s)]
*  growth going way up. I could see productivity growth going way up, rate of technology adoption [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=232.88s)]
*  going way up. And then we can do a global tour if you like, but basically all of our competitors [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=236.72s)]
*  have profound issues and we could go through them one by one, but the competitive landscape, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=242.16s)]
*  it's remarkable how much better positioned we are for growth. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=248.8s)]
*  RG What about the humans themselves? Almost philosophical questions. I travel across the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=252.56s)]
*  world and there's something about the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=257.52s)]
*  intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Sagar who claims it might be the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=263.84s)]
*  Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You at the heart of Silicon [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=270.16s)]
*  Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=277.6s)]
*  JS Yeah. So is this a family show or am I allowed to swear? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=282.24s)]
*  RG You can say whatever the fuck you want. JS Okay. So the great TV show, Succession, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  the show, of course, of which you intended to root for exactly zero of the characters. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=289.6s)]
*  RG Yes. JS The best line for Succession was in the final episode of the first season when the whole [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=293.12s)]
*  family is over in Logan Roy's ancestral homeland of Scotland and they're at this castle for some [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=297.28s)]
*  wedding. Logan is just completely miserable because he's been in New York for 50 years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=302.55999999999995s)]
*  He's totally miserable being back in Scotland and he gets in some argument with somebody and he [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  says finally, he just says, my God, I cannot wait to get out of here and go back to America where [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=312.64s)]
*  we could fuck without condoms. JS Was that a metaphor or okay? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  RG Exactly. No, but it's exactly the thing. Everybody instantly knows what that is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  Watching that instantly starts laughing because you know what it means, which is exactly this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=327.68s)]
*  I think there's an ethnographic way of it. There's a bunch of books on, like you said, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  the Scots-Irish, all the different derivations of all the different ethnic groups that have come to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  the US over the course of the last 400 years. What we have is this amalgamation of the Northeast [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=337.6s)]
*  Yankees who were super tough and hardcore. Yeah, the Scots-Irish are super aggressive. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=345.04s)]
*  We've got the Southerners and the Texans and the whole blended [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  Anglo-Hispanic thing, super incredibly tough, strong, driven, capable characters, the Texas [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  Rangers. We've got the California, we've got the wild, we've got the incredibly inventive hippies, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  but we also have the hardcore engineers. We've got the best rocket scientists in the world. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=368.56s)]
*  We've got the best artists in the world, creative professionals, the best movies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=372.32s)]
*  And so yeah, all of our problems I think are basically, in my view to some extent, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=377.04s)]
*  attempts to basically sand all that off and make everything basically boring and mediocre. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  But there is something in the national spirit that basically keeps bouncing back. And basically, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  what we discover over time is we basically just need people to stand up at a certain point and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  say, it's time to build, it's time to grow, it's time to do things. And there's something in the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=397.68s)]
*  American spirit that just roars right back to life. And I've seen it before. I saw it as a kid [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=404.4s)]
*  here in the early 80s because the 70s were horribly depressing in the US. They were a nightmare [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=408.64s)]
*  on many fronts. And in a lot of ways, the last decade to me has felt a lot like the 70s, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=417.2s)]
*  just being mired in misery and just this self-defeating negative attitude and everybody's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=422.4s)]
*  upset about everything. And then by the way, energy crisis and hostage crisis and foreign wars and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=428.08s)]
*  just demoralization. The low point in the 70s was Jimmy Carter who just passed away, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=434.24s)]
*  he went on TV and he gave this speech known as the Malay speech. And it was the weakest possible [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  trying to rouse people back to a sense of passion. Completely failed. And we had the hostages in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=445.04s)]
*  Iran for 440 days. And every night on the nightly news, it was lines around the block, energy crisis, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=451.36s)]
*  depression, inflation. And then Reagan came in and Reagan was a very controversial character at [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=457.04s)]
*  the time. And he came in and he's like, yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=462.32s)]
*  on the hill and we're going to do it. And he did it and we did it. And the national spirit came [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=466.96s)]
*  roaring back and roared really hard for a full decade. And I think that's exactly what, I think [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=470.32s)]
*  we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here. And I just did a super long podcast on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=475.28s)]
*  Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible professor at Stanford. And he was part [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=479.44s)]
*  of the Reagan. So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic. Yes. And one of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=484.56s)]
*  which maybe you can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=490.32s)]
*  freedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just in general individualism. Yeah, that's right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=496.8s)]
*  Yeah. And as you know, America has this incredible streak of individualism. Individualism in America [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=503.2s)]
*  probably peaked, I think, between roughly call it the end of the Civil War, 1865 through to probably [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=508.64s)]
*  call it 1931 or something. And there was this incredible run. I mean, that period, we now know [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=513.76s)]
*  that period is the second industrial revolution. And it's when the United States basically assumed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=518.88s)]
*  global leadership and basically took over technological and economic leadership from England. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=522.64s)]
*  And then that led to ultimately then therefore being able to not only industrialize the world, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=527.52s)]
*  but also win World War II and then win the Cold War. And yeah, there's a massive [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=532.0s)]
*  individualistic streak. By the way, Milton Friedman's old videos are all on YouTube. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=536.56s)]
*  They are every bit as compelling and inspiring as they were then. He's a singular figure. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=542.48s)]
*  And many of us, I never knew him, but he was at Stanford for many years at the Hoover Institution, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=549.84s)]
*  but I never met him. But I know a lot of people who worked with him and he was a singular figure, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=555.52s)]
*  but all of his lessons live on or are fully available. But I would also say it's not just [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=560.4s)]
*  individualism. And this is one of the big things that's playing out in a lot of our culture and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=566.16s)]
*  political fights right now, which is basically this feeling certainly that I have and I share [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=570.8s)]
*  with a lot of people, which is it's not enough for America to just be an economic zone. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  And it's not enough for us to just be individuals. And it's not enough to just have line go up. And [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  it's not enough to just have economic success. There are deeper questions at play. And also, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  there's more to a country than just that. And quite frankly, a lot of it is intangible. A lot [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  of it involves spirit and passion. And like I said, we have more of it than anybody else. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=595.68s)]
*  But we have to choose to want it. The way I look at it is all of our problems are self-inflicted. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=601.68s)]
*  Decline is a choice. All of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=607.92s)]
*  basically people telling us, people in positions of authority telling us that we shouldn't stand [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=612.8s)]
*  out, we shouldn't be adventurous, we shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  we shouldn't this, that, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about everything that we do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=621.92s)]
*  And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=625.2s)]
*  quite honestly, as of November, I think people are done with it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=629.36s)]
*  If we could go on a tangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=632.88s)]
*  and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book, The Ancient City, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=637.6s)]
*  by, if I can only pronounce the name, French historian, Numa de Nii Foustel de Cologne. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=642.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=647.5200000000001s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said this is an important book to understand [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=649.12s)]
*  who we are and where we come from. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=652.88s)]
*  So what that book does, it's actually quite a striking book. So that book is written by this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=654.56s)]
*  guy as a professor. He likes to do the pronunciations, the foreign language [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=658.56s)]
*  pronunciations for the day. He was a professor of classics at the Sorbonne in Paris, the top [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=663.68s)]
*  university actually in the 1860s. So actually right around after the US Civil War. And he was [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=671.52s)]
*  a savant of a particular kind, which is he, and you can see this in the book, is he had apparently [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  read and sort of absorbed and memorized every possible scrap of Greek and Roman literature. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=682.48s)]
*  And so it's like a walking like index on basically Greek and Roman, everything we know about Greek [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=688.24s)]
*  and Roman culture. And that's significant. The reason this matters is because basically none [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=691.76s)]
*  of that has changed. And so he had access to the exact same materials that we have access to. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=695.52s)]
*  And so we've learned nothing. And then specifically what he did is he talked about the Greeks and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=700.08s)]
*  the Romans, but specifically what he did is he went back further. He reconstructed the people [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  who came before the Greeks and the Romans and what their life and society was like. And these were [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=707.6s)]
*  the people who were now known as the Indo-Europeans. And these were, or you may have heard of these, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=710.56s)]
*  these are the people who came down from the steps. And so they came out of what's now like Eastern [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=714.4799999999999s)]
*  Europe, like around sort of the outskirts of what's now Russia. And then they sort of swept [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=718.0s)]
*  through Europe. They ultimately took over all of Europe, by the way, almost many of the ethnicities [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=722.4s)]
*  in the Americas, the hundreds of years that follow, are Indo-European. And so they were [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=727.28s)]
*  basically this warrior class that came down and swept through and essentially populated much of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=732.0s)]
*  the world. And there's a whole interesting saga there, but what he does, and then they basically, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=738.24s)]
*  from there came basically what we know as the Greeks and the Romans were kind of evolutions [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=743.36s)]
*  off of that. And so what he reconstructs is sort of what life was like, what life was like, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=746.48s)]
*  at least in the West for people in their kind of original social state. And the significance of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=750.8s)]
*  that is, is the original social state is living in the state of the absolute imperative for survival [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=755.52s)]
*  with absolutely no technology, right? Like no modern systems, no nothing, right? You've got [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=760.64s)]
*  clothes on your back, you've got whatever you can build with your bare hands, right? This is, you [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  know, predates basically all concepts of technologies. We understand that today. And so these are people [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=770.24s)]
*  under like maximum levels of physical survival pressure. And so what social patterns do they [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=774.8800000000001s)]
*  evolve to be able to do that? And the social pattern basically was as follows, there's a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=779.5200000000001s)]
*  three-part social structure, family, tribe and city, and zero concept of individual rights, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=784.32s)]
*  and essentially no concept of individualism. And so you were not an individual, you were a member [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=792.08s)]
*  of your family. And then a set of families would aggregate into a tribe, and then a set of tribes [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=796.32s)]
*  would aggregate into a city. And then the morality was completely, it was actually what Nietzsche [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=800.8800000000001s)]
*  talks about, the morality was entirely master morality, not slave morality. And so in their [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=807.36s)]
*  morality, anything that was strong was good. And anything that was weak was bad. And it's very [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  clear why that is, right? It's because strong equals good equals survive, weak equals bad equals [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  die. And that led to what became known later as the master-slave dialectic, which is, is it more [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=820.4s)]
*  important for you to live on your feet as a master, even at the risk of dying? Or are you willing to, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=825.12s)]
*  you know, live as a slave on your knees in order to not die? And this is sort of the derivation of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  that moral framework. Christianity later inverted that moral framework, but you know, the original [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=833.36s)]
*  framework lasted for, you know, many, many thousands of years. No concept of individualism. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=837.92s)]
*  The head of the family had total life and death control over the family. The head of the tribe, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=841.92s)]
*  same thing, head of the city, same thing. And then you were morally obligated to kill members of the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=845.6s)]
*  other cities on contact, right? You were morally required to, like if you didn't do it, you were a [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=850.08s)]
*  bad person. And then the form of the society was basically maximum fascism combined with maximum [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=854.64s)]
*  communism, right? And so it was maximum fascism in the form of this like absolute top-down control [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=861.12s)]
*  where the head of the family, tribe or city could kill other members of the community at any time [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=866.72s)]
*  with no repercussions at all. So maximum hierarchy, but combined with maximum communism, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  which is no market economy. And so everything gets shared, right? And sort of the point of being in [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=876.24s)]
*  one of these collectives is that it's a collective and, you know, and people are sharing. And of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=880.72s)]
*  course that limited how big they could get because, you know, the problem with communism is it doesn't [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=884.64s)]
*  scale, right? It works at the level of a family. It's much harder to make it work at the level of [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=888.4s)]
*  a country. Impossible. Maximum fascism, maximum communism. And then it was all intricately tied [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=891.84s)]
*  into their religion. And their religion was in two parts. It was veneration of ancestors [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=898.48s)]
*  and it was veneration of nature. And the veneration of ancestors is extremely important because it was [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=904.56s)]
*  basically like basically the ancestors were the people who got you to where you were. The [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  ancestors were the people who had everything to teach you, right? And then it was veneration of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=913.04s)]
*  nature. Cause of course nature is the thing that's trying to kill you. And then you had your [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=916.64s)]
*  ancestor, every family, tribe or city had their ancestor gods and then they had their nature [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  gods. Okay. So fast forward to today. Like we live in a world that is like radically different, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=924.64s)]
*  but in the book takes you through kind of what happened from that through the Greeks and Romans [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=929.04s)]
*  through to Christianity. But it's very helpful to kind of think in these terms because the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=932.56s)]
*  conventional view of the progress through time is that we are, the cliche is the arc of the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=937.04s)]
*  moral universe, Ben Storrs justice, right? Or so-called wig history, which is that the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=942.88s)]
*  arc of progress is positive, right? And so what you hear all the time, what you're taught in school [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=947.28s)]
*  and everything is every year that goes by, we get better and better and more and more moral and more [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=951.92s)]
*  and more pure and a better version of ourselves. Our Indo-European ancestors would say, oh no, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=955.5999999999999s)]
*  you people have like fallen to shit. Like you people took all of the principles of basically [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=960.8s)]
*  your civilization and you have diluted them down to the point where they barely even matter. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=965.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, and you're having, you know, children on a wedlock and you're, you know, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=969.76s)]
*  you regularly encounter people of other cities and you don't try to kill them. And like, how crazy is [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=972.56s)]
*  that? And they would basically consider us to be living like an incredibly diluted version of this [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=976.0s)]
*  sort of highly religious, highly cult-like, right? Highly organized, highly fascist, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=981.68s)]
*  fascist communist society. I can't resist noting that as a consequence of basically going through [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=985.84s)]
*  all the transitions we've been through, going all the way through Christianity, coming out the other [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=992.96s)]
*  end of Christianity, Nietzsche declares, God is dead. We're in a secular society, you know, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=996.08s)]
*  that still has, you know, tinges of Christianity, but, you know, largely prides itself on no longer [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1000.4s)]
*  being religious in that way. You know, we being the sort of most fully evolved modern, secular, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1004.48s)]
*  you know, the expert scientists and so forth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1010.24s)]
*  same religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had, specifically ancestor worship, which is [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1015.2s)]
*  identity politics and nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually like, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1020.24s)]
*  worked our way all the way back to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1026.0s)]
*  goes to show that like, you know, in some ways we have fallen far from the family tree, but in [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1029.52s)]
*  some cases we're exactly the same. You kind of described this progressive idea of wokeism and so on [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1034.24s)]
*  as worshiping ancestors. Identity politics is worshiping ancestors, right? It's tagging [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1040.56s)]
*  newborn infants with either, you know, benefits or responsibilities or, you know, levels of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1046.24s)]
*  condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would have recognized it on site. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1050.64s)]
*  We somehow think it's like super socially progressive. Yeah. And it is not. I mean, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1056.72s)]
*  I would say obviously not. Let's, you know, get new answers, which is where I think you're headed, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1061.28s)]
*  which is, look, like, is the idea that you can like completely reinvent society every generation [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1064.72s)]
*  and have no regard whatsoever for what came before you. That seems like a really bad idea, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1069.28s)]
*  right? That's like the Cambodians with year zero under Pol Pot and, you know, death follows. It's [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1072.8799999999999s)]
*  obviously the Soviets tried that. You know, the, you know, the utopian fantasists who think that [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1077.36s)]
*  they can just rip up everything that came before and create something new in the human condition [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1083.52s)]
*  and human society have a very bad history of causing enormous destruction. So on the one hand, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1086.8s)]
*  it's like, okay, there is like a deeply important role for tradition. And the way I think about that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1091.2s)]
*  is it's the process of evolutionary learning, right? Which is what tradition ought to be is [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1095.92s)]
*  the distilled wisdom of all. And, you know, this is how the Indo-Europeans thought about it. It [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1100.88s)]
*  should be the distilled wisdom of everybody who came before you, right? All those important and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1104.0s)]
*  powerful lessons learned. And that's why I think it's fascinating to go back and study how these [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1108.24s)]
*  people lived is because that's part of the history and part of the learning that got us to where we [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1112.24s)]
*  are today. Having said that, there are many cultures around the world that are, you know, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1115.68s)]
*  mired in tradition to the point of not being able to progress. And in fact, you might even say [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1119.92s)]
*  globally that's the default human condition, which is, you know, a lot of people are in societies in [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1124.0s)]
*  which, you know, there's like absolute seniority by age. You know, kids are completely, you know, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1128.16s)]
*  like in the US, like for some reason we decided kids are in charge of everything, right? And like, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1132.32s)]
*  you know, they're the trendsetters and they're allowed to like set all the agendas and like set [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1136.08s)]
*  all the politics and set all the culture. And maybe that's a little bit crazy. But like in a [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1139.04s)]
*  lot of other cultures, kids have no voice at all, no role at all, because it's the old people who [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1142.24s)]
*  are in charge of everything, you know, their gerontocracies. And it's all a bunch of 80 year [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1146.08s)]
*  olds running everything, which by the way, we have a little bit of that too, right? And so I would [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1150.24s)]
*  say is like, there's a doubt there's a real downside, you know, full traditionalism is [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1155.92s)]
*  communitarianism, you know, it's ethnic particularism, you know, it's ethnic chauvinism, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1160.32s)]
*  it's, you know, this incredible level of resistance to change. You know, that's, I mean, it just [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1164.72s)]
*  doesn't get you anywhere. Like it may be good and fine at the level of individual tribe, but as a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1170.32s)]
*  society, society living in the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't, you can't advance, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1173.92s)]
*  you can't participate in all the good things that, you know, that have happened. And so, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1177.76s)]
*  you know, I think probably this is one of those things where extremists on either side is probably [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1182.16s)]
*  a bad idea. And I, but you know, but, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1185.44s)]
*  nuanced way. So the beautiful picture you painted of the roaring twenties, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1190.08s)]
*  how can the Trump administration play a part in making that future happen? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1196.24s)]
*  Yeah. So look, a big part of this is getting the government boot off the neck of the American [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1200.32s)]
*  economy, the American technology industry, the American people, you know, and then again, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1205.44s)]
*  this is a replay of what happened in the sixties and seventies, which is, you know, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1209.92s)]
*  for what started out looking like, you know, I'm sure good and virtuous purposes, you know, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1212.8s)]
*  we ended up both then and now with this, you know, what I, what I described as sort of a form of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1216.72s)]
*  soft authoritarianism, you know, the good news is it's not like a military dictatorship. It's [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1220.56s)]
*  not like, you know, you get thrown into Lubeyanka, you know, for the most part, it's not coming at [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1224.48s)]
*  four in the morning. You're not getting dragged off to a cell. So it's not hard authoritarianism, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  but it is soft authoritarianism. And so it's this, you know, incredible suppressive blanket [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1232.0s)]
*  of regulation rules, you know, this concept of a vitocracy, right? What's required to get anything [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1236.32s)]
*  done, you know, you need to get 40 people to sign off on anything. Any one of them can veto it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1241.76s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of how our now political system works. And then, you know, just this [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1245.92s)]
*  general idea of, you know, progress is bad and technology is bad and capitalism is bad and [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1250.56s)]
*  building businesses is bad and success is bad. You know, tall poppy syndrome, you know, basically [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1255.04s)]
*  anybody who sticks their head up, you know, deserves to get it, you know, chopped off. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1261.12s)]
*  Anybody who's wrong about anything deserves to get condemned forever. You know, just this very kind [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1263.84s)]
*  of, you know, grinding repression and then coupled with specific government actions, such as censorship [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1268.7199999999998s)]
*  regimes, right? And debanking, right? And, you know, draconian, you know, deliberately kneecapping, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1275.12s)]
*  you know, critical American industries. And then, you know, congratulating yourselves in the back [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1281.52s)]
*  for doing it or, you know, having these horrible social policies like let's let all the criminals [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1285.28s)]
*  out of jail and see what happens. Right. And so, like, we've just been through this period. You [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1289.04s)]
*  know, I call it a demoralization campaign. Like, we've just been through this period where, you [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1293.52s)]
*  know, whether it started that way or not, it ended up basically being this comprehensive message that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1296.56s)]
*  says you're terrible and if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you. And the Biden [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1300.32s)]
*  administration reached kind of the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1305.52s)]
*  fronts at the same time. And so, just like relieving that and getting kind of back to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1309.84s)]
*  a reasonably, you know, kind of optimistic, constructive, you know, pro-growth frame of mind, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1316.0800000000002s)]
*  there's just there's so much pent up energy and potentially the American system that that alone [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1322.0s)]
*  is going to, I think, cause, you know, growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  of things proactively that, yeah, and then there's a lot of things proactively that could be done. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1329.92s)]
*  Adam Backer So how do you relieve that? To what degree [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1332.88s)]
*  has the thing you described ideologically permeated government and permeated big companies? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1336.24s)]
*  Chris McGrath Disclaimer first, which is I don't want to predict anything on any of this stuff [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1343.84s)]
*  because I've learned the hard way that I can't predict politics or Washington at all. But I [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1346.56s)]
*  would just say that the plans and intentions are clear and the staffing supports it. And all the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1351.1999999999998s)]
*  conversations are consistent with the new administration and that they plan to take, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1355.6s)]
*  you know, very rapid action on a lot of these fronts very quickly. They're going to do as much [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1358.9599999999998s)]
*  as they can through executive orders and then they're going to do legislation and regulatory [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1362.7199999999998s)]
*  changes for the rest. And so they're going to move, I think, quickly on a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1365.76s)]
*  Adam Backer You can already feel, I think, a shift in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1369.12s)]
*  the national spirit, or at least let's put it this way, I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1370.56s)]
*  I mean, we just saw a great example of this with what Mark Zuckerberg is doing. Obviously, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1375.52s)]
*  I'm involved with his company, but we just saw it kind of in public, the scope and speed of the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  changes are reflective of sort of this, of a lot of these shifts. But I would say that same [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  conversation, those same kinds of things are happening throughout the industry. So the tech [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1390.3999999999999s)]
*  industry itself, whether people were pro-Trump or anti-Trump, there's just like a giant vibe shift, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1394.1599999999999s)]
*  mood shift that's like kicked in already. And then I was with a group of Hollywood people about [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1398.64s)]
*  two weeks ago and they were still people who at least vocally were still very anti-Trump. But [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1402.72s)]
*  I said, has anything changed since November 6th? And they immediately said, oh, it's completely [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1408.5600000000002s)]
*  different. It feels like the ISIS thawed, woke us over. They said that all kinds of projects are [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  going to be able to get made now that couldn't before, that Hollywood's going to start making [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1418.8000000000002s)]
*  comedies again. They were just like, it's like an incredible immediate [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1421.76s)]
*  environmental change. And as I talk to people kind of throughout, certainly throughout the economy, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1428.64s)]
*  people who run businesses, I hear that all the time, which is just this last 10 years of misery [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1432.88s)]
*  is just over. I mean, the one that I'm watching that's really funny, I mean, Facebook's getting [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1437.0400000000002s)]
*  a lot of, that is getting a lot of attention, but the other funny one is BlackRock, which I'm not, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1440.88s)]
*  and I don't know him, but I've watched for a long time. And so Larry Fink, who's the CEO of BlackRock [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1444.88s)]
*  was like first in as a major investment CEO on like every dumb social trend and rule set, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1449.68s)]
*  like every, all right, I'm going for it. Every retarded thing you can imagine, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1457.6s)]
*  every ESG and every possible satellite companies with every aspect of just these crazed ideological [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1464.7199999999998s)]
*  positions. And he was coming in, he literally was like, had aggregated together trillions of dollars [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1471.4399999999998s)]
*  of shareholdings that were his customers' rights. And he seized their voting control of their shares [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1476.24s)]
*  and was using it to force all these companies to do all of this like crazy ideological stuff. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1484.24s)]
*  And he was like the typhoid Mary of all this stuff in corporate America. And he in the last year has [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1487.92s)]
*  been like backpedaling from that stuff, like as fast as he possibly can. And I saw just an example [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1492.32s)]
*  last week, he pulled out of the, whatever the corporate net zero Alliance, he pulled out of [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1495.92s)]
*  the crazy energy stuff. And so like, he's backing away as fast as he can. Remember that Richard [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1500.48s)]
*  Pryor backwards walk? Richard Pryor had this way where he could back out of a room while looking [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1505.76s)]
*  like he was walking forward. And so, you know, even they're doing that. And just the whole thing, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1510.72s)]
*  I mean, if you saw the court recently ruled that NASDAQ had these crazy board of directors composition [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1518.96s)]
*  rules. One of the funniest moments of my life is when my friend Peter Thiel and I were on the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  Meta board. And these NASDAQ rules came down mandated diversity on corporate boards. And so [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1527.84s)]
*  we sat around the table and had to figure out, you know, which of us counted as diverse and the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1533.04s)]
*  very professional attorneys at Meta explained with a 100% complete straight face that Peter [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1536.8s)]
*  Thiel counts as diverse by virtue of being LGBT. And this is a guy who literally wrote a book called [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1542.64s)]
*  the diversity myth. And he literally looked like he swallowed a live goldfish. And this was imposed. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1548.48s)]
*  I mean, this was like so incredibly offensive to him that like, it just like, it was just [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1556.56s)]
*  absolutely appalling. And I felt terrible for him, but the look on his face was very funny. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1559.52s)]
*  And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know, your stock exchange imposing this stuff on you. And then the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1563.6000000000001s)]
*  court, whatever the court of appeals just nuked that. You know, it's like these things basically [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  are being like ripped down one by one. And what's on the other side of it is basically, you know, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1572.4s)]
*  finally being able to get back to, you know, everything that, you know, everybody always [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1576.5600000000002s)]
*  wanted to do, which is like run their companies, have great products, have happy customers, you [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1579.68s)]
*  know, like succeed, like succeed, achieve, outperform, and, you know, work with the best and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1583.44s)]
*  the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1588.96s)]
*  American society. It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire. Well, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1592.88s)]
*  so it was very, you know, there was a moment. So Peter, you know, Peter, of course, you know, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1598.64s)]
*  is, you know, is publicly gay husband for a long time, you know, but, you know, there are other men [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1602.96s)]
*  on the board, right? And, you know, we're sitting there and we're all looking at it and we're like, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1607.76s)]
*  all right, like, okay, LGBT. And we just, we keep coming back to the B, right? And it's like, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1610.72s)]
*  you know, it's like, all right, you know, I'm willing to do a lot for this company, but [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1619.04s)]
*  it's all about sacrifice for diversity. Well, yeah. And then it's like, okay, like, is there a test? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1625.2s)]
*  So, oh yeah, exactly. How do you prove it? The questions that got asked, you know, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1632.64s)]
*  what are you willing to do? Yeah. And I, I've become very good at asking, um, uh, lawyers, uh, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1638.0s)]
*  completely absurd questions with a totally straight face. And do they answer with a straight face? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1643.2s)]
*  Uh, sometimes. Okay. I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1647.28s)]
*  So you mentioned, uh, the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon Valley and vibe shift, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1652.48s)]
*  maybe you can speak to, um, uh, preference falsification. What do they actually believe? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1658.56s)]
*  How many of them actually hate Trump? What, like what percent of them are, uh, feeling this vibe [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1664.24s)]
*  shift and are interested in, uh, creating the roaring twenties in the way they've described? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  So first we should maybe talk populate population. So there's like all of Silicon Valley. Um, and the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1677.52s)]
*  way to just measure that is just look at voting records, right? And, and what that shows [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1682.0s)]
*  consistently is Silicon Valley is just a, you know, at least historically my entire time there [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1685.12s)]
*  has been overwhelmingly majority, just straight up Democrat. Um, uh, the other way to look at that is [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1688.48s)]
*  political donation records. And again, you know, the political donations in the Valley, you know, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1692.96s)]
*  range from 90 to 99%, you know, to one side. Um, and so, you know, we'll, we'll, I just bring it [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1696.48s)]
*  up cause like, we'll see what happens with the voting and with donations going forward. Um, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1701.36s)]
*  I, we maybe talk about the fire later, but I can tell you, there is a very big question of what's [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1705.44s)]
*  happening in Los Angeles right now. Um, I don't want to get into the fire, but like it's catastrophic [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  and you know, there was already a rightward shift in the big cities in California. And I think a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1713.76s)]
*  lot of people in LA are really thinking about things right now as they're trying to, you know, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1718.0s)]
*  literally save their houses and save their families. Um, but you know, even in San Francisco, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1721.84s)]
*  there was a big, right, it was a big shift to the right in the voting, um, in, um, in 24. So we'll, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1725.76s)]
*  we'll see where, we'll see where that goes, but you know, you, you observe that by just looking at, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1729.92s)]
*  looking at the numbers over time. Um, the part that I'm more focused on is, you know, and I don't [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1732.88s)]
*  know how to exactly describe this, but it's like the top thousand or the top 10,000 people, right? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1737.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, and, um, you know, I don't have a list, but like it's the, you know, it's all the top founders, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  top CEOs, top executives, top engineers, top VCs, you know, and then kind of into the ranks, um, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1745.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, the people who kind of built and run the companies. Um, and they're, they're, you know, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1751.2s)]
*  I don't have numbers, but I have a much more tactile feel, you know, for, for, for what's happening. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1754.8000000000002s)]
*  Um, so I, the big thing I, I have now come to believe is that the idea that people have [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1759.2s)]
*  beliefs is mostly wrong. Um, I think that most people just go along. Um, and I think even most [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1766.88s)]
*  high status people just go along. And I think maybe the most high status people are the most [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1774.88s)]
*  prone to just go along because they're the most focused on status. Um, and the way I would describe [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1778.32s)]
*  that is, um, you know, one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the Unabomber. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1783.68s)]
*  Ted Kaczynski and amidst his madness, he had this extremely interesting articulation. You know, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1789.2s)]
*  he was a, he was a, he was an insane lunatic murderer, but he was also a, you know, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1793.68s)]
*  Harvard super genius. Um, not that those are in conflict, um, but, uh, he, it was a very bright [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1797.44s)]
*  guy and he, he did this whole thing. Um, where he talked about basically he was very right wing [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1806.64s)]
*  and talked, talked about leftism a lot. Um, and he had this great concept that's just stuck in my [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1811.3600000000001s)]
*  mind ever since I wrote it, which is he had this concept he just called over social, over socialization [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  um, and so, you know, most people are socialized, most people are socialized. Like most people are, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1819.68s)]
*  you know, we live in a society, most people learn how to be part of a society. They give some [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1824.16s)]
*  difference to the society. There's something about modern Western elites where they're [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1827.68s)]
*  over socialized. Um, and they're just like overly oriented towards what other people like themselves, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1831.76s)]
*  you know, think, um, and believe. And you can get a real sense of that if you have a little bit of [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1837.2s)]
*  an outside perspective, which I just do, I think as a consequence of where I grew up, um, like even [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1842.16s)]
*  before I had the views that I have today, there was always just this weird thing where it's like, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1847.6s)]
*  why does every dinner party have the exact same conversation? Why does everybody agree on every [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1850.8s)]
*  single issue? Why is that agreement precisely what was in the New York Times today? Um, why are these [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  positions not the same as they were five years ago, right? Uh, but why does everybody like snap [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1862.8s)]
*  into agreement every step of the way? And that was true when I came to Silicon Valley and it's just, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1868.8s)]
*  just true today, 30 years later. And so I think most people are just literally take, I think [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1872.48s)]
*  they're taking their cues from it's some combination of the press, the universities, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1876.88s)]
*  the big foundations. So it's like, basically it's like the New York Times, Harvard, the Ford [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1880.64s)]
*  foundation, and, you know, I don't know, um, you know, a few CEOs, um, and a few public figures and, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1884.48s)]
*  you know, maybe, you know, maybe the president of your partisan power and like whatever that is, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  everybody just, everybody who's sort of good and proper and elite and good standing and in [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1894.16s)]
*  charge of things and a sort of correct member of, you know, let's call it coastal American society, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  everybody just believes those things. And then, you know, the two interesting things about that [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1903.36s)]
*  is number one, there's no divergence among the, the, the organs of power, right? So the Harvard [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1906.9599999999998s)]
*  and Yale believe the exact same thing. The New York Times, the Washington Post believe the exact [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1912.0s)]
*  same thing. The Ford foundation and the Rockefeller foundation believe the exact same thing. Google and, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1915.36s)]
*  you know, whatever, you know, Microsoft believe the exact same thing. Um, but those things change [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1918.9599999999998s)]
*  over time, but there's never conflict in the moment. Right. Um, and so, you know, the New York [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  Times and the Washington Post agreed on exactly everything in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1930.48s)]
*  2020, despite the fact that the specifics changed radically, the lockstep was what mattered. Um, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1936.24s)]
*  and so I think basically we, we in the Valley, we're on the tail end of that in the same way. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1942.48s)]
*  Hollywood's on the tail end of that in the same way New York's on the tail end of that, the same [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1945.92s)]
*  way the media is on the tail end of that. It's, it's like some sort of collective pie in mind thing. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1948.96s)]
*  And I just go through that to say, like, I don't think most people in my orbit or, you know, let's [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1953.04s)]
*  say the top 10,000 people in the Valley or the top 10,000 people in LA, I don't think they're [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1956.96s)]
*  sitting there thinking basically I have rocks. I mean, they probably think they have rocks, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1961.28s)]
*  a lot of beliefs, but they don't actually have like some inner core of rocks, a lot of beliefs. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  And then they kind of watch reality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1968.48s)]
*  beliefs like correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they conform to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1971.44s)]
*  the belief system around them. And I think most of the time they're not even aware that they're [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  basically part of a herd. Is it possible that the surface chatter of dinner parties underneath [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1980.16s)]
*  that there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts and beliefs that's going on, but you're just talking [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1986.88s)]
*  to people really close to you or in your own mind. And then the socialization happens at the dinner [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  parties. Like when you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four people who you really [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=1998.48s)]
*  trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the mind, there is an actual belief or a [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2004.4s)]
*  struggle, attention within New York Times or with the, for the listener, there's a slow smile that [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2010.24s)]
*  overtook Mark Andreessen's face. So look, I'll just tell you what I think, which is at the dinner [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2019.2s)]
*  parties and at the conferences, no, there's none of that. What there is is that all of the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2023.36s)]
*  heretical conversations have anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2028.56s)]
*  and any new idea, you know, is a heretical idea. Any deviation, it's either discussed one-on-one [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2033.2s)]
*  face-to-face. It's like a whisper network or it's like a real life social network. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2038.56s)]
*  There's a secret handshake, which is like, okay, you meet somebody and you like know each other a [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2042.96s)]
*  little bit, but like not well. And like, you're both trying to figure out if you can like talk to the [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2046.96s)]
*  other person openly or whether you have to like be fully conformist. It's a joke. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2050.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. Humor. Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke. If the other person laughs, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2055.52s)]
*  the conversation is on. Yeah. Yeah. If the other person doesn't laugh, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2060.48s)]
*  back slowly away from the scene. I didn't mean anything by it. Right. And then by the way, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2063.68s)]
*  it doesn't have to be like a super offensive joke. It just has to be a joke. That's just up against [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2070.3199999999997s)]
*  the edge of one of the use the same bankman freed term, one of the chivalrous, you know, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2073.3599999999997s)]
*  it has to be up against one of the things of, you know, one of the things that you're absolutely [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2077.68s)]
*  required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then, and then at that point, what happens is you [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2082.48s)]
*  have a peer to peer network, right? You have, you have, you have a one-to-one connection with somebody [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2085.6s)]
*  and then you have your, your, your, your little conspiracy of thought, thought criminality. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2090.24s)]
*  And then you have your net, you've probably been through this, you have your network of thought [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2095.12s)]
*  criminals and then they have their network of thought criminals. And then you have this like [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2098.24s)]
*  delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together. Right. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2101.04s)]
*  And the dance, the fundamental, uh, mechanism of the dance is humor. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2105.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's humor. Like, well, of course for two reasons. Number one, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2109.04s)]
*  number one, humor is a way to have deniability, right? Humor is a way to discuss these things [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2113.68s)]
*  without, without, without, with having deniability. Oh, I'm sorry, it was just a joke. Right. So, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2116.88s)]
*  so that's part of it, which is one of the reasons why comedians can get away with saying things. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2120.48s)]
*  The rest of us can't, you know, they can always fall back on, oh yeah, I was just going for the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2123.52s)]
*  laugh. But the other key thing about humor, right. Is that, is that laughter is involuntary, right? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2126.56s)]
*  Like you either laugh or you don't. And it's not like a conscious decision of whether you're [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2131.28s)]
*  going to laugh and everybody can tell when somebody's fake laughing. Right. And this, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2134.48s)]
*  every professional comedian knows this, right? The laughter is the clue that you're onto something [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2137.2000000000003s)]
*  truthful. Like people don't laugh at like made up bullshit stories. They laugh because like you're [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2140.32s)]
*  revealing something that they either have not been allowed to think about or have not been [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2144.8s)]
*  allowed to talk about, right. Or is off limits. And all of a sudden it's like the ice breaks and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2148.48s)]
*  it's like, oh yeah, that's the thing. And it's funny. And like, I laugh. And then, and then of [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2152.88s)]
*  course, this is why, of course live comedy is so powerful is because you're all doing that at the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  same time. So you start to have, right, the safety of, you know, the safety of numbers. And so, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2159.6000000000004s)]
*  so the comedians have like the, it's no, no surprise to me. Like for example, Joe has been [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2163.44s)]
*  as successful as he has, cause they have, they have this hack that the, you know, the rest of us [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2166.8s)]
*  who are not professional comedians don't have, but, but you have your in-person version of it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2170.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And then you've got the question of whether the, whether you can sort of join the networks [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2173.92s)]
*  together. And then you've probably been to this is, you know, then at some point there's like a [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  different, there's like the alt dinner party, the Thorker middle dinner party, and you get six or [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2179.84s)]
*  eight people together and you join the networks. And those are like the happiest mo at least in [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2183.76s)]
*  the last decade, those are like the happiest moments of everybody's lives. Cause they're just [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2187.36s)]
*  like, everybody's just ecstatic. Cause they're like, I don't have to worry about getting yelled [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2190.32s)]
*  at and shamed like for every third sentence that comes out of my mouth. And we can actually talk [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2193.6000000000004s)]
*  about real things. So, so that's the live version of it. And then the, then of course the other side [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2197.28s)]
*  of it is the, you know, the group chat, the group chat phenomenon. Right. And then this, and then [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2201.84s)]
*  basically the same thing played out, you know, until, until Elon bought X and until Substack took [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2205.84s)]
*  off, you know, which were really the two big breakthroughs in free speech online, the same [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2209.52s)]
*  dynamic played out online, which is you had absolute conformity on the social networks, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2213.92s)]
*  like literally enforced by the social networks themselves through censorship. And then also [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2217.28s)]
*  through cancellation campaigns and mobbing and shaming. Right. And, and, but then you had, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  but then group chats grew up to be the equivalent of Samusdott, right? Anybody who grew up in the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2225.28s)]
*  Soviet Union under communism, no, you know, they had the hard version of this, right? It's like, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2229.36s)]
*  how do you know who you could talk to? And then how do you distribute information? And, you know, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2234.08s)]
*  like, you know, again, that was the hard authoritarian version of this. And then we've [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  been living through this weird mutant, you know, soft authoritarian version, but with, you know, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2241.44s)]
*  with some of the same patterns. And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient to, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2245.36s)]
*  to build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor. Yeah, exactly. Well, and this is the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2249.52s)]
*  thing. And then, well, this is kind of the running joke about group chat, right? The running kind of [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2257.2s)]
*  thing about group chats. It's not even a joke. It's true. It's like, it's like every group chat, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2260.0s)]
*  if you've noticed this, like every principle of group chats, every group chat ends up being [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2263.68s)]
*  about memes and humor. And the goal of the game, the game of the group chat is to get as close to [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2268.24s)]
*  the line of being actually objectionable as you can get without actually tripping it. Right. And [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2272.48s)]
*  I looked literally every group chat that I have been in for the last decade, even if it starts some [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2278.16s)]
*  other direction, what ends up happening is it becomes the absolute comedy fest where, but it's [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2282.0s)]
*  walking, they walk right off the line and they're constantly testing. And every once in a while, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2287.04s)]
*  somebody will trip the line and people will freak out. And it's like, Oh, too soon. Okay. You know, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2290.56s)]
*  we've got to wait until next year to talk about that. You know, they walk it back. And so it's [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2293.84s)]
*  that same thing. And yeah, and then group chats is a technological phenomenon. It was amazing to see [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2297.52s)]
*  because basically it was number one, it was, you know, obviously the rise of smartphones. Then it [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2301.28s)]
*  was the rise of the, of the new messaging services. Then it was the rise specifically of, I would say, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2305.12s)]
*  combination of WhatsApp and signal. And the reason for that is those were the two, the two big systems [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2310.24s)]
*  that did the full encryption. So you actually had, you actually felt safe. And then the real [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2314.56s)]
*  breakthrough, I think, was disappearing messages, which hit signal probably four or five years ago [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2319.4399999999996s)]
*  and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of, the combination of encryption [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  and, and disappearing messages, I think really unleashed it. Well, and then there's the fight, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2331.04s)]
*  then there's the fight over the length of the disappearing messages. Right. And so it's like, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2335.12s)]
*  I often get behind in my, my thing. So I set to seven day, you know, disappearing messages and [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2339.2799999999997s)]
*  my friends who are like, no, that's way too much risk. It's gotta be a day. And then every once [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2344.0s)]
*  in a while, somebody will set it to five minutes before they send something like particularly [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2348.48s)]
*  inflammatory. Yeah. 100%. Well, what, I mean, one of the things that bothers me about WhatsApp, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  the choices between 24 hours and, you know, seven days, one day or seven days. And I have to have an [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2356.4s)]
*  existential crisis deciding whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2362.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. Now, of course, what's happening right now is the big thought, right? And so the vibe [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2369.44s)]
*  shifts. So what's happening on the other, on the other side of the election is, you know, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  Elon on Twitter two years ago and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram, and by the way, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2376.56s)]
*  with the continued growth of Substack and with other, you know, new platforms that are emerging, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2380.4s)]
*  you know, like I think it may be, you know, I don't know that everything just shifts back into [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2384.0s)]
*  public, but like a tremendous amount of the, a tremendous amount of the verboten conversations, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2388.4s)]
*  you know, can now shift back into public view. And I mean, quite frankly, this is one of those [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2393.8399999999997s)]
*  things, you know, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what those people are saying, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2398.4s)]
*  and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know, I would argue still like net better for society [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2401.2000000000003s)]
*  that those things happen in public instead of private, you know, do you really want like, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2405.52s)]
*  yeah, like, don't you want to know? And so, and then it's just, look, it's just, I think clearly [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2409.84s)]
*  much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2415.44s)]
*  I mean, to push back and to come back to this idea that we're talking about, I do believe that [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2419.6800000000003s)]
*  people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people, I wonder what [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2424.4s)]
*  fraction of people have that, to me, this is the preference falsification is really interesting. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2428.64s)]
*  What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2435.28s)]
*  as compared to what's out in public? Because like that, the dynamical system that is [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2441.04s)]
*  the difference between those two is fascinating. Like there's throughout history, the fall of [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  communism in multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting because everybody was [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2452.4s)]
*  following, you know, the line until not, but you better for sure, privately, there was a huge [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2458.56s)]
*  number of boiling conversations happening where like, this is this, the bureaucracy of communism, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2465.92s)]
*  the corruption of communism, all of that was really bothering people more and more and more [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2472.2400000000002s)]
*  and more. And all of a sudden there's a trigger that allows the vibe shift to happen. So to me, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2476.64s)]
*  the interesting question here is what is the landscape of private thoughts and ideas and [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2483.28s)]
*  conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially my question is how much [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2488.8s)]
*  dormant energy is there for this roaring 20s? What people are like, no more bullshit, let's get shit [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2496.6400000000003s)]
*  done. Yeah. So let's go through the, we'll go through the theory of preference falsification. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2502.4s)]
*  Yes. Just by the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2505.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So this is, this is exactly, this is one of the all time great books, incredible, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2509.44s)]
*  about 20, 30 year old book, but it's very, it's completely modern and current in what it talks [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2512.7200000000003s)]
*  about as well as very deeply historically informed. So it's called a private truths, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2516.48s)]
*  public lies, and it's written by a social science professor named Timur Kuran at, I think Duke. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2520.8s)]
*  And it's, it's definitive work on this. And so he, he has this concept, he calls preference [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2528.88s)]
*  falsification. And so preference falsification is two things, preference falsification, and you get [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2532.7200000000003s)]
*  it from the title of the book, private truths, public lies. So preference falsification is when [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2536.8s)]
*  you believe something and you can't say it, or, and this is very important, you don't believe [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  something and you must say it. Right. And, and, and, and the commonality there is in both cases, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2545.92s)]
*  you're lying. You, you, you, you believe something internally and then, and then you're lying about [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2550.96s)]
*  it in public. And so the, the thing, you know, the, and there's sort of two, the two classic forms of [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2554.96s)]
*  it, there's the, you know, for example, there's the, I believe communism is rotten, but I can't [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2559.84s)]
*  say it version of it. But then there's also the, the, the famous parable of the, the real life [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2563.12s)]
*  example. But the thing that Voslav Havel talks about in the other good book on this topic, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2569.04s)]
*  which is the power of the powerless, you know, who is an anti-communist resistance fighter, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2572.96s)]
*  who ultimately became the, you know, the, the president of Czechoslovakia after the fall of [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2577.44s)]
*  the wall. But he wrote this book and he, he describes the other side of this, which is [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2580.64s)]
*  workers of the world unite. Right. And so he, he describes what he calls the parable of the green [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2584.88s)]
*  grocer, which is your green grocer in Prague in 1985. And for the last 70 years, it has been, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2589.04s)]
*  50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory to have a sign in the window of your store. This says [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2596.08s)]
*  workers of the world unite. Right. And it's 1985, it is like crystal clear that the world, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2599.7599999999998s)]
*  the workers of the world are not going to unite. Like, like all the things that could happen in [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2604.88s)]
*  the world, that is not going to happen. The commies have been at that for 70 years. It is [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2609.84s)]
*  not happening, but that slogan had better be in your window every morning, because if it's not in [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2613.2s)]
*  your window every morning, you are not a good communist. The secret police are going to come [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2616.72s)]
*  by and they're going to, they're going to get you. And so the first thing you do when you get to the [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2619.8399999999997s)]
*  store is you put that slogan in the window and you make sure that it stays in the window all [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2623.4399999999996s)]
*  day long. And, but he says, the thing is every single person, the green grocer knows the slogan [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2626.16s)]
*  is fake. He knows it's a lie. Every single person walking past the slogan knows that it's a lie. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2630.0s)]
*  Every single person walking past the store knows that the green grocer is only putting it up there [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2634.8799999999997s)]
*  because he has to lie in public. And the green grocer has to go through the humiliation of [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2639.12s)]
*  knowing that everybody knows that he's caving into the system and lying in public. And so it [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2644.08s)]
*  turns into the moralization campaign. It's not just ideological enforcement. In fact, it's not [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2648.3199999999997s)]
*  ideological enforcement anymore because everybody knows it's fake. The authorities know it's fake. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2654.4s)]
*  Everybody knows it's fake. It's not that they're enforcing the actual ideology of the world's [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2657.7599999999998s)]
*  workers of the world uniting. It's that they are enforcing compliance, right? And compliance with [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2662.0s)]
*  the regime and fuck you, you will comply. Right? And so, so anyway, that that's the other side [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2666.64s)]
*  of that. And of course we have lived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2671.68s)]
*  anybody listening to this could name a series of slogans that we've all been forced to chant for [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2676.7999999999997s)]
*  the last decade that everybody knows at this point are just like simply not true. I'll let the audience [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2680.48s)]
*  speculate on those on their own group chats. Send Mark your memes online as well, please. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2685.68s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. But okay, so anyway, so it's the two sides of that, right? So it's private [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2692.56s)]
*  truths, public lies. So then what preference falsification does is it talks about extending [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2697.36s)]
*  that from the idea of the individual experiencing that to the idea of the entire society experiencing [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2701.6800000000003s)]
*  that, right? And this gets to your percentages question, which is like, okay, what happens in a [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2705.36s)]
*  society in which people are forced to lie in public about what they truly believe? What happens, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2709.6s)]
*  number one, is that individually they're lying in public and that's bad. But the other thing that [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2712.88s)]
*  happens is they no longer have an accurate gauge at all or any way to estimate how many people agree [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2716.08s)]
*  with them. And this is how you, and again, this, this, this literally is like how you get something [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2720.56s)]
*  like the communist system, which is like, okay, you end up in a situation in which 80 or 90 or 99% [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2724.96s)]
*  of society can actually all be thinking individually, I really don't buy this anymore. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2730.4s)]
*  And if anybody would just stand up and say it, I would be willing to go along with it, but I'm not [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  going to be the first one to put my head on the chopping block. But you have no, because of the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2737.68s)]
*  suppression, censorship, you have no way of knowing how many other people agree with you. And if the [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2741.44s)]
*  people, if the people agree with you are 10% of the population and you become part of a movement, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2746.16s)]
*  you're going to get killed. If 90% of the people agree with you, you're going to win the revolution. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2750.0s)]
*  Right? And so the question of like what the percentage actually is, is like a really critical [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2755.92s)]
*  question. And then, and then basically in any sort of authoritarian system, you can't like run a [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2760.16s)]
*  survey, right? To get an accurate result. And so you actually can't know until you put it to the [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2763.76s)]
*  test. And then what he describes in the book is it's always put the test in the same way. And this [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2767.68s)]
*  is exactly what's happened for the last two years, like a hundred percent of exactly what's happened. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2770.88s)]
*  It's like straight out of this book, which is somebody, Elon sticks his hand up and says, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2774.4s)]
*  the workers of the world are not going to unite. Right? Or the emperor is actually wearing no [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2781.52s)]
*  clothes, right? You know, that famous parable, right? So one person stands up and does it. And [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2785.76s)]
*  literally that person is standing there by themselves and everybody else in the audience [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2789.84s)]
*  is like, Ooh, I wonder what's going to happen to that guy. Right? But again, nobody knows. Elon [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2792.96s)]
*  doesn't know. The first guy doesn't know. Other people don't know, like, which way is this going [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2798.48s)]
*  to go? And it may be that that's a minority position and that's a way to get yourself killed. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2801.6s)]
*  Or it may be that that's the majority position in that. And you are now the leader of a revolution. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2804.88s)]
*  And then basically, of course, what happens is, okay, the first guy does that doesn't get killed. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2809.12s)]
*  The second guy does a lot of the time that guy does get killed. But when the guy doesn't get [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2813.52s)]
*  killed, then a second guy pops his head up and says the same thing. All right. Now you've got two, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2816.7999999999997s)]
*  two leads to four, four leads to eight, eight leads to 16. And then as we saw with the fall of the [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2821.2s)]
*  Berlin wall, this is what happened in Russia and Eastern Europe in 89. When it goes, it can go. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2825.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. And then it rips. And then what happens is very, very quickly, if it turns out that you had [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2830.32s)]
*  a large percentage of the population that actually believe the different thing, it turns out all of [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2835.76s)]
*  a sudden, everybody has this giant epiphany that says, oh, I'm actually part of the majority. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2839.28s)]
*  And at that point, like you were on the freight train to revolution, right? Like it is rolling. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2843.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. Now the other part of this is the distinction between the role of the elites [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2848.1600000000003s)]
*  and the masses. And here, the best book is called The True Believer, which is the Eric Hoffer book. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2852.0800000000004s)]
*  And so the nuance you have to put on this is the elites play a giant role in this because the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2857.52s)]
*  elites do idea formation and communication, but the elites by definition are a small minority. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2863.04s)]
*  And so there's also this giant role played by the masses and the masses are not necessarily [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2867.7599999999998s)]
*  thinking these things through in the same intellectualized formal way that the elites [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2871.8399999999997s)]
*  are, but they are for sure experiencing these things in their daily lives. And they for sure [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2875.3599999999997s)]
*  have at least very strong emotional views on them. And so when you, when you really get the [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2879.12s)]
*  revolution, it's when you get the elites lined up with, or a new, either the current elites [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2882.64s)]
*  change or the new set of elites, a new set of counter elites basically come along and say, no, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2886.96s)]
*  there's actually a different and better way to live. And then the piece that people basically [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2891.04s)]
*  decide to follow the, you know, to follow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2894.24s)]
*  it. And of course that part is also happening right now. And again, case study number one of [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2897.92s)]
*  that would be Elon and his, you know, he turns out, you know, truly massive following. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2901.8399999999997s)]
*  And he has done that over and over in different industries, not just saying crazy shit online, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2904.8799999999997s)]
*  but saying crazy shit in the, in the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2909.92s)]
*  in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again, turns out saying crazy shit is one of the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2916.0s)]
*  ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress. Yeah. And it's like, well, but then [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2920.56s)]
*  there's the test. Is it crazy shit or is it the truth? Right. And, and, and, you know, and this [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2924.4s)]
*  is where, you know, many, there are many, many specific things about Elon's genius, but one of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2928.56s)]
*  the, one of the really core ones is an absolute dedication to the truth. And so when Elon says [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2932.0s)]
*  something, it sounds like crazy shit, but in his mind, it's true. Now, is he always right? No, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2936.24s)]
*  sometimes the rockets crash. Like, you know, sometimes he's wrong. He's human. He's like [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2941.12s)]
*  anybody else. He's not right all the time, but at least my, my through line with him, both in what [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2944.64s)]
*  he says in public and what he says in private, which by the way, are the exact same things. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2948.72s)]
*  He does not do this. He doesn't lie in public about what he believes in private, or at least [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2952.3999999999996s)]
*  he doesn't do that anymore. Like he's a hundred percent consistent in my, in my experience, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2955.3599999999997s)]
*  by the way, there's two guys who are a hundred percent consistent like that, that I know, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2959.7599999999998s)]
*  you, Lenin Trump, whatever you think of them, what they say in private is a hundred percent [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2963.44s)]
*  identical to what they say in public. Like they are completely transparent. They're completely [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2969.2s)]
*  honest in that way, right? Which is like, and again, it's not like they're perfect people, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2972.0s)]
*  but they're honest in that way. And it makes them potentially both as they have been very powerful [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2975.52s)]
*  leaders of these movements, cause they're both willing to stand up and say the thing that if [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2980.08s)]
*  it's true, it turns out to be the thing in many cases that, you know, many or most, or almost [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  everyone else actually believes, but nobody was actually willing to say out loud. And so they can [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  actually catalyze these shifts. And I mean, I think this framework is exactly why Trump took [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2991.6s)]
*  over the Republican party is I think Trump stood up there on stage with all these other kind of [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2995.04s)]
*  conventional Republicans. And he started saying things out loud that it turned out the base [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=2998.08s)]
*  really was, they were either already believing or they were prone to believe. And he was the only [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  one who was saying them. And so the, again, elite masses, he was the elite, the voters of the masses [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3005.68s)]
*  and the voters decided, you know, no, no more bushes. Like we're going this other direction. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3010.0s)]
*  That's the mechanism of social change. Like what we just described is like the actual mechanism [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3014.96s)]
*  of social change. It is fascinating to me that we have been living through exactly this. We've [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3018.48s)]
*  been living through everything, exactly what Timur Karan describes, everything that Vaslav Havel [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3022.88s)]
*  described, you know, black squares and Instagram, like the whole thing, right? All of it. And we've [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3027.36s)]
*  been living through the, you know, the, the true believer elites masses, you know, thing with, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3033.52s)]
*  you know, with a set of like basically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3037.2s)]
*  masses anymore in a set of new elites that are running away with things. And so like we're living [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3041.12s)]
*  through this like incredible applied case study of these ideas. And you know, if there's a moral [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3045.2s)]
*  of the story, it is, you know, I think fairly obvious, which is it is a really bad idea for [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3049.3599999999997s)]
*  a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3054.0s)]
*  precepts of what they're told they have to do, you know, to be, to be good people like that. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3057.2s)]
*  That is just not a good state to be in. So one of the ways to avoid that in the future, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3060.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe is to keep the Delta between what's set in private and what's set in public small. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3065.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, well, this is sort of the siren song of censorship is we can keep people from [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3070.72s)]
*  saying things, which means we can keep people from thinking things. And, you know, by the way, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3074.0s)]
*  that may work for a while, right? Like, you know, I mean, again, the hard form of the Soviet Union, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3078.72s)]
*  Soviet Union owning a mimeograph, pre photocopiers, there were mimeograph machines that were used to [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3083.6s)]
*  make some of the underground newspapers, which is the mechanism and written communication of radical [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3088.16s)]
*  ideas, radical ideas. Ownership of a mimeograph machine was punishable by death. Right. So that's [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3092.56s)]
*  the hard version, right? You know, the soft version is somebody clicks a button in Washington and [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3099.6s)]
*  you are erased from the Internet. Right. Like, which, you know, good news, you're still alive. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3103.76s)]
*  Bad news is, you know, shame about not being able to get a job. You know, too bad your family now, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3108.32s)]
*  you know, hates you and won't talk to you, you know, whatever the, you know, whatever the version [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3112.32s)]
*  of cancellation has been. And so, so, so like, does that work? Like, maybe it works for a while. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3115.44s)]
*  It could work for the Soviet Union for a while, you know, in its way, especially when it was [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3121.1200000000003s)]
*  coupled with, you know, official state power. But when it unwinds, it can unwind with like [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  incredible speed and ferocity, because to your point, there's all this bottled up energy. Now, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3128.96s)]
*  your question was like, what are the percentages? Like, what's the breakdown? And so my, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3133.04s)]
*  my rough guess, just based on what I've seen in my world is it's something like 20, 60, 20. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3137.84s)]
*  It's like, you've got 20% like true believers in whatever is, you know, the current thing. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3143.84s)]
*  You know, you get 20, 20% of people who are just like true believers in whatever they, they're, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3148.64s)]
*  you know, whatever's in the, like I said, whatever's in your times, Harvard professors [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3152.0s)]
*  and the Ford Foundation, like just, they're just believing about it. Maybe it's 10, maybe it's five, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3155.12s)]
*  but let's say generously it's 20. So, so, you know, 20%, kind of full on revolutionaries. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3159.12s)]
*  And then you've got, let's call it 20% on the other side that are like, no, I'm not on board [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3165.68s)]
*  with this. This is, this is crazy. I'm not, I'm not signing up for this, but you know, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3169.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, they, their view of themselves is they're in a small minority. And in fact, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3172.96s)]
*  they start out in a small minority because what happens is the 60% go with the first 20%, not the [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3175.68s)]
*  second 20%. So you've got this large middle of people and it's not that there's anything like, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3179.7599999999998s)]
*  it's not that people in the middle are not smart or anything like that. It's that they just have [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3184.72s)]
*  like normal lives and they're just trying to get by and they're just trying to go to work each day [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3188.16s)]
*  and do a good job and be a good person and raise their kids and, you know, have a little bit of [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3191.8399999999997s)]
*  time to watch the game. And they're just not engaged in the cut and thrust of, you know, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3195.92s)]
*  political activism or any of this stuff is just not their thing. But then, but that's where the [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3200.72s)]
*  socialization comes in. It's just like, okay, by default, the 60% will go along with the 20% [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3205.8399999999997s)]
*  of the radical revolutionaries at least for a while. And then the counter elite is in this [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3210.8799999999997s)]
*  other 20%. And over time, they build up a theory and network and ability to resist and a new set [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3215.52s)]
*  of representatives and a new set of ideas. And then at some point there's a contest and then, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3222.88s)]
*  and then the question is what happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it's kind [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3228.88s)]
*  of my point. It's not even really, does the 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like, okay, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3232.64s)]
*  what is the thing that that 60% now decides to basically fall into step with? And I think that [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3237.28s)]
*  in the Valley, that 60% for the last decade decided to be woke and extremely, I would say, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3243.3599999999997s)]
*  on edge on a lot of things. And that 60% is pivoting in real time. They're just done. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3250.24s)]
*  They've just had it. And I would love to see where that pivot goes because there's internal [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3256.56s)]
*  battles happening right now, right? So this is the other thing. Okay. So there's two forms of [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3261.68s)]
*  internal, there's two forms of things that, and Timur Kronos, Timur has actually talked about this, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3265.6s)]
*  Professor Kronos talked about this. So one is he said, he said, this is the kind of unwind where [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3268.7999999999997s)]
*  what you're going to have is you're now going to have people in the other direction. You're [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3272.72s)]
*  going to have people who claim that they supported Trump all along, who actually didn't. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3274.9599999999996s)]
*  Right. So it's going to swing the other way. And by the way, Trump's not the only part of this, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3279.6s)]
*  but he's just a convenient shorthand for a lot of this. But whatever it is, you'll have people who [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3283.4399999999996s)]
*  will say, well, I never supported the EI, or I never supported ESG, or I never thought we should [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3288.56s)]
*  have canceled that person, right? Where of course they were full on a part of the mob, like, kind of [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3292.56s)]
*  at that moment. And so anyway, so you'll have preference falsification happening in the other [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3296.8s)]
*  direction. And his prediction, I think basically is you'll end up with the same quote problem on [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3300.48s)]
*  the other side. Now, will that happen here? I don't know. How far is American society willing [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3305.04s)]
*  to go into these things? I don't know. But there is some question there. And then the other part [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
*  of it is, okay, now you have this elite that is used to being in power for the last decade. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3315.76s)]
*  And by the way, many of those people are still in power and they're in very important positions. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  And the New York Times is still the New York Times and Harvard is still Harvard. And those people [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3324.48s)]
*  haven't changed at all, right? And they've been bureaucrats in the government and senior democratic [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3327.44s)]
*  politicians and so forth. And they're sitting there right now feeling like reality has just [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3334.32s)]
*  smacked them hard in the face because they lost the election so badly. But they're now going into [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3338.08s)]
*  a, and specifically the Democratic Party is going into a civil war, right? And that form of the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3343.36s)]
*  civil war is completely predictable. And that's exactly what's happening, which is half of them [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3348.32s)]
*  are saying, we need to go back to the center. We need to deradicalize because we've lost the people. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3352.32s)]
*  We've lost the people in the middle. And so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3357.1200000000003s)]
*  to get 50% plus one in an election, right? And then the other half of them are saying, no, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3360.48s)]
*  we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak. We were too soft. We must become more [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3364.7200000000003s)]
*  revolutionary. We must double down and we must celebrate murders in the street of health insurance [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3367.92s)]
*  executives. And that right now is like a real fight. If I could tell you a little personal story [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3372.2400000000002s)]
*  that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a, there's a professor historian. I won't say who, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3377.6s)]
*  who I admire deeply, love his work. He's a kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking about [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3383.12s)]
*  having a podcast, we're doing a podcast. And he eventually said that, you know what, at this time, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3390.08s)]
*  given your guest list, I just don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3396.96s)]
*  in my particular institution. And I asked who are the particular figures in this guest list. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3405.3599999999997s)]
*  He said Trump. And the second one, he said that you announced your interest to talk to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3411.7599999999998s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. So I just don't want the headache. Now I fully believe he, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3417.8399999999997s)]
*  it would surprise a lot of people if I said who it is, but you know, this is a person who's now [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3425.2s)]
*  bothered by the, the guest list. And I should also say that 80 plus percent of the guest list [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3430.0s)]
*  is left wing. Okay. Nevertheless, he just doesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3436.4s)]
*  that you've kind of mentioned that you just don't, don't want the headache. You just want to just [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3443.84s)]
*  have a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk to your fellow professors. And I think a lot of [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3448.8s)]
*  people are feeling that in universities and in other contexts and tech companies. And I wonder [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3454.24s)]
*  if that shifts, how quickly that shifts. And there, the percentages, you mentioned 20, 60, 20 matters. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3460.16s)]
*  And the, and the, the contents of the private groups matters and the dynamics of how that [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3467.2799999999997s)]
*  shifts matters. Cause it's very possible. Nothing really changes in universities and in major tech [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3472.24s)]
*  companies. Or just there's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3477.76s)]
*  ideas, this new vibes to reverberate through these companies and universities, but as possible, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3486.2400000000002s)]
*  the wall will hold. Yeah. So he's a friend of yours. I respect that you don't want to name him. I also [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3493.0400000000004s)]
*  respect you don't want to beat on him. So I would like to beat on him on your behalf. Does he have [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3498.2400000000002s)]
*  tenure? Yes. He should use it. So this is the thing, right? This is the ultimate indictment [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3502.48s)]
*  of the corruption and the rot at the heart of our education system, at the heart of these [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3511.44s)]
*  universities. And it's by the way, it's like across the board. It's like all the, all the top [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3514.96s)]
*  universities. It's like, cause the siren song for what it's been for 70 years, whatever the tenure [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3518.0s)]
*  system peer review system, tenure system, which is like, yeah, you work your butt off as an academic [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3523.76s)]
*  to get a professorship and then to get tenure because then you can say what you actually think. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3528.96s)]
*  Right. Then you can do your work and your research and your speaking and your teaching without fear [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3534.8s)]
*  of being fired, right? Without fear of being canceled. Like academic freedom. I mean, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3540.48s)]
*  think of the term academic freedom and then think of what these people have done to it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3548.08s)]
*  Like it's gone. Like that entire thing was fake and is completely rotten. And these people are [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3552.56s)]
*  completely, completely giving up the entire moral foundation of the system that's been built for [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3562.48s)]
*  them, which by the way is paid for virtually 100% by taxpayer money. What's the, what's the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3568.08s)]
*  inkling of hope in this? Like what this particular person and others who hear this, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3576.16s)]
*  what can give them strength, inspiration and courage? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3580.8799999999997s)]
*  That the population at large is going to realize the corruption in their industry and it's going [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3584.24s)]
*  to withdraw all the funding. It's okay. So desperation. No, no, no, no, no. Think about [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3587.52s)]
*  what happens next. Okay. So let's go, let's go through it. So the, the universities, the university, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3592.7999999999997s)]
*  the universities are funded by four primary sources of federal funding. The big one is the [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3596.16s)]
*  federal student loan program, which is, you know, in the many trillions of dollars at this point and [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3600.08s)]
*  only spiraling, you know, way faster than the, than inflation. That's number one. Number two is [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3603.6s)]
*  federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know that when a scientist at [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3607.76s)]
*  university gets a research grant, the university rakes as much as 70% of the money for central [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3613.44s)]
*  uses. Number three is tax exemption at the operating level, which is based on the idea [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3619.0400000000004s)]
*  that these are nonprofit institutions as opposed to let's say political institutions. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3623.92s)]
*  And then number four is tax exemptions at the endowment level, you know, which is the financial [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3629.28s)]
*  buffer that these places have. Anybody who's been close to university budget will basically [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3633.84s)]
*  see that what would happen if you withdrew those sources of federal taxpayer money. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3640.0s)]
*  And then for the state schools, the state money, they all instantly go bankrupt. And then you could [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3643.52s)]
*  rebuild. Then you could rebuild. Cause the problem right now, you know, like the folks at university [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3648.7200000000003s)]
*  of Austin are like mounting a very valiant effort and I hope that they succeed and I'm cheering for [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3653.6000000000004s)]
*  them. But the problem is you're now inserting, suppose you and I want to start a new university [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3656.88s)]
*  and we want to hire all the free thinking professors and we want to have the place that [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3661.36s)]
*  fixes all this. Practically speaking, we can't do it because we can't get access to that money. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3664.0s)]
*  Even the most direct reason we can't get access to that money. We can't get access to federal [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3669.04s)]
*  student funding. Do you know how universities are accredited for the purpose of getting access to [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3672.48s)]
*  federal student funding, federal student loans? They're accredited by the government, but not [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3677.04s)]
*  directly indirectly. They're not accredited by the department of education. Instead, what happens is [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3682.0s)]
*  the department of education accredits accreditation bureaus that are nonprofits that do the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3686.56s)]
*  accreditation. Guess what the composition of the accreditation bureaus is? The existing universities. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3691.2s)]
*  They're in complete control. The incumbents are in complete control as to who gets [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3698.16s)]
*  as to who gets access to federal student loan money. Guess how enthusiastic they are about [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3702.72s)]
*  accrediting a new university. Right. And so we have a government funded and supported cartel [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  that has gone, I mean, it's just obvious now it's just gone like sideways and basically any [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3713.28s)]
*  possible way it could go sideways, including, I mean, literally as you know, students getting [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3717.28s)]
*  beaten up on campus for being the wrong religion. They're just wrong in every possible way at this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3720.32s)]
*  point. And it's all in the federal taxpayer back. And there is no way, I mean, in my opinion, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3725.2s)]
*  there is no way to fix these things without replacing them. And there's no way to replace [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3731.28s)]
*  them without letting them fail. And by the way, it's like everything else in life. I mean, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3735.52s)]
*  in a sense, this is like the most obvious conclusion of all time, which is what happens [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3739.6s)]
*  in the business world when a company does a bad job is they go bankrupt and another company takes [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3743.04s)]
*  its place. Right. And that's how you get progress. And of course, below that is what happens is this [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3747.68s)]
*  is the process of evolution, right? Why does anything ever get better? Because things are [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3752.4s)]
*  tested and tried and then the things that are good survive. And so these places have cut themselves, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3755.68s)]
*  they've been allowed to cut themselves off from both from evolution at the institutional level [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3761.04s)]
*  and evolution at the individual level, as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3764.7999999999997s)]
*  And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified centralized [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3771.2s)]
*  corrupt system. We're surprised by the results. They are not fixable in their current form. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3775.68s)]
*  Cot√© I disagree with you on that. I have maybe it's grounded in hope that I believe you can [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3780.64s)]
*  revolutionize the system from within because I do believe Stanford and MIT are important. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3786.08s)]
*  Oh, but that logic doesn't follow at all. That's underpants gnome logic. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3791.28s)]
*  Underpants gnome. Can you explain what that means? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3795.44s)]
*  Underpants knows logic. So I just started watching a key touchstone of American culture with my [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3797.52s)]
*  nine year old, which of course is South Park. Yes. And there is, wow. And there is a, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3801.28s)]
*  which by the way is a little aggressive for a nine year old, very aggressive, but he likes it. So [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3806.08s)]
*  he's learning all kinds of new words and all kinds of new ideas. But yeah, I told him, I said, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3810.64s)]
*  you're going to hear words on here that you are not allowed to use. Right. Education. And I said, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3815.2s)]
*  you know how we have an agreement that we never lied to mommy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3819.52s)]
*  I said, not using a word that you learn in here does not count as lying. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3825.68s)]
*  Wow. Keep that in mind. Orwellian redefinition of lying. But yes, go ahead. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3830.56s)]
*  Of course, in the very opening episode, in the first 30 seconds, one of the kids calls the other [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3834.88s)]
*  kid a dildo. Right. We're off to the races. Yep. Daddy, what's a dildo? Yep. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3838.96s)]
*  Sorry. Sorry, son. I don't know. Yeah. So the underpants. So a famous episode of South Park, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3844.72s)]
*  the underpants gnomes. And so the underpants gnomes. So there's this rat, all the kids basically [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3855.04s)]
*  realized that their underpants are quite missing from their dresser drawers. Somebody's stealing [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3859.04s)]
*  the underpants and it's just like, well, who on earth would steal the underpants? And it turns [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3863.04s)]
*  out it's the underpants gnomes. And it turns out the underpants gnomes to come to town and they've [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3866.48s)]
*  got this little underground warren of tunnels and storage places for all the underpants. And so they [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3870.4s)]
*  go out at night, they steal the underpants and the kids discover that, you know, the underpants [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3873.68s)]
*  gnomes and they're, you know, what, what are you doing? Like what's, what's the point of this? And [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3877.12s)]
*  so the underpants gnomes present their, their master plan, which is a three-part plan, which is [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3880.24s)]
*  step one, collect underpants, step three, profit. Yep. Step two, question mark. Yeah. So you just, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3884.56s)]
*  you just proposed the underpants gnome, which is very common in politics. So the form of this in [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3893.68s)]
*  politics is we must do something. This is something therefore we must do this. But there's no [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3897.76s)]
*  causal logic chain in there at all to expect that that's actually going to succeed. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3905.44s)]
*  Cause there's no reason to believe that it is. It's the same thing, but this is what I hear all the [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3909.0400000000004s)]
*  time. And I'm, I will let you talk as the host of the show in a moment, but, but the, but I hear [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3912.32s)]
*  this all the time. I hear this, I have friends who are on these boards, right? Very involved in these [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3918.96s)]
*  places. And I hear this all the time, which is like, Oh, these are very important. We must fix [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3922.4s)]
*  them. And so therefore they are fixable. There's no logic chain there at all. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3926.32s)]
*  If there's that pressure that you described in terms of cutting funding, then you have the [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3932.48s)]
*  leverage to fire a lot of the administration and have new leadership that steps up that, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3937.36s)]
*  that aligns with this vision that things really need to change at the heads of the universities. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3943.1200000000003s)]
*  And they put students and faculty primary fire, a lot of the administration and realign and [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3950.32s)]
*  reinvigorate this idea of freedom of thought and intellectual freedom. I mean, I don't, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3957.44s)]
*  because there is already a framework of great institutions that's there and the way they talk [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3962.6400000000003s)]
*  about what it means to be a great institution is aligned with this very idea that you're [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3968.7200000000003s)]
*  talking about. It's this meaning like intellectual freedom, the idea of tenure, right? On the surface, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3973.1200000000003s)]
*  it's aligned underneath is become corrupted. If we say free speech and academic freedom often [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3979.92s)]
*  enough, sooner or later, these tendered professors will get brave. Wait, do you think the universities [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3985.04s)]
*  are fundamentally broken? Okay. So how do you fix it? How do you have institutions for educating [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3988.96s)]
*  20 year olds and institutions that hosts researchers that have the freedom to do epic shit, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=3995.36s)]
*  like research type shit that's outside the scopes of R and D departments and inside companies. So [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4004.56s)]
*  how do you create an institution like that? How do you create a good restaurant when the one down [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4010.0s)]
*  the street sucks? All right. You invent something new. You open a new restaurant. Yeah. Like how [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4013.44s)]
*  often in your life, if you experienced a restaurant, that's just absolutely horrible. And it's [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4020.64s)]
*  poisoning all of its customers and the food tastes terrible. And then three years later, you go back [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4024.16s)]
*  and it's fantastic. Charlie Mugger actually had the great, the best comment on his great investor, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4027.36s)]
*  Charlie Mugger, the great comment. He was once asked, he's like, you know, he was general electric [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4031.52s)]
*  was going through all these challenges and he was asked to the Q and A said, how would you fix the [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4035.2s)]
*  culture of general electric? And he said, fix the culture of general electric. He said, I couldn't [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4038.56s)]
*  even fix the culture at a restaurant. Like it's insane. Like, obviously you can't do it. Nobody [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4041.6s)]
*  in business thinks you can do that. Like it's impossible. Like it's not, it's now, now look, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4048.64s)]
*  having said all that, I should also express this because I have a lot of friends to work at these [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4054.24s)]
*  places and, and, and, and are involved in various attempts to fix these. I hope that I'm wrong. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4057.6s)]
*  I would love to be wrong. I would love for the, I would love for the underpants gnome step two, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4062.16s)]
*  to be something clear and straightforward that they can figure out how to do. I would love to, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4066.16s)]
*  love to fix it. I'd love to see them come back to their spoken principles. I think that'd be great. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4069.68s)]
*  I'd love to see the professors with tenure get bravery. I would love to see, I mean, it'd be [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4073.2799999999997s)]
*  fantastic. You know, my partner and I've done like a lot of public speaking on this topic. It's, it's [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4077.52s)]
*  been intended to not just be harsh, but also be like, okay, like these, these challenges have to [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4081.7599999999998s)]
*  be confronted directly. By the way, let me also say something positive, you know, especially post [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4086.0s)]
*  October 7th, there are a bunch of very smart people who are major donors and board members [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4090.32s)]
*  of these institutions like Mark Rowan, you know, who are really coming in trying to, you know, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4094.64s)]
*  I think legitimately trying to fix these places. I have a friend on the executive committee at one [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4098.56s)]
*  of the top technical universities. He's working over time to try to do this. Man, I hope they can [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4102.08s)]
*  figure it out. Um, but I, but the counter question would just be like, do you see it actually [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4107.12s)]
*  happening at a single one of these places? I'm a person that believes in leadership. If you have [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4111.36s)]
*  the right leadership, the whole system can be changed. So here's a question for your friend [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4116.48s)]
*  who have tenure at one of these places, which is who runs his university? I think, you know, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4122.5599999999995s)]
*  you know how I think runs it? Whoever the fuck says they run it. That's what great leadership is. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4126.799999999999s)]
*  Like a president has that power, but how the university has the leverage because they can [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4132.5599999999995s)]
*  mouth off like Elon can. Can they fire the professors? They can fire them through being [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4136.64s)]
*  vocal publicly. Yes. They fire the professors. What are you talking about legally? No, they [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4141.52s)]
*  cannot fire the professors. Then we know who runs the university. The professors? Yeah, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4146.08s)]
*  professors, the professors and the students, the professors and the Ferrell students. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4149.52s)]
*  And they're of course in a radicalization feedback cycle, driving each other crazy. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4153.04s)]
*  What happens when you're put in charge of your bureaucracy where the, where the thing that the [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4159.04s)]
*  bureaucracy knows is that they can outlast you. The thing that the tenure professors at all these [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4162.48s)]
*  places know is it doesn't matter who the president is because they can outlast them, because they [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4167.44s)]
*  cannot get fired. By the way, it's the same thing that bureaucrats in the government know. It's the [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4171.12s)]
*  same thing that the bureaucrats in the department of education know. They know the exact same thing. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4175.04s)]
*  They cannot last you. It's, I mean, it's the whole thing that it's the resistance, like they can be [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4179.5199999999995s)]
*  the resistance. They can just sit there and resist, which is what they do. They're not fireable. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4183.28s)]
*  That's definitely a crisis that needs to be solved. That's a huge problem. And I also don't like that [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4187.28s)]
*  I'm defending academia here. I agree with you that the situation is dire and, uh, but I just think [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4191.68s)]
*  that institutions are important. And I should also add context since you've been grilling me a little [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4199.12s)]
*  bit, you were using restaurants as an analogy. And earlier offline in this conversation, you said that [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4203.280000000001s)]
*  Dairy Queen is a great restaurant. So let's, let's let the listener take that. Dairy Queen is the [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4208.96s)]
*  best restaurant. The best restaurant. There you go. So everything that Mark Addres is saying today, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4214.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't want to cut. You should go order a blizzard. Just one day, you should walk down there [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4219.28s)]
*  and order a blizzard. Yeah. They can get like 4,000 calories in a cup. They can. They're delicious. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  Amazing. They are truly delicious. They'll put anything in there you want. All right. Okay. So, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4227.679999999999s)]
*  but anyway, let me just close by saying, look, I, my friends at the university system, I would just [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4232.32s)]
*  say, look, like this is the challenge. Like I would just, I would just pose this as the challenge. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4235.599999999999s)]
*  Like to me, like this is having had a lot of these conversations, like this is the bar in my view. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4239.36s)]
*  This is the conversation that actually has to happen. This is the bar that actually has to [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4243.92s)]
*  be hit. These problems need to be confronted directly. Cause I think there's just, I think [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4246.72s)]
*  there's been way too much. I mean, I'm actually worried kind of on the other side, there's too [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4250.240000000001s)]
*  much happy talk in these conversations. I think the taxpayers do not understand this level of crisis. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4253.280000000001s)]
*  And I think if the taxpayers come to understand it, I think the funding evaporates. And so I think [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4258.16s)]
*  the, the fuse is going through, you know, no fault of any of ours, but like the fuse is going and [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4262.56s)]
*  there's some window of time here to fix this and address it and justify the money. Cause it just, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4267.2s)]
*  normal taxpayers sitting in normal towns in normal jobs are not going to tolerate [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4272.16s)]
*  this for that much longer. You've mentioned censorship a few times. Let us, if we can go [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4277.12s)]
*  deep into the darkness of the past and how censorship mechanism was used. So you are a good [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4282.32s)]
*  person to speak about the history of this because you were there on the ground floor in 2013 ish [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4289.2s)]
*  Facebook. I heard that you were there when they invented or maybe [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4296.64s)]
*  developed the term hate speech in the context of censorship off on social media. So take me to [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4303.84s)]
*  through that history, if you can, the use of a censorship. So I was there on the ground floor [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4312.96s)]
*  in 1993. There's multiple floors to this building. Apparently there are. Yeah. So I got the first ask [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4316.96s)]
*  to implement censorship on the internet, which was in the web browser. That is fast. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4324.72s)]
*  19 actually in 1982, I was asked to implement a nudity filter. Did you have the courage to speak [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4329.92s)]
*  up back then? I didn't have any problems speaking up back then. I was making $6 and 25 cents an hour. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4335.280000000001s)]
*  I did not have a lot to lose. No, I was asked at the time and then look, I, you know, legitimate, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4341.280000000001s)]
*  you know, in some sense, a legitimate request, which is working on a research project actually [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4345.92s)]
*  funded by the federal government at a public university. So, you know, I don't think my boss [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4349.52s)]
*  was like in any way out of line, but it was like, yeah, like this, this web browser thing is great, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4353.36s)]
*  but like, could it just make sure to not have any photos of naked people that show up? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4357.04s)]
*  But if you think about this for a second, as a technologist, I had an issue, which is this was [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4360.48s)]
*  like pre-image net, right? And so I had a brief period where I tried to imagine an algorithm [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4364.32s)]
*  that I referred to as the breast detection algorithm that I was going to have to design. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4368.96s)]
*  And then apparently a variety of other apparently body parts people are also sensitive about. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4375.04s)]
*  And then I politely declined to do this. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4379.04s)]
*  For just the technical difficulties. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4382.08s)]
*  Well, number one, I actually didn't know how to do it, but number two is just like, no, I'm not, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4384.0s)]
*  I'm not building, I'm just not building a censorship engine. Like I'm, you know, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4386.72s)]
*  I'm just not doing it. And in those days it was, you know, in those days, the internet generally [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4389.92s)]
*  was, you know, a free fire zone for everything. It was actually interesting. It's sort of pre-93, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4393.6s)]
*  the internet was such a specific niche community. Like it was like the million kind of highest IQ [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4397.76s)]
*  nerds in the world. And so it actually like didn't really have a lot of, you know, issues. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4403.6s)]
*  People were like super interested in talking about like astrophysics and not very interested in, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4408.72s)]
*  you know, even politics at that time. So there really was not an issue there, but yeah, I didn't, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4412.8s)]
*  I didn't want to start the process. So I think the way to think about this, so first of all, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4416.96s)]
*  you know, yeah, so I was involved in this at Facebook every step, by the way, I've been [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4421.4400000000005s)]
*  involved with this at Facebook every step of the way. I joined the board there in 2007. So I saw, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4424.64s)]
*  I've seen everything in the last, you know, almost 20 years, every step of the way, but also I've [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4428.320000000001s)]
*  been involved in most of the other companies over time. So I was an angel investor in Twitter, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4432.0s)]
*  knew them really well. We were the founding investor in Substack. I'm part of the Elon [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4435.36s)]
*  takeover of Twitter with X. I was an angel at LinkedIn. So I've been in these, we were the [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4440.0s)]
*  funder of Pinterest. We were one of the main investors there, Reddit as well. And I was [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4445.28s)]
*  having these conversations with all these guys all the way through. So as much talk specifically [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4449.599999999999s)]
*  about Facebook, but I can just tell you like the general pattern. And for quite a while, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4452.88s)]
*  it was kind of all the same across these companies. Yeah. So basically the way to think about this, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4456.639999999999s)]
*  the true kind of nuanced view of this is that there is practically speaking, no internet service [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4461.92s)]
*  that can have zero censorship. And by the way, that also mirrors, there is no country that actually [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4466.64s)]
*  has limited free speech either. The U S first amendment actually has 12 or 13 formal carve outs [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4471.92s)]
*  from the Supreme court over time, you know, so incitement to violence and terrorist recruitment [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4478.0s)]
*  and child abuse. And so, you know, child pornography and so forth, they're like, they're not covered by [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4482.56s)]
*  the first amendment. And just practically speaking, if you and I are going to start an internet [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4486.88s)]
*  company and have a service, we can't have that stuff either, right? Cause it's illegal or it [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4491.12s)]
*  will just clearly, you know, destroy the whole thing. So you're always going to have a censorship [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4494.48s)]
*  engine. I mean, hopefully it's not actually in the browser, but like, you're going to have it for [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4499.12s)]
*  sure at the level of an internet service. But then what happens is now you have, now you have a [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4502.5599999999995s)]
*  machine, right? Now, now you have a system where you can put in rules saying, we allow this, we [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4507.599999999999s)]
*  don't allow that. You have enforcement, you have consequences, right? And once that system is in [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4512.48s)]
*  place, like it becomes the ring of power, right? Which is like, okay, now anybody in that company [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4518.72s)]
*  or anybody associated with that company or anybody who wants to pressure that company [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4524.16s)]
*  will just start to say, okay, you should use that machine for more than just terrorist recruitment [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4527.52s)]
*  and child pornography. You should use it for XYZ. And basically that transition happened, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4531.12s)]
*  call it 2012, 2013 is when there was this like very, very kind of rapid pivot. I think the kickoff [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4537.4400000000005s)]
*  to it for some reason was this, it was the beginning of the second Obama term. I think [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4543.6s)]
*  it also coincided with the sort of arrival of the first kind of super woke kids into these schools. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4547.84s)]
*  You know, that kind of, you know, it's the kids that were in school between like, you know, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4554.56s)]
*  for the Iraq war and then the global financial crisis. And like they came out like super [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4558.320000000001s)]
*  radicalized. They came into these companies, they immediately started mounting these social crusades [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4561.52s)]
*  to ban and censor lots of things. And then, you know, quite frankly, the Democratic party [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4565.120000000001s)]
*  figured this out. And they figured out that these companies were, you know, very subject to being [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4569.6s)]
*  controlled. And the, you know, the executive teams and boards of directors are almost all Democrats. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4573.04s)]
*  And, you know, there's tremendous circulation. A lot of Obama people from the first term actually [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4577.12s)]
*  came and worked in these companies and a lot of FBI people and other, you know, law enforcement [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4580.96s)]
*  intelligence people came in and worked and they're all Democrats, you know, they were all Democrats [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4585.36s)]
*  for that set. And so they just, you know, the ring of power was lying on the table. It had been built [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4588.88s)]
*  and they, you know, pick it up and put it on and then they just ran. And the original discussions [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4594.56s)]
*  were basically always on two topics. It was hate speech and misinformation. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4599.68s)]
*  Hate speech was the original one. And the hate speech conversation started exactly like you'd [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4603.92s)]
*  expect, which is we can't have the N word in which the answer is fair enough. Let's not have the N [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4608.56s)]
*  word. Okay. Now we've set a precedent, right? And then, and then Jordan Peterson has talked a lot [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4613.04s)]
*  about this. The definition of hate speech ended up being things that make people uncomfortable, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4619.280000000001s)]
*  right? So we can't have things that make people uncomfortable. I, of course, you know, people like [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4623.6s)]
*  me that are disagreeable, raise their hands and say, well, that idea right there makes me [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4627.12s)]
*  uncomfortable. But of course that doesn't count as hate speech, right? So, you know, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4630.88s)]
*  the ring of power is on one hand and not, not on the other hand. And then basically that began [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4636.08s)]
*  this slide where it ended up being that, you know, completely anodyne. This is a point that Mark has [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4640.64s)]
*  been making recently, like completely anodyne comments that are completely legitimate on [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4646.5599999999995s)]
*  television or on the Senate floor, all of a sudden, our hate speech can't be said online. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4650.0s)]
*  So that, you know, the ring of power was wielded in grossly irresponsible ways. We could talk about [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4653.36s)]
*  all the stuff that happened there. And then the other one was misinformation. And that wasn't as [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4658.4s)]
*  there was a little bit of that early on, but of course that really kicked in with, with Trump. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4661.28s)]
*  So the hate speech stuff, the hate speech stuff, predated Trump by like three or four years. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4666.24s)]
*  The misinformation stuff was basically, it was a little bit later and it was the consequence of [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4671.36s)]
*  the Russiagate hoax. And then that was, you know, a ring of power that was even more powerful, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4675.28s)]
*  right? Because, you know, hate speech is like, okay, at some point, if some, if something offensive [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4680.8s)]
*  or not, like at least you can have a question as to whether that's the case. But the problem with [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4685.04s)]
*  misinformation is like, is it the truth or not? You know, you know, what do we know for 800 years [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4688.72s)]
*  or whatever Western civilization? It's that, you know, there's only a few entities that can [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4693.92s)]
*  determine the truth on every topic. You know, there's God, you know, there's the King. We don't [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4697.5199999999995s)]
*  have those anymore. And the rest of us are all imperfect and flawed. And so the idea that any [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4701.92s)]
*  group of experts is going to sit around the table and decide on the truth is, you know, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4706.32s)]
*  deeply anti-Western and deeply authoritarian. And somehow the misinformation kind of crusade [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4709.599999999999s)]
*  went from the Russiagate hoax into just full blown. We're going to use that weapon for whatever [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4714.16s)]
*  we want. And then, and then of course, then the culminating moment on that, that really was the [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4719.5199999999995s)]
*  straw that broke the camel's back was we're going to censor all theories that the COVID virus might [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4723.04s)]
*  have been manufactured in a lab as misinformation. And inside these companies, like that was the [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4728.16s)]
*  point where people for the first time, this is like what, three years ago, for the first time, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4733.28s)]
*  they were like, that was when it sunk in where it's just like, okay, this has spun completely [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4736.8s)]
*  out of control. But anyway, that's how we got to where we are. And then basically that spell [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4741.28s)]
*  lasted that, that, that complex existed and got expanded basically from call it 2013 to 2023. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4746.5599999999995s)]
*  I think basically two things broke it. One is Substack. And so, and I'm super proud of those [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4754.48s)]
*  guys because they started from scratch and declared right up front that they were going [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4760.08s)]
*  to be a free speech platform. And they came under intense pressure, including from the press. And [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4764.32s)]
*  they tried to beat them to the ground and kill them. And intense pressure, by the way, from, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4771.76s)]
*  let's say certain of the platform companies, basically threatening them. And they stood up [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4775.44s)]
*  to it. And sitting here today, they have the widest spectrum of speech and conversation [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4780.0s)]
*  anywhere on planet earth. And they've done a great job. And it's worked by the way. It's great. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4784.64s)]
*  And then obviously Elon, with X was the hammer blow. And then I see the third one now is what [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4788.64s)]
*  Mark is doing at Facebook. And there's also like singular moments. I think you've spoken about this, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4794.4800000000005s)]
*  which like John Stewart going on Stephen Colbert and talking about the lab leak theory. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4801.360000000001s)]
*  I just, there's certain moments to just kind of shake everybody up. The right person, the right [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4809.280000000001s)]
*  time. It's a wake up call. So that there, and I will tell you like, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4814.72s)]
*  and I should say John Stewart attacked me recently, so I'm not that thrilled about him. But I would say [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4819.84s)]
*  I was a long run fan of John Stewart. I watched probably every episode of The Daily Show when he [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4824.240000000001s)]
*  was on it for probably 20 years. But he did a very important public service. And it was that [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4828.0s)]
*  appearance on The Colbert Show. And I don't know how broadly this is, you know, at the time it was [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4834.0s)]
*  in the news briefly, but I don't know how, if people remember this, but I will tell you in the [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4837.360000000001s)]
*  rooms where people discuss what is misinformation and these policies, that was a very big moment. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4840.88s)]
*  That was probably actually the key catalyzing moment. And I think he exhibited, I would say, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4844.88s)]
*  conspicuous bravery and had a big impact with that. And yeah, for people who don't recall what he did, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4848.400000000001s)]
*  and this was in the full blown, like you absolutely, you know, you absolutely must [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4853.68s)]
*  lock down for two years. You absolutely must keep all the schools closed. You absolutely must have [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4856.88s)]
*  everybody work from home. You absolutely must wear a mask, like the whole thing. And one of those was [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4860.24s)]
*  you absolutely must believe that COVID was completely natural. You must believe that. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4865.44s)]
*  And not believing that means you're a fascist Nazi Trump supporter, mega evil QAnon person, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4870.879999999999s)]
*  right? And that was like uniform and that was enforced by the social media companies. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4875.839999999999s)]
*  And like I said, that was the peak. And John Stewart went on The Colbert Show. And I don't [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4880.16s)]
*  know if they planned it or not, because Colbert looked shocked. I don't know how much it was a [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4884.5599999999995s)]
*  bit, but he went on there and he just had one of these like, the Emperor's wearing no clothes [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  things where he said, it's just not plausible that you had the COVID super virus appear [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4892.24s)]
*  300 yards down the street from the Wuhan Institute of lethal coronaviruses. Like it's just not [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4896.96s)]
*  plausible that that certainly that you could just rule that out. And then there was another [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4903.92s)]
*  key moment. Actually, the more serious version was I think the author Nicholson Baker wrote a [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4907.599999999999s)]
*  big piece for New York magazine. Nicholson Baker is like one of our great novelist writers of our [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4910.639999999999s)]
*  time. And he wrote the piece and he did the complete addressing of it. And that was the first, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4915.44s)]
*  I think that was the first legit, there had been like alt, renegade, there had been people running [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4920.08s)]
*  around saying this, but getting censored all over the place. That was the first one that was like [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4924.16s)]
*  in the mainstream press where he, and he talked to all the heretics and he just like laid the whole [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4927.2s)]
*  thing out. And that was a moment. And I remember, let's say a board meeting at one of these companies [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4931.68s)]
*  after that, where basically everybody looked around the table and it was like, all right, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4935.6s)]
*  I guess we're not, we don't need to censor that anymore. And then of course what immediately [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4939.76s)]
*  follows from that is, well, wait a minute, why were we censoring that in the first place? And [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4945.28s)]
*  and then the downstream, not that day, but the downstream conversations were like, okay, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4950.08s)]
*  if we made such a giant, in retrospect, if we all made such a giant collective mistake [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4953.36s)]
*  censoring that, then what does that say about the rest of our regime? And I think that was the thread [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4958.16s)]
*  in the sweater that started unraveling. I should say it again. I do think that the John Stuart [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4961.84s)]
*  appearance and the statement he made was a courageous act. I agree. I think we need to [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4966.24s)]
*  have more of that in the world. And like you said, Elon, everything he did with X is a series of [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4970.88s)]
*  courageous acts. And I think what, um, Zuck, what Mark Zuckerberg did on Rogan a few days ago, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4979.28s)]
*  is a courageous act. Can you just speak to that? He has become, I think, an outstanding [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4988.0s)]
*  communicator, right? And he's, you know, somebody who came in for a lot of criticism earlier in his [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4993.5199999999995s)]
*  career on that front. And I think he's, you know, he's one of these guys who can sit down and talk [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=4996.96s)]
*  for three hours and, and make complete sense. And, you know, as you do with, with all of all of your [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5001.36s)]
*  episodes, like when somebody sits and talks for three hours, like you really get a sense of somebody [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5006.64s)]
*  because it's, it's really hard to be artificial for that long. And, you know, he's, he's not done that [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5010.320000000001s)]
*  repeatedly. He's really good at it. And then look, I, again, I would maybe put him in the third [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5014.4800000000005s)]
*  category now with, um, certainly after that appearance, uh, I would say, um, I would put him [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5017.76s)]
*  up there now with, you know, kind of be line of Trump in the sense of the public or the, the public [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5022.160000000001s)]
*  and the private are now synchronized. I guess I'd say that, like he, he, he sat on that show, what [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5025.280000000001s)]
*  he really believes. He said all the same things that he says in private. Like, I don't think [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5029.04s)]
*  there's really any, any discrepancy anymore. Um, I would say he has always taken upon himself [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5032.24s)]
*  a level of obligation responsibility to running a company, the size of Metta and to running [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5037.679999999999s)]
*  services that are that large. Um, and I think, you know, his conception of what he's doing, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5043.36s)]
*  which I think is correct is he's running services that are bigger than any country, right? He's [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5048.0s)]
*  running, you know, over 3 billion people use those services. Um, and so, and then, you know, the [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5051.36s)]
*  company has, you know, many tens of thousands of employees and many investors and it's a public [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5056.24s)]
*  company and he thinks very deeply and seriously about his responsibilities. Um, and so, you know, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5060.08s)]
*  he has not felt like he has had, let's just say the complete flexibility that he, a lot has had. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5065.12s)]
*  And, you know, people could argue that one way or the other, but, you know, he's, he's, you know, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5069.92s)]
*  yeah, he's, he's, you know, he talked about a lot. He's, he's evolved a lot. A lot of it was, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5073.84s)]
*  he learned a lot. And by the way, I'm going to put myself right back up there. Like I'm not claiming [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5077.5199999999995s)]
*  any huge foresight or heroism on any of this. Like I've also learned, learned a lot. Like, like I, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5081.5199999999995s)]
*  my views on things are very different than they were 10 years ago on lots of topics. And so, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5086.08s)]
*  you know, I've been on a learning journey. He's been on a learning journey. He is a really, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5090.48s)]
*  really good learner. He assimilates information, you know, as good as or better than anybody else [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5094.88s)]
*  I know. The other thing I guess I would just say is he talked on that show about something very [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5100.0s)]
*  important, which is when you're in a role where you're running a company like that, there are a [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5105.28s)]
*  set of decisions that you get to make and you deserve to be criticized for those decisions and [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5109.44s)]
*  so forth. And it's valid. But you are under tremendous external pressure as well. And by [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5114.08s)]
*  the way, you're under tremendous internal pressure. You've got your employees coming at you. You've [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5120.4s)]
*  got your executives in some cases coming at you. You've got your board in some cases coming at you. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5124.48s)]
*  You've got your shareholders coming at you. So you've got your internal pressures, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5129.04s)]
*  but you also have the press coming at you. You've got academia coming at you. You've got the entire [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5132.4s)]
*  nonprofit complex coming, activist complex coming at you. And then really critically, you know, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5137.36s)]
*  he talked about a Rogan and these companies all went through this. In this last, especially five [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5142.24s)]
*  years, you have the government coming at you. And, you know, that's the really, you know, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5147.28s)]
*  stinky end of the pool where, you know, the government was, in my view, you know, illegally [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5151.76s)]
*  exerting, you know, just in flagrant violation of the first amendment and federal laws on speech [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5156.32s)]
*  and coercion and conspiracy, forcing these companies to engage in activities. You know, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5160.639999999999s)]
*  again, in some cases they may have wanted to do, but in other cases they clearly didn't want to do [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5166.4s)]
*  and felt like they had to do. And the level of pressure, like I was going to say, like I've known [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5169.36s)]
*  every CEO at Twitter, they've all had the exact same experience, which when they were in the job, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5174.88s)]
*  it was just daily beatings. Like it's just getting punched in the face every single day, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5179.2s)]
*  constantly. And, you know, Mark is very good at getting physically punched in the face. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5184.0s)]
*  Get better and better, yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5189.599999999999s)]
*  And he is, and he, you know, and he's very good at, you know, taking a punch and he has taken many, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5190.88s)]
*  many punches. So I would encourage people to have a level of sympathy for these are not [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5195.2s)]
*  kings. These are people who operate with like, I would say extraordinary levels of external pressure. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5199.12s)]
*  I think if I had been in his job for the last decade, I would be a little puddle on the floor. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5204.0s)]
*  And so it says, I think a lot about him that he has risen to this occasion the way that he has. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5208.96s)]
*  And by the way, I should also say, you know, the cynicism of course is immediately out and, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5213.599999999999s)]
*  you know, it's a legitimate thing for people to say, but, you know, it's like, oh, you're only [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5216.8s)]
*  doing this because of Trump or, you know, whatever. And it's just like, no, like he has been thinking [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5220.48s)]
*  about and working on these things and trying to figure them out for a very long time. And so I [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5224.64s)]
*  think what you saw are legitimate, deeply held beliefs, not some, you know, sort of just in the [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5228.56s)]
*  moment thing that could change at any time. So what do you think it's like to be him and [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5233.360000000001s)]
*  other leaders of companies to be you and withstand internal pressure and external pressure? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5237.84s)]
*  What's that life like? Is it deeply lonely? That's a great question. So leaders are lonely [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5244.56s)]
*  to start with. And this is one of those things where almost nobody has sympathy, right? Nobody [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5249.200000000001s)]
*  feels sorry for a CEO, right? Like it's not a thing, right? And, you know, and again, legitimately [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5253.44s)]
*  so, like CEOs get paid a lot, like the whole thing, there's a lot of great things about it. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5258.48s)]
*  So it's not like they should be out there asking for a lot of sympathy, but it is the case that [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5261.44s)]
*  they are human beings. And it is the case that it is a lonely job. And the reason it's a lonely job [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5264.639999999999s)]
*  is because your words carry tremendous weight and you are dealing with extremely complicated issues [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5269.759999999999s)]
*  and you're under a tremendous amount of emotional, you know, personal emotional stress. And, you know, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5275.599999999999s)]
*  you often end up not being able to sleep well and you end up not being able to like keep up an [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5280.4s)]
*  exercise routine and all those things. And, you know, you're come under family stress because [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5283.759999999999s)]
*  you're working all the time or my partner, Ben, you know, was he was CEO of our last company before [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5286.96s)]
*  we started the venture firm. He said, you know, the problem he had like with his family life was he [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5291.28s)]
*  would, even when he was home at night, he wasn't home because he was in his head trying to solve [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5295.28s)]
*  all the business problems. And so he was like supposed to be like having dinner with his kids [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5300.08s)]
*  and he was physically there, but he wasn't mentally there. So, you know, you kind of get, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5302.799999999999s)]
*  you get that a lot, but the key thing is like, you can't talk to people, right? So you can't, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5305.92s)]
*  I mean, you can talk to your spouse and your kids, but like they don't understand that they're [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5309.44s)]
*  not working in your company. They don't understand, they have the context to really help you. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5312.4s)]
*  If you talk to your executives, they all have agendas, right? And so they're all, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5316.4s)]
*  they can't resist, like it's just human nature. And so you can't necessarily rely on what they say. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5320.879999999999s)]
*  It's very hard in most companies to talk to your board because they can fire you, right? Now, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5326.5599999999995s)]
*  Mark has the situation because he has control. It actually turns out he can talk to his board [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5332.08s)]
*  and Mark talks to us about many things that he does that most CEOs won't talk to their boards [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5335.5199999999995s)]
*  about because we literally, because we can't fire him. But the general, including all the CEOs [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5338.88s)]
*  of Twitter, none of them had control and so they could all get fired. So you can't talk to the [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5344.08s)]
*  board members. They're going to fire you. You can't talk to shareholders because they'll just like [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5349.2s)]
*  dump your stock, right? Like, okay, so who's the, so every once in a while, what you find is basically [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5352.32s)]
*  the best case scenario they have is they can talk to other CEOs. And there's these little [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5357.92s)]
*  organizations where they kind of pair up and do that. And so they maybe get a little bit out of [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5361.76s)]
*  that, but even that's fraught with peril because can you really talk about confidential information [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5364.72s)]
*  with another CEO, insider trading risk? And so it's just a very lonely and isolating thing [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5368.8s)]
*  to start with. And then on top of that, you apply pressure, right? And that's where it gets painful. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5374.56s)]
*  And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on this internal external pressure thing. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5380.56s)]
*  My general experience with companies is that they can withstand most forms of external pressure as [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5385.2s)]
*  long as they retain internal coherence, right? So as long as the internal team is really bonded [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5392.0s)]
*  together and supporting each other, most forms of external pressure you can withstand. And by that, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5398.88s)]
*  I mean, investors dump your stock, you lose your biggest customers, whatever negative article, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5404.32s)]
*  negative headline, you can withstand all that. And basically, in fact, many of those forms of [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5410.72s)]
*  pressure can be bonding experiences for the team where they come out stronger. What you 100% cannot [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5416.24s)]
*  withstand is the internal crack. And what I always look for in high pressure corporate situations [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5421.52s)]
*  now is the moment when the internal team cracks because I know the minute that happens, we're in [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5426.8s)]
*  a different regime. It's like the solid has turned into liquid. We're in a different regime and the [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5433.120000000001s)]
*  whole thing can unravel in the next week because then people turn it. I mean, this is what's [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5439.200000000001s)]
*  happening in Los Angeles right now. The mayor and the fire chief turned on each other and [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5442.96s)]
*  that's it. That government is dysfunctional. It is never going to get put back together again. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5448.0s)]
*  It is over. It is not going to work ever again. And that's what happens inside companies. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5452.56s)]
*  And so somebody like Mark is under profound internal pressure and external pressure at [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5457.76s)]
*  the same time. Now, he's been very good at maintaining the coherence of his executive team, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5463.84s)]
*  but he has had over the years a lot of activist employees as a lot of these companies have had. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5468.0s)]
*  And so that's been continuous pressure. And then the final thing I'd say is I said that [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5473.2s)]
*  companies can withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all. And the special, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5476.8s)]
*  though not all one is government pressure. Is it when your government comes for you? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5480.72s)]
*  Like, yeah, any CEO who thinks that they're bigger than their government [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5484.64s)]
*  has that notion beaten out of them in short order. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5490.08s)]
*  Can you just linger on that? Because it is maybe educating and deeply disturbing. You've spoken [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5492.72s)]
*  about it before, but we're speaking about again, this government pressure. So you think they've [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5499.92s)]
*  crossed the line into essentially criminal levels of pressure, flagrant criminality, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5505.76s)]
*  felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can actually cite the laws, but yes, absolute criminality. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5512.64s)]
*  Can you explain how those possible to happen and maybe on a hopeful note, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5519.68s)]
*  how we can avoid that happening again? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5525.12s)]
*  So I should start with is a lot of this now is in the public record, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5527.76s)]
*  which is good because it needs to be in the public record. And so there's three forms of [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5531.4400000000005s)]
*  things that are in the public record that people can look at. So one is the Twitter files, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5534.64s)]
*  which Elon put out with the set of journalists when he took over. And I will just tell you, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5538.64s)]
*  the Twitter files are a hundred percent representative of what I've seen at every [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5541.92s)]
*  other one of these companies. And so you can just see what happened in Twitter and you can just [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5544.8s)]
*  assume that that happened in these other companies, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5548.96s)]
*  of pressure that they got. So that's number one, that stuff, you can just read it and you should, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5553.04s)]
*  if you haven't. The second is, Mark referenced this in the Rogan podcast, there's a Congressman [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5557.12s)]
*  Jim Jordan, who has a committee congressional committee called the weaponization committee. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5562.64s)]
*  And they in the last, you know, whatever three years have done a full scale investigation of [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5566.64s)]
*  this and Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation. And those have many of those [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5570.56s)]
*  have now been made public and you can download those reports and there's like, like 2000 pages [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5575.92s)]
*  worth of material on that. And that's essentially the Facebook version of the Twitter files just [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5579.280000000001s)]
*  arrived at with a different mechanism. And then third is Mark himself talking about this on, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5583.4400000000005s)]
*  on, on Rogan. So I'll, you know, just defer to his comments there, but yeah, basically what, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5587.92s)]
*  what those three forms of information show you is basically the government, you know, over time [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5592.24s)]
*  and then culminating in 2020, 2021, you know, in the last four years just decided that the first [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5597.5199999999995s)]
*  amendment didn't apply to them. And they just decided that federal laws around free speech and [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5602.639999999999s)]
*  around conspiracies to take away the rights of citizens just don't apply. And they just decided [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5607.679999999999s)]
*  that they can just arbitrarily pressure, just like literally arbitrarily call up companies [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5613.679999999999s)]
*  and threaten and bully and yell and scream and, and, you know, threaten repercussions and force [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5618.24s)]
*  people to force them to censor. And, you know, there's this whole thing of like, well, the first [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5622.5599999999995s)]
*  amendment only applies to, you know, the government doesn't apply to companies. It's like, well, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5627.44s)]
*  there's actually a little bit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely applies to the [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5630.8s)]
*  government. Like 100% the first amendment applies to the government, by the way, so does the fourth [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5634.719999999999s)]
*  amendment and the fifth amendment, including the right to due process also applies to the government. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5640.639999999999s)]
*  There was no due process at all to any of the censorship regime that was put in place. There [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5644.24s)]
*  was no due process put in place, by the way, for debanking either. Those are just as serious [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5648.24s)]
*  violations as the, as the free speech violations. And so this is just like flagrant flagrant [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5652.88s)]
*  unconstitutional behavior. And then there are specific federal statutes. There's it's 18241 [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5657.2s)]
*  and 18242. And one of them applies to federal employees, government employees. And the other [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5661.84s)]
*  one applies to private actors around what's called deprivation of rights and conspiracy to [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5666.719999999999s)]
*  deprive rights. And it is not legal according to the United States criminal code for government [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5672.32s)]
*  employees or in a conspiracy private entities to take away constitutional rights. And interestingly, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5676.96s)]
*  some of those constitutional rights are enumerated, for example, in the first amendment, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5683.44s)]
*  freedom of speech. And then some of those rights actually do not need to be enumerated. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5686.5599999999995s)]
*  It is, if the government takes away rights that you have, they don't need to be specifically [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5690.799999999999s)]
*  enumerated rights in the constitution in order to still be a felony. The constitution does not, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5695.44s)]
*  very specifically does not say you only have the rights that it gives you. It says you have all the [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5700.96s)]
*  rights that have not been previously defined as being taken away from you. Right. And so debanking [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5704.64s)]
*  qualifies as a right, right to access the financial system is every bit something that's subject to [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5709.52s)]
*  these laws as free speech. And so, yeah, this has happened. And then I'll just add one final thing, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5714.08s)]
*  which is we've talked about two parties so far, talk about the government employees. And then [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5719.12s)]
*  we've talked about the companies, the government employees for sure have misbehaved. The companies, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5722.8s)]
*  there's a very interesting question there as to whether they are victims or perpetrators [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5727.84s)]
*  or both. They will defend and they will argue, and I believe they have a good case that they [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5731.52s)]
*  are victims, not perpetrators, right? They are the downstream subjects of pressure, not the cause of [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5736.4800000000005s)]
*  pressure. But there's a big swath of people who are in the middle and specifically the ones that [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5741.6s)]
*  are funded by the government that I think are in possibly pretty big trouble. And that's all of [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5746.0s)]
*  these third party censorship bureaus. I mean, the one that is sort of is most obvious is the so-called [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5750.16s)]
*  Stanford Internet Observatory that got booted up there over the last several years. And they [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5756.16s)]
*  basically were funded by the federal government to be third party censorship operations. And [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5761.2s)]
*  they're private sector actors, but acting with federal funding. And so it puts them in this very [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5766.32s)]
*  interesting spot where there could be very obvious theory under which they're basically acting as [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5771.5199999999995s)]
*  agents of the government. And so I think they're also very exposed on this and have behaved in just [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5776.639999999999s)]
*  flagrantly illegal ways. So fundamentally, government should not do any kind of pressure [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5781.2s)]
*  even soft pressure on companies to censor. Can't. Not allowed. It really is disturbing. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5786.96s)]
*  I mean, it probably started soft, lightly, slowly, and then it escalates as the old will to power [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5794.4s)]
*  will instruct them to do. Because you get, I mean, yeah, that's why there's protection. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5804.48s)]
*  Because you can't put a check on power for government, right? There are so many ways that [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5811.04s)]
*  they can get you. There are so many ways they can come at you and get you. And the thing here to [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5815.52s)]
*  think about is a lot of times when people think about government action, they think about [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5819.92s)]
*  legislation, right? So when I was a kid, we got trained at how does government work? There was [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5823.280000000001s)]
*  this famous animated short. The thing we got shown was just a cartoon of how a bill becomes a law. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5828.240000000001s)]
*  And it's like this, you know, fancy little bill snipped along and gets this. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5832.96s)]
*  I'm just the bill. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5835.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5836.080000000001s)]
*  Exactly. It's like, all right, number one, that's not how it works at all. That doesn't actually [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5836.8s)]
*  happen. We could talk about that. But even beyond that, mostly what we're dealing with is not [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5841.040000000001s)]
*  legislation. When we talk about government power these days, mostly it's not legislation. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5844.96s)]
*  Mostly it's either regulation, which is basically the equivalent of legislation, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5849.12s)]
*  but having not gone through the legislative process, which is a very big open legal issue [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5852.8s)]
*  and one of the things that the Doge is very focused on. Most government rules are not [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5856.56s)]
*  legislated, they're regulated. And there's tons and tons of regulations that these companies are [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5860.64s)]
*  sub. This is another cliche you'll hear a lot, which is all private companies can do whatever [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5865.04s)]
*  they want. And it's like, oh, no, they can't. They're subject to tens of thousands of regulations [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5868.08s)]
*  that they have to comply with. And the hammer that comes down when you don't comply with [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5872.24s)]
*  regulations is profound. Like they can completely wreck your company with no ability for you to do [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5876.24s)]
*  anything about it. So regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5880.32s)]
*  And then there's what's called just flat out administrative power, is the term that you'll [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5884.5599999999995s)]
*  hear. And administrative power is just literally the government telling you, calling you and telling [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5888.08s)]
*  you what to do. Here's an example of how this works. So Facebook had this whole program a few [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5891.36s)]
*  years back to do a global cryptocurrency for payments called Libra. And they built the entire [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5895.28s)]
*  system and it was this high scale, you know, sort of new cryptocurrency and they were going to build [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5899.92s)]
*  into every product and there were going to be 3 billion people who could transact with Libra. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5903.04s)]
*  And they went to the government and they went to the, all these different, try to figure out how [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5906.24s)]
*  to make it. So it was like fully compliant with anti-money laundering and all these, you know, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5909.12s)]
*  controls and everything. And they had the whole thing ready to go. Two senators wrote letters to [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5911.92s)]
*  the big banks saying, we're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5915.52s)]
*  do, you should know that every aspect of your business is going to come under greatly increased [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5921.68s)]
*  level of regulatory scrutiny, which is of course the exact equivalent of it sure is a nice corner [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5926.64s)]
*  restaurant you have here. It would be a shame if, you know, somebody tossed a Molotov cocktail [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5932.240000000001s)]
*  through the window and burned it down tonight. Right. And so that letter, like what is that letter? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5935.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it's not a law. It's not even a regulation. It's just like straight direct state power. And [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5940.160000000001s)]
*  then, and then it culminates in literally calls from the white house where they're just like flat [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5945.76s)]
*  out telling you what to do, which is of course what a king gets to do, but not what a president [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5950.4800000000005s)]
*  gets to do. And so anyway, so this, so, so what these companies experienced was they experienced [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5953.76s)]
*  the full panoply of this, but it was, it was the level of intensity was in that order. It was [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5958.96s)]
*  actually legislation was the least important part. Regulation was more important. Administrative [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5963.6s)]
*  power was more important. And then just like flat out demands and flat out threats were ultimately [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5967.6s)]
*  the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people who don't do [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5971.84s)]
*  it. So like, as with all these things, ultimately the fault lies with the voters. And so, you know, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5977.2s)]
*  you have to decide, you don't want to live in that regime. I have no idea what part of this [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5982.8s)]
*  recent election mapped to the censorship regime. I do know a lot of people on the right got very [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5985.84s)]
*  angry about the censorship, but I, you know, I think it probably at least helped with enthusiasm [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5989.4400000000005s)]
*  on that side. You know, maybe some people in the left will now not want their, you know, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5992.96s)]
*  democratic nominees to be so pro-censorship. So the voters definitely, you know, get a vote. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5997.6s)]
*  Number one, number two, I think you need transparency. You need to know what happened. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6003.52s)]
*  We know some of what happened. Peter Thiel has written in the FT just now saying, we just need [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6007.84s)]
*  after what we've been through in the last decade, we need broad-based truth and reconciliation, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6013.200000000001s)]
*  you know, efforts to really get to the root of things. So maybe that's part of it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6017.04s)]
*  We need investigations for sure. Ultimately, we need prosecutions. Like we need ultimately, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6022.08s)]
*  we need people to go to jail because we need to set object lessons that say that you don't get [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6027.200000000001s)]
*  to do this. And on those last two, I would say that those are both up to the new administration [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6030.64s)]
*  and I don't want to speak for them and I don't want to predict what they're going to do, but they [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6035.360000000001s)]
*  for sure have the ability to do both of those things and we'll see where they take it. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6039.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants this kind of overreach of power for government, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6042.96s)]
*  including perhaps people that were participating in it. It's like this dark momentum of power. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6048.0s)]
*  They just get caught up in it. And that's the reason there's that kind of protection. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6055.52s)]
*  Nobody wants that. So I use the metaphor of the ring of power. And for people who don't catch the [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6059.68s)]
*  reference as Lord of the Rings and the thing with the ring of power and Lord of the Rings, it's the [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6063.92s)]
*  ring that Gollum has in the beginning and it turns you invisible and it turns out it unlocks [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6067.52s)]
*  all this like fearsome power. It's the most powerful thing in the world. It's the key to [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6071.52s)]
*  everything. And basically the moral lesson of Lord of the Rings, which was written by a guy who [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6075.040000000001s)]
*  thought very deeply about these things is yeah, the ring of power is inherently corrupting. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6079.040000000001s)]
*  The characters at one point, they're like, Gandalf, just put on the ring and fix this. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6083.280000000001s)]
*  Right. And he's like, he will not put the ring on even to end the war because he knows that it [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6086.88s)]
*  will corrupt him. And then as it starts, the character of Gollum is the result of [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6093.28s)]
*  a normal character who ultimately becomes this incredibly corrupt and deranged version of himself. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6099.12s)]
*  And so I think you said something actually quite profound there, which is the ring of power is [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6103.28s)]
*  infinitely tempting. The censorship machine is infinitely tempting. If you have it, you are [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6108.32s)]
*  going to use it. It's overwhelmingly tempting because it's so powerful and that it will corrupt [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6113.84s)]
*  you. And yeah, I don't know whether any of these people feel any of this today. They should. I [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6119.12s)]
*  don't know if they do. But yeah, you go out five or 10 years later, you would hope that you would [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6125.12s)]
*  realize that your soul has been corroded and you probably started out thinking that you were a [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6130.0s)]
*  patriot and you were trying to defend democracy and you ended up being extremely authoritarian [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6133.599999999999s)]
*  and anti-democratic and anti-Western. Can I ask you a tough question here? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6138.08s)]
*  Staying on the ring of power, Elon is quickly becoming the most powerful human on earth. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6143.52s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. You don't think he is. Well, he doesn't have the nukes. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6153.2s)]
*  So nukes. Yeah, there's different definitions and perspectives on power, right? How can he and or [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6157.6s)]
*  Donald Trump avoid the corrupting aspects of this power? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6167.76s)]
*  I mean, I think the danger is there with power. It's just, it's flat out there. I would say with [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6172.72s)]
*  Elon, I mean, we'll see. I would say with Elon and I would say, by the way, overwhelmingly, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6177.120000000001s)]
*  I would say so far so good. I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by what he's done on almost every front [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6180.64s)]
*  for like the last 30 years, but including all this stuff recently. I think he's been a real [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6185.4400000000005s)]
*  hero on a lot of topics where we needed to see heroism. But look, I would say, I guess the sort [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6190.240000000001s)]
*  of case that he has this level of power is some combination of the money and the proximity to the [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6194.56s)]
*  president. And obviously both of those are instruments of power. The counter argument to [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6199.04s)]
*  that is I do think a lot of how Elon is causing change in the world right now. I mean, there's [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6203.6s)]
*  the companies he's running directly where I think he's doing very well and we're investors in multiple [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6209.6s)]
*  of them and doing very well. But I think like a lot of the stuff that gets people mad at him is [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6213.280000000001s)]
*  like, it's the social and political stuff and it's, you know, it's his statements and then it's the [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6219.360000000001s)]
*  downstream effects of his statements. So like, for example, it's, you know, for the last couple [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6222.96s)]
*  weeks, it's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this rape gang scandal, you know, this rape [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6226.4s)]
*  organized child rape thing in the UK. And, you know, it's, you know, it's actually a, it's a [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6230.4800000000005s)]
*  preface cascade. It's one of these things where people knew there was a problem. They weren't [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6236.16s)]
*  willing to talk about it. It kind of got suppressed. And then Elon brought it up and then all of a [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6239.28s)]
*  sudden there's now in the UK, this like massive explosion of basically open conversation about it [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6244.72s)]
*  for the first time. And, you know, it's like this catalyzing, all of a sudden everybody's kind of [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6248.72s)]
*  woken up and being like, oh my God, you know, this is really bad. And there will be now, you know, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6252.16s)]
*  pretty sure, pretty, pretty clearly big changes as a result. So, and Elon was, you know, he played [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6256.639999999999s)]
*  the role of the boy who said the emperor has no clothes, right? But, but, but here's the thing, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6260.5599999999995s)]
*  here's my point. Like he said it about something that was true, right? And so had he said it about [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6264.48s)]
*  something that was false, you know, he would get no credit for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6269.2s)]
*  for it. But he said something that was true. And by the way, everybody over there instantly, they [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6273.44s)]
*  were like, oh yeah, he's right. Right. Like nobody, nobody seriously said, they're just arguing the [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6277.68s)]
*  details now. So, so number one, it's like, okay, he says true things. And so it's like, okay, how far, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6281.92s)]
*  let's put it this way, like how worried are we about somebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6287.4400000000005s)]
*  power being that they get to speak the truth. And I guess I would say, especially in the last decade [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6292.0s)]
*  of what we've been through, where everybody's been lying all the time about everything, I'd say, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6296.240000000001s)]
*  I think we should run this experiment as hard as we can to get people to tell the truth. And so [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6298.88s)]
*  I don't feel that bad about that. And then the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6303.84s)]
*  the money and politics question. And the money and politics question is this very interesting [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6308.400000000001s)]
*  question because it seems like there's a clear cut case that the more money and politics, the worst [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6312.4800000000005s)]
*  things are, and the more corrupted the system is. That was a very popular topic of public [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6317.84s)]
*  conversation up until 2016 when Hillary outspent Trump three to one and lost. You'll notice that [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6322.64s)]
*  money and politics has almost vanished as a topic in the last eight years. And once again, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6328.48s)]
*  Trump spent far less, you know, Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden spent. So [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6333.679999999999s)]
*  they were, they were at, I don't know, something like three, three billion total and Trump, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6338.879999999999s)]
*  I think spent again, like a third or a fourth of that. And so the money and politics kind of [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6341.759999999999s)]
*  topic has kind of vanished from the popular conversation in the last eight years. It has [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6346.879999999999s)]
*  come back a little bit now that Elon is spending, you know, but, but again, like it's like, okay, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6350.639999999999s)]
*  he's spending, but the data would seem to indicate in the last, at least in the last eight years, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6357.52s)]
*  that money doesn't win the political battles. It's actually like the voters actually have a voice [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6360.96s)]
*  and they actually exercise it and they don't just listen to ads. And so again, there, I would say [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6364.96s)]
*  like, yeah, clearly there's some power there, but I don't know if it's, I like, I don't know if it's [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6368.320000000001s)]
*  some like, I don't know if it's some weapon that he can just like turn on and, and use in a definitive [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6371.84s)]
*  way. And I don't know if there's parallels there, but I could also say just on a human level, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6376.64s)]
*  he has a good heart and I interact with a lot of powerful people and that's not always the case. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6382.4s)]
*  So that's a good thing there. If we, if we can draw parallels to the hobbit or whatever, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6388.4s)]
*  who gets to put on the ring Frodo Frodo. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe one of the lessons of Lord [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6394.4s)]
*  of the Rings writers, even, even Frodo would have been, you know, even Frodo would have been [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6398.879999999999s)]
*  corrupted, right? But you know, nevertheless, you had somebody who could do what it took at the, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6401.679999999999s)]
*  at the time. The thing that I find just so amazing about the Elon phenomenon and all the critiques is, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6406.16s)]
*  you know, the one thing that everybody in our societies universally agrees on because of our, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6410.64s)]
*  it's sort of our, our, our post Christian egalitarian. So, you know, we live in sort [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6414.64s)]
*  of this post secularized Christian context in the West now and it's, you know, we, we, we consider [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6418.96s)]
*  Christianity kind of, you know, backwards, but we still believe essentially all the same things. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6424.64s)]
*  We just dress them up in, in, in sort of fake science. So the, the one thing that we're all [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6427.92s)]
*  told, we're all taught from, from early is that the best people in the world are the people who [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6434.0s)]
*  care about all of humanity, right? And we venerate, you know, all of our figures are people [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6436.96s)]
*  who care about all of, you know, Jesus cared about all of humanity, Gandhi cared about all [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6441.12s)]
*  of humanity, Martin Luther King cared about all of humanity. Like it's, it's, it's the person who [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6444.32s)]
*  cares the most about everybody. And with Elon, you have a guy who literally like his, he's literally, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6448.32s)]
*  he talks about this constantly and he talks about exactly the same in private is literally, he is [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6454.08s)]
*  operating on behalf of all of humanity to try to get us to, you know, he goes through to get us [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6458.0s)]
*  through multi-planetary civilization so that we can survive a strike on any one planet so that we [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6461.76s)]
*  can extend the light of human consciousness into the world and into the universe and have it [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6465.12s)]
*  persist, you know, and the good of the whole thing. And like literally the critique is, yeah, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6468.4s)]
*  we want you to care about all of humanity, but not like that. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6472.4s)]
*  Yeah. All the critics, all the, all the surface turmoil, the critics will be forgotten. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6476.64s)]
*  I think that's, yeah, that's clear. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6483.04s)]
*  You said that we always end up being ruled by the elites of some kind. Can you explain this law, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6485.12s)]
*  this idea? So this comes from a Italian political philosopher from about a hundred years ago named [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6492.32s)]
*  Robert. I'm going to mangle the front, let you pronounce the Italian, Michelle's or Michael's. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6497.92s)]
*  And then it was, I learned about it through a famous book on politics, probably the best book [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6505.2s)]
*  on politics written in the 20th century called the Machiavellians by this guy, James Burnham, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6509.36s)]
*  who has had a big impact on me. But in the Machiavellians, he resurrects what he calls [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6514.08s)]
*  the Italian realist school of political philosophy from the, from the tens and 20s. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6518.0s)]
*  And these were people to be clear, this was not like a Mussolini thing. These were people who were [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6522.32s)]
*  trying to understand the actual mechanics of how politics actually works. So to get to the actual [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6525.4400000000005s)]
*  sort of mechanical substance of like how the political machine operates. And this guy, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6531.12s)]
*  Michelle said this concept he ended up with called the iron law of oligarchy. And so what the iron law [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6536.72s)]
*  of oligarchy, and I mean, take a step back to say what he meant by oligarchy, because it has [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6542.8s)]
*  multiple meanings. So basically in classic political theory, there's basically three forms [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6546.48s)]
*  of government at core. There's democracy, which is rule of the many, there's oligarchy, which is [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6549.839999999999s)]
*  rule of the few. And there's monarchy, which is rule of the one. And you can just use that as a [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6555.2s)]
*  general framework of any government you're going to be under is going to be one of those, just a [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6559.44s)]
*  mechanical observation without even saying which one's good or bad, just a structural observation. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6562.639999999999s)]
*  And so the question that Michelle's asked was like, is there such a thing as democracy? Like, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6568.0s)]
*  is there actually such a thing as democracy? Is there ever actually like direct, direct government? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6571.36s)]
*  And what he did was he mounted this sort of incredible historical exploration of whether [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6576.48s)]
*  democracies had ever existed in the world. And the answer basically is almost never. And we could [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6580.08s)]
*  talk about that. But the other thing he did was he sought out the most democratic private organization [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6584.24s)]
*  in the world that he could find at that point, which he concluded was some basically communist [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6590.4s)]
*  German autoworkers union that was like wholly devoted to the workers of the world uniting, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6594.08s)]
*  you know, back when that was like the hot thing. And he went in there and he's like, okay, this is [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6598.08s)]
*  the organization out of all organizations on planet earth that must be operating as a direct [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6601.839999999999s)]
*  democracy. And he went in there and he's like, oh, nope, there's a leadership class. You know, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6605.6s)]
*  there's like six guys at the top and they control everything. And they lead the rest of the [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6609.120000000001s)]
*  membership along, you know, by the nose, which is of course the story of every union. The story [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6613.200000000001s)]
*  of every union is always the story of, you know, there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know, kind of [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6617.92s)]
*  running the thing. You know, we just saw that with the dock workers union, right? Like, you know, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6621.360000000001s)]
*  there's a guy and he's in charge. And by the way, the number two is his son, right? Like that's not [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6625.360000000001s)]
*  like, you know, an accident, right? So the iron law of oligarchy basically says democracy is fake. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6631.68s)]
*  There's always a ruling class. There's always a ruling elite structurally. And he said the reason [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6636.96s)]
*  for that is because the masses can't organize, right? What's the fundamental problem? Whether [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6640.64s)]
*  the mass is 25,000 people in a union or 250 million people in a country, the masses can't organize. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6645.4400000000005s)]
*  The majority cannot organize. Only a minority can organize. And to be effective in politics, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6650.16s)]
*  you must organize. And therefore every political structure in human history has been some form of [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6654.88s)]
*  a small organized elite ruling a large and dispersed majority, every single one. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6661.2s)]
*  The Greeks and the Florentines had brief experiments in direct democracy and they [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6666.96s)]
*  were total disasters. In Florence, I forget the name of it. It was called like the workers revolt [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6671.92s)]
*  or something like that. There was like a two year period where they basically experimented [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6677.2s)]
*  with direct democracy during the Renaissance and it was a complete disaster and they never tried [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6681.84s)]
*  it again. In the state of California, we have our own experiment on this, which is the proposition [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6685.84s)]
*  system, which is an overlay on top of the legislature. And anybody who looks at it for [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6691.2s)]
*  two seconds concludes it's been a complete disaster. It's just a catastrophe and it's caused [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6696.08s)]
*  enormous damage to the state. And so basically the presumption that we are in a democracy is just [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6700.24s)]
*  sort of by definition fake. Now, good news for the US, it turns out the founders understood this. And [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6705.5199999999995s)]
*  so of course they didn't give us a direct democracy. They gave us a representative democracy, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6709.599999999999s)]
*  right? And so they built the oligarchy into the system in the form of Congress and the executive [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6713.36s)]
*  branch, the judicial branch. But so anyway, so as a consequence, democracy is always and everywhere [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6717.68s)]
*  fake. There is always a ruling elite. And basically the lesson of the Machiavellians is you can deny [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6723.12s)]
*  that if you want, but you're fooling yourself. The way to actually think about how to make a system [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6729.280000000001s)]
*  work and maintain any sort of shred of freedom is to actually understand that that is actually [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6733.6s)]
*  what's happening. And lucky for us, the founders saw this and figured out a way to, given that [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6738.0s)]
*  there's going to be a ruling elite, how to create a balance of power among that elite. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6745.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6751.44s)]
*  So it doesn't get out of hand. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6751.76s)]
*  And it was very clever, right? And some of this was based on earlier experiments. By the way, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6752.8s)]
*  these were very, very smart people, right? And so they knew tremendous amounts of Greek and Roman [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6757.04s)]
*  history. They knew the Renaissance history, the Federalist papers. They argued this at great [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6761.36s)]
*  length. You can read it all. They ran one of the best seminars in world history trying to figure [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6765.44s)]
*  this out. And they went through all this. And yeah, and so they thought through it very carefully, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6770.64s)]
*  but just to give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic. So, you know, one way they did [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6774.72s)]
*  it is through the three branches of government, right? Executive, legislative, and judicial, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6779.2s)]
*  sort of balance of powers. But the other way they did it was they sort of echoing what had been done [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6783.76s)]
*  earlier, I think in the UK parliament, they created the two different bodies of the legislature, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6788.240000000001s)]
*  right? And so the, you know, the house and the Senate, and as you know, the house is a [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6793.280000000001s)]
*  portion on the basis of population and the Senate is not, right? The small states have just as many [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6796.240000000001s)]
*  senators as the big states. And then they made the deliberate decision to have the house get [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6800.8s)]
*  reelected every two years to make it very responsive to the will of the people. And they [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6805.2s)]
*  made the decision to have the Senate get reelected every six years so that it had more buffer [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6808.400000000001s)]
*  from the passions of the moment. But what's interesting is they didn't choose one or the [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6813.12s)]
*  other, right? They did them both. And then to get legislation passed, you have to get through both [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6817.28s)]
*  of them. And so they built in like a second layer of checks and balances. And then there's a thousand [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6821.4400000000005s)]
*  observations we could make about like how well the system is working today and like how much does [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6826.88s)]
*  it live up to the ideal and how much are we actually complying with the constitution? And [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6830.72s)]
*  there's lots of, you know, there's lots of open questions there, but you know, this system has [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6834.64s)]
*  survived for coming on 250 years with a country that has been spectacularly successful that I [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6838.64s)]
*  don't think at least, you know, I don't think any of us would trade the system for any other one. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6843.84s)]
*  And so it's, yeah, one of the great all time achievements. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6847.36s)]
*  . Yeah, it's incredible. And we should say they were all pretty young relative to our current [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6849.36s)]
*  set of leaders. Many in their twenties at the time. And like super geniuses, this is one of those [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6854.64s)]
*  things where it's just like, all right, something happened where there was a group of people where, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6858.32s)]
*  you know, nobody ever tested their IQs, but like these are Einstein's of politics. Yeah, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6861.92s)]
*  an amazing thing. But anyway, I just, I go through all that, which is they were very keen students of [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6865.68s)]
*  the actual mechanical practice of democracy, not fixated on what was desirable. They were [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6869.92s)]
*  incredibly focused on what would actually work, which is, you know, I think the way to think about [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6875.84s)]
*  these things. There were engineers of sort, not the fuzzy humanity students. They were shape [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6879.84s)]
*  rotators, not word cells. I remember that. Wow. That meme came and went. I think you were central [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6885.68s)]
*  to them. You're central to a lot of memes. You're the meme dealer and the meme popularizer. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6892.8s)]
*  That meme I get some credit for. And then the current thing is the other one I get some credit [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6898.96s)]
*  for. I don't know that I invented either one, but I popularized them. Take credit and run with it. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6901.76s)]
*  Yeah. If we can just linger on the Machiavellians, it's a study of power and power dynamics. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6906.72s)]
*  Like you mentioned, looking at the actual reality of the machinery of power from everything you've [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6915.12s)]
*  seen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting things you can sort [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6922.16s)]
*  of continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6927.68s)]
*  institutions? Yeah. So a lot of it, you know, we already talked about this a bit with the [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6933.12s)]
*  universities, which is you can apply a Machiavellian style lens to the, it's why I posed [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6937.2s)]
*  the question to you that I did, which is, okay, who runs the university, the trustees, the [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6941.28s)]
*  administration, the students or the faculty? And the answer, the true answer is some combination [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6946.0s)]
*  of the three or of the four plus the donors, by the way, plus the government, plus the press, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6950.32s)]
*  et cetera. Right. And so there's a mechanical interpretation of that. I mean, companies [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6955.12s)]
*  operate under the exact same set of questions. Who runs a company? You know, the CEO, but like [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6960.08s)]
*  the CEO runs the company basically up to the day that either the shareholders or the management [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6965.28s)]
*  team revolt. If the shareholders revolt, it's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. If the [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6968.88s)]
*  management team revolts, it's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat. By the way, if the employees [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6973.12s)]
*  revolt, it's also hard to stay in the seat. By the way, if the New York Times comes at you, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6976.96s)]
*  it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6980.88s)]
*  the seat. So, you know, like a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand is who [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6984.48s)]
*  can get who fired. You know, so who has more power? You know, the newspaper columnist who makes, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6990.16s)]
*  you know, $200,000 a year or the CEO who makes, you know, $200 million a year. And it's like, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6996.32s)]
*  well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7000.639999999999s)]
*  I have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired. Did anyone ever get fired from the Bill Ackman [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7004.799999999999s)]
*  assault on journalism? So Bill, Bill, like really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7012.32s)]
*  No, because what happens is they wear it with the, I mean, they, and I would say to their credit, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7019.2s)]
*  they wear it as a badge of honor. And then to their shame, they wear it as a badge of honor, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7022.96s)]
*  right? Which is, you know, if they're doing the right thing, then they are justifiably [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7026.08s)]
*  priding themselves for standing up under pressure. But it also means that they can't respond to [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7030.88s)]
*  legitimate criticism. And, you know, they're obviously terrible at that now. As I recall, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7035.04s)]
*  he went straight to the CEO of I think Astral Springer that owns Insider. And I, you know, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7040.16s)]
*  and I happen to know the CEO and I think he's quite a good CEO, but like, I like, well, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7044.8s)]
*  there's a good example is the CEO of Astral Springer run his own company, right? Like, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7048.48s)]
*  well, there's a fascinating, okay, so there's a fascinating thing playing out right now. Like [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7053.36s)]
*  you have to dwell on these fires. But it's a case, you see the pressure reveals things, right? And [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7056.08s)]
*  so if you've been watching what's happened with the LA Times recently, so this guy, biotech [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7061.12s)]
*  entrepreneur buys the LA Times like whatever eight years ago, it is just like the most radical [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7065.36s)]
*  social revolutionary thing you can possibly imagine. It endorses every crazy left-wing radical. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7070.32s)]
*  You can imagine it endorses Karen Bass, it endorses Gavin Newsom. It's just like a litany of [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7074.96s)]
*  all the people who are currently burning the city to the ground. It's just like endorsed every [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7079.28s)]
*  single bad person every step of the way. He's owned it the entire time. You know, he put his [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7083.04s)]
*  foot down right before, for the first time, I think put his foot down right before the November [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7088.0s)]
*  election and said, we're not, we're not getting, he said, we're going to get out of this thing where [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7091.36s)]
*  we just always endorse the Democrat. And we said, we're not endorsing, I think he said, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7094.56s)]
*  we're not endorsing for the presidency. And like the paper flipped out, right? It's like, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7097.120000000001s)]
*  our billionaire backer who's, I don't know what he spends, but like he must be burning [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7101.4400000000005s)]
*  50 or a hundred million dollars a year out of his pocket to keep this thing running. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7104.96s)]
*  He paid 500 million for it, which is amazing. Back when people still thought these things [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7108.400000000001s)]
*  were businesses. And then he's probably burned another 500 million over the last decade, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7114.400000000001s)]
*  keeping it running. And he burns probably another 50, 100 million a year to do this. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7119.6s)]
*  And the journalists at the LA Times hate him with the fury of a thousand sons. Like they just like [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7123.36s)]
*  absolutely freaking despise him. And they have been like attacking him and you know, the ones [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7128.16s)]
*  that can get jobs elsewhere quit and do it. And the rest just stay and say the worst, you know, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7132.0s)]
*  most horrible things about him. And they want to constantly run these stories attacking him. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7135.04s)]
*  And so he has had this reaction that a lot of people in LA are having right now to this fire [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7139.599999999999s)]
*  into this just like incredibly vivid collapse of leadership and all these people that he had his [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7144.16s)]
*  paperhead endorsed are just disasters. And he's on this tour. He's basically just, he's decided, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7148.32s)]
*  he's decided to be the boy who says the Emperor has no clothes, but he's doing it to his own [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7154.639999999999s)]
*  newspaper. Very smart guy. He's on a press tour and he's basically saying, yeah, we, yes, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7159.12s)]
*  we did all that and we endorsed these people and it was a huge mistake and we're going to completely [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7163.44s)]
*  change. And his paper is, you know, in a complete internal revolt. But I go through it, which is, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7166.639999999999s)]
*  okay, now we have a very interesting question, which is who runs the LA Times? Because for the [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7171.679999999999s)]
*  last eight years, it hasn't been him. It's been the reporters. Now for the first time, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7176.08s)]
*  the owner is showing up saying, oh no, I'm actually in charge. And the reporters are saying, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7183.68s)]
*  no, you're not. And like, like it is freaking on. And so again, if the Machiavellian's mindset on [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7187.2s)]
*  this is like, okay, how is power actually exercised here? Can a guy who's like even super rich and [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7193.2s)]
*  super powerful who even owns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full scale assault? Not only [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7198.5599999999995s)]
*  by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7202.8s)]
*  anti-Christ. And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly. And so that's the game [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7206.4800000000005s)]
*  of power there. And firing people. And you know, he has removed people and he has set new rules. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7212.64s)]
*  I mean, he is, he is now, I think at long, I think he's saying that he's now at long last actually [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7216.88s)]
*  exercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7220.8s)]
*  the business. There are certain other owners of these publications that are doing similar things [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7225.12s)]
*  right now. He's the one I don't know. So he's the one I can talk about. But there are others [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7228.64s)]
*  that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really interesting open question, [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7233.280000000001s)]
*  like, you know, in a fight between the employees and the employer, like it's not crystal clear [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7238.56s)]
*  that the employer wins that one. And just to stay on journalism for a second, we mentioned [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7242.240000000001s)]
*  Bill Ackman, I just want to say, put him in the category we mentioned before of a really courageous [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7245.76s)]
*  person. I don't think I've ever seen anybody so fearless in going after, you know, in following [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7251.84s)]
*  what he believes in publicly. That's courage. That, that, that several things he's done publicly, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7260.400000000001s)]
*  it has been really inspiring. Just being courageous. What do you think is like the most impressive [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7267.52s)]
*  example? Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to like, I mean, it's, it's [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7271.52s)]
*  like sticking your like kicking the beehive or whatever, you know, what's going to follow [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7279.2s)]
*  and do that. I mean, that's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7285.44s)]
*  they're going to, you know, there's just so many mechanisms they use, including like writing [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7291.36s)]
*  articles and get cited by Wikipedia, then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7295.599999999999s)]
*  all this kind of stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer just, just tweets these essays and just goes [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7299.92s)]
*  after them legally and also in the public eye and just, I don't know. That was truly inspiring. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7308.64s)]
*  There's not many people like that in public and I, hopefully that inspires not just me, but many [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7315.04s)]
*  others to be like, to be courageous themselves. Did you know of him before he started doing this [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7321.84s)]
*  in public? I knew of Neri, his wife, she's just brilliant researcher and scientist. And so I admire [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7327.52s)]
*  her look up to her. I think she's amazing. Well, the reason I ask if you knew about Bill is because [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7332.8s)]
*  a lot of people had not heard of him before, especially like before October 7th and before [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7337.04s)]
*  some of the campaigns he's been running since in public, but with Harvard and so forth. But [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7340.72s)]
*  he was very well known in the investment world before that. So he was a famous, he's a so-called [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7345.36s)]
*  activist investor for, you know, very, very successful and very widely respected for probably [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7350.72s)]
*  30 years before now. And I bring that up because it turns out they weren't for the most part [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7355.5199999999995s)]
*  battles that happened in kind of full public view. They weren't national stories, but in the business [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7361.2s)]
*  and investing world, the activist investor is a very, it's like in the movie taken, it's a very [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7364.72s)]
*  specific set of skills on how to like really take control of situations and how to wreck the people [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7369.52s)]
*  who you're going up against. And just, and there's a lot that has been controversy over the years [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7377.12s)]
*  on this topic and there's too much detail to go into, but the defense of activist investing, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7383.4400000000005s)]
*  which I think is valid is, you know, these are the guys who basically go in and take stakes in [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7387.2s)]
*  companies that are being poorly managed or under optimized. And then generally what that means is, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7391.68s)]
*  at least the theory is that means the existing management has become entrenched and lazy, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7396.240000000001s)]
*  mediocre, you know, whatever, not responding to the needs of the shareholders, often not responding [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7401.04s)]
*  to the customers. And the activists basically go in with a minority position and then they rally [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7406.0s)]
*  support among other investors who are not activists. And then they basically show up and they force [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7411.68s)]
*  change. But they are the aggressive version of this. And I've been on the, I've been involved [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7415.92s)]
*  in companies that have been on the receiving end of these, where it is amazing how much somebody [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7420.96s)]
*  like that can exert pressure on situations, even when they don't have formal control. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7425.44s)]
*  So it's another, it would be another chess piece on the mechanical board of kind of how power gets [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7429.44s)]
*  exercised. And basically what happens is the effective analysts, a large amount of the time [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7434.08s)]
*  they end up taking, they end up taking over control of companies, even though they never own more than [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7436.96s)]
*  like 5% of the stock. And so anyway, so it turns out with Bill's been such a fascinating case, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7440.72s)]
*  because he has that like complete skillset. And he has now decided to bring it to bear in areas [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7444.8s)]
*  that are not just companies. And two interesting things for that. One is, you know, some of these [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7451.52s)]
*  places, you know, and some of these battles are still ongoing, but number one, like a lot of people [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7456.0s)]
*  who run universities or newspapers are not used to being up against somebody like this. And by the [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7459.360000000001s)]
*  way, also now with infinitely deep pockets and lots of experience in courtrooms and all the things [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7464.96s)]
*  that kind of go with that. But the other is through example, he is teaching a lot of the rest of us, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7468.400000000001s)]
*  the activist playbook, like in real time. And so the Liam Neeson skillset is getting more broadly [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7473.92s)]
*  diffused just by being able to watch and learn from him. So I think he's having a, you know, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7479.12s)]
*  I would put him up there with Ilan in terms of somebody who's really affecting how all this is [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7484.24s)]
*  playing out. But even skillset aside, just courage and- Yes. Including, by the way, courage to go [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7488.0s)]
*  outside of his own zone. Yeah. Right. You know, because like he hasn't, I'll give you an example, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7492.24s)]
*  like my firm, Venture Capital firm, we have LPs. There are things that I feel like I can't do or [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7496.88s)]
*  say, because I feel like I would be bringing, you know, I would be bringing embarrassment or [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7501.28s)]
*  other consequences to our LPs. He has investors also where he worries about that. And so a couple [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7505.2s)]
*  things, one is his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship with his own investors. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7511.12s)]
*  But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors, I know this for a fact, his investors [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7515.599999999999s)]
*  have been remarkably supportive of him doing that. Because as it turns out, a lot of them actually [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7519.04s)]
*  agree with him. And so he's, it's the same thing he does in his activism campaigns. He is able to [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7523.44s)]
*  be the tip of the spear on something that actually a lot more people agree with. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7529.44s)]
*  Yeah. It turns out if you have truth behind you, it helps. And just again, you know, how I started [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7532.879999999999s)]
*  is a lot of people are just fed up. You've been spending a bunch of time in Mar-a-Lago and Palm [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7539.2s)]
*  Beach helping the new administration in many ways, including interviewing people who might join. So [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7543.839999999999s)]
*  what's your general sense about the talent, about the people who are coming in into the new [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7550.96s)]
*  administration? So I should start by saying I'm not a member of the new administration. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7554.96s)]
*  I'm not in the room when a lot of these people are being selected. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7559.92s)]
*  I believe you said unpaid intern. I'm an unpaid intern. So I'm a volunteer and [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7563.68s)]
*  I went helpful, but I'm not making the decisions nor am I in a position to speak for the [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7568.4s)]
*  administration. So I don't want to say anything that would cause people to think I'm doing that. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7572.56s)]
*  This is a very unusual situation, right? Where you had an incumbent president and then you had a [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7576.16s)]
*  four-year gap where he's out of office and then you have him coming back, right? And as you'll [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7579.04s)]
*  recall, there was a fair amount of controversy over the end of the first term. The fear, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7582.96s)]
*  the specific concern was the first Trump administration, they will all say this is [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7588.56s)]
*  like they didn't come in with a team, right? So they didn't come into the team and most of [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7593.52s)]
*  the sort of institutional base of the Republican party were Bush Republicans and they were, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7597.2s)]
*  and many of them had become never Trumpers. And so they had a hard time putting the team together. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7601.36s)]
*  And then by the way, they had a hard time getting people confirmed. And so if you talk to the people [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7604.8s)]
*  who were there in the first term, it took them two to three years to kind of even get the government [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7608.56s)]
*  in place. And then they basically only had the government in place for basically like 18 months [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7611.92s)]
*  and then COVID hit, and then sort of the aftermath and everything and all the drama and headlines [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7617.2s)]
*  and everything. And so the concern, including from some very smart people in the last two years has [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7621.68s)]
*  been, boy, if Trump gets a second term, is he going to be able to get a team that is as good as the [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7626.0s)]
*  team he had last time or a team that is actually not as good? Because maybe people got burned out, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7630.72s)]
*  maybe they're more cynical now, maybe they're not willing to go through the drama. By the way, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7634.64s)]
*  a lot of people in the first term came under like, you know, with their own withering legal [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7638.48s)]
*  assaults and, you know, some of them went to prison and like, you know, a lot of stuff happened. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7641.679999999999s)]
*  Lots of investigations, lots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots of debanking, by the way. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7646.16s)]
*  A lot of the officials in the first Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7652.16s)]
*  Yeah, I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7658.959999999999s)]
*  In the wake of the first term, yes. We now take out spouses and children with our ring of power. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7661.759999999999s)]
*  And so there's like this legitimate question as to like whether, okay, what will the team for the [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7667.52s)]
*  second term look like? And at least what I've seen and what you're seeing this the appointments is, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7671.92s)]
*  it looks much, much better. First of all, it just looks better than the first term and not because [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7675.4400000000005s)]
*  the people in the first term were not necessarily good, but just you just have this like influx of [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7679.6s)]
*  like incredibly capable people that have shown up that want to be part of this. And you just [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7683.68s)]
*  didn't have that the first time. And so they're just drawing on a much deeper, richer talent pool [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7687.92s)]
*  than they had the first time. And they're drawing on people who know what the game is. Like they're [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7692.160000000001s)]
*  drawing on people now who know what is going to happen and they're still willing to do it. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7696.48s)]
*  And so they're going to get, I think, you know, some of the best people from the first term, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7700.0s)]
*  but they're bringing in a lot of people who they couldn't get the first time around. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7703.12s)]
*  And then second is there's a bunch of people, including people in the first term, where they're [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7708.0s)]
*  just 10 years older. And so they went through the first term and they just learned how everything [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7710.879999999999s)]
*  works. Or they're young people who just had a different point of view. And now they're 10 [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7715.12s)]
*  years older and they're ready to go serve in government. And so there's a generational shift [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7719.2s)]
*  happening. And actually one of the interesting things about the team that's forming up is it's [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7723.76s)]
*  remarkably young. Some of the cabinet members and then many of the second and third level people [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7727.2s)]
*  are like in their thirties and forties, you know, which is a big change from the gerontocracy that [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7731.6s)]
*  we've been under for the last 30 years. And so I think the caliber has been outstanding. And we [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7736.16s)]
*  could sit here and list tons and tons of people, but like, you know, the people who are running, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7741.2s)]
*  it's everything from the people who are running all the different departments at HHS, it's the [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7745.12s)]
*  people running, you know, the number two at the Pentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just like an [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7748.400000000001s)]
*  incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. We've got two, actually two of my [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7752.16s)]
*  partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Yeah. Like many, many parts of the government, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7757.599999999999s)]
*  the people are like really impressive. Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7762.88s)]
*  given the human being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7770.0s)]
*  favoritism versus meritocracy, that there's kind of circles of sycophantcy that form. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7777.52s)]
*  And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically suck up to the president, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7784.72s)]
*  that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good position [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7794.0s)]
*  to speak to the degree that's happening versus hiring based on merit and just getting great teams. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7797.76s)]
*  Yeah. So look, I just start by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7806.4s)]
*  some risk of that, right? So there's always some, you know, it's just, it's like a natural reality [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7811.5199999999995s)]
*  warps around powerful leaders. And so there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7815.2s)]
*  powerful leaders are very aware of that. And Trump at this point in his life, I think is highly aware [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7818.96s)]
*  of that, at least my interactions with him, like he definitely seems very aware of that. So that's [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7822.799999999999s)]
*  one thing I would just say that I think the way to look at that, I mean, look, like I said, I don't [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7828.639999999999s)]
*  want to predict what's going to happen once this whole thing starts unfolding, but I would just say [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7831.839999999999s)]
*  again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs and then the fact that [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7835.92s)]
*  these are some of the most accomplished people in the business world and in the medical field. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7839.12s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH. So I was actually part of the interview team for a lot of [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7845.68s)]
*  the HHS folks. Nice. Jay's amazing. I was so happy to see that. So I literally got, this is the story, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7850.96s)]
*  I got to the transition office for one of the days of the HHS interviews and I was on one of [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7856.8s)]
*  the interviewing teams and they gave us, I didn't know who the candidates were and they gave us the [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7860.32s)]
*  sheet in the beginning and I go down the sheet and I saw Jay's name and I like, I almost physically [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7863.2s)]
*  fell out of my chair. And I was just like, you know, and I have, I happen to know Jay and I like, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7867.12s)]
*  respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this, like talk about a guy who proved [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7874.0s)]
*  himself under extraordinary pressure over the last five years. And then go radical under the pressure. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7877.599999999999s)]
*  He maintained balance and thoughtfulness and depth. I mean, incredibly, very serious, very analytical, [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7883.92s)]
*  very applied. And yes, a hundred percent tested under pressure came out. Like the more people look [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7890.0s)]
*  back at what he said and did, and you know, he's not, you know, none of us are perfect, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7896.16s)]
*  but like overwhelmingly, like overwhelmingly insightful throughout that whole period. And you [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7899.68s)]
*  know, we, you know, we would all be much better off today had he been in charge of the response. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7904.72s)]
*  And so just like an incredibly capable guy and look, and then he learned from all that, right? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7909.2s)]
*  He learned a lot in the last five years. And so the idea that somebody like that could be head of NIH [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7912.8s)]
*  as compared to the people we've had is just like breathtakingly, it's just a gigantic upgrade, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7917.2s)]
*  you know, and then Marty McAree coming in to run FDA, exact same thing. The guy coming to run a [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7922.24s)]
*  CDC, exact same thing. I mean, I've been spending time with Dr. Oz. So, you know, I'm not like, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7926.88s)]
*  again, I'm not like, I'm not on these teams, I'm not in the room, but like I've been spending [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7934.0s)]
*  enough time trying to help that like his level of insight into the healthcare system is like, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7937.2s)]
*  it's like astounding. And it comes from being a guy who's been like in the middle of the whole [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7941.599999999999s)]
*  thing and been talking to people about this stuff and working on it and serving as a doctor [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7945.2s)]
*  himself and in medical systems for, you know, his entire life. And it's just like, you know, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7948.639999999999s)]
*  he's like a walking encyclopedia on these things. And so, and you know, very dynamic, you know, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7952.72s)]
*  very charismatic, very smart, organized, effective. So, you know, to have somebody like that in there. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7956.32s)]
*  And so anyway, they're just, I have like 30 of these stories now across all these different, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7962.96s)]
*  all these different positions. And so I, and then I just, I'd be quite honest, I do the compare and [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7967.04s)]
*  contrast to the last four years and it's not even these people are not the same ballpark. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7971.44s)]
*  They're just like wildly better. And so, you know, the pound for pound is maybe the best team in the [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7975.679999999999s)]
*  White House since, you know, I don't even know, maybe the nineties, maybe the, maybe the thirties, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7982.32s)]
*  maybe the fifties, you know, maybe Eisenhower had a team like this or something, but it's, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7990.4s)]
*  there's a lot of really good people in there now. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7994.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The potential for change is certainly extremely high. Well, can you speak to Doge? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7996.24s)]
*  What's the most wildly successful next two years for Doge? Can you imagine maybe also, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8001.76s)]
*  can you think about the trajectory that's the most likely and what kind of challenges would it be [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8009.92s)]
*  facing? Yeah. So, and I'll start by saying again, I'm not disclaimer, I have to say I'm not on Doge. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8015.2s)]
*  I'm not a member of Doge. We should say there's about 10 lawyers in the room. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8021.76s)]
*  Staring, you know, I'm just kidding. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8026.24s)]
*  Both the angels and the devils on my shoulder. Okay. So, yeah. So I'm not speaking for Doge. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8028.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Doge. Those guys are doing it. I'm not doing it, but I am, you know, again, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8033.04s)]
*  I'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm a hundred percent supportive. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8037.6s)]
*  Yeah. So look, I think the way to think of, I mean, the basic outlines are in public, right? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8042.32s)]
*  Which is it's a, it's a time limited, you know, basically commission. It's not a formal government [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8046.48s)]
*  agency. It's a, you know, time limited 18 month. It'll, it'll, in terms of implementation, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8050.8s)]
*  it will advise the executive branch, right? And so the, the, the implementation will happen [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8056.400000000001s)]
*  through the white house. And the president has total attitude on what he wants to, what he wants [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8060.4800000000005s)]
*  to implement. And then basically what I think about it is three kind of streams, you know, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8065.04s)]
*  kind of target sets and they're related, but different. So money, people and regulations. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8070.0s)]
*  And so, you know, the headline number, they've, you know, put the $2 trillion number and there's [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8076.64s)]
*  disputes over, over that and whatever. And there's all question there, but then there's the people [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8080.56s)]
*  thing and the people thing is interesting because you get into these very kind of fascinating [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8083.84s)]
*  questions. And I've been doing this. I won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this for [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8089.12s)]
*  people in government as a pop quiz and I can stump them every time, which is a, how many federal [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8093.52s)]
*  agencies are there? And the answer is somewhere between 450 and 520 and nobody's quite sure. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8097.52s)]
*  And then the other is how many people work for the federal government? And the answer is, you know, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8104.08s)]
*  something on the order, I forget, but like 4 million full-time employees and maybe up to 20 [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8108.64s)]
*  million contractors and nobody's quite sure. And so there's a large people component to this. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8112.320000000001s)]
*  And then by the way, there's a related component to that, which is how many of them are actually [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8118.320000000001s)]
*  in the office. And the answer is not many. Most of the federal buildings are still empty. Right. And [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8120.96s)]
*  so, and then there's questions of like, are people, you know, working from home or are we actually [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8126.8s)]
*  working from home? So there's the people dimension and of course the money and the people are [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8130.08s)]
*  connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing. Right. And I described [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8133.84s)]
*  earlier how basically our system of government is much more now based on regulations than [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8137.6s)]
*  legislation, right? Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that went [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8141.360000000001s)]
*  through Congress. They're from an agency that created a regulation. That turns out to be very, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8146.400000000001s)]
*  very important. So one is, Elon had already described, we want to do, the Doge wants to do [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8150.88s)]
*  broad-based regulatory relief. And Trump has talked about this and basically get the government off [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8154.72s)]
*  his backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8158.64s)]
*  But there's also something else that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were a [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8163.360000000001s)]
*  set of Supreme court decisions about two years ago that went directly after the idea that the [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8166.56s)]
*  executive branch can create regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8171.92s)]
*  without corresponding congressional legislation. And most of the federal government that exists [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8177.280000000001s)]
*  today, including most of the departments and most of the rules and most of the money and most of the [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8182.96s)]
*  people, most of it is not enforcing laws that Congress passed. Most of it is, is regulation. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8188.64s)]
*  And the Supreme court basically said large parts, large to maybe all of that regulation [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8194.16s)]
*  that did not directly result from a bill that went through Congress the way that the cartoon [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8200.24s)]
*  said that it should, that may not actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8204.48s)]
*  was super in favor of big government. They had no desire to act. They did nothing based on this. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8211.52s)]
*  They didn't pull anything back in, but the new regime, if they choose to, could say, look, [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8215.119999999999s)]
*  the thing that we're doing here is not challenging the laws. We're actually complying with the [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8220.88s)]
*  Supreme court decision that basically says we have to unwind a lot of this and we have to unwind the [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8225.84s)]
*  regulations, which are no longer legal, constitutional. We have to unwind the spend and we have to unwind [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8230.32s)]
*  the people. And so, and that's how you get from basically connect the thread from the regulation [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8234.88s)]
*  part back to the money part, back to the people part. They have work going on all three of these [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8239.439999999999s)]
*  threads. They have, I would say incredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8243.76s)]
*  former government people who a hundred percent of them are super cynical on this topic and they're [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8249.68s)]
*  like, this is impossible. This can never possibly work. And I'm like, well, I can't tell you what [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8252.960000000001s)]
*  the secret plans are, but like, like blow my mind. Like on all three of those, like they have, they [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8257.36s)]
*  have ideas that are like really quite amazing as you'd expect from, you know, from, from the people [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8262.64s)]
*  involved. And so over the course of the next few months, you know, that'll start to become [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8267.04s)]
*  visible. And then the final thing I would say is this is going to be very different than the attempts [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8271.36s)]
*  like there have been other programs like this in the past. The Clinton Gore administration had one [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8276.56s)]
*  and then there were others before that Reagan had one. The difference is this time they're social [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8281.84s)]
*  media. And so there has never been, it's interesting. One of the reasons people in [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8287.519999999999s)]
*  Washington are so cynical is because they know all the bullshit. Like they know all the bad spending [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8294.56s)]
*  and all the bad rules and all the like, you know, I mean, look, we're adding a trillion dollars to [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8300.0s)]
*  the national debt every a hundred days right now. And that's compounding and it's now passing the [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8304.16s)]
*  size of the defense department budget and it's compounding and it's pretty soon, it's going to [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8308.96s)]
*  be adding a trillion dollars every 90 days, and then it's going to be adding a trillion dollars [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8312.48s)]
*  every 80 days. And then it's going to be a trillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8315.119999999999s)]
*  get fixed at some point, we enter a hyper inflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8319.039999999999s)]
*  Kablui, right? And so like everybody in DC knows that something has to be done. And then everybody [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8325.119999999999s)]
*  in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible to do anything. Right. They know all the problems and [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8330.16s)]
*  they also know the sheer impossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're not taking into [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8334.88s)]
*  account, what the critics are not taking into account is these guys can do this in the full [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8338.8s)]
*  light of day and they can do it on social media. They can completely bypass the press. They can [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8343.84s)]
*  completely bypass the cynicism. They can expose any element of unconstitutional or silly government [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8347.2s)]
*  spending. They can run victory laps every single day on what they're doing. They can bring the [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8353.28s)]
*  people into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our Machiavellian [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8357.28s)]
*  structure, which is if you think about, again, you've got democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8362.08s)]
*  rule of the many, rule of the few, rule of the one. You could think about what's happening here [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8367.2s)]
*  as a little bit of a sandwich, right? Which is you have, we don't have a monarch, but we have a [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8371.28s)]
*  president, rule of the one with some power. And then we have the people who can't organize, [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8375.36s)]
*  but they can be informed and they can be aware and they can express themselves through voting [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8380.08s)]
*  and polling. Right? And so there's a sandwich happening right now is the way to think about [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8384.24s)]
*  it, which is you've got basically monarch, monarchy, you've got rule of one combining [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8388.48s)]
*  with rule of many, right? And rule of many is that you get to vote, right? The people do get to vote [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8392.08s)]
*  basically. And then essentially Congress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic class in [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8396.88s)]
*  Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8401.199999999999s)]
*  I think have the power to do all kinds of things here. And I think that would be the way I would [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8406.72s)]
*  watch it. The transparency. I mean, Elon just by who he is, is incentivized to be transparent [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8410.4s)]
*  and show the bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's going to be so [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8419.76s)]
*  exciting. I mean, honestly just makes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8424.4s)]
*  These people are spending our money. Yeah. These people have enormous contempt for the taxpayer. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8431.119999999999s)]
*  Okay. Here's the thing you hear in Washington. Here's one of the things. So the first thing you [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8437.84s)]
*  hear is this is impossible. They'll be able to do nothing. And then, yeah, I walked them through [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8440.640000000001s)]
*  this and they're like, they start to get, it starts to dawn on them that this is a new kind of thing. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8443.2s)]
*  And then they're like, well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in entitlements and the [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8446.720000000001s)]
*  debt and the military. And so like, yeah, you've got like this silly fake, whatever, NPR funding [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8450.0s)]
*  or whatever. And like it just, it's a round here and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8456.560000000001s)]
*  budget and it's like, whatever, $500 million or $5 billion or it's the charging stations that don't [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8459.84s)]
*  exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they build eight charging stations or it's the [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8466.64s)]
*  broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody, right? And cost you $30 billion. So [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8471.439999999999s)]
*  these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is a $30 billion is a rounding error on the [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8477.039999999999s)]
*  federal budget. It doesn't matter who cares if they make it go away. And of course any taxpayer [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8480.64s)]
*  is like, what the? What do you mean? It's $30 billion. Right? And then the experts are like, [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8484.96s)]
*  and the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like, well, it doesn't matter [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8493.199999999999s)]
*  because it's a rounding error. No, it's $30 billion. And if you're this cavalier about $30 [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8496.24s)]
*  billion, imagine how cavalier you are about the 3 trillion. Okay. Then there's the, okay, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8500.48s)]
*  $30 billion is $30 billion. A lot of the federal budget and percentage. No, it's not, but $30 [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8505.6s)]
*  billion divided by 30, but do the math, $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8509.119999999999s)]
*  right? Like what's that math expert? $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay. So $100 to an ordinary [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8514.4s)]
*  person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8522.24s)]
*  It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8529.039999999999s)]
*  materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter, to be able to have a romantic relationship with [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8533.52s)]
*  your wife. It's there's like a hundred things that that person can do with a hundred dollars [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8537.68s)]
*  that they're not doing. Cause it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8541.68s)]
*  the money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous, ridiculousness and graft. And so [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8545.76s)]
*  the idea that that $30 billion program is not something that is like a very important thing to [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8550.64s)]
*  go after is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer is just off the charts. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8554.56s)]
*  And then that's just one of those programs. There's like a hundred of those programs [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8560.0s)]
*  and they're all just like that. Like, it's not like any of this stuff is running well. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8564.48s)]
*  Like the one thing we know is that none of this stuff is running well. Like we know that for sure. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8567.279999999999s)]
*  Right. And we like, we know these people aren't showing up to work and like, we know that all [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8571.039999999999s)]
*  this crazy stuff is happening. Right. And like, you know, the, the, the, do you remember Elon's [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8573.76s)]
*  story of the, do you remember Elon's story of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8578.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. So like Pennsylvania, okay. So Pennsylvania is like a wonderful state, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8582.72s)]
*  great history. It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8585.6s)]
*  cities into just like complete chaos, violence, madness and death. Right. And the federal [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8589.12s)]
*  government has just like, let it happen. It's incredibly violent places. And so the Biden [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8592.64s)]
*  administration decided that the big pressing law enforcement thing that they needed to do in [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8597.28s)]
*  Pennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to prevent them from selling raw milk [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8600.4s)]
*  with armed raids. Right. And it turns out it really pissed off the Amish. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8605.039999999999s)]
*  It turns out they weren't willing to drive to the polling places because they don't have cars. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8611.119999999999s)]
*  But if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the reasons [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8614.96s)]
*  why Trump won. Anyway, so like the law enforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things, [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8618.48s)]
*  like the system's not working. And so you, you add up, pick $130 billion programs. All right. Now [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8623.119999999999s)]
*  you're okay. Math major, a hundred times a hundred. Ten thousand. Ten thousand dollars. Okay. Ten [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8629.68s)]
*  thousand dollars per taxpayer per year. And, but it's also not just about money. That's really, [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8634.56s)]
*  obviously money is a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude that then in sort of, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8640.16s)]
*  in the ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody wants to work in government and be productive. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8645.28s)]
*  It makes it so the corruption can, it breeds corruption. It breeds laziness. It breeds secrecy [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8652.64s)]
*  because you don't want to be transparent about having done nothing all year, all this kind of [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8659.68s)]
*  stuff. And you don't want to reverse that. So it will be exciting for the future to work in government [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8663.92s)]
*  because the amazing thing, if you're the steel man government is you can do shit at scale. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8669.6s)]
*  You have money and you can directly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8676.24s)]
*  It's super exciting. As long as there's no bureaucracy that slows you down or not [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8682.72s)]
*  huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8689.76s)]
*  Yeah. So here's the turn. This blew my mind because I was, you know, once you look at it, [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8692.96s)]
*  once you open the hell mouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8698.4s)]
*  So there is a term of art in government called impoundment. And so you, you, if you're like me, [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8703.039999999999s)]
*  you've learned this the hard way when your car has been impounded, the government meaning of [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8708.8s)]
*  impoundment, the federal budget meaning is a different meaning. Impoundment is as follows. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8712.24s)]
*  The constitution requires Congress to authorize money to be spent by the executive branch. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8716.96s)]
*  Right? So the executive branch goes to Congress says we need money acts. Congress does their thing. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8721.52s)]
*  They come back and they say you can have money. Why the money's appropriated from Congress. The [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8725.84s)]
*  executive branch spends it on the military or whatever they spend it on or on roads to nowhere [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8729.36s)]
*  or charging stations to nowhere or whatever. And what's in the constitution is the Congress [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8733.039999999999s)]
*  appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an additional interpretation of [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8739.28s)]
*  appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which is the executive branch not only [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8746.08s)]
*  needs Congress to appropriate X amount of money. The executive branch is not allowed to underspend. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8751.44s)]
*  Yeah. I'm aware of this. I'm aware of this. And so there's this thing that happens in Washington [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8756.560000000001s)]
*  at the end of every fiscal year, which is September 30th. And it's the, it's the great budget flush [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8762.08s)]
*  and any remaining money that's in the system that they don't know how to productively spend, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8766.64s)]
*  they deliberately spend it on productively. Yeah. To the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8769.84s)]
*  of dollars. A president that doesn't want to spend the money can't not spend it. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8775.44s)]
*  Yeah. Like, okay, A, that's not what's in the constitution. And there's actually quite a good [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8780.0s)]
*  Wikipedia page that goes through the great debate on this has played out in the legal world over the [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8784.88s)]
*  last 60 years. And like, basically, if you look at this with anything resembling, I think it'll [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8788.4s)]
*  open mind. You're like, all right, this is not what the founders meant. And then number two, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8792.56s)]
*  again, we go back to this thing of contempt. Like, can you imagine showing up and running [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8796.64s)]
*  the government like that and thinking that you're doing the right thing and not going home at night [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8803.039999999999s)]
*  and thinking that you've sold your soul, right? Like, it's just like, I actually think you sort [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8806.0s)]
*  of had a really good point, which is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8810.32s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Cause it makes them, it makes them bad people and they didn't, they didn't start out [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8813.92s)]
*  wanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this, like, yeah, everywhere, everywhere. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8817.199999999999s)]
*  And so we'll see how far these guys get. I'm, I am extremely encouraged what I've, what I've seen so [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8823.279999999999s)]
*  far. It seems like a lot of people will try to slow them down, but yeah, I hope they get far. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8826.96s)]
*  Another difficult topic, immigration. What's your take on the, let's say heated H1B visa debate [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8831.439999999999s)]
*  that's going on online and legal immigration in general? Yeah. Should I start by saying I am not [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8837.84s)]
*  involved in any aspect of government policy on this. I am not planning to be, this is not an issue [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8844.08s)]
*  that I'm working on or that I'm going to work on. I'm, we're not, this is not part of the agenda [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8848.8s)]
*  of what the firm is doing. So my firm is doing so like, I'm not, I'm not in, I'm not in this in the [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8852.32s)]
*  new administration or the government. I'm not planning to be so purely just personal opinion. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8857.279999999999s)]
*  So I would say I would describe it as a complex or nuanced, hopefully nuanced view on this issue. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8862.24s)]
*  That's maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I think, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8867.84s)]
*  and I kind of thought about this, you know, I didn't say anything about it all the way through [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8872.88s)]
*  the big kind of debate over Christmas, but I thought about it a lot and read everything. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8875.44s)]
*  I think what I realized is that I just have a very different perspective on some of these things. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8879.279999999999s)]
*  And the reason is because of the combination of where I came from and then where I ended up. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8883.039999999999s)]
*  And so let's start with this. Where I ended up, Silicon Valley. So, and I have made the pro [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8887.84s)]
*  skilled high skilled immigration argument many, many times, the H1B argument many times [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8894.4s)]
*  in past lives. I've been in DC many times arguing with prior administrations about this, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8898.88s)]
*  always on the side of trying to get more H1Bs and trying to get more high skilled immigration. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8903.84s)]
*  And, you know, I think that argument is very strong and very solid and very, you know, [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8907.76s)]
*  has paid off for the U.S. in many, many ways. And we can go through it, but I think it's the argument [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8913.44s)]
*  everybody already knows, right? It's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8917.84s)]
*  you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H1Bs, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8921.2s)]
*  right? So everybody kind of gets that argument. So it's basically just to summarize, it's a [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8924.32s)]
*  mechanism by which you can get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8928.960000000001s)]
*  keep them here to increase the productivity of the U.S. companies. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8933.36s)]
*  Yeah. And then it's not just good for them and it's not just good for Silicon Valley or the tech [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8938.24s)]
*  industry, it's good for the country because they then create new companies and create new technologies [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8943.44s)]
*  and create new industries that then create many more jobs for Americans, native born Americans, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8947.44s)]
*  than would have previously existed. And so you've got a, it's a positive, some flywheel thing [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8951.92s)]
*  where everybody wins. Like everybody wins, there are no trade-offs. It's all absolutely glorious in [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8956.32s)]
*  all directions. You cannot possibly, there cannot possibly be a moral argument against it under any [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8961.28s)]
*  circumstances. Anybody who argues against it is obviously doing so from a position of racism, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8966.560000000001s)]
*  is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right? Right. I mean, that's the thing. And like I said, [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8970.960000000001s)]
*  I've made that argument many times. I'm very comfortable with that argument. And then I'd [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8975.68s)]
*  also say, look, I would say number one, I believe a lot of it. I'll talk about the parts I don't [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8978.320000000002s)]
*  believe, but I believe a lot of it. And then the other part is, look, I benefit every day. I always [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8982.24s)]
*  describe it as I work in the United Nations. Like I, my own firm and our founders and our companies [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8987.04s)]
*  and the industry and my friends, you know, are just this like amazing, you know, panoply, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8992.720000000001s)]
*  cornucopia of people from all over the world. And, you know, I just, I've worked, I don't know, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9000.080000000002s)]
*  at this point where people from, it's gotta be, I don't know, 80 countries or something. And [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9005.12s)]
*  hopefully over time it'll be, you know, the rest as well. And, you know, it's just, it's been amazing [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9008.160000000002s)]
*  and they've done many of the most important things in my industry and it's, it's been really [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9012.160000000002s)]
*  remarkable. So, so that's all good. And then, you know, there's just the practical version of [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9015.2s)]
*  the argument, which is we are the, we are the main place. These people get educated anyway, [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9020.16s)]
*  right? They, the best and the brightest tend to come here to get educated. And so, you know, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9023.52s)]
*  this is the old kind of Mitt Romney staple of green card to every, you know, at least, you know, [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9026.720000000001s)]
*  maybe not every university degree, but every technical degree, maybe the sociologists we [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9030.800000000001s)]
*  could quibble about, but you know, the roboticists for sure, for sure, for sure. We can all agree. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9035.76s)]
*  At least I won you over on something today. Well, no, I'm, I'm exaggerating for effect. So, [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9040.16s)]
*  and I lost you. I had you for a second. I haven't gotten to the other side of the argument yet. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9045.44s)]
*  Okay. Thank you. So surely we can all agree that we need to staple a green card roller [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9049.44s)]
*  coasters going up. The roller coaster is rationing slowly up. So, yeah, so surely we can all agree [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9054.880000000001s)]
*  that the roboticists should all get green cards. And again, like there's a lot of merit to that. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9059.84s)]
*  Obviously, like, look, we want the U S to be the world leader in robotics. What's step one to being [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9062.960000000001s)]
*  the world leader in robotics is have all the great robotics people, right? Like, you know, very [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9066.960000000001s)]
*  unlike the underpants, no, it's like a very straightforward formula, right? All right. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9071.04s)]
*  That's all well and good. All right. But it gets a little bit more complicated because there is a [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9074.56s)]
*  kind of argument that's sort of right underneath that, that you also hear from, you know, these [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9079.519999999999s)]
*  same people. And I have made this argument myself many times, which is we need to do this because [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9082.8s)]
*  we don't have enough people in the U S who can do it otherwise. Right. We have all these unfilled [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9086.8s)]
*  jobs. We've got all these, you know, all these companies that wouldn't exist. We don't have [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9090.88s)]
*  enough good founders. We don't have enough engineers. We don't have enough scientists. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9093.68s)]
*  Or then the next version of the argument below that is our education system is not good enough [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9097.119999999999s)]
*  to generate those people. And which is a weird argument by the way, because like our education [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9101.2s)]
*  system is good enough for foreigners to be able to come here preferentially and like a very large [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9106.16s)]
*  number of cases, but somehow not good enough to educate our own native foreign people. So there's [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9110.560000000001s)]
*  like a weird, these little cracks in the matrix that you can kind of stick your fingernail into [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9114.400000000001s)]
*  and kind of wonder about. Now we'll come back to that one, but like at least yes, our education [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9118.400000000001s)]
*  system has this flaws. And then, and then underneath that is the, is the argument that, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9122.720000000001s)]
*  you know, Vivek made, you know, which is, you know, we have cultural rot in the country and, [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9126.08s)]
*  you know, native born people in the country aren't, you know, don't work hard enough and [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9130.56s)]
*  spend too much time watching TV and tick tock and don't spend enough time studying differential, [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9133.519999999999s)]
*  you know, equations. And again, it's like, all right, like, you know, yeah, there's a fair [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9137.279999999999s)]
*  amount to that. Like there's a lot of American culture that is, you know, there's a lot of [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9141.359999999999s)]
*  frivolity. There's a lot of, you know, look at that. I mean, we have well documented social issues on [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9146.4s)]
*  many fronts, many things that cut against having a culture of just like straightforward high [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9150.0s)]
*  achievement and effort and striving. Anyway, like, you know, those are the basic arguments. But then [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9154.24s)]
*  I have this kind of other side of my, you know, kind of personality and thought process, which is, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9159.6s)]
*  well, I grew up in a small farming town in rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest. And, you know, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9163.52s)]
*  it's interesting. There's not a lot of people who make it from rural Wisconsin to, you know, high [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9167.68s)]
*  tech. And so it's like, all right, why is that exactly? Right. And then I know I'm an aberration, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9171.68s)]
*  like I was the only one from anybody I ever knew who ever did this, right. I know what an aberration [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9177.68s)]
*  I am. And I know exactly how that aberration happened. And it's a very unusual set of steps, [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9182.0s)]
*  including, you know, many that were just luck. But like it, there is in no sense, a talent flow [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9185.6s)]
*  from rural Wisconsin into high tech, like not at all. There is also like in no sense, a talent [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9192.4s)]
*  flow from the rest of the Midwest into high tech. There is no talent flow from the South in the high [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9199.84s)]
*  tech. There is no flow from the Sunbelt into high tech. There's no flow from, you know, the deep South [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9203.52s)]
*  in the high tech. Like just like literally it's like the blanks, but there's this whole section [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9208.480000000001s)]
*  of the country that just where the people just like for some reason don't end up in tech. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9213.6s)]
*  Now that's a little bit strange because these are the people who put a man on the moon. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9218.320000000002s)]
*  These are the people who built the world war II war machine. These are the people, at least their [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9223.6s)]
*  ancestors are the people who built the second industrial revolution and built the railroads [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9228.160000000002s)]
*  and built the telephone network, telephone network and built, you know, logistics and [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9232.08s)]
*  transportation in the auto industry. I mean, the auto industry was built in Cleveland and Detroit. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9235.52s)]
*  And so at least these people's parents and grandparents and great-grandparents somehow [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9239.36s)]
*  had the wherewithal to like build all of this, like amazing things, invent all these things. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9243.36s)]
*  And then there's many, many, many, many stories in the history of American invention and innovation [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9247.36s)]
*  and capitalism, where you had people who grew up in the middle of nowhere, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9251.68s)]
*  Fylo Farnsworth invented the television and just like, you know, tons and tons of others, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9254.720000000001s)]
*  endless stories like this. Now you have like a puzzle, right? And the conundrum, which is like, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9258.24s)]
*  okay, like what is happening on the blank spot of the map? And then of course you also can't help [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9262.960000000001s)]
*  noticing that the blank spot on the map, the Midwest, the South, you've also just defined [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9267.68s)]
*  Trump country, the Trump voter base, right? And it's like, oh, well, that's interesting. Like, [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9272.08s)]
*  how did that happen? Right. And so either you really, really, really have to believe the very, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9277.04s)]
*  very strong version of like the Vivek thesis or something where you have to believe that like that [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9281.36s)]
*  basically culture, the whole sort of civilization in the middle of the country and the south of the [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9285.12s)]
*  country is so like deeply flawed, either inherently flawed or culturally flawed such that for whatever [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9289.52s)]
*  reason they are not able to do the things that their parents and grandparents were able to do [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9294.96s)]
*  and that their peers are able to do or something else is happening. Would you care to guess on [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9299.039999999999s)]
*  what else is happening? I mean, what affirmative action? Affirmative action. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9302.72s)]
*  Okay. This is very, think about this is very entertaining, right? What are the three things [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9308.64s)]
*  that we know about affirmative action? It is absolutely 100% necessary. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9312.32s)]
*  However, it cannot explain the success of any one individual. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9318.32s)]
*  Right. Right. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9320.96s)]
*  Nor does it have any victims at all. I think it could explain maybe [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9322.96s)]
*  disproportionate, but it surely doesn't explain why you're probably the only person in Silicon [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9326.56s)]
*  Valley from Wisconsin. What educational institution in the last 60 years has wanted [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9332.88s)]
*  farm boys from Wisconsin? But what institution rejected farm boys from Wisconsin? All of them. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9336.72s)]
*  All of them. Of course. Okay. So we know this. We know this. The reason we know this is because [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9342.24s)]
*  of the Harvard and UNC Supreme Court cases. So this was like three years ago. These were big [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9346.48s)]
*  court cases. Because the idea of affirmative action has been litigated for many, many, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9351.68s)]
*  many years and through many court cases. And the Supreme Court repeatedly in the past had upheld [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9355.199999999999s)]
*  that it was a completely legitimate thing to do. And there's basically two categories of affirmative [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9358.88s)]
*  action that really matter. One is admissions into educational institutions. And then the other is [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9363.68s)]
*  jobs, getting hired. Those are the two biggest areas. The education one is super potent, [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9369.6s)]
*  has been a super potent political issue for a very long time for all. People have written [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9374.48s)]
*  and talked about this for many decades. I don't need to go through it. There's many arguments [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9378.08s)]
*  for why it's important. There's many arguments as to how it could backfire. It's been this thing. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9381.039999999999s)]
*  But the Supreme Court upheld it for a very long time. The most recent ruling, I'm not a lawyer. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9384.88s)]
*  I don't have the exact reference in my head, but there was a case in 2003 that said that [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9390.48s)]
*  Senator De O'Connor famously wrote that although it had been 30 years of affirmative action and [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9396.08s)]
*  although it was not working remotely as it had been intended, she said that, well, basically, [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9400.96s)]
*  we need to try it for another 25 years. But she said basically as a message to future [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9407.039999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court justices, if it hasn't resolved basically the issues it's intended to resolve [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9410.48s)]
*  within 25 years, then we should probably call it off. By the way, we're coming up on the 25 years. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9414.72s)]
*  It's a couple of years away. The Supreme Court just had these cases. It was a Harvard case and [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9419.359999999999s)]
*  I think a University of North Carolina case. And what's interesting about those cases is the [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9425.759999999998s)]
*  lawyers in those cases put a tremendous amount of evidence into the record of how the admissions [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9429.84s)]
*  decisions actually happen at Harvard and happen at UNC. And it is like every bit as cartoonishly [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9434.960000000001s)]
*  garish and racist as you could possibly imagine because it's a ring of power. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9441.44s)]
*  And if you're an admissions officer at a private university or an administrator, [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9447.2s)]
*  you have unlimited power to do what you want and you can justify any of it under any of these rules [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9450.32s)]
*  or systems. And up until these cases, it had been a black box where you didn't have to explain [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9455.28s)]
*  yourself and show your work. And what the Harvard and USC cases did is they basically required [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9460.480000000001s)]
*  showing the work. And there was all kinds of phenomenal detail. I mean, number one is there [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9464.480000000001s)]
*  were text messages in there that will just curl your hair of students being spoken of and just [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9469.6s)]
*  crude racial stereotypes that would just make you want to jump out the window. It's horrible stuff. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9473.76s)]
*  But also there was statistical information. And of course, the big statistical kicker to the whole [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9477.84s)]
*  thing is that at top institutions, it's common for different ethnic groups to have different [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9482.8s)]
*  cutoffs for SAT that are as wide as 400 points. So different groups. So specifically Asians need [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9486.96s)]
*  to perform at 400 SAT points higher than other ethnicities in order to actually get admitted [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9496.4s)]
*  into these. I mean, white people are a part of this, but Asians are a very big part of this. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9501.359999999999s)]
*  And actually the Harvard case was actually brought by an activist on behalf of actually [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9505.439999999999s)]
*  the Asian students who were being turned away. And it's basically, I mean, it's the cliche now [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9509.2s)]
*  in the Valley and in the medical community, which is like, if you want a super genius, [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9513.84s)]
*  you hire an Asian from Harvard because they are guaranteed to be freaking Einstein. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9516.880000000001s)]
*  Because if they weren't, they were never getting admitted. Right. Almost all the [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9521.2s)]
*  qualified Asians get turned away. So they've been running this. It's a very, very explicit, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9524.240000000002s)]
*  very, very clear program. This of course has been a third rail of things that people are not supposed [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9530.240000000002s)]
*  to discuss or under any circumstances. The thing that has really changed the tenor on this is [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9534.640000000001s)]
*  I think two things. Number one, those Supreme court cases, the Supreme court ruled that they [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9539.12s)]
*  can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a single education institution [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9543.12s)]
*  in America that is conforming with the Supreme court ruling. I think they are all flagrantly [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9547.92s)]
*  ignoring it. And we could talk about that. Mostly because of momentum probably or what? [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9552.400000000001s)]
*  They are trying to make the world a better place. They are trying to solve all these [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9556.400000000001s)]
*  social problems. They are trying to have diverse student populations. They are trying to live up [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9559.36s)]
*  to the expectations of their donors. They are trying to make their faculty happy. They are trying to [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9563.76s)]
*  have their friends and family think that they are good people. They are trying to have the [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9569.12s)]
*  press write nice things about them. It's nearly impossible for them. And to be clear, nobody has [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9573.36s)]
*  been fired from an admissions office for 25 years or prior. The Supreme court now is ruled to be [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9580.0s)]
*  illegality. And so they are all the same people under the exact same pressures. The numbers are [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9585.44s)]
*  moving a little bit, but I don't know anybody in the system who thinks that they are complying [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9592.160000000002s)]
*  with the Supreme court. Who's in charge in the rank ordering of who rules who? The universities [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9596.32s)]
*  rule the Supreme court way more than the Supreme court rules the universities. Well, another [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9601.36s)]
*  example of that is I think it's every sitting member of the Supreme court right now went to [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9605.44s)]
*  either Harvard or Yale. The level of incestuousness here is like... Anyway, so there's that. And so [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9608.64s)]
*  this has been running for a very long time. So one is the Harvard and UNC cases kind of gave up the [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9616.32s)]
*  game, number one, or at least showed what the mechanism was. And then number two, the other [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9619.44s)]
*  thing is obviously the aftermath of October 7th, right? And what we discovered was happening with [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9623.52s)]
*  Jewish applicants. And what was happening at all the top institutions for Jewish applicants was [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9628.16s)]
*  they were being managed down, they were being actively managed down as a percentage of the base. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9632.560000000001s)]
*  And let's say I've heard reports of like extremely explicit basically plans to manage the Jewish [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9638.960000000001s)]
*  admissions down to their representative percentage of the US population, which is 2%. And there's a [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9646.16s)]
*  whole backstory here, which is a hundred years ago, Jews were not admitted into a lot of these [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9651.04s)]
*  institutions. And then there was a big campaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9654.400000000001s)]
*  immediately became 30% of these institutions because there's so many smart, talented Jews. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9657.84s)]
*  So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent generation of leadership has been trying [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9662.320000000002s)]
*  to get it down to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least a lot of Jewish people I know, sort of, [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9666.640000000001s)]
*  they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered it the hard way after October 7th, [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9671.76s)]
*  right? And so all of a sudden... So basically the Supreme court case meant that you could address [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9676.080000000002s)]
*  this in terms of the Asian victims. The October 7th meant that you could address it in terms of [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9680.64s)]
*  the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are being systematically excluded, right? [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9685.439999999999s)]
*  And then of course, there's the thing that you basically can't talk about, which is all the [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9689.92s)]
*  white people are being excluded. And then it turns out it's also happening to black people. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9693.76s)]
*  And this is the thing that like blew my freaking mind when I found out about it. So I just assumed [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9699.92s)]
*  that this was great news for American blacks because obviously if whites, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9705.76s)]
*  Asians and Jews are being excluded, then the whole point of this in the beginning was to get [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9711.52s)]
*  the black population up. And so this must be great for American blacks. So then I discovered [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9714.960000000001s)]
*  this New York Times article from 2004 called, blacks are being admitted into tough schools [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9719.12s)]
*  at greater numbers, but which ones? And again, and by the way, this is in the New York Times. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9724.800000000001s)]
*  This is not in like, whatever, National Review, this is New York Times. 2004. And the two [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9731.28s)]
*  authorities that were quoted in the story are Henry Louis Gates, who's the Dean of the African [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9737.04s)]
*  American Studies community in the United States. Super brilliant guy. And then Lani Guinier, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9741.12s)]
*  she was a potential Supreme court appointee under, I think, a close friend of Hillary Clinton. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9747.84s)]
*  And there was for a long time, she was on the short list for Supreme court. So one of the top [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9752.320000000002s)]
*  jurists, lawyers in the country, both black, was sort of legendarily successful in the academic [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9756.48s)]
*  and legal worlds and black. And they are quoted as the authorities in this story. And the story [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9762.960000000001s)]
*  that they tell is actually very, it's amazing. And by the way, it's happening today in education [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9767.84s)]
*  institutions and it's happening in companies. And you can see it all over the place and the government, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9775.12s)]
*  which is at least at that time, the number was half of the black admits into a place like Harvard [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9779.599999999999s)]
*  were not American born blacks. They were foreign born blacks. Specifically, northern African, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9786.16s)]
*  generally Nigerian or West Indian. Right. And by the way, many Nigerians and northern Africans have [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9793.84s)]
*  come to the US and have been very successful. Nigerian Americans as a group, like way out [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9801.279999999999s)]
*  performed. They're, you know, this is a super smart cohort of people. And then West Indian [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9804.48s)]
*  blacks in the US are incredibly successful. Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9808.08s)]
*  as well as Colin Powell, like just two sort of examples of that. And so basically what Henry [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9812.72s)]
*  Louis Gates and Lenny Grenier said in the story is Harvard is basically struggling to either [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9817.84s)]
*  whatever it was, identify, recruit, make successful, whatever it was, American born native blacks. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9822.72s)]
*  And so therefore they were using high skilled immigration as an escape hatch [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9828.16s)]
*  to go get blacks from other countries. And then this was 2004 when you could discuss such things. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9832.32s)]
*  Obviously that is a topic that nobody has discussed since it has sailed on. All of the DEI [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9838.88s)]
*  programs of the last 20 years have had this exact characteristic. There's large numbers of black [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9844.56s)]
*  people in America who are fully aware of this and are like, it's obviously not us that are getting [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9849.36s)]
*  any slots. We're obviously, we're literally competing with people who are being imported. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9853.52s)]
*  And you know, if you believe in the basis of affirmative action, you were trying to make up [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9857.279999999999s)]
*  for historical injustice of American black slavery. And so the idea that you import somebody from [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9860.48s)]
*  Nigeria that never experienced that is like tremendously insulting to black Americans. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9865.6s)]
*  Anyway, so you can see where I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60 year social engineering [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9872.4s)]
*  experiment to exclude native born people from the educational slots and jobs that high skilled [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9876.96s)]
*  immigration has been funneling foreigners into. Right. And so it turns out it's not a victim free [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9882.16s)]
*  thing. There's like 100%. There's victims because why? There's only so many, for sure there's only [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9886.96s)]
*  so many education slots. And then for sure there's only so many of these jobs. Right. You know, [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9891.199999999999s)]
*  Google only hires so many, you know, whatever level seven engineers. Right. And so that's the [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9895.519999999999s)]
*  other side of it. Right. And so you're a farm boy in Wisconsin, right. Or a, you know, black American [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9900.4s)]
*  whose ancestors arrived here, you know, on a slave ship 300 years ago in Louisiana, or a, you know, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9906.64s)]
*  Cambodian immigrant in the Bronx. And your kid or a Jewish immigrant, or, you know, from a very [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9912.24s)]
*  successful Jewish family. And, you know, your entire, you know, for three generations, you and [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9919.28s)]
*  your parents and grandparents went to Harvard. And what all of those groups know is the system that [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9923.92s)]
*  has been created is not for them. Right. It's designed specifically to exclude them. And then [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9928.16s)]
*  what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, yeah, let's bring in more [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9934.4s)]
*  foreigners. Right. And so anyway, so the short version of it is you can't anymore, I don't think, [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9938.08s)]
*  just have the quote high-skilled immigration conversation for either education or for [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9943.76s)]
*  employment without also having the DEI conversation. And then underneath, and then DEI is just [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9951.28s)]
*  another word for affirmative action. So it's the affirmative action conversation. And you need to [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9956.24s)]
*  actually deal with this at substance and to see what's actually happening to people. You need to [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9960.0s)]
*  join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for high-skilled immigration, [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9962.96s)]
*  given the extent to which DEI took over both the education hiring, education process and the hiring [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9968.8s)]
*  process. Okay. So first of all, that was brilliantly laid out the nuance of it. So just to understand, [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9974.4s)]
*  it's not so much a criticism of H1B, high-skilled immigration, is that there needs to be more people [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9981.039999999999s)]
*  saying, yay, we need more American born hires. So I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9987.519999999999s)]
*  every message on this and not saying anything. And when I was, which you know me well enough to know [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9993.439999999999s)]
*  that's a serious level of work. Yeah, that's very Zen. Yes. Thank you. No, it wasn't. There was [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9998.72s)]
*  tremendous rage on the other side of it, but I suppressed it. So I was waiting for the dog that [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10003.439999999999s)]
*  didn't bark. Right. And the dog that didn't bark was, I did not, and tell me if you saw one, I did [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10011.119999999999s)]
*  not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10015.76s)]
*  who was also pounding the table to go get more smart kids who are already here [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10019.12s)]
*  into these educational institutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10022.880000000001s)]
*  That's true. I think I agree with that. There really was a divide. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10027.36s)]
*  But it was like, literally it was like the proponents of high-skilled immigrant. And again, [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10031.92s)]
*  this was me for a very long time. I mean, I kind of took myself by surprise on this because I was on, [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10035.04s)]
*  you know, I had the much say simpler version of this story for a very long time. Like I said, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10038.880000000001s)]
*  I've been in Washington many times under past presidents lobbying for this, by the way, never [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10043.44s)]
*  made any progress, which we could talk about. Like it never actually worked. But, you know, [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10047.04s)]
*  I've been on the other side of this one, but I was literally sitting there being like, all right, [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10051.76s)]
*  which of these like super geniuses who, you know, many of whom, by the way, are very, you know, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10054.880000000001s)]
*  successful high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled immigrants, you know, which of these [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10059.12s)]
*  super geniuses are going to like say, actually we have this like incredible talent source here in [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10063.12s)]
*  the country, which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people. I'm talking about [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10067.36s)]
*  native-born Americans, whites, Asians, Jews, blacks, for sure. For sure. For sure. Those four [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10070.16s)]
*  groups. But also white people. Yeah. And also white people. People that are making the case [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10075.039999999999s)]
*  for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H1B. It's an extreme divide. And [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10081.2s)]
*  those people that are making that case are often not making it in a way that's like, [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10089.36s)]
*  uh, making it in quite a radical way. Let's put it this way. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10095.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But you have this interesting thing that you have a split between the sides that I've noticed, [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10099.039999999999s)]
*  which is one side has all of the experts. Right. Right. And I'm using scare for people listening [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10102.16s)]
*  to audio. I'm making quotes in the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can. One side has all [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10107.92s)]
*  the certified experts. The other side just has a bunch of people who are like, they know that [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10111.84s)]
*  something is wrong and they don't quite know how to explain it. And what was so unusual about the [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10115.679999999998s)]
*  Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of the Supreme Court is they actually had sophisticated [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10119.84s)]
*  lawyers for the first time in a long time actually put all this evidence together and actually put [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10123.76s)]
*  it in the public record. They actually, they actually had experts, which is just, which is [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10126.800000000001s)]
*  just really rare. Generally what you get is you get, because if you don't have experts, what do [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10130.720000000001s)]
*  you have? You know something is wrong and you have, but you have primarily an emotional response. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10134.08s)]
*  You feel it, but can you put it, you know, can you put it in the words and tables and charts, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10138.16s)]
*  you know, that are, that are certified expert can and no, you can't like, that's not, you know, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10144.08s)]
*  that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong. And it also doesn't mean that you [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10147.44s)]
*  have less of a moral stance. Yeah. And so it's just like, all right. Now, by the way, look, [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10150.16s)]
*  I think there's, there, I think there are ways to square the circle. I think there's a way to have [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10154.8s)]
*  our cake and eat it too. Like, I think there'd be many ways to resolve this. I think, again, [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10157.76s)]
*  I think the way to do it is to look at these, these, these issues combined, look at, at DEI [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10162.32s)]
*  combined with high school immigration. It so happens the DEI is under much more scrutiny today [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10166.56s)]
*  than it has been for probably 20 years affirmative action is the Supreme Court did just rule that it [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10172.48s)]
*  is not legal for universities to do that. They are still doing it, but they should stop. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10178.64s)]
*  And then there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also dishing their DEI programs. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10186.16s)]
*  In part, that's happening for a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10192.64s)]
*  a lot of corporate lawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court rulings in education [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10195.84s)]
*  either already apply to businesses or it just is a clear foreshadowing. The Supreme Court will [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10200.16s)]
*  rule on new cases that will ban any businesses. And so, so, so there, there is a moment here to [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10205.28s)]
*  be able to look at this on both sides. Let me add one more nuance to it though. It makes it even [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10210.560000000001s)]
*  more complicated. So the cliche is we're going to brain drain the world, right? You've heard that [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10216.16s)]
*  we're going to, we're going to take all the smart people from all over the world. We're going to [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10220.720000000001s)]
*  bring them here. We're going to educate them and we're going to keep them. And then they're going [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10223.28s)]
*  to raise their families here, create businesses here, create jobs here. Right. In the cliche, [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10225.52s)]
*  that's a super positive thing. Yeah. Okay. So what happens to the rest of the world? [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10228.960000000001s)]
*  They lose. Well, how fungible are people? [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10234.8s)]
*  How many highly ambitious, highly conscientious, highly energetic, high achieving, high IQ super [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10241.44s)]
*  geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great. But if there just aren't that [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10248.08s)]
*  many and they all come here and they all aren't where they would be otherwise, what happens to [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10253.76s)]
*  all those other places? So it's almost impossible for us here to have that conversation in part [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10259.68s)]
*  because we become incredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10265.36s)]
*  aren't just simply all the same, which is the whole thing we could talk about. But also we are [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10269.12s)]
*  purely the beneficiary of this effect, right? We are brain draining the world, not the other way [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10275.04s)]
*  around. There's only four. So if you look at the flow of high skilled immigration over time, [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10278.56s)]
*  there's only four permanent sinks of high skilled immigration places people go. It's the US, Canada, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10283.12s)]
*  the UK and Australia. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so for those countries, [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10288.8s)]
*  this seems like a no lose proposition. It's all the other countries that basically what we four [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10297.199999999999s)]
*  countries have been doing is draining all those people out. It's actually much easier for people [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10302.32s)]
*  in Europe to talk about this I've discovered because the Eurozone is whatever, 28 countries. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10305.92s)]
*  And within the Eurozone, the high skilled people over time have been migrating to originally the [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10310.24s)]
*  UK, but also specifically, I think it's the Netherlands, Germany and France, [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10314.72s)]
*  but specifically they've been migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10319.359999999999s)]
*  where this really hit the fan was in Greece, right? So Greece falls into chaos, disaster. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10324.24s)]
*  And then you're running the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10328.96s)]
*  economic development plan together. All of your smart young kids have left. What are you going to [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10331.599999999999s)]
*  do, right? By the way, this is a potential, I know you care a lot about Ukraine. This is a potential [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10338.08s)]
*  crisis for Ukraine, in part because of this, because we enthusiastically recruit Ukrainians, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10344.16s)]
*  of course. And so we've been brain draining Ukraine for a long time, but also of course, [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10349.119999999999s)]
*  war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so when it comes time for Ukraine to rebuild [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10353.36s)]
*  as a peaceful country, is it going to have the talent base even that it had five years ago? [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10358.16s)]
*  It's like a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, we have brain drain a lot of [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10362.88s)]
*  really smart people out of Russia. A lot of them are here over the last 30 years. And so there's [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10367.119999999999s)]
*  this thing, it's actually really funny if you think about it. The one thing that we know to [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10372.88s)]
*  be the height of absolute evil that the West ever did was colonization and resource extraction. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10377.359999999999s)]
*  Right? So we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and English and everybody [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10382.64s)]
*  else went and had these colonies and then went in and we took all the oil and we took all the [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10387.199999999999s)]
*  diamonds and we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is, right? Well, for some reason, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10390.72s)]
*  we realized that that's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10395.279999999999s)]
*  non-conscious physical matter. For some reason, we think it's completely morally acceptable to [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10398.96s)]
*  do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious and beautiful and wonderful and the great [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10403.679999999998s)]
*  flowering of peace and harmony and moral justice of our time to do it. And we don't think for one [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10409.359999999999s)]
*  second what we're doing to the countries that we're pulling all these people out of. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10414.72s)]
*  And this is one of these things like, I don't know, maybe we're just going to live in this [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10418.56s)]
*  delusional state forever and we'll just keep doing it and it'll keep benefiting us and we just won't [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10422.24s)]
*  care what happens. But I think there may come, this is one of these submarines under 10 feet [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10425.92s)]
*  under the water line. I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly realize, oh my God, [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10430.64s)]
*  what are we doing? Because we need the rest of the world to succeed too, right? We need these other [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10435.36s)]
*  countries to flourish. We don't want to be the only successful country in the middle of just [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10441.6s)]
*  complete chaos and disaster. And we just extract and we extract and we extract and we don't think [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10445.28s)]
*  twice about it. This is so deeply profound actually. So what is the cost of winning, [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10449.76s)]
*  quote unquote, if these countries are drained in terms of human capital on the level of geopolitics, [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10456.960000000001s)]
*  what does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10464.32s)]
*  want them to be strong in the way we understand strong, not just in every way so that cooperation [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10469.68s)]
*  and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. It's interesting. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10478.32s)]
*  This is one of those truths where you just speak and it resonates and I didn't even think about it. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10485.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So this is you were sitting during the holiday season, just boiling over. So all that [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10491.279999999999s)]
*  said, there's still to you some good to the H1B? Okay, so then you get this other, okay, so then [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10498.4s)]
*  come all the way around. There's another nuance. So there's another nuance. There's another nuance, [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10505.68s)]
*  which is mostly the valley we don't use H1Bs anymore. Mostly we use O1s. So there's a separate [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10508.720000000001s)]
*  class of visa and the O1 is like this. It turns out the O1 is the supergenius visa. So the O1 is [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10515.6s)]
*  basically our founder. When we have somebody from anywhere in the world and they've invented a [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10521.36s)]
*  breakthrough in new technology and they want to come to the US to start a company, they come in [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10526.080000000002s)]
*  through an O1 visa. And that actually is like a fairly high bar. It's a high acceptance rate, [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10529.52s)]
*  but it's like a pretty high bar and they do a lot of work and you have to put real work into it [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10534.800000000001s)]
*  and really prove your case. Mostly what's happened with the H1B visa program is that it has gone to [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10539.2s)]
*  basically two categories of employers. One is basically a small set of big tech companies that [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10546.08s)]
*  hire in volume, which is exactly the companies that you would think. And then the other is it [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10550.32s)]
*  goes to these, they call kind of the mills, the consulting mills, right? And so there's a set of [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10554.640000000001s)]
*  companies with names. I don't want to pick on companies, but names like Cognizant that hire, [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10558.88s)]
*  basically have their business model is primarily Indian, being in primarily Indians in large [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10563.599999999999s)]
*  numbers. And they often have offices next to company owned housing and they'll have organizations [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10569.119999999999s)]
*  that are literally thousands of Indians living and working in the US and they do basically call it [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10574.96s)]
*  mid-tier like IT consulting. So these folks, they're making good wages, but they're making [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10581.599999999999s)]
*  60 or 80 or $100,000 a year, not the 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so in practice, [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10587.84s)]
*  the startups, basic like little tech, as we call it, or the startup world, [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10595.6s)]
*  mainly doesn't use H1Bs at this point and mainly can't because the system is kind of rigged in a [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10599.44s)]
*  way that we really can't. And then again, you get to the sort of underlying morality here, [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10604.08s)]
*  which is it's like, well, Amazon, Amazon's an, I love Amazon, but they're a big powerful company. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10608.960000000001s)]
*  They've got more money than God. They've got resources. They've got a long-term planning [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10615.279999999999s)]
*  horizon. They do big, profound things over decades at a time. They could, or any of these other [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10618.88s)]
*  companies could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10625.44s)]
*  from all throughout the country. And you'll notice they don't do that. They bring in 10,000, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10629.84s)]
*  20,000 H1Bs a year. And so you've got a question there. And then these mills, there's lots of [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10635.359999999999s)]
*  questions around them and whether they should, whether that's even an ethical way to, I don't [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10641.52s)]
*  want to say they're unethical, but there's questions around exactly what the trade-offs are there. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10645.68s)]
*  And so, yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box that really, nobody really wanted to be opened. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10651.2s)]
*  To play devil's advocate on all this in terms of national immigration issues, [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10657.52s)]
*  none of this is a top end issue just because the numbers are small. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10661.28s)]
*  Right. And so I don't think the administration has said this is not a priority of theirs for [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10664.560000000001s)]
*  right now. But I guess what I would say is like there is actually a lot of complexity and nuance [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10668.24s)]
*  here. I have a lot of friends, like I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues who are, [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10673.52s)]
*  you know, came over on H1Bs or O1s, green cards, many are now citizens. And, you know, every single [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10678.08s)]
*  one of them was not every single one. A lot of them were enthusiastic to, you know, defend the [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10683.76s)]
*  honor of immigrants throughout this whole period. And they said to me, it's like, well, Mark, how [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10687.039999999999s)]
*  can we, you know, how can we, how can we more clearly express, you know, the importance of [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10690.4s)]
*  high-skilled immigration to the U.S.? And I was like, I think you can do it by advocating for also [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10693.52s)]
*  developing our native foreign talent. And like, do you want to inflame the issue or do you want [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10697.44s)]
*  to diffuse the issue? Right. And I think the answer is to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one more [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10702.4s)]
*  positive scenario, which, and then I'll also beat up on the university some more. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10709.84s)]
*  Do you know about the National Merit Scholarship System? Have you heard about this? [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10714.800000000001s)]
*  Not really. Can you explain? [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10719.76s)]
*  So there's a system that was created during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars. And [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10720.640000000001s)]
*  it is a basically, it was created, I forget in the 1950s or 60s when it was when people in [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10725.6s)]
*  government actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest as heretical an idea as that [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10730.640000000001s)]
*  sounds today. And so it's basically a national talent search for basically IQ. Its goal is to [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10735.04s)]
*  identify basically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country, by the way, completely regardless of [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10742.32s)]
*  other characteristics. So there's no race, gender, any other aspect to it. It's just going for straight [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10748.560000000001s)]
*  intelligence. It uses the first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory SAT that you take, [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10752.4s)]
*  and then the SAT. So it uses those scores that that is the scoring. It's a straight PSAT scoring [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10758.96s)]
*  system. So they use the SAT as a proxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10764.8s)]
*  identify they all they it's like they get down to like 1% of the population of the kids, 18 year [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10772.8s)]
*  olds any given year who score highest on the PSAT. And then they get down to further qualified down [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10777.52s)]
*  to the 0.5% that also replicate on the SAT. And then it's like the scholarship amount is like [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10781.84s)]
*  $2,500. Right. So it's like, there's a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today, but it's [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10787.44s)]
*  a national system being run literally to find the best and the brightest. How many of our great and [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10792.48s)]
*  powerful universities use this as a scouting system? Like our universities all have sports [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10797.36s)]
*  teams. They all have national scouting, full-time scouts who go out and they go to every high school [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10802.32s)]
*  and they try to find all the great basketball players and bring them into the NCAA into all [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10807.92s)]
*  these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities use the national [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10811.84s)]
*  merit system to go do a talent search for the smartest kids and just bring them in? [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10816.16s)]
*  Let me guess very few. Zero. As you say it, that's brilliant. There should be that same level of [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10821.04s)]
*  scouting for talent internally. Go get the smartest ones. Give you one more kicker on this topic. If [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10828.16s)]
*  I haven't beaten it to death, the SAT has changed. So the SAT used to be a highly accurate proxy for [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10834.08s)]
*  IQ. That caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like the whole idea of IQ. And so the SAT [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10841.52s)]
*  has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the college board that runs it. And it has been [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10849.36s)]
*  essentially like everything else, it's been dumbed down. And so in two ways, number one, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10854.24s)]
*  it's been dumbed down where an 800 from 40 years ago does not mean what an 800 means today. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10860.72s)]
*  And 40 years ago, it was almost impossible to get an 800. Today, there's so many 800s that you could [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10866.16s)]
*  stock the entire Ivy League with 800s. And so it's been deliberately dumbed down. And then two is, [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10872.64s)]
*  they have tried to pull out a lot of what's called the G loading. And so they've tried to [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10879.439999999999s)]
*  detach it from being an IQ proxy because IQ is such an inflammatory concept. And the consequence [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10882.88s)]
*  of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've made it more coachable. So the SAT 40 years ago, [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10887.84s)]
*  coaching didn't really work. And more recently, it has really started to work. And one of the [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10894.4s)]
*  things you see is the Asian spike. You see this giant leap upward in Asian performance over the [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10897.52s)]
*  last decade. And I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is because it's more coachable [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10901.76s)]
*  now and the Asians do the most coaching. So there's a bunch of issues with this. And so the [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10905.44s)]
*  coaching thing is really difficult because the coaching thing is a subsidy then to the kids [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10911.12s)]
*  whose parents can afford coaching. And I don't know about you, but where I grew up, there was [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10915.04s)]
*  no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there. I didn't even know what the SAT was until the day [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10918.720000000001s)]
*  I took it, much less that there was coaching, much less that it could work. So much less we could afford [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10923.36s)]
*  it. So number one, there's issues there. But the other issue there is think about what's happened [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10927.36s)]
*  by the dumbing down. 800 no longer captures all the smart. 800 is too crude of a test. It's like [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10931.36s)]
*  the AI benchmarking problem. It's the same problem they have in AI benchmarking right now. 800 is too [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10938.400000000001s)]
*  low of a threshold. There are too many kids scoring 800 because what you want is you want whatever, [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10943.2s)]
*  if it's going to be 100,000 kids, I don't know what it is, it's going to be 50,000 kids a year [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10949.52s)]
*  scoring 800. You also then want kids to be able to score 900 and 1,000 and 1,100 and 1,200. And you [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10952.560000000001s)]
*  want to ultimately get to, you'd like to identify, ultimately identify the top 100 kids and make sure [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10957.44s)]
*  that you get them in MIT. And the resolution of the test has been reduced so that it actually is [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10962.400000000001s)]
*  not useful for doing that. And again, I would say this is like part of the generalized corruption [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10967.6s)]
*  that's taken place throughout this entire system where we have been heading in the reverse direction [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10972.24s)]
*  from wanting to actually go get the best and brightest and actually put them in the places [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10976.48s)]
*  where they should be. And then just the final comment would be the great thing about standardized [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10980.24s)]
*  testing and the national merit system is it's like I said, it's completely race blind, it's [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10984.0s)]
*  gender blind, it's blind on every other characteristic, it's only done on test scores. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10987.44s)]
*  And you can make an argument about whether that's good or bad, but it is for sure, [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10991.92s)]
*  it's the closest thing that we had to get to merit. It was the thing that they did when they [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10997.039999999999s)]
*  thought they needed merit to win the Cold War. And of course, we could choose to do that anytime [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11001.36s)]
*  we want. And I just say, I find it incredibly striking and an enormous moral indictment of [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11005.36s)]
*  the current system that there are no universities that do this today. So back to the immigration [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11010.640000000001s)]
*  thing just real quick, it's like, okay, we aren't even trying to go get the smart kids out of the [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11014.640000000001s)]
*  center and south. And even if they think that they can get into these places, they get turned down. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11017.92s)]
*  And the same thing for the smart Asians and the same thing for the smart Jews and the same thing [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11022.16s)]
*  for the smart black people. And it's just like, I don't know how that's moral. I don't get it at [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11025.04s)]
*  all. As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and ACT many times and I've always gotten perfect [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11032.960000000001s)]
*  on math 800. And I'm not special. It doesn't identify genius. I think you want to search for [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11040.480000000001s)]
*  genius and you want to create measures that find genius of all different kinds, speaking of diversity. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11052.16s)]
*  And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and over, defend immigrants, yes, [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11060.16s)]
*  but say we should hire more and more native born. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11068.8s)]
*  Adam Foss Well, you asked me in the beginning, [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11072.16s)]
*  like what's the most optimistic forecast, right? That we could have the most optimistic [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11073.52s)]
*  forecast would be my God, what if we did both? [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11077.44s)]
*  Riegel So that's the reasonable, [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11079.12s)]
*  the rational, the smart thing to say here. In fact, we don't have to have a war. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11085.36s)]
*  Adam Foss Well, it would defuse the entire issue. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11089.76s)]
*  Riegel Yeah. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11092.16s)]
*  Adam Foss If everybody in the center in the south of the country and every Jewish family, [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11092.640000000001s)]
*  Asian family, black family knew they were getting a fair shake, it would defuse the issue. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11095.36s)]
*  Like how about defusing the issue? Like what a crazy radical. Sorry, [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11100.24s)]
*  I don't mean to really get out of my skis here, but. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11103.44s)]
*  Riegel I think your profile on X States, it's time to build. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11105.12s)]
*  It feels like 2025 is a good year to build. So I wanted to ask your advice and maybe [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11110.560000000001s)]
*  for advice for anybody who's trying to build, who's trying to build something useful in the world, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11122.320000000002s)]
*  maybe launch a startup or maybe just launch apps, services, whatever, ship software products. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11127.84s)]
*  So maybe by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping? [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11137.44s)]
*  Adam Foss So I mean, a big part of the answer, I think, [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11143.28s)]
*  is we're in the middle of a legit revolution. And I know you've been talking about this on your show, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11145.52s)]
*  but like AI coding, I mean, this is the biggest earthquake to hit software in certainly my life, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11149.36s)]
*  maybe since the investment software. And I'm sure we're involved in various of these companies, [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11155.919999999998s)]
*  but these tools from a variety of companies are absolutely revolutionary. And they're getting [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11160.32s)]
*  better at leaps and bounds right every day. And you know all this, but like the thing with coding, [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11168.32s)]
*  like there's like open questions of whether AI can get better at like, I don't know, [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11173.039999999999s)]
*  understanding philosophy or whatever, creative writing or whatever, but like for sure we can [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11176.32s)]
*  make it much better at coding, right? Because you can validate the results of coding. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11180.24s)]
*  And so there's all these methods of synthetic data and self-training and reinforcement learning [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11184.72s)]
*  that for sure you can do with coding. And so everybody I know who works in the field says AI [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11188.72s)]
*  coding is going to get to be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And you can, I mean, [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11193.36s)]
*  anybody wants to see this, just go on YouTube and look at AI coding demos, little kids making [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11198.32s)]
*  apps in 10 minutes working with an AI coding system. And so I think it's the golden age. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11202.24s)]
*  I mean, I think this is an area where it's clear that the golden age, the tool set is extraordinary [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11206.0s)]
*  you know, in a day as a coder for sure in a day, you can retrain yourself. You know, [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11210.0s)]
*  start using these things, get a huge boost in productivity as a non-coder. You can learn much [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11214.720000000001s)]
*  more quickly than you could before. That's actually a tricky one in terms of learning [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11218.24s)]
*  as a non-coder to build stuff. It's still, I feel like you still need to learn how to code. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11222.800000000001s)]
*  It becomes a superpower. It helps you be much more productive. Like you could legitimately be a [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11227.84s)]
*  one person company and get quite far. I agree with that up to a point. So the, [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11233.84s)]
*  I think for sure for quite a long time, the people who are good at coding are going to be the best at [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11243.12s)]
*  actually having AI's code things. Because they're going to understand what, I mean, very basic, [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11246.72s)]
*  they're going to understand what's happening, right? And they're going to be able to evaluate [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11250.4s)]
*  the work and they're going to be able to, you know, literally like manage AI's better. Like even if [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11253.44s)]
*  they're not literally handwriting the code, they're just going to have a much better sense of what's [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11257.36s)]
*  going on. So I definitely think like a hundred percent, my nine-year-old is like doing all kinds [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11259.92s)]
*  of coding classes and he'll keep doing that for certainly through 18. We'll see after that. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11263.52s)]
*  And so for sure that's the case. But look, having said that, one of the things you can do with an AI [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11269.44s)]
*  is say, teach me how to code, right? And so, and you know, there's a whole bunch of, you know, [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11274.24s)]
*  I'll name names, you know, Khan Academy, like there's a whole bunch of work that they're doing [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11282.32s)]
*  at Khan Academy for free. And then, you know, we have this company, Replet, which is originally [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11285.28s)]
*  specifically built for kids for coding that has AI built in. That's just absolutely extraordinary [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11289.76s)]
*  now. And then, you know, there's a variety of other systems like this. And yeah, I mean, [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11294.320000000002s)]
*  the AI is going to be able to teach you to code. AI, by the way, is, as you know, spectacularly [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11300.320000000002s)]
*  good at explaining code, right? And so, you know, the tools have these features now where you can [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11304.24s)]
*  talk to the code base. And so you can like literally like ask the code base questions about itself. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11310.400000000001s)]
*  And you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and paste code into [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11315.6s)]
*  a chat GPT and just ask it to explain it, what's going on, rewrite it, improve it, [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11318.640000000001s)]
*  make recommendations. And so there's, yeah, there's dozens of ways to do this. By the way, [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11322.480000000001s)]
*  you can also, I mean, even more broadly than code, like, you know, okay, you want to make a video [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11326.960000000001s)]
*  game. Okay, now you can do AI, art generation, sound generation, dialogue generation, voice [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11330.480000000001s)]
*  generation, right? And so all of a sudden, like you don't need designers, you know, you don't need, [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11335.76s)]
*  you know, voice actors, you know, so yeah, so there's just like unlimited and then, you know, [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11340.0s)]
*  a big, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's, it's interfacing [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11345.44s)]
*  into other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments or something [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11348.72s)]
*  like that. And, you know, AI is fantastic at writing glue code. So, you know, really, [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11352.56s)]
*  really good at making sure that you can plug everything together, really good at helping you [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11357.76s)]
*  figure out how to deploy, you know, it'll even write a business plan for you. So it's just this, [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11361.04s)]
*  it's like everything happening with AI right now. It's just, it's like this latent superpower. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11367.6s)]
*  And there's this incredible spectrum of people who have really figured out massive performance [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11370.640000000001s)]
*  increases, productivity increases with it already. There's other people who aren't even aware it's [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11374.960000000001s)]
*  happening and there's some gearing to whether you're a coder or not, but I think there are [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11378.32s)]
*  lots of non coders that are off the races. And I think there are lots of professional coders who [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11384.32s)]
*  are still like, you know, the blacks myths were not necessarily in favor of, you know, [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11387.84s)]
*  the car business. So, yeah, there's the old William Gibson quote, the future is here. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11393.359999999999s)]
*  It's just not evenly distributed yet. And this is maybe the most potent version of that that I've [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11398.48s)]
*  ever seen. Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme with the, with the bell curve, the people on both [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11402.96s)]
*  extremes say AI coding is the future. It's very common to programmers to say, you know, if you're [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11411.44s)]
*  any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it. That's just not true. I consider myself [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11417.76s)]
*  reasonably good programmer and I, my productivity has been just skyrocketed and the joy of programming [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11423.52s)]
*  skyrocketed. Every aspect of programming is more efficient, more productive, more fun, [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11428.960000000001s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. I would also say code is, you know, code has code has of anything in like [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11436.800000000001s)]
*  industrial society code as it has the highest elasticity, which is to say the easier it is to [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11441.52s)]
*  make it the more, the more of it gets made. Like I think effectively there's unlimited demand for [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11446.16s)]
*  code. Like in other words, like there's always some other idea for a thing that you can do, [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11450.48s)]
*  a feature that you can add or a thing that you can optimize. And so, and so like overwhelmingly, [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11455.44s)]
*  you know, the amount of code that exists in the world is a fraction of even the ideas we have [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11461.6s)]
*  today. And then we come up with new ideas all the time. And so I think that like, [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11464.72s)]
*  you know, I was, I was late eighties, early nineties when sort of automated coding system [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11470.4s)]
*  started to come out, expert systems, big deal in those days. And there were all these, there was a [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11473.68s)]
*  famous book called the decline and fall of the American programmer, you know, that predicted [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11477.44s)]
*  that these new coding systems were going to mean we wouldn't have programmers in the future. And [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11480.880000000001s)]
*  of course the number of programming jobs exploded by like a factor of a hundred. Like my guess will [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11483.6s)]
*  be, we'll have more, my guess is we'll have more coding jobs probably by like an order of magnitude [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11487.68s)]
*  10 years from now. That will be different. There'll be different jobs. They'll involve [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11491.76s)]
*  orchestrating AI. But there will be, we will be creating so much more software that the whole [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11496.08s)]
*  industry will just explode in size. Are you seeing the size of companies decrease in terms [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11502.16s)]
*  of startups? What's the landscapes of little tech? All we're seeing right now is the AI hiring boom [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11507.68s)]
*  of all time. Oh, for the big tech people and little tech, everybody's trying to hire as many [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11513.44s)]
*  engineers as they can to build AI systems. It's just, it's a hundred percent. I mean, [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11519.52s)]
*  there's a handful of company, you know, there's a little bit, there's, there's customer service, [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11523.92s)]
*  you know, there we have some companies and others. I think it's clarinet that's publicizing a lot of [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11528.16s)]
*  this in Europe where, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized and jobs that can be automated. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11531.52s)]
*  But like for engineering jobs, like it's just an explosion of hiring. At least so far, there's no [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11539.36s)]
*  trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Now, having said that, I am looking forward to the day. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11546.0s)]
*  I am waiting for the first company to walk in saying, yes, like the more radical form of it. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11550.640000000001s)]
*  But so basically the companies that we see are basically one of two kinds. We see the companies [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11556.0s)]
*  that are basically sometimes use weak form, strong form. So the weak form companies, [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11559.68s)]
*  sometimes use the term, it's the called the sixth bullet point. AI is the sixth bullet point on [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11565.52s)]
*  whatever they're doing. Sure. Right. And it's on the slide, right? So they've got the, you know, [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11570.16s)]
*  whatever, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And then AI is the sixth thing. And the reason AI is the sixth [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11574.16s)]
*  thing is because they had already previously written the slide before the AI revolution started. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11577.12s)]
*  And so they just added the sixth bullet point on the slide, which is how you're getting all [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11580.24s)]
*  these products that have like the AI button up in the corner, right? The little sparkly button, [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11583.6s)]
*  right? And all of a sudden Gmail is offering to summarize your email, which I'm like, I don't need [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11587.76s)]
*  that. Like I need you to answer my email, not summarize it. Like what the hell. Okay. So we [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11591.68s)]
*  see those and that's fine. That's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11597.04s)]
*  But then we see the strong form, which is the companies that are building from scratch for AI, [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11601.92s)]
*  right? And they're building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally an AI [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11606.400000000001s)]
*  email system as an example. So just- Oh, nice. I can't wait. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11610.08s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to completely, right. So the very obvious idea, very smart team, [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11614.4s)]
*  it's going to be great. And then, you know, notion just, you know, another, not one of our [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11618.24s)]
*  companies, but just came out with a product. So now companies are going to basically come through, [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11622.64s)]
*  sweep through, and they're going to do basically AI first versions of basically everything. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11626.24s)]
*  And those are like companies built, you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11630.4s)]
*  of the argument. Yeah. Cursor is an example that they basically said, okay, we're going to [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11634.4s)]
*  rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen. What if we knew from scratch that we could build [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11638.8s)]
*  on this? And again, this is like, this is part of the full employment act for startups and VCs is [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11642.96s)]
*  just like, if a technology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11648.24s)]
*  to start the product development process over from scratch because you need to reconceptualize the [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11653.519999999999s)]
*  product. And then usually what that means is you need a new company because most incumbents just [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11657.119999999999s)]
*  won't do that. And so, yeah, so that's underway across many categories. What I'm waiting for [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11661.599999999999s)]
*  is the company where it's like, no, our org chart is redesigned as a result of AI, right? And so I'm [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11666.88s)]
*  waiting for the company where it's like, no, we're going to have like, you know, and the cliche, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11672.4s)]
*  here's a thought experiment, right? The cliche would be we're going to have like the human [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11677.2s)]
*  executive team, and then we're going to have the AIs be the workers, right? So we'll have a VP of [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11680.48s)]
*  engineering supervising a hundred instances of coding agents, right? Okay, maybe, right? By the [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11683.52s)]
*  way, or maybe, maybe the VP of engineering should be the AI, maybe supervising human coders who are [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11689.84s)]
*  supervising AIs, right? Because one of the things that AI should be pretty good at is managing [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11696.16s)]
*  because it's like not, you know, it's like a process driven. It's the kind of thing that AI [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11701.359999999999s)]
*  is actually pretty good at, right? Performance evaluation coaching. And so should it be an AI [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11705.119999999999s)]
*  executive team? And then, you know, and then of course, the ultimate question, which is AI CEO, [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11710.16s)]
*  right? And then, you know, and then there's, and then maybe the most futuristic version of it would [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11716.24s)]
*  be an actual AI agent that actually goes fully autonomous. Yeah, what if you really set one of [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11720.32s)]
*  these things loose and let it, let it basically build itself a business? And so I will say like, [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11724.8s)]
*  we're not yet seeing those. And I think there's a little bit of the systems aren't quite ready [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11729.76s)]
*  for that yet. And then I think it's a little bit of you really do need at that point, like a founder [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11734.56s)]
*  who's really willing to break all the rules and really willing to take the swing. And I'm, and [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11739.68s)]
*  those people exist. And so I'm sure we'll see that. And some of it is, as you know, with all the [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11744.56s)]
*  startups, this is the execution, the idea that you have a AI first email client, this seems like an [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11748.960000000001s)]
*  obvious idea, but actually creating one, executing and then taking on Gmail is really, [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11755.2s)]
*  it's really difficult. I mean, Gmail, it's fascinating to see Google can't do it. Because, [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11760.720000000001s)]
*  because why? Because of momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer the entirety of the system. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11767.52s)]
*  Feels like Google is perfectly positioned to, to do it. Same with like your perplexity, [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11772.08s)]
*  which I love, like Google could technically take on perplexity and do it much better, [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11778.320000000002s)]
*  but they haven't not yet. So it's fascinating why that is for large companies. I mean, that, [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11782.88s)]
*  that is an advantage for a little tech. They can be agile. Yeah, that's right. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11789.599999999999s)]
*  They can move fast. Yeah. Little companies can break glass in a way, big companies can't. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11793.839999999998s)]
*  Right. This is sort of the big breakthrough that Clay Christensen had in the innovators dilemma, [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11797.199999999999s)]
*  which is sometimes when big companies don't do things, it's because they're screwing up. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11801.199999999999s)]
*  And that certainly happens. But a lot of times they don't do things because it would break too [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11804.64s)]
*  much glass. Specifically, it would interfere with their existing customers and their existing [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11808.4s)]
*  businesses. And they just simply won't do that. And by the way, responsibly, they shouldn't do that. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11813.76s)]
*  Right. And so they just get, Clay Christensen's big thing is they often don't adapt because they [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11818.88s)]
*  are well-run, not because they're poorly run, but they're optimizing machines. They're optimizing [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11825.119999999999s)]
*  against the existing business. And as you kind of just said, this is like a permanent state of [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11830.0s)]
*  affairs for large organizations. Every once in a while, one breaks the pattern and actually does [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11834.8s)]
*  it. But for the most part, this is a very predictable form of human behavior. And this [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11839.279999999999s)]
*  fundamentally is why startups exist. It feels like 2025 is when the race for [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11842.64s)]
*  dominance in AI will see some winners. It's a big year. So who do you think wins the race? Open AI, [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11848.16s)]
*  Meta, Google, XAI, who do you think wins the AI race? I would say, I'm not going to predict. I'm [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11855.359999999999s)]
*  going to say there's questions all over the place. And we have this category question we call [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11860.48s)]
*  the trillion dollar question, which is like literally depending on how it's answered, [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11864.64s)]
*  people make or lose a trillion dollars. And I think there's like, I don't know, five or six [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11868.0s)]
*  trillion dollar questions right now that are hanging out there, which is an unusually large [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11871.68s)]
*  number. And I just hit a few of them and we can talk about them. So one is big models versus small [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11875.279999999999s)]
*  models. Another is open models versus closed models. Another is whether you can use synthetic [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11880.08s)]
*  data or not. Another is chain of thought. How far can you push that? And reinforcement learning. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11885.599999999999s)]
*  And then another one is political trillion dollar questions, policy questions, which the US and the [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11891.039999999999s)]
*  EU have both been flunking dramatically and the US hopefully is about to really succeed at. Yeah. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11896.88s)]
*  Then there's probably another half dozen big important questions after that. And so these are [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11903.599999999999s)]
*  all just like, say this is an industry that's in flux in a way that I, even more dramatic, [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11907.279999999999s)]
*  I think than the ones I've seen before. And look, the most obvious example of the flux is sitting [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11913.039999999999s)]
*  here in the summer, sitting here less than three years ago, sitting here in December of 22, we [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11918.48s)]
*  would have said that OpenAI is just running away with everything. And sitting here today, it's like, [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11923.04s)]
*  there's at least six world-class god model companies and teams that are, by the way, [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11928.08s)]
*  generating remarkably similar results. That's actually been one of the most shocking things [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11933.84s)]
*  to me is like, it turns out that once you know that it's possible to build one incredibly smart [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11937.44s)]
*  Turing test passing large language model, which was a complete shock and surprise to the world, [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11941.6s)]
*  it turns out within a year, you can have five more. There's also a money component thing to it, [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11947.2s)]
*  which is to get the money to scale one of these things into the billions of dollars. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11952.320000000002s)]
*  There's basically right now only two sources of money that will do that for you. One is the [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11956.240000000002s)]
*  hyperscalers giving you the money, which you turn around and round trip back to them, or foreign [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11960.400000000001s)]
*  sovereigns, other countries sovereign wealth funds, which can be difficult in some cases for [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11965.2s)]
*  companies to access. So there's maybe another trillion dollar question is the financing question. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11970.960000000001s)]
*  Here's one. So Sam Altman has been public about the fact that he wants to transition OpenAI from [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11977.84s)]
*  being a nonprofit to being a for-profit. The way that that is legally done is that, [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11981.76s)]
*  and there is a way to do it. There is a way in US law to do it. The IRS and other legal entities, [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11987.76s)]
*  government entities, scrutinizes very carefully because the US takes foundation [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11992.480000000001s)]
*  nonprofit law very seriously because of the tax exemption. And so historically, the way that you [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11996.16s)]
*  do it is you start a for-profit and then you raise money with the for-profit to buy the assets of the [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12001.52s)]
*  nonprofit at fair market value. And the last financing round at OpenAI was 150 some billion [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12006.4s)]
*  dollars. And so logically, if the flip is going to happen, the for-profit has to go raise $150 [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12013.84s)]
*  billion out of the chute to buy the assets. Raising 150 billion is a challenge. So is that [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12020.16s)]
*  even possible? If that is possible, then OpenAI maybe is off to the races as a for-profit company. [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12028.24s)]
*  If not, I don't know. And then obviously the Elon lawsuit. So just because they're the market [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12032.48s)]
*  leader today, there's big important questions there. Microsoft has this kind of love-hate [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12038.0s)]
*  relationship with them. Where does that go? Apple's lagging badly behind, but they're very good at [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12042.48s)]
*  catching up. Amazon is primarily hyperscaler, but they now have their own models. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12047.6s)]
*  RG And then there's the other questions like you laid out brilliantly, briefly and brilliantly, [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12051.76s)]
*  open versus closed, big versus little models, synthetic data. That's a huge, huge question. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12056.32s)]
*  And then test on compute with a chain of thought, the role of that. And these are, [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12062.16s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, trillion dollar questions. [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12069.28s)]
*  JS Yeah, these are big. Here's a trillion dollar question, which is kind of embedded in that, [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12071.12s)]
*  which is just hallucinations. So if you are trying to use these tools creatively, you're thrilled [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12075.12s)]
*  because they can draw new images and they can make new music and they can do all this incredible [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12080.800000000001s)]
*  stuff. They're creative. The flip side of that is if you need them to be correct, they can't be [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12084.880000000001s)]
*  creative. That's the term hallucination. And these things do hallucinate. And there have been court [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12089.68s)]
*  cases already where lawyers have submitted legal briefs that contain made up court citations, [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12097.36s)]
*  case citations. The judge is like, wait a minute, this doesn't exist. And the very next question is, [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12101.6s)]
*  did you write this yourself? And the lawyer goes, uh... [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12105.28s)]
*  RG I mean, that's why you along with Grok looking for truth. I mean, that's an open technical [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12108.24s)]
*  question. How close can you get to truth with LLMs? JS Yeah, that's right. And [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12115.84s)]
*  my sense is this very contentious topic at the industry. My sense is if to the extent that there [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12120.32s)]
*  is a domain in which there is a definitive and checkable and provable answer, and you might say [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12126.640000000001s)]
*  math satisfies that coding satisfies that, and maybe some other fields, then you should be able [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12130.720000000001s)]
*  to generate synthetic data. You should be able to do a chain of thought reasoning. You should be able [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12135.12s)]
*  to do reinforcement learning and you should be able to ultimately eliminate hallucinations. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12138.720000000001s)]
*  For by the way, that's a trillion dollar question right there as to whether that's true. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12144.24s)]
*  But then there's questions like, okay, is that going to work in the more general domain? [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12148.08s)]
*  So for example, one possibility is these things are going to get truly superhuman at math and [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12152.08s)]
*  coding, but at like discussing philosophy, they're basically as smart as they're ever going to be. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12156.0s)]
*  And they're going to be kind of, say mid-wit grad student level. And the theory there would just [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12162.480000000001s)]
*  be they're already out of training data. You talk to these people, literally the big models [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12167.52s)]
*  are like within a factor of two acts of consuming all the human generated training data to the point [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12173.68s)]
*  that some of these big companies are literally hiring people like doctors and lawyers to sit [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12177.28s)]
*  and write your training data by hand. And so does this mean that like you have to, [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12180.48s)]
*  if you want your model to get better at philosophy, you have to go hire like a thousand philosophers [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12184.16s)]
*  and have them write new content? And is anybody going to do that? And so maybe these things are [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12187.28s)]
*  topping out in certain ways and they're going to leap way ahead in other ways. And so anyway, [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12192.32s)]
*  so we just don't, I guess this is maybe my main conclusion is I don't, anybody telling you these [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12196.32s)]
*  big sweeping conclusions, this whole super, all of these abstract generalized super intelligence [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12203.52s)]
*  AGI stuff, like it, maybe it's the engineer in me, but like, no, like that's not the, that's not the [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12208.640000000001s)]
*  that's too abstract. Like it's got to actually work. And then by the way, it has to actually [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12214.16s)]
*  have to be able to pay for it. I mean, this is a problem right now with the big models, [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12219.92s)]
*  the big models that are like really good at coding and math, they're like actually very expensive to [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12224.640000000001s)]
*  run. You know, they're quite slow. Another trillion dollar question, future chips, [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12227.76s)]
*  which I know you've talked a lot about. Another trillion dollar question. Yeah. I mean, [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12233.44s)]
*  all the global issues. Oh, another trillion dollar question, censorship, [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12238.880000000001s)]
*  right? Like, and all the, as they say, all the human feedback training process, [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12243.12s)]
*  exactly what are you training these things to do? What are they allowed to talk about? [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12250.56s)]
*  But how long do they give you these? How often do they give these incredibly [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12253.28s)]
*  preaching moral lectures? Here's a good, here's a trillion dollar question. How many other countries [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12257.84s)]
*  want their country to run its education system, healthcare system, new system, [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12263.76s)]
*  political system on the basis of an AI that's been trained according to the most extreme left-wing [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12268.400000000001s)]
*  California politics? Right. Cause that's kind of what they have on offer right now. And I think [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12272.16s)]
*  the answer to that is not very many. So there's like massive open questions there about like what, [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12278.16s)]
*  you know, and by the way, like what morality of these things can it get trained on as a. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12284.64s)]
*  And now Owen, we're cracking wide open with what's been happening over the past few months, [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12288.64s)]
*  censorship on every level of these companies and just the very idea, what truth means and what it [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12295.119999999999s)]
*  means to expand the Overton window of LLMs or the Overton window of human discourse. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12301.68s)]
*  So what I experienced, you know, going back to how we started, what I experienced was, all right, [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12307.84s)]
*  social media censorship regime from hell, debanking, right? At like a large scale. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12311.12s)]
*  And then the war on the crypto industry, trying to kill it. And then basically declared intent to do [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12317.28s)]
*  the same thing to AI and to put AI under the same kind of censorship and control regime as social [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12322.400000000001s)]
*  media in the banks. And I think this election tipped in America, I think this election tipped [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12328.0s)]
*  us from a timeline in which things were going to get really bad on that front to a timeline in [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12333.44s)]
*  which I think things are going to be quite good. But look, those same questions also apply outside [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12337.76s)]
*  the U S and you know, the EU is doing their thing. They're being extremely draconian and they're [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12341.68s)]
*  trying to lock in a political censorship regime on AI right now. That's so harsh that even American [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12347.04s)]
*  AI companies are not even willing to launch new products in the EU right now. Like that's not [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12351.04s)]
*  going to last, but like what happens there, right? And what, what are the trade-offs, you know, [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12355.52s)]
*  what levels of censorship are American companies going to have to sign up for if they want to [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12359.76s)]
*  operate in the EU or is the EU still capable of generating its own AI companies or have we [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12363.28s)]
*  brain drain them so that they can't? So big questions. Quick questions. So you're very [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12368.4s)]
*  active on X, a very unique character. Flamboyant, exciting, bold. You post a lot. I think there's a [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12377.2s)]
*  meme. I don't remember it exactly, but the Elon posted something like a inside Elon. There are [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12388.72s)]
*  two wolves. One is please be kind or more positive. And the other one is I think, you know, doing the, [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12394.56s)]
*  uh, I take a big step back and fuck yourself in the face guy. How many wolves are inside [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12402.56s)]
*  your mind when you're tweeting to be clear a reference from the comedy classic, [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12409.279999999999s)]
*  Tropic Thunder. Yeah. Legendary movie. Yes. Um, any zoomers listening to this who haven't seen that [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12413.92s)]
*  movie, go watch it immediately. Yeah. There's nothing offensive about it at all. Um, Tom Cruise's [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12421.28s)]
*  greatest performance. Um, so, um, yeah, no, look, I should start by saying like, I'm not supposed to [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12429.52s)]
*  be tweeting at all. So, uh, yeah, yes, yes, yes. And so, but you know, [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12437.28s)]
*  so how do you approach that? Like, how do you approach what to tweet? I mean, I don't look, [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12442.400000000001s)]
*  so it's, it's a, it's a, um, it, it, I don't, I don't well enough. Um, it's mostly an exercise [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12446.880000000001s)]
*  and frustration. Um, look, there's a glory to it and there's, there's, there's an issue with it. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12452.16s)]
*  And the glory of it is like, you know, instantaneous global communication, you know, in X in particular [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12456.0s)]
*  is like the, you know, the town square on all these, you know, social issues, political issues, [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12461.36s)]
*  everything else, current events. Um, but I mean, look, there's no question the format, the format [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12464.48s)]
*  of at least the original tweet is, you know, prone to be inflammatory. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12468.8s)]
*  the guy who at one point the entire nation of India hated me. Um, cause I once tweeted something, [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12473.52s)]
*  it turned out that is still politically sensitive. Um, and the entire continent, um, I stayed up all [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12477.92s)]
*  night that night as, as I became front page headline and leading television news in each [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12482.4s)]
*  time zone in India for a single tweet. So like the single tweet out of context is a very dangerous [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12486.72s)]
*  thing. Um, obviously X now has the middle ground where they, you know, they, they now have the [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12492.0s)]
*  longer form essays. Um, and so, um, you know, probably the most productive thing I can do is, [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12498.4s)]
*  is longer form, um, is longer form things. Um, you're not going to do it though. I do, [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12502.4s)]
*  I do from time to time. I should, I should do more of them. And then, yeah, I mean, look, but, [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12507.92s)]
*  and yeah, obviously access X is doing great. And then, uh, like I said, like stuff stack, [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12511.76s)]
*  you know, has become the center for a lot, you know, a lot of them, I think the best kind of, [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12515.6s)]
*  you know, deeply thought through, you know, certainly intellectual content, um, you know, [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12519.039999999999s)]
*  tons of current events, uh, stuff there as well. Um, and then, um, yeah. So, and then there's a [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12523.839999999998s)]
*  bunch of other, you know, a bunch of new systems that are very exciting. So I think one of the [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12528.16s)]
*  things we can look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12531.119999999999s)]
*  reinvigoration of social media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now. [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12534.0s)]
*  Um, I'm very excited to see the con to see what's going to happen with that. And then, um, [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12538.16s)]
*  that means it's happened on X, but it's now going to happen on other platforms. [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12541.679999999998s)]
*  Um, and then, um, the other is, um, crypto is going to come, you know, crypto is going to come [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12544.4s)]
*  right back to life. Um, and actually that's very exciting. Actually, that's worth noting is that's [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12549.76s)]
*  another trillion dollar question on AI, which is, um, in a world of pervasive AI, and especially in [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12553.84s)]
*  a world of AI agents and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12559.2s)]
*  they need an economy. Um, and in crypto, in our view happens to be the ideal economic system [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12563.52s)]
*  for that, right? Cause it's a very programmable money. It's a very easy way to plug in and do that. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12569.44s)]
*  And there's this transaction processing system that can, that can do that. And so I think the [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12573.2s)]
*  crypto AI intersection, you know, it's potentially very, a very, very big deal. Um, and so that was, [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12576.880000000001s)]
*  that was going to be impossible under the prior regime. And I think under the new regime, [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12582.800000000001s)]
*  hopefully it'll be something we can do. Uh, almost for fun, let me ask, uh, a friend of yours, [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12586.0s)]
*  Jan Lekoon, what are your top 10 favorite things about Jan Lekoon? He's, uh, I think he's a, [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12591.2s)]
*  he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree on [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12599.28s)]
*  a lot of things. Um, but I personally like vigorous disagreement. I, as a person in the stands, [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12603.04s)]
*  like to watch the gladiators go at it. And no, he's a super genius. I mean, look, [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12608.960000000001s)]
*  I haven't said we're super close, but you know, casual, casual friends, I worked with him at Metta, [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12614.0s)]
*  you know, he's the chief scientist at Metta for a long time and it's still, you know, works with us. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12617.52s)]
*  And, um, you know, and it's obviously, he's a legendary figure in the field and one of the main [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12621.92s)]
*  people responsible for what's happening. Um, I, it's my serious observation would be that it's, it's, [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12626.240000000002s)]
*  the thing I keep, I've talked to him about for a long time and I keep trying to read and follow [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12631.599999999999s)]
*  everything he does is he's probably, he is the, I think, see if you agree with this, he is the [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12635.119999999999s)]
*  smartest and most credible critic of LLMs is the path for AI. Um, and, um, he's not, you know, [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12641.519999999999s)]
*  there's certain, I would say troll like characters who are just like crap and everything, but like, [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12647.84s)]
*  Jan has like very deeply thought through basically, um, theories as to why LLMs are an evolutionary [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12651.199999999999s)]
*  dead end. Um, and, um, and I actually like, um, I, I try to do this thing where I try to model, [[03:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12656.64s)]
*  you know, I try to have a mental model of like the two different sides of a serious argument. [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12663.119999999999s)]
*  So I've tried to like internalize that argument as much as I can, which is difficult because like, [[03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12665.84s)]
*  we're investing it behind LLMs as aggressively as we can. And so if he's right, like that could be a [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12669.76s)]
*  big problem, but like we should also know that. Um, and then I sort of use his ideas to challenge [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12674.48s)]
*  all the bullish people, you know, to really kind of test their level of knowledge. So I like to [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12680.16s)]
*  kind of grill people. Like I'm not like, I'm not, you know, I'm, I was not, you know, I was got my [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12685.04s)]
*  CS degree 35 years ago, so I'm not like deep in the technology, but like, if, if to the extent I [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12690.240000000002s)]
*  can understand Jan's points, I can use them to, um, you know, to really surface a lot of the questions [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12694.720000000001s)]
*  for the people who are more bullish. Um, and that's been, I think very productive. Um, yeah. So, [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12699.6s)]
*  yeah, it's just, it's very striking that you have somebody who is like that central in the space, [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12704.400000000001s)]
*  who is actually like a full on, a full on skeptic. And, you know, and again, ask, you could, this [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12708.320000000002s)]
*  could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He can end up being totally right, [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12713.44s)]
*  or it could be that he will provoke the evolution of these systems to be much better than they [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12717.52s)]
*  would have been. Yeah. He could be both right and wrong. I, first of all, I do, I do agree with that. [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12722.08s)]
*  He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the LLM path to AGI. [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12726.800000000001s)]
*  You know, his basic notion is that there needs, AI needs to have some physical [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12733.52s)]
*  understanding of the physical world. And that's very difficult to achieve with LLMs. [[03:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12739.04s)]
*  And that, that is a really good way to challenge the limitations of LLMs and so on. He's also been a [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12743.759999999998s)]
*  vocal and a huge proponent of open source, which is a whole nother, which you have been as well. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12750.0s)]
*  Which is very useful. Yeah. And that's been just fascinating to watch. And anti-doomer. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12755.599999999999s)]
*  Anti-doomer. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's very, he embodies, he also has many wolves. [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12759.84s)]
*  So it's been really, really fun to watch. The other two. Okay. Here's my other wolf coming out. [[03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12768.24s)]
*  The other two of the three godfathers of AI are like radicals, like, like full on left, you know, [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12772.72s)]
*  far left, you know, like they, I would say like either Marxists or borderline Marxists. And they're [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12779.199999999999s)]
*  like, I think quite extreme in their social and political views. And I think that feeds into their [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12784.56s)]
*  doomerism. And I think, you know, they, they, they are lobbying for like draconian government. I think [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12788.48s)]
*  what would be ruinously destructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's, it's [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12793.68s)]
*  actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have Jan as a counterpoint to those two. [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12797.76s)]
*  Another fun question. Our mutual friend, Andrew Huberman first, maybe what do you love most about [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12802.56s)]
*  Andrew? And second, what score on a scale of one to 10, do you think he would give you on your [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12808.0s)]
*  approach to health? Oh, three. Three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay. Exactly. That's [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12813.52s)]
*  good. Exactly. Well, so he, he did, he convinced me to stop drinking alcohol, which was a big [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12820.8s)]
*  success. Well, it was like my, other than my family, it was my favorite thing in the world. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12826.24s)]
*  And so it was a major, major reduction. Like having like a glass of scotch at night was like [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12830.4s)]
*  a major, like it was like the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly negatively [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12834.16s)]
*  impacted my emotional health. I blame him for making me much less happy as a person, but much, [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12838.0s)]
*  much, much healthier, physically healthier. So that, that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did [[03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12844.48s)]
*  that. But then his sleep stuff, like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that. I have no interest in his [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12850.08s)]
*  sleep shit. Like, no, this whole light, natural light. No, we're not doing it too hardcore. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12855.28s)]
*  I don't see any, I don't see any natural. I don't see any natural light in here. [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12860.880000000001s)]
*  It's all covered. It's all horrible. And I'm very happy. I would be very happy living and working [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12864.480000000001s)]
*  here. Cause I'm totally happy without natural light in darkness. It must be a metaphor for [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12870.320000000002s)]
*  something. Yes. It's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you could have a blue [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12875.12s)]
*  screen in your face for three hours and then go right to sleep. Like, I don't understand why [[03:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12878.24s)]
*  you should want to take shortcuts. [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12882.08s)]
*  I now understand what they mean by toxic masculinity. All right. [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12884.960000000001s)]
*  So, uh, let's see. You're exceptionally successful by most measures, [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12891.92s)]
*  but what to use the definition of success? [[03:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12898.960000000001s)]
*  I would probably say it is a combination of two things. I think it is, um, contribution. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12902.800000000001s)]
*  Um, so, you know, have you done something that mattered ultimately? Um, and, um, and, [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12910.8s)]
*  you know, and specifically matter to people. Um, and then the other thing is I think happiness is [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12916.880000000001s)]
*  either overrated or almost a complete myth. Um, and in fact, interesting Thomas Jefferson did not [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12921.2s)]
*  mean happiness the way that we understand it. When he said pursuit of happiness in the declaration [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12927.04s)]
*  of independence, he meant it more of the Greek meaning, um, which is closer to satisfaction, [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12930.64s)]
*  um, or fulfillment. Um, and so I think happiness is, so I think about happiness as [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12936.8s)]
*  the first, the first ice cream cone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12942.48s)]
*  park during sunset makes you super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12947.2s)]
*  thousandth ice cream cone, not so much. Um, the thousandth mile of the walk through the park. [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12952.24s)]
*  Um, the thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. Um, right. And so [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12959.28s)]
*  happiness is this very fleeting concept. Um, and the people who anchor on happiness seem to [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12965.6s)]
*  go off the rails pretty often. So did the deep sense of having been, I don't know how to put it, [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12969.76s)]
*  useful. So that's a good place to arrive at in life. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I mean, can you sit, [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12976.08s)]
*  can you, yeah. You know, who was it who said that all the source of all the ills in the world with [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12985.6s)]
*  man's inability to sit in a room by himself doing nothing. Um, but like if you're sitting in a room [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12989.76s)]
*  by yourself and you're like, all right, there are, you know, four in the morning. It's like, all [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12994.96s)]
*  right, have I like, you know, have I lived up to my expectation of myself? Like if you have, you [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12998.0s)]
*  know, the people I know who feel that way are pretty centered. Um, and, um, you know, generally [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13002.88s)]
*  seem very, um, I don't know how to put it, pleased with, you know, proud, um, calm at peace. Um, [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13007.519999999999s)]
*  the people who are, um, you know, sensation seekers, um, you know, some of the sensations, [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13015.839999999998s)]
*  by the way, some sense, you know, there's, there's certain entrepreneurs, for example, [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13021.359999999999s)]
*  who are like into every form of extreme extreme sport and they get, you know, huge satisfaction [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13023.52s)]
*  out of that. Um, or, you know, there's sensation seeking and sort of useful and productive ways. [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13026.880000000001s)]
*  You know, Larry Ellison was always like that Zuckerberg is like that. And then, you know, [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13031.28s)]
*  there's a lot of entrepreneurs who end up, you know, drugs, you know, like sexual, you know, [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13035.44s)]
*  sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun at first and then backfire. Yeah. But at the end of [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13042.800000000001s)]
*  the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4 a.m. Yeah. And I would even say [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13046.48s)]
*  happy, but I know I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, the way maybe I mean it, [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13052.96s)]
*  but I can be happy by myself at 4 a.m. with a blue screen. That's good. Exactly. Staring at a cursor. [[03:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13059.759999999998s)]
*  Exactly. As a small tangent, a quick shout out to an amazing interview you did with Barry Weiss [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13065.919999999998s)]
*  and just to her in general, Barry Weiss of the Free Press. She has a podcast called Honestly [[03:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13074.0s)]
*  with Barry Weiss. She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13079.52s)]
*  One of the joys, see, we talked about happiness. One of the things that makes me happy is making [[03:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13087.92s)]
*  you uncomfortable. Thank you. So this question is designed for many of the questions today [[03:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13092.08s)]
*  are designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God and you said after a pause, [[03:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13096.960000000001s)]
*  you're not sure. So it felt like the pause, the uncertainty there was [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13102.56s)]
*  some kind of ongoing search for wisdom and meaning. Are you in fact searching for wisdom and meaning? [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13110.08s)]
*  I guess I put it this way. There's a lot to just understand about people that I feel like I'm only [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13117.68s)]
*  starting to understand. And that's certainly a simpler concept than God. So that's what I spent [[03:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13124.32s)]
*  a lot of the last 15 years trying to figure out. I feel like I spent my first like whatever, [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13134.4s)]
*  30 years figuring out machines and then now I'm spending 30 years figuring out people, [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13138.48s)]
*  which turns out to be quite a bit more complicated. And then I don't know, [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13141.84s)]
*  maybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then, you know, look, I mean, just like Elon, [[03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13145.199999999999s)]
*  it's just like, okay, the known universe is like very complicated and mystifying. [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13152.0s)]
*  I mean, every time I pull up an astronomy, I get super in astronomy and it's like, you know, [[03:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13157.2s)]
*  daddy, how many galaxies are there in the universe? And how many galaxies are there in the universe? [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13161.2s)]
*  A hundred billion. Okay. Like how? [[03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13166.32s)]
*  Yeah. Like how is that freaking possible? Like what, like it's just, it's such a staggering concept. [[03:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13170.24s)]
*  I actually wanted to show you a tweet that blew my mind from Elon from a while back. [[03:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13178.88s)]
*  He said, Elon said, as a friend called it, this is the ultimate skill tree. This is a [[03:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13183.92s)]
*  wall of galaxies, a billion light years across. So these are all galaxies. [[03:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13189.52s)]
*  Yeah. Like what the, like how was it that big? Like how the hell? And like, you know, [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13195.6s)]
*  I can read the textbook into this and that and the whatever, eight billion years and the big bang [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13201.36s)]
*  and the whole thing. And then it's just like, all right, wow. And then it's like, all right, [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13204.72s)]
*  the big bang. All right. Like what was, what was before the big bang? [[03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13207.679999999998s)]
*  You think we'll ever, we humans will ever colonize like a galaxy and maybe even go beyond? [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13213.359999999999s)]
*  Sure. I mean, yeah. I mean, in the fullness of time. Yeah. [[03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13219.279999999999s)]
*  So you have that kind of optimism and you have that kind of hope that extends across thousands of [[03:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13221.84s)]
*  years. In the fullness of time. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. You know, all the, all the problems, [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13225.439999999999s)]
*  all the challenges with it that I do, but like, yeah, why not? I mean, again, in the fullness of [[03:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13227.84s)]
*  time, it'll, it'll take a long time. You don't think we'll destroy ourselves? [[03:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13231.84s)]
*  No, I doubt it. I doubt it. And you know, fortunately we have Elon [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13234.4s)]
*  giving us, giving us the, the, the backup plan. So, so I don't know. Like I grew up, you know, [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13239.12s)]
*  rural Midwest, sort of just like conventionally kind of Protestant Christian. It never made that [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13242.56s)]
*  much sense to me. Got trained as an engineer and a scientist. I'm like, oh, that definitely doesn't [[03:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13247.04s)]
*  make sense. I'm like, I know I'll spend my life as an empirical, you know, rationalist and I'll [[03:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13250.0s)]
*  figure everything out. And then, you know, and then again, you walk up against these things, [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13254.0s)]
*  you know, you, you bump up against these things and you're just like, all right, I, I like, [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13258.88s)]
*  okay, I guess there's a scientific explanation for this, but like, wow. And then there's like, [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13262.24s)]
*  all right, where did that come from? Right. And then how far back can you go on the causality [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13268.16s)]
*  chain? Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean, then even, even just, you know, experiences that we all have [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13272.48s)]
*  on earth, it's hard to, it's hard to rationally explain it all. And then, you know, so yeah, [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13277.44s)]
*  I guess I just say I'm kind of radically open-minded at peace with the fact that I'll [[03:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13281.36s)]
*  probably never know. The other thing that has happened and maybe the more practical answer to [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13285.6s)]
*  the question is, I think I have a much better understanding now of the role that religion [[03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13289.76s)]
*  plays in society than I didn't have when I was younger. And my partner, Ben has a great, [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13294.32s)]
*  I think he quotes his father on this. He's like, if a man does not have a real religion, [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13300.0s)]
*  he makes up a fake one. And the fake ones go very, very badly. And so there's this class, [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13303.28s)]
*  it's actually really funny. There's this class of intellectual, there's this class of intellectual [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13311.6s)]
*  that has what appears to be a very patronizing point of view, which is, yes, I'm an atheist, [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13314.32s)]
*  but it's very important that the people believe in something. Right. And Mark's had like the [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13318.4s)]
*  negative view on that, which is religion is the opiate of the masses. But there's a lot of like [[03:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13324.0s)]
*  right-wing intellectuals who are themselves, I think, pretty atheist or agnostic that are like, [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13327.039999999999s)]
*  it's deeply important that the people be Christian or something like that. And on the one hand, [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13330.24s)]
*  it's like, wow, that's arrogant and presumptive. But on the other hand, you know, maybe it's right [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13335.039999999999s)]
*  because, you know, what have we learned in the last hundred years is in the absence of a real [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13339.679999999998s)]
*  religion, people will make up fake ones. There's this writer, there's this political philosopher [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13344.08s)]
*  who's super interesting on this named Eric Vogel. And he wrote this, he wrote in that sort of mid [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13349.279999999999s)]
*  part of the century, mid late part of the 20th century. He was like born and I think like 1900 [[03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13353.92s)]
*  and like died in like 85. So he saw the complete run of communism and, and, and Nazism. And himself, [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13358.64s)]
*  you know, fled the, I think he fled Europe and, you know, the whole thing. And, you know, his, [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13365.12s)]
*  his sort of big conclusion was basically that both communism and Nazism and fascism were, [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13370.400000000001s)]
*  were basically religions were, were, but like in the deep way of religions, like they were, [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13374.640000000001s)]
*  you know, he called them political religions, but they were, they were like actual religions. And, [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13379.6s)]
*  you know, they were the, they were what Nietzsche forecasted when he said, you know, God is dead, [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13382.640000000001s)]
*  we've killed him and we won't wash the blood off our hands for a thousand years, right? Is we will [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13386.800000000001s)]
*  come up with new religions that will just cause just mass murder and death. And like you read his [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13392.0s)]
*  stuff now and you're like, yep, that happened. Right. And then of course, as fully, you know, [[03:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13397.44s)]
*  elite modernists, of course, we couldn't possibly be doing that for ourselves right now, but of [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13401.92s)]
*  course we are. And, you know, I would argue that Eric Vogel and for sure would argue that the last [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13405.2s)]
*  10 years, you know, we have been in a religious frenzy, you know, that woke has been a full scale [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13410.56s)]
*  religious frenzy and has had all of the characteristics of a religion, including everything [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13415.04s)]
*  from patron saints to holy texts to, you know, sin. It's that wokeness has said every aspect of a, [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13419.76s)]
*  wokeness has said every, I think it's that every single aspect of an actual religion, [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13428.0s)]
*  other than redemption, right? Which is maybe like the most dangerous religion you could ever come [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13431.04s)]
*  up with is the one where there's no forgiveness. Right. And so I think if Vogel were alive, [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13436.48s)]
*  I think he would have zeroed right in on that, would have said that. And, you know, we just like [[03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13441.12s)]
*  sailed right off. I mentioned earlier, like we somehow rediscovered the religions of the [[03:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13445.28s)]
*  Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity politics and environmentalism. Like, I don't think that's an [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13448.960000000001s)]
*  accident. So anyway, like there is something very deep going on in the human psyche on religion [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13454.16s)]
*  that is not dismissable and needs to be taken seriously, even if one struggles with the [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13462.16s)]
*  specifics of it. I think I speak for a lot of people. It's been a real joy and for me an honor [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13471.12s)]
*  to get to watch you seek to understand the human psyche, as you described. You're in that 30 year [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13477.44s)]
*  part of your life. And it's been an honor to talk with you today. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Alex. [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13484.480000000001s)]
*  Is that it? That's only, only how long is that? Four hours with Mark Andreessen. It's like 40 hours [[03:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13490.480000000001s)]
*  of actual content. So I'll accept being one of the short ones. Oh, for the listener, Mark looks like [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13498.24s)]
*  he's ready to go for 20 more hours. And I need a nap. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Alex. [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13505.28s)]
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Andreessen. To support this podcast, [[03:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13512.64s)]

*  Thomas Sowell. It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance. [[03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13522.48s)]
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. [[03:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=13531.84s)]
