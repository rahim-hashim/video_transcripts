# Georges St-Pierre: The Science of Fighting | Lex Fridman Podcast #179
**Lex Fridman:** [April 25, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIPxfzfOTxk)
*  The following is a conversation with George St. Pierre, considered by many to be the greatest
*  fighter in the history of UFC and MMA, but even more than that, one of the greatest martial artists
*  ever. Quick mention of our sponsors, Allform, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, Theragun, and TheInformation.
*  Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that
*  getting the chance to hang out with George, talk to him on the podcast, record a quick self-defense
*  video that I'll release soon, all while both of us wearing suits, was one of the most memorable
*  days of my life. In setting all this up, I talked to Joe Rogan and originally we couldn't schedule
*  a chat with him and George on the JRE, which allowed me to pretend for a brief time that
*  George came down to Austin just to see me. Who the hell am I? In truth, him and Joe probably
*  conspired to make me feel special, but that's the point. It's inspiring to see George and Joe,
*  who are at the top of their field, treat others as equals, as human beings, no matter who they are,
*  even silly Russians in a suit. Meeting George was an honor for me beyond words.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with my long-time martial arts hero
*  and now my friend, Mr. George St. Pierre. In your fighting career, were you more motivated by the
*  love of winning or the fear and hatred of losing? I like to win better than I hate to lose because
*  if it would not have been the case, I would never have fought in the first place because I don't
*  like to fight at all. But you talked about the anxiety, the fear, the experience leading up to
*  a fight. So to you, ultimately the reason to go through that difficult process is because it feels
*  damn good to have your hand raised? There is that. There is also the fact that
*  martial art had been introduced when I was very young, and it's probably the best thing I can do
*  in my life. Fighting, that's what I do best. Also, it provides me of freedom, of access of things that
*  most people do not have, but all that as a price. And a lot of money, I made a lot of money, of
*  course, with it. I was maybe predisposed with certain abilities. I met incredible mentors
*  throughout my life. I worked really hard. And of course, I had a lot of chances.
*  The stars were all aligned. And in order to keep those advantages of freedom, money, and glory,
*  and access of things that most people don't have, and have these dream life that I have,
*  I had to sacrifice myself and fight in order to keep it. It's very hard to understand
*  because I also believe most fighters are not like me. A lot of guys, because I corner a lot of guys,
*  and it seems to me that they love their job. They enjoyed to go fight in the cage. I love to train.
*  I love the science of fighting, the sport, to be in good shape, the confidence that training in
*  mixed martial arts gives me. However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty, the stress
*  that I have, not knowing if I will be badly injured, or humiliated, or winning the fight.
*  It's to me unbearable. And that's what takes the most out of me, more than brain damage,
*  more than anything. That's what takes the most out of me. But the thing you get from it is the
*  freedom that you get because of the money, but because of the celebrity, because of everything
*  that comes with it. So you can be the best version of yourself because of fighting. But at the same
*  time, you've said that, quote, I don't believe there's pleasure in life. I believe there's only
*  a relief from pain. We have to suffer to be on top. So isn't there something to just the suffering
*  in itself, just doing really difficult shit, just to get to the top? To explain that and so people
*  can relate to it because not everybody's a fighter. I think the best example I can
*  give is, let's say you're, you haven't eaten for a long time and you're craving, right? So you're
*  suffering. And then when it's time to eat, finally, you're about to eat your favorite dish.
*  It's going to taste so much better. So that's why I believe there is always some sort of sacrifice
*  before the pleasure. And the more sacrifice you do, like they say in fighting, the bigger the risk,
*  the bigger is the reward. And I feel that's how it is for me. Yeah, I feel that with, I've started
*  fasting a little bit in the past couple of years and there's nothing as amazing as a delicious
*  meal or anything, actually anything, any food when you haven't eaten for several days.
*  It's kind of incredible. It's not incredible in this simple way of finally I get to eat.
*  You get to truly experience the beauty of what it is to be alive. Like that little piece of food,
*  you see all the flavors, you feel just the experience of it is ultimately
*  of gratitude of how awesome it is to be alive. But when you eat many times a day and you're
*  pigging out and you don't get to experience that, and it's fascinating. It's really like fasting
*  is one of the most accessible things for people, I think, to experience that kind of
*  pairing of hardship to pleasure. I agree. And in my case, it changed my life on a good way.
*  I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different. But to fight Michael Bisping,
*  my last fight was against the champion in the heavier weight class that I used to compete at.
*  I thought that if I would gain weight, it would increase my performance.
*  I struggled a lot to gain weight. I gained a lot about 8 to 10 pounds. Normally, I walk around
*  185 pounds and for that fight, I was walking around 195. However, I forced myself to eat like
*  six times a day. I was on a very strict diet and it didn't feel right to me because
*  I feel like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder. And I think it was a bad idea for me because when
*  I did the weigh-in and I went on a scale at 185, I couldn't go back to my initial weight that was
*  195 that I worked so hard for several months to get there. So I was 190 pounds, but I couldn't
*  get back. In the morning of the fight, I got sick. We didn't know what it was in the beginning
*  because in order to know, to find out what it was, I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy. They
*  put a camera inside of you and to do that, they give you something that empties you. I was trying
*  to gain weight, not to lose weight. So I told myself, I'm going to wait after the fight,
*  whatever it is, because it was pretty bad. It was blood and I didn't know what I was. I was very
*  concerned. I thought I had maybe cancer. I was freaking out. So I said, I'm going to do that
*  fight and then right away, I'm going to make a checkup. So I did the fight. Everything went
*  well. I won the fight. I went back home. I did a colonoscopy and I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.
*  Then I got on very severe medication to get better. I'm not a big fan of medication. I was
*  trying to look for a more natural way to get better. I found out about fasting.
*  And it really changed my life. I met Dr. Jason Fong, who was one of the world authorities
*  of fasting. He treats diabetes patients with fasting. He gave me a program of fasting.
*  It really changed my life. Right away, what I did is I went in a CAT scan to see the difference,
*  because it was right after my fight with Michael Bisping. I did the CAT scan. I had my muscle mass,
*  bone density, fat percentage, water retention. It's pretty amazing. It can show you which harm
*  has more muscle than the other. It's very precise. I did it two months after. I started doing
*  time-restricted eating, 16-8. But right away, when I started, I did three days water fast.
*  The Dr. Jason Fong said, because I like to train during those days,
*  I consume Himalayan salt to make sure. Because when you sweat, there's a lot of minerals to make
*  sure you don't deplete your mineral. When I compared the two results in the CAT scan, I found out
*  my biggest concern was to lose muscle mass. I found out that I did not lose muscle mass.
*  Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit. Even though my weight on the scale was lighter,
*  I kept the same muscle mass, even increased a little bit. My bone density increases a little bit.
*  My water retention is the biggest thing that decreased. My inflammation and my fat percentage.
*  Basically, by looking at the data, I found out that by eating so much, trying to gain weight to
*  fight Michael Bisping, I only increase my water retention, which is not good because it's like
*  dead weight and inflammation on you. What was the actual process of fasting? You said 16-8,
*  time restricted, intermittent fasting. You also mentioned the three-day water fast.
*  What did that feel like? You also said training during the three days. How did that feel? Can
*  you give me some details of how that is fascinating? I do three days water fast,
*  four times a year. For me, I do it after New Year's because during the holidays,
*  I eat bad foods and I drink. I see it more like a cleansing, like a detox, so to speak.
*  Mental too, like psychological. Yes. I do it after the New Year's, right before the summer,
*  cut for the beach if I have to go. After the summer, because of the summer, I've been
*  partying a little bit sometimes, let myself go, and right before the holidays. Dr. Fong, he says to
*  me, said, George, everybody is different because I'm a very active person and everybody has a
*  different genetic. For me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot because I still train during
*  those three days. The first two days, I don't change nothing. I train on my regular schedule.
*  However, on the third day, I modify a little bit. I do something more easy and that's how I do.
*  I've tried before because when I say three days is my sweet spot, I've tried to go up to five days,
*  but the problems is after my third day, I found out that I had a big problem sleeping. I get into a
*  hyperactive mode. They call that the Antargetter mode. It's amazing. Your creativity is at its peak,
*  but you cannot sleep very well. Sleeping, for me, is very important. That's why I do three days.
*  That's interesting. You're right. It's four or five days when you start.
*  Sleep is not important for me. The creativity is really important.
*  It's very interesting the places your mind goes after a few days. You're right.
*  What does it do to your mind? You mentioned your body likes it. In terms of training,
*  do you find that it helps you focus and think? You're one of the great strategic thinkers in
*  terms of martial arts. Does it help with learning? Does it help with thinking? Does it help with
*  strategizing and all that? Unfortunately, I got into fasting after I retired. I really wish people
*  asked me, would you have done it during the time that you competed? The answer is yes.
*  I think we live in a society that was bombarded by publicity. Oh, buy this, eat protein, this,
*  that, and fasting, nobody makes money with it because there's nothing to sell. I think that's
*  why a lot of people have not heard about it. Even for myself, if someone would have talked to me
*  about the benefits of fasting, when I was training, before I got sick, I would probably
*  have ignored him because it's hard to believe. Sounds ridiculous. Don't eat. It's going to help
*  your mind and you're going to gain muscle potentially. Exactly. Perhaps people have talked
*  to me about it, but it went in one of my hair and got out from the other side. It really changed my
*  life. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms. What I do
*  is I know a lot of people have ulcerative colitis. For me, I cannot recommend it to other people
*  because everybody is different. For me, I made a lot of research of how people from ulcerative
*  colitis got better. I found out that a lot of people that got that condition get better in a
*  natural way through fasting, eating fermented food, collagen, bone broth, and stuff for their gut.
*  It made a huge difference in my life. I just wish I would have known that before.
*  Do you have a specific diet-wise stuff you like? I've recently had another ridiculous sounding
*  thing, but it makes me feel really good. It's very low carbs, so keto or even carnivore. It sounds
*  ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense, but it makes me feel really good even for performance.
*  Is Rogan influenced you? No, I was influenced by people. I'll tell you where because I was
*  doing it before he was doing it. It was popular in the endurance athlete community where it was
*  fat adapted athletes, insane people who run 50 miles, 100 miles. They figured out that they could
*  fuel their body with fat. They can go to fat as the source of energy as opposed to carbs.
*  I remember hoping that I'll be able to learn how to run 50 miles and so on. I've never done more
*  than 22, but I just remember switching away from carbs and feeling really liberated. I wasn't
*  thinking about food as much. I'm able to eat once a day and feel really good. I think everybody's
*  body is different, but I think carbs make me lazy. Maybe it's because-
*  The crash. Yeah, it's the crash, but also just psychologically something.
*  It forced me to also think about food too much. It starts becoming, just like you said, our society
*  is so much about food. There's so much advertisement and so much of our social life is about food.
*  It's very easy to live day to day thinking, when is the next meal? What am I going to eat for lunch?
*  What am I going to eat for dinner? What am I going to eat for breakfast? If you're not careful,
*  that's going to get in the way of you doing cool shit. Liberating yourself and thinking,
*  what am I actually passionate about in this life? Creating and forgetting to eat, those kinds of
*  things, and still being able to fuel your body. I don't know. It's been fascinating to figure out
*  later in life that carbs aren't necessary to function well. It makes me think we don't know
*  anything about nutrition. That's right. Personally, I don't think I could have a diet without carbs.
*  I love chocolate too much. For me, eating is a pleasure of life. I love my carbs. I love my sugar.
*  However, if you talk about diet, I don't have a specific diet. But recently, what I'm trying to do
*  is the days that I do not work out, I only eat once. That's kind of my rules. Plus, I try to respect
*  16, 8, and do my three-day fast four times a year. But the rest of the thing, I let myself loose
*  because I don't think I would be happy if I don't give myself the right to eat. For me, personally,
*  I love to eat so much. You talk about diet, carnivore diet. It's very interesting because
*  a few years ago, I went to Africa in Maasai Mara. It's a tribe in East Africa. I went to visit them.
*  I did a safari. I talked to them. These guys, their diet is 99% carnivore. That's crazy. You
*  should see they're very beautiful people. Shredded like that. Some people would say,
*  it's genetic. I'm like, yeah, maybe it's genetic. Think about the Eskimos also. Most of their diet
*  is on fish. I believe it can be done. I believe it can be done like an exclusive carnivore diet.
*  I think I'm going to try it pretty soon just to have the experience to see how it feels like.
*  Well, you're going to hang out with Joe. Be careful bringing it up because he'll convince
*  you to forever switch to carnivore. Definitely. He loves it. But just like you, I think he loves
*  food. He can't ever stay on carnivore. It was funny because we went to an Italian restaurant
*  together and I still only eat meat. I love the constraints of discipline. That's partially why
*  I like carnivore. I like saying no to food that is delicious. But part of the problem is that I
*  don't know how to moderate. You said chocolate. I don't know how to have one chocolate. Is that
*  something you're able to do in moderation? No, it's when I have an opportunity, I do it.
*  I'm an extremist person. That's the thing. When I have a chance, I go
*  too much. That's what I like about my life. That's what I like about fasting because probably
*  if I would not have discovered fasting, eating chocolate would give me cramps and all sorts of
*  problems because people on ulcerative colitis, normally they cannot eat chocolate. They cannot
*  drink alcohol. But I believe because I'm fasting, that's the reason why I'm medication-free. I can
*  eat whatever I want whenever I want. But I have to do that fasting. Now it became to a point that
*  it's no longer hard for me. It's normal. I don't even force myself. It's easy. Some of my friends
*  think I'm insane. But I tell them when you get used to it, it becomes like an habit. I know that
*  hunter-gatherer, like our ancestor, did not eat three times a day. It's not true. They eat when
*  they could and when they eat, they feed themselves as much as they can until the next time because
*  they didn't know when they could eat again. I think that's how we're built to have this similar
*  lifestyle. If we could take a step back to the discussion about fear a little bit. So Mike Tyson
*  talks about this process of him walking to the ring. He sounds similar to you in many ways of
*  the anxiety and the fear that he experiences. And he has this sort of story that he tells about
*  walking to the ring and being supremely afraid. But as he walks and gets closer and steps in,
*  he finds the confidence and becomes supremely confident. I think he calls himself a god. I feel
*  like a god in the ring. Do you go through a similar process of finding the confidence?
*  Well, yes. I use a James Lange theory. So what I do is because I'm not afraid to admit that I'm
*  afraid. And in the beginning of my career, I really thought, I asked myself because I was very good
*  in mixed martial arts, but I really thought I wasn't made for this because the idea of fighting
*  didn't make me happy. It's something like I was forced to do in order to keep that lifestyle
*  that I have and achieve my goal, perhaps one day to make enough money to retire.
*  And that was my dream. But when I was looking around the gym where I was training,
*  most of my training partner, they were happy. They were excited. And sometimes I corner a lot
*  of guys and they're happy and they're in the locker room. They don't react the same way I do.
*  Some perhaps does, but if you see me in the locker room,
*  I don't react the same way. Like when I get like my last fight with Michael Bissping,
*  just to give you an example, in my last fight with Michael Bissping, because it's fresh,
*  it's the one that is the most recent. But it's always the same thing. My last fight
*  and Bissping, I get in the locker room. I had like three guys that I trained with, Mickey Galle,
*  Eamonn Zahabi and Joseph Duffy. They all lost. My locker room was basically cursed.
*  When you're in a locker room and people from your locker room leave for a fight,
*  then they come back. It's kind of a momentum. You shake and yeah, good job. Now it's my turn.
*  It's kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing. So the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty
*  bad. It was like going to a funeral. So I was very scared. And before every fight, I asked myself,
*  always, shit, what the hell I'm doing here? Why did I choose to come back? Oh my God. And I'm
*  freaking out. However, I'm putting on a mask like I'm acting. Because if I don't do that,
*  it will reflect on my coaches. And if my coach, the confidence of my coaches is affected,
*  it will reflect on me. So I need to feel strong. I need to make them believe that
*  I'm excited to be there and I'm happy to be there. So this sort of play
*  starts when I get my first step in the locker room, even though I feel completely different.
*  But that's how I play it. Normally, the fight day, I never feel 100%. I always feel exhausted,
*  tired. My eyes are itching because I don't sleep enough the few nights before because I'm
*  constantly rehearsing scenarios that might happen in the fight. So mentally, I'm not on top.
*  But you keep all that to yourself. I keep it to myself and I'm lying to everybody around me.
*  But everybody knows, you know? Fair ass John De Niro, they know Freddie Rose. They've been with
*  me for a long time. So they know what's going on. But at least I'm lying to them. I'm like,
*  I'm feeling great. And seeing all my training partner, like very disappointed because they
*  lost their fight, some were badly hurt as well. It was hard. And I remember I get, I get, I get,
*  I start to warm up and everything. And as you start to warm up, you become a different person.
*  Because, you know, we know that certain posture and yoga can affect your mental state. But I
*  would say it's a little bit the same thing in fighting. You know, like when you start hitting
*  the pads, your muscle memory, your instincts comes back and you remember that you're good at this,
*  you know, and your confidence starts to grow. And as seeing your trainers holding the pad and
*  repeating your moves, it makes you also remember all the sacrifice you have done through your
*  training camp. And confidence comes from how you prepared yourself. And even you're afraid,
*  you can be confident, confident at the same time. Being afraid and being confident is two different
*  things. And before every fight, just right before I walk in, it's when I'm scared, I go in the
*  bathroom and I look at myself in the mirror. I used to have a bandana and a gi, but now I
*  didn't have this for my last fight because of the new Reebok deal they had. But I did the same
*  rehearsal that I always do. I look at myself in the mirror and I start to compliment myself.
*  Like even if I don't believe it, I'm starting to trying to believe it as I am. I'm finding all the
*  reason why I'm going to win the fight. And all my trainer knows that before every fight, when the
*  guy from the UFC goes and Steppen Maroon says, St. Pierre, you're up next, I always take a few minutes
*  to do that same rehearsal. And I tell myself I'm going to win this fight because I'm better. And
*  I'm very cocky about myself. I'm telling all the reasons that I'm going to win. I got a better
*  team. I made more sacrifice. I'm faster. I'm more powerful, way more athletic. My fighting IQ is
*  better than him. I got a strategy on point that he's never going to be able to keep up with.
*  I was telling myself, I'm going to show these young kids how things should be done. I'm trying
*  to boost myself. Try to boost yourself. And you start to believe in it. You become a different
*  person. So when you walk out the bathroom, now rock and roll. Now I really believe it for real.
*  I'm still scared, but I believe it for real. And that's the transformation that happened for me
*  right there. And from there to the fight, until the fight is over, I call it cruise control.
*  Because you don't have time to think in a fight. If you're trying to think, you're missing
*  the opportunity. So that's how I see it for myself. So at that point, you stop thinking,
*  and you just go cruise control, autopilot. Trust yourself. Trust yourself because you repeated
*  all the scenarios. So everything that you have done, it's inside your computer. Your computer,
*  your brain is programmed to react accordingly to certain situations. And it's not the night of the
*  fight that you'll tell yourself, oh, finally, I'm going to do this if you do this now. If you have
*  not practiced it before, you're screwed. The preparation, the repetition that makes it happen.
*  What about the really difficult moments in a fight where you
*  are tested to your limits, essentially? Usually it's cardio related exhaustion, right? Where you
*  have to ask yourself that same question. It's like, why the hell am I doing this?
*  Yes. Do you experience those or are you able to ride through the autopilot? And if you do,
*  what do you do in those moments? Never in a fight. When I'm in a fight,
*  when the fight is on, I never change my mind. I go until the end. However, for example,
*  my first fight with BJ Penn, I had a terrible first round. So I had to switch gear. That happened
*  sometimes. But it's part of my plan. I always have a plan B, plan A, plan B, plan C. You need
*  to have that. If fighters go into a fight thinking, oh, what I'm going to do is this, and they don't
*  have a plan B, if this doesn't work, that means they're not well prepared. If you talk to me
*  before every fight, I can like in 30 seconds give you my old strategy. For BJ Penn, my first fight
*  with BJ Penn was, oh, I'm going to keep it standing up. Keep the fight from the outside,
*  because I'm faster than him. Then the fight with BJ Penn start. I found out that I was not faster
*  than him. And I found out that his reaction time was better than mine. So I got beat up the first
*  round and I got a bloody nose and everything. So my plan B was now I'm going to wrestle him.
*  I'm going to wrestle him and make him tired and trying to put him down. And that's how I beat him,
*  because I switched gear. But if you can't do that, if you cannot find a way to become the perfect
*  nemesis to your opponent, you might win a few fights, but you're going to fight someone
*  sooner or later that will give you a lot of trouble. So that's where the anxiety pays off.
*  You're anticipating all the ways it goes wrong. So you develop the plan B and plan C.
*  Hi, you know, we talked a lot with like John Donahue, who you work with. It's interesting.
*  I don't think I've heard him talk about plan B and plan C. He usually has a really clear plan A,
*  entire system of plan A. I don't think I've heard him. We've had a good discussion about it in
*  in over some cheeseburgers. And he's he was kind of espousing the value of
*  mastering escapes. So when you find yourself in bad situations, being exceptionally good at finding
*  ways out of those bad situations, and that's a way of dominance. There's nothing there's no better
*  way to dominate your opponent, according to him, than to show that they can't possibly hurt you,
*  no matter how bad the position is. It's like it's a as opposed to physical dominance,
*  it's a psychological dominance. It's very interesting. But I wonder if he has plan B
*  and plan C in his mind, too. You know, in mixed martial arts, sometimes it's like in science,
*  something you can make a mistake, like a mistake, you know, like every human can make mistakes,
*  you know, there's certain sport or a certain situation that you if there's a mistake made,
*  you're you're you're that's it. Exactly. Sometimes it's the case in MMA. But sometimes you're able
*  to redeem yourself. And if you look the fight with BJ Penn, one that I had, which was probably one
*  of the most competitive fight, and it was probably that it was the fight that I got the most damage.
*  And I was messed up. It took me three days, like two, three days to recuperate from that fight. I
*  was really damaged. And my first fight versus my second fight, I made a lot of adjustment
*  because I have learned from my first fight. And also I had a guy. One thing people don't know,
*  like they talk about fighters having secret weapons. See, for me, my secret weapons was not
*  like some is that they use like certain like different things. For me, it was knowledge.
*  I had a guy in Montreal, he was measuring frames. He's not a scientist. He's a friend of a
*  ferrari and what he does, he watched fight and he measure frames that the way he does it is when
*  you watch a fight and one of the guy threw a punch, he cut the picture by frame, the video by frame.
*  So he's able to see which fighter has better reaction time than others.
*  And BJ Penn, he found out that BJ Penn of all the UFC roster at the time when he was in his prime,
*  he had probably the best reaction time of all. According to him, Lyoto Machida was the second one.
*  But BJ Penn was the first one. So I knew that if I would try to go first, because I always been
*  the fastest guy normally when I fight someone. But when I fought BJ Penn, I tried to go first
*  and he was always able to like, I never was never able to touch him with my jab and he came back
*  with a counter punch. However, because of what he told me, I knew that BJ Penn has a very fast
*  reaction time but had a very poor reset time. To him, the way he described it to me is like,
*  your nervous system is like a muscle. BJ Penn was so fast, but he's like more like a sprinter.
*  So when I did the second fight, when I fought BJ Penn, I made him flinch. Like I fake a lot,
*  so I make him react and flinch. So all that reaction time that he used to flinch was not
*  used properly to avoid my punches. So I load up his nervous system with a lot of information
*  and fake and to make him flinch and pretending I was kicking and wrestling. So he got overwhelmed
*  and he got tired very, very fast. So that's how I beat him. People sometimes they don't know
*  really what's the strategy behind the thing. They only see the physical part. But when you
*  fight someone, if I fight you, I look at you in the eyes, there's a lot of things that going on
*  between you and I. I can look down here, bam, jab you in the face. The audience will not see these
*  little details, but you will see it. And that's what makes the magic during a fight. The relation
*  that you have with the opponent, you know, like the mental game, what you make him believe,
*  those little things, I use a lot of those. If you've talked to a lot of my opponent,
*  they'll tell you like, I use a lot of these little things. You know, like I look down at
*  Banner, I go up or I am pretending I want to attack you so I'm make you flinch. But in reality,
*  I'm just doing this because I want to rest. I want to recuperate and I'm tired.
*  How much is, you know, people talk about that with poker, for example, how much is
*  the value of this, you know, so like some people argue that poker is more about the betting.
*  You know, just the money. It's just how much you bet and so on. So that would be more like the
*  analogy there with fighting would be just strictly the physical movement of your body.
*  And then a lot of people argue that there's a lot here in the way you look and the little
*  movements in the face. So do you think you're communicating with your opponent when you look
*  at them? There's no way to know for sure 100%. And I'm by no means psychic, nothing like that.
*  And I don't believe in that at all. The only thing is I know to looking through the eyes of
*  my opponent when he's afraid and when he gives up on me. I've been accused very often in my career
*  to not take enough risk to not finish my opponent. But the reason why I didn't finish my opponent is
*  because I saw in his eyes that he gave up. He gave me the fight and I'm winning the fight. So
*  it's not up to me. It's not to me to make it to try to sacrifice myself trying to finish him.
*  Perhaps if I do that, I will open up for him to capitalize on my mistake. It's up to him to make
*  a risk. So people sometimes they don't understand that this is the art of fighting my friend, you
*  know, like if I'm winning the fight like an hockey and ice hockey, if you're winning the game and
*  it's the third period, it's at the end of the third period, you're not going to take out your
*  goaltender trying to score another goal because winning five to three or five to four is the same
*  thing. Same thing in MMA, we make a living out of this. And sometimes, you know, as sad as bad as
*  it can be, you want to save yourself for another day, you know, you want to minimize the damage.
*  But if he knows he's losing the fight, it's up to him to take the risk. It's not up to me.
*  So I'm a good counter fighter. I use a lot of my attack or counter strike or reactive takedown or
*  proactive takedown. That's my specialty. So I'm not going to, I have no desire to sacrifice myself
*  trying to try to finish my opponent if he wants to, if perhaps I might give him the opportunity
*  to capitalize on me. It's not smart to do that. And very often when I fight someone, I can read
*  him. I see the fear in his eyes. Now I'm like, I got you now. He's very desperate. That doesn't mean
*  I have to put my guard down because he's going to be desperate. But I know I'm beating you.
*  And I know I'm beating you. I'm just going to do what I need. You know, if I have a chance,
*  of course I'll knock him out, but I'm not going to try to sacrifice myself to knock you out.
*  And if you do that, maybe one day you'll make a mistake and you'll get dropped and you'll
*  tell yourself, I shoot, I just got brain damage. Maybe I'm never going to come back the same. Maybe
*  I ruined my career or, you know, it's a, it's a very serious game that we're playing. It's very
*  dangerous. In the face of that risk. I mean, Mike Tyson talked about, you know, when the opponent
*  looks away, he knows he's got him, right? That, that, that he's broken for a person like me who
*  has trouble making eye contact with people. There's, there's truth to that. I mean, there,
*  there's truth to that, that there's, there's an animal nature to us looking away. I mean,
*  you could see that the way the body language, the way the eyes move between two animals going at it
*  in the wild on like two lines fight or to whatever fight, there's a certain beta move when you've,
*  you've been defeated. Yes. Or one thing when I know that, that when it happened, one of the signs
*  is when I just like make a faint and the guy flinch like crazy, that's mean he's really scared
*  of me. It's a little bit like you're, you're, you're, you're doing this. That guy flinched a little
*  bit or you're doing this. He's flinched like, oh, that's mean you hurt him and he doesn't want to
*  get hurt again. So he's, he's really trying to run away and not, not winning the fight anymore,
*  but not losing. So sort of surviving the, the, the five round. And it's hard to, to finish a guy
*  who does, doesn't want to fight a guy who's not fighting anymore to win in this fighting to not
*  lose. And the proof of that, if you don't believe me, just look the reign of all the greatest
*  champion in UFC. I don't care who they are, John Jones or, or, like you could clearly see that in
*  the beginning of their rank, they could, you know, finish a lot of their opponent the same,
*  same as me in the beginning. I was finishing a lot of my opponent, but there's a time that
*  the entire UFC roster is studying you and they found a ways to perhaps not beating you, but they
*  found a way to navigate through the, the, the fight in a way that they minimize the damage.
*  You know what I mean? So it's a big difference between fighting to win and fighting to not lose.
*  You said that there's a difference between a fighter and a martial artist. So now we were
*  talking about fighting. You're considered by many to be one of the greatest fighters of all time,
*  but you've said that there's a difference between a fighter and a martial artist.
*  A fighter is training for a purpose. He has a fight. I'm, I'm a martial artist. I don't train
*  for a fight. I train for myself. I'm training all the time. My goal is perfection, but I will
*  never reach perfection. So what to you does it mean to be a martial artist? Martial artist is
*  because that lifestyle that I have has been introduced to me and the seed has been planted
*  to my mind a long, long time ago by, by my father. I, I do not train because I have a fight. I will
*  always train. Even now it kind of amuse me that to see that a lot of people, because I'm still
*  training because I love the science of fighting. I do not like to fight, but I love the science of
*  it. And I will always do it as long as I can do it. People think I'm going to make a comeback and
*  everything. I'm, I'm about to get to have 40 years old, you know, like it's, I'm, you know, like,
*  I don't want to fight in a cage at 40 years old. I mean, some people have done it, they did it very
*  well, but I'm not one of them. I'm, I feel a little bit to me that, and you never say never,
*  feel like to me, like it's a little, like a kid that you play with a strain when he's young, like
*  then he's five years old, six years old, seven years old, eight years old. And then I want to be like,
*  what the hell am I doing here? And I'm too old for this. Like, like it's, I, I,
*  I've done it, you know, and, and, and I got out of it on top and I'm, I'm healthy, which is the most
*  important thing right now, touching wood and I'm, I'm wealthy. I beat the game. You know what I mean?
*  In a way, like I, that's not to be cocky, but I did it. And I wish more, more fighters could do
*  the same thing. I wish, but it's unfortunate because a lot of them, they stay there and hang
*  out for too long and they get badly hurt. They get beaten and, and, and broken, you know, and they
*  finish broke as well because the lifestyle you have when you're a pro athlete, it's crazy. You
*  know, it's, it's, it's unbelievable. However, everything that goes up in life goes down and
*  you need to plan your future, you know? So for, for me, what if some guys have the same mentality
*  as me and they're watching us right now, I would say if you do it because you're just good at it,
*  you like the money, the advantage, the freedom that it gives you, but you don't necessarily like
*  to fight when you're done, you finish on top, you know, go cash, go cash out and get out of here.
*  Walk away. That's really hard to do. However, it's not everybody that does it for that reason.
*  Some people generally love to fight, love to compete. So they do it because they love it,
*  you know, or they do it because of the money. But if you don't love it, if you don't like to fight
*  because it's very stressful and you don't enjoy, you enjoy the training perhaps, but you don't like
*  to fight, you do it because it's part of what you need to do in order to keep that lifestyle.
*  And, you know, like you don't need the money. Get out of here, man. If you're in your prime,
*  get out of here because if you don't, you'll hurt your own legacy, you'll damage your health.
*  It's very sad. And it's a sad business. You know what I mean? It's like a lot of,
*  one of the place where is the most, one of the most happiest place for me to go and the most
*  saddest place for me to go is in the gym, TriStar Montreal. Because it's one of the happiest place
*  for me to go because I can go train and do what I love to do. But it's also a very sad place for me
*  because after when I'm about to leave, there's always a bunch of young kid that comes or guys
*  that are around 30, 33 years old and they come to me and say, hey, George, you have some advice for me.
*  And I look at them. And if they're my friend, they're real close friend of mine, I'll tell them
*  the truth in their face. And I've done it many times and it was not well received. But if they're
*  not my friend, I have to, you know, you know, there's always an advice about fighting and I answer
*  their question. It's my pleasure. But the truth, if they want me to tell the truth,
*  the big majority of them, I would tell them, I said, listen, man, you're in maybe three,
*  like on the losing street of three fights. You're 30, 33 years old, you know, I think you should
*  think about doing something else in your life, you know, have other goals, you know, because
*  you're not going to make it. And, you know, I've seen that movie before and it's a very sad ending.
*  And I'm sad to tell you the truth, because you're not going to make the money, just choose some.
*  But if I tell them that they're going to be angry at me because they're going to be like, oh, you,
*  you make it and you think I cannot make it. So it's kind of, they're going to think I'm cocky.
*  But I was lucky to make it. You know what, the star, we're all aligned. But at one point,
*  you need to be able to have a plan B, you know, like, like some parent, they come to see me with
*  their kids. Hey, this is the future world champion in the UFC. And what advice would you give him?
*  I always tell the same thing. And it does not make everybody happy. When I said I say I go to the
*  case, I say, are you good at school? Say stay at school. School is very important for you. Stay
*  educated. Yeah, do boxing, martial arts, a great sport, stay in shape, but don't put your eggs all
*  in the same basket. And the parents sometimes are angry when I say not angry, but I can see
*  their eyes. They're like, they kind of surprised. And it's not because I made it that I will
*  tell their kid to follow the same path that I did. I went to school too. I've studied. I dropped
*  off school when I had my first world championship fight against Matt Hughes. But before that, I was
*  school. So I had another, you know, another way to go if things would not have gone the same,
*  the way I wanted. But the problem, and I'm saying that it's not only about boxing and MMA. I'm
*  talking about hockey, basketball, baseball, same thing. Maybe it's the one on the hundred thousand
*  that make it. And I'm saying that make it. When I'm saying I make it, that means they can retire
*  and have enough money for the rest of his life. Because it's a sad story. The only people only
*  heard about the people that makes it. But a lot of fighters, even the UFC champion in boxing
*  champion, even the football, basketball, I don't care the big names. When they retire, they have
*  zero. They're bankrupt, my friend. And it's a very sad, sad story and a sad reality that most
*  people are not aware of. But having other paths in life actually can also increase the chance of you
*  dominating and like reaching the highest peak in your main thing. I mean, Jimmy Page, I don't
*  know if you know who that is, is a judo coach in America. He says that to all of his athletes,
*  is to make sure that you go. He has a lot of, you know, Kayla Harrison, two-time Olympic gold
*  medalist. He has a lot of Olympic medalists. But basically there's something about going to school,
*  like having, forget school, any other avenue in life that gives you the freedom to go all out
*  in your main. Like that, you know, you're doing it for the right reasons. You're not stuck. It
*  clears the mind to where you're free to be the best in the world as opposed to kind of, you have to.
*  I mean, at different people, it motivated by different things. So sometimes some people like
*  having their back to the wall and that's the only option they have. But most people, I think,
*  excel when you have other options. I think it's a distraction and I think it's important to have
*  a distraction. When you say that, I think about one of my coach, John Danaher. He put his academic
*  background experience into Jiu-Jitsu. And that for me, that's why he's the best teacher I ever had.
*  He's incredible. He started teaching me when I even couldn't speak much English at the time.
*  And I was able to communicate and understand, you know, that's how good he is. But I truly believe
*  that most of athletes, especially in sports like mixed martial arts, train way too much. If I could
*  go back and talk to a young George, I would tell him, you do way too much volume. You train way too
*  hard. Train smarter. It's more important. And I think sometimes we underestimate the benefit of
*  recuperation because I think we assimilate the information that we learn
*  during a training when we recuperate and not during the training itself. And this whole mentality of
*  harder, heavier, you know, like it's good for someone who's lazy. But if you're an elite athlete,
*  most of the time, you know, like you're not always, but most of the time is because you're not
*  lazy. And a lot of guys, sometimes they're elite athletes, champions. And you hear people say,
*  oh, I can't believe he's very gifted, but he doesn't work. But perhaps it's not really because
*  perhaps it's because we don't understand. Perhaps he's doing the right thing. And it's
*  us who's working too much and too hard. That's what I think. There's a guy I train with. He's
*  a he made me think about it. His name is Mansour Bernawi. He's going to be a future star. He's an
*  incredible fighter. He trained once a day. And he asked me some time advice when he came to Montreal.
*  He's from France. You'll hear about him. He's very good. And I saw him in the morning at Tristar. And
*  I said, okay, I'll see you perhaps later in the other training. He said, oh no, I only train once
*  a day. And he kind of waits for me to give him like, like, like, not not an approval, but like,
*  to see how I react or, or, you know, I don't know. It was kind of a strange feeling. But I told
*  myself, at that point, I kind of I had an awakening. And I, and I told myself, man,
*  maybe he's doing the right thing. Because a lot a lot of people would say, for example, oh,
*  that's a lazy way of doing it. But perhaps it's the best way to do it. I'm not saying
*  training once a day is the best way to do it. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying that
*  everybody is different. But for him, it works beautifully. And I wouldn't change anything,
*  you know, like, if I would be him because he's improving like crazy.
*  Yeah. And ultimately, the bigger picture there is to do something that everyone else is,
*  says is stupid. It's like the fasting thing that that a lot of people would say a lot of nutritional
*  experts would say that that's, that's a dumb way. You know, if you want to be an MMA fighter,
*  you should be eating like many times a day, you should be starting every day with oatmeal,
*  you should be carving up constantly. But that's not necessarily true for everybody. And it's
*  possible. I'm sure there's actually now a few MMA fighters that are carnivore only it's possible.
*  I used to eat right before training. And I didn't bother me. However, now,
*  I my first training that I do normally in average around noon 11am. I'm I haven't eaten anything
*  when I do my first training and it feels to me that I'm much I'm much more clear. I'm much more
*  clear in my mind. I'm much more creative. I feel better. Yeah, yeah, it's a big difference. I just
*  wish I would have known that before. Well, it's fascinating the role of the mind in all of this,
*  how important is it for your mind to be clear to really think deeply? I there's a
*  there's a judoka American named Travis Stevens. I remember he said something that
*  that the right kind of practice is when your mind is exhausted at the end of it,
*  that you were constantly thinking through things like your body shouldn't be exhausted first,
*  your mind should be exhausted first. It's really fascinating. So people think about training hard.
*  You know, a successful practice is where you walk away, just overwhelmed how much you had to think.
*  It's fascinating framing of of a successful practice. It's true. Travis Steven was one of
*  my main training partner when I got ready for my fight with Nick Diaz and Carlos Condit. He drove
*  every Friday from, I believe, Boston. It's like a six hour drive, drive to the gym in Montreal,
*  train with us an hour and a half, drive back. He's got such an amazing discipline.
*  I was so happy for him when he won the medal at the Olympic game. Man, what a well deserved,
*  you know, accomplishment. It's unbelievable. It paid off. You know, I'm I was so happy for him.
*  And every time we got to the gym, he was waiting for me in the kneeling position like a soldier.
*  I was like, my God, this guy is made of steel, you know, and after training, I always offer him,
*  I say, hey, Travis, I know you like to train with that because in Montreal, they have very good judo
*  team, Nicholas Gill and all those guys. And I say, if you want to stay, I'll get you the hotel,
*  you know, like anything you want is like, no, no, I got to go back. I got another training later.
*  I'm like, not only that he trained with us, you have to go back because he had another training.
*  I'm like, this is insane. And he's gone through a huge number of injuries. So he's also an innovator
*  because I mean, it's difficult to say, but for American judo, there's not many high level judoka.
*  So if you want to be the like, fight with the best in the world, you're you have to be alone.
*  It's a lonely journey. Actually, it's kind of sad. It's much easier to be in Japan where
*  everybody's a killer when you're alone at it. It's a it's a difficult journey. And, you know,
*  it's it's funny we talked about kind of there's some sports where a mistake is that's it. You know,
*  you can't recover from a mistake. I think judo oftentimes is one of those sports. And added on
*  top of that is the Olympics only every four years. And Travis's story, he's the reason I
*  when I saw him in 2008, as I started martial arts, I switched from like wrestling and street fighting
*  to doing jiu jitsu and judo. And I just saw so much guts. And the in 2000, I might be messing
*  up the years here, but in the next Olympics, he fought and he lost on just the referee call. Yeah.
*  And just he went to war and he just so much guts and just everything on the line and to lose
*  and to still persevere through all the injuries through all that through incredibly difficult
*  training sessions to go another four years and then compete and then win a medal. I mean, that
*  guy is just and like he clearly could have been very successful. He's also an incredible jiu jitsu
*  competitor. So he could have switched to that. But he's stuck in a lot of sport when you're an elite
*  like, for example, in Canada, I saw he's the number one sport of the country's
*  kids when they're an elite, when they're young, they get chosen and they're kind of already
*  known as a superstar. The school where they go and the program they follow.
*  Like, I'm sure it's the same thing in the US and basketball, baseball, perhaps
*  American football because they already chosen. So they grew up with that
*  that it's a kid that superstar stardom, so to speak. And it's already sort of glamorous.
*  You know, however, in MMA, there's no MMA judo wrestling like in America because it's not our
*  national sport. It's actually it's not like even when I first started was not really well received
*  by the media. There's no glamor into it. Now, I don't know. It seems like it's another era now.
*  And I feel sometimes. That some people do it for the wrong reason.
*  You know, some people do it because of the glamor, because of the money.
*  But even if you're an elite and very good, the glamor and the money won't come in the beginning.
*  It's a very long grind before, you know, it start it start to come in and you need to make those
*  sacrifices. And it's a it's a journey that where you will be tested, you will be hurt
*  repetitively. And you're going to have to reach the down deep and come back up. And then once
*  you finally think you made it, you're going to go back in the down deep again. It's a very exhausting
*  and encouraging adventure sometimes. But if you hold on to your dream and you believe in it,
*  you know, and you have the stars are aligned, you're going to make it. That's why it's only
*  a few people that make it, you know. And that's why I feel I feel sometimes that a lot of people
*  in the new generation do it for the wrong reason. In my generation, because of sport at first,
*  it was there were no rules. I thought it was more pure. The people that did it was really
*  because of the passion that we didn't seek money and fame. We did it because we wanted to be
*  I did it because I wanted to be the man. You know, I like to have the confidence that when
*  I walk somewhere, I'm, you know, I have the confidence that, you know, it's an illusion
*  because nobody's faster than a bullet. Yes. But I wanted to achieve it for myself. And I which
*  today now, because I don't know if it's social media and all that that the world has changed.
*  The glamour, the you know, it's I feel it's a different thing right now. Yeah. The if you
*  get in it for the glamour, the money, you may not have the right the right amount of fuel to
*  persevere through all the ups and downs. Yeah, sure. You know, when you talk about motivation
*  of money and glamour, a guy comes to mind and I don't know how many wrestlers you know, but
*  in Russia, there's a guy named Bovasiy Satiev. Satiev brothers, one of the greatest freestyle
*  wrestlers of all time. But he also has it's funny that he doesn't have many interviews.
*  One of my goals is to go out and talk to him in Russian, do an interview with him,
*  because he's exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker. He's the kind of martial artist that you
*  are in the way that it's not just about the different battles you've been through or whatever.
*  It's about the philosophy behind the way he approaches life. He has spoken quite a bit about
*  that the glamour, the fame, the money are all things that get in the way of the purity of the
*  experience, the art, that the way to achieve greatness is to just lose yourself in the art of
*  the actual combat. In his case, it's wrestling. And then kind of not to worry and actively make
*  sure that you block out anybody who, you know, feeds you the narrative where you're supposed to
*  be this famous person and all those kinds of things that he basically says, let others write
*  your story. Make sure that you just focus on the art. And now another person from that side of the
*  world is, of course, Khabib. So he represents that side of the world. And we were talking about
*  walking away and most people not being able to walk away at the top as you have, but also now
*  Khabib has, it looks like, incredibly so. So, I mean, maybe you can comment about what your thoughts
*  are about Khabib, not to bring it back off, being able to just walk away. You know, we talk about
*  the gold very often. Khabib is, you know, one of, isn't the argument because he has the most dominant
*  carrier of all martial art, the guy. You know, some guys can be named the gold for different
*  reasons, but Khabib for that reason, and he's undefeated. I don't even know if he lost. He
*  might have lost round, but he dominates all his opponent. It was ridiculous and such an incredible
*  carrier that he had. I love to watch him fight. He's incredible. And when you talk about the art,
*  when you say mixed martial art, the idea of a flawless performance for me,
*  everybody often when we say flawless performance thinks about a knockout, a brutal knockout.
*  But for me, it's to be able to showcase beautiful technique, like a beautiful takedown,
*  beautiful submission, like something beautiful that, you know, when you look at, for example,
*  Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan or like Stephen Curry, or even if you don't know nothing about
*  basketball and you watch Michael Jordan, you'll be like, wow, that's beautiful what you just did.
*  Like we talk about fighting and trying to say the word beautiful in fighting for certain people,
*  it could sound kind of crazy, you know, but I'm talking about the technique.
*  A beautiful technique. You know, for me, that's the goal. You know, when I was fighting, it's not only
*  to have a brutal knockout because some people are more gifted than others. I'm saying gifted. Some
*  people are better than others in certain phase of fighting. But for me, it was that it was to
*  showcase, to win, of course, but to showcase some beautiful technique that you can watch it and be
*  like, wow, that was incredible. The timing, he did it. And when I think about Khabib Normagomanov,
*  I see all the detail of his work, especially when he's got his opponent against defense. That's
*  like, that's his area of expertise where he's, to me, he's the best that ever did it in terms of
*  that fighting style, that particular expertise that he has. It's like, he's got that, you know,
*  that particular expertise that he has. It's just incredible.
*  The flawless execution of that particular set of techniques.
*  Yes. And Conor McGregor had the accuracy. The Spider Anderson Silva was like, was, I would say,
*  the most flamboyant of all, you know, like he was moving like the matrix. John Jones was incredible
*  creativity, spinning elbows and that, and he faced incredible adversity. Dimitrious Johnson was
*  so complete. You could, you could bring, like he was slamming a guy to an umpire. It was just
*  unbelievable. Like, like he was like the complete fighter. BJ Penn was like so flexible. He did
*  stuff with his body that like nobody could do his dick. The dexterity of his hips was just unbelievable.
*  Um, Dominic Cruz to me was incredible. His footwork is distance control. So when you talk about
*  like the goat, Royce Gracie, another one, he did things that I think for me is not number one.
*  Yeah, I got, I got to, and sorry to interrupt, the hoist is a fascinating one. I'd love to hear
*  what you think about him, but many people consider you, most people consider you to be the number one
*  greatest mixed martial arts fighter ever. So it's fascinating to remove you from that list
*  and continue this discussion and asking like, who do you think is the greatest fighter ever?
*  You listed some amazing ones. Royce, you somehow skipped Fedor. I'm very, as a Russian, I'm very
*  offended. No, I was, I was going to, there's so many Fedor is one as well. Fedor, I think in his
*  prime was like, when you say, when you talk about a name, for example, like, like, like, like, like
*  for example, like we talk about him when he was in his prime. Like when I talk, for example,
*  about Anderson Silva, I'm not talking about the Anderson Silva who fought his last fight
*  against Urey Yohal. I'm talking about the Anderson Silva who knocked out Victor Belfort. Yes. BJ Penn,
*  same thing. The problem is when fighters hang on for too long in the sport, that's what happened.
*  They kind of make, make people forget how good they were. And it's very sad. We talk about Fedor
*  and just, just think about Stipe Miocic. Miocic is probably the greatest heavyweight of all time.
*  With Fedor, I would really wonder who would have won this fight, the both guys in their prime.
*  I tend to lean towards Fedor because my heart was with Fedor, but he could have gone the other way.
*  But just because Miocic lose his last fight, now everybody's like, oh yeah, they forgot about him.
*  It's crazy, man. It's one fight. You zig when you should zag, boom. It's,
*  that's the reality of mixed martial arts. Well, that's why the thing is the mixed martial arts
*  isn't just the performance, the strictly who won and who lost. It's also the stories we tell ourselves.
*  And so, I mean, there's beautiful stories being weaved. And that also is part of who is the
*  greatest of all time is what were the battles, what had to be overcome, what was the flavor of
*  the flawless performances, you know, all of that plays into it. And you're right, being able to
*  walk away at the top is also part of that. A lot of people ask me about Khabib. And
*  that fight, I want it to happen. Khabib wanted to happen, but UFC did not want to happen
*  between you and Khabib. Yes. And we tried to make it like about three years ago when I retired.
*  No, it was after two years ago. And they never came to fruition. The UFC were clear. They said
*  they have other plan for Khabib. And it makes sense for the business standpoint because they
*  want to keep the ball rolling. Now Khabib retired. And like everybody else after Justin Gaethje,
*  I was doing the commentator in French for the UFC. And I had a butterfly. I thought he was going to
*  call me out. If there's one guy that I would have said yes, it would be him because for a fighter,
*  the most exciting things to do, it's often the scariest one. And Khabib was, you know,
*  scariest match up for you? Yes. He was worth the risk because nobody has ever been able to solve
*  them. How would you solve the Khabib, normally get him out of puzzle? Well, Khabib is very good
*  against defense. I would have to establish a game plan and everything, but I think what I would
*  need it to do is take the center of the octagon right away. Use a lot of think and faith. Keep the
*  fight all the way out or all the way in. And when I say all the way in is when you close the gap,
*  use my proactive and reactive takedown and perhaps my superior explosivity to put him down.
*  I like to use those proactive and reactive take down because for me, I feel it's more economical.
*  Khabib is a much better chain wrestler than me. Chain wrestler is when you get the guys to
*  defense, it's pure wrestling. What makes my takedown very efficient? It's my karate. It's not my
*  wrestling. I'm very good at timing my opponent and getting in with my explosivity. So if you watch
*  out my takedown, it does not demand often, it does not demand a lot of work. I call it proactive
*  takedown when he's coming to punch me and I react. Proactive is when I'm faking it. I instigate the
*  takedown by a fake, then I take him down. Reactive is when I'm baiting him to throw something, then
*  I'm going. It's a counter. Yeah. Yes. But all my takedowns- In the center of the octagon.
*  Yes. My takedowns are more in the center of the octagon. For example, another guy that does it
*  well is Gleason Tebow that did it well in his best days. Khabib has more of a style of chain
*  wrestling, I would say like Kamaru Usman, so to speak, kind of guy. It's a different style.
*  You cannot compare both styles. That's the kind of takedown I'm good. If I would have fight Khabib,
*  that's one of the strategies I would have. I would not have been afraid because everybody
*  that I fought, I was able to put them down. I have the pedigree to prove it in my fight resume.
*  So you would have perhaps seen him on his back and I would have perhaps been on my back as well. So
*  it would have been a very interesting fight. How hard do you think he is to take down? I mean,
*  a lot of people speak about his wrestling being just- It has nothing to do with the wrestling
*  because- It has to do with the karate. If I got the timing and I got my both hands around his knees,
*  he's going down the other way. Everybody goes down. Yes. Yes. He goes down. And I had a lot of-
*  That's what I would have done. I would not have been afraid of his wrestling.
*  I would have beat the instigator. I would have forced the fight forward. And that's how I would
*  have approached that fight, which I believe most of his opponent were afraid of his wrestling
*  because they didn't have the tools that I have to put him down. I would not have forced the wrestling.
*  In the clinch, I would have tried to disengage. I have many ways to disengage a clinch.
*  I would have wanted to force the fight in a fighting distance, like in a shoot box distance,
*  not in a wrestling distance. Is it possible this fight still happens?
*  I- You're young, look great in a suit. Well, there's a lot of problems now. And the thing is,
*  now I made peace with it. I no longer don't want to fight. And it's not going to happen. UFC
*  was not interested and I'm bound by contract with the UFC and by exclusivity. There are some people
*  who says to me, oh, how about if Russians are crazy, wealthy Russian guy come with the money.
*  I said, I'm going to be in court with UFC. And also I'm older now. And when I go home, man,
*  I'm like, I don't want to do this. You know, like, I don't want to do this. But like, for example,
*  I was training with Freddie Roach a few days ago and I'm hitting pads, you know,
*  and Freddie's looking at me and he's like, Hey, you have the hitch back. I'm like, yeah.
*  If Dana White would walk in the room in the gym at that precise moment with a UFC contract,
*  I would sign it, sign it in a blink of an eye. But when I go home, I'm like, hell no.
*  My belly is full. I'm healthy. I'm wealthy. Why would I want to fight for? I made peace with it.
*  But the minute I go back in the gym, because I still get it inside me when I train with the young
*  guys, I still get it. And a lot of guys think, hey, tell me the truth. You're preparing a comeback
*  because I still get it. You know, I'm a little bit older, but I got more knowledge. I can compensate.
*  I become a different animal because, you know, it changed you. But then after you go home and you,
*  you're like, man, no way I'm doing this. It's very hard to explain. You need to be a fighter
*  to understand that. It's very, very hard to explain. Well, from your perspective, I think
*  could be is one of the rare, one of the few fascinating scientific puzzles yet to be solved.
*  So from that aspect as a martial artist, it's just a fascinating journey to try to solve that puzzle.
*  There is a thing too, that we say, oh, who's the best fighter? People,
*  Lex, they don't like, I am this, I realized that later in my life. And I'm sure a lot of young guy
*  will say, oh, I said, if you're, it's not, don't speak for me, but I'm telling you right now,
*  what I'm about to say, you will realize it later. When I was young, I think you can proclaim
*  yourself the more, the bad ass man on the planet. You know, like nobody can beat you at,
*  it's an illusion, man. That's the sad thing about, for example, DC, Daniel Cormier,
*  that's probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest of all time. You said, but like,
*  it's almost because of that little matchup with John Jones, it's difficult for people to conceive
*  of him as the greatest of all time. It's all about matchup. It's all about timing. And also,
*  you make a fight, you make both guys fight 10 times. The result might be different, like,
*  like every time, you know, I mean, maybe he's going to win eight out of 10, but that night
*  he's going to lose. Why? Because we don't know, the universe made it like that. You know, maybe
*  he got sick, maybe he had the emotional issues, he didn't sleep well, and he makes him lose focus,
*  and he got caught. You don't, we don't know. But it's, it's, that's the thing with the people
*  ask me, would you have done it with Khabib? What would happen? I don't know. Maybe out of 10 time,
*  I don't know. Maybe as a fighter, I hope I would have won more than him. He thinks the opposite
*  is only one way to find out. But that night, if there is a fight, the guy that gonna win doesn't
*  mean he's the best fighter. That's mean that he's the one that fought the best the night of the
*  fight. Same thing in basketball or hockey. The team that wins the game, it's not necessarily
*  the best thing is the team that play the best that the night of the game and fighting is no
*  different. So being the baddest man on the planet, it's an illusion. I mean, that's the tragic thing
*  about it is on any one night, anything can happen. And that that tells a story for all of human
*  history is it's, it's sad, it's sad to think about, but that's what makes it beautiful that
*  there's so much at stake, like entire lives, all the dreams you've had growing up, all the hard
*  work, all of it is decided in a single night, even though that means nothing in terms of who's
*  actually better. It's I mean, that's the beauty. That's why people love the Olympics, especially
*  because it happens so rarely. And dreams are broken. Or like triumph is achieved by the unlikely
*  hero all like right there. I mean, that's why we love it. Right. That's why I love it.
*  If we would know always the result before it would be boring. That's why we do it. You know,
*  you watch the odds, you know, like, like sometimes I like to watch the odds before a fight, you know,
*  because, you know, there's things, you know, I believe in causality, you know, I believe in
*  everybody believe different things, but I believe everything is because there's a,
*  there's a cause to everything. That's personally what I believe. I don't believe that I have like
*  free will. I think I have the illusion of free will, but I believe there is a cause for everything.
*  And if I'm doing something because of something, because of a cause by definition, there's no free
*  will in a way. You know, if there's a cause by definition, there is not.
*  How does that make you feel by the way, like the idea that if we just look outside of even just
*  human psychology and fighting and so on, if we look at like physics, if everything is predetermined,
*  if all of these low molecules interacting, it's all already like your story is already written.
*  I mean, it depends. It's written, but I wouldn't need to know all the data and it's impossible.
*  Right. Like it's, it's, it's kind of weird. I got to say, but I don't, to me,
*  I don't see any argument to counter that idea. I, I, I, I can, I don't, maybe I'm, I'm ignorant,
*  but I haven't seen nobody and everything that I've read so far. There is nothing that countered that
*  idea that, that, that, because in a mechanical world, if your car broke or, you know, we don't
*  say, oh, the car decided to broke or a three, a tree's fall. There's reason why the tree is falling.
*  We don't say the tree is the site to fall. Right. So because us human being, I think it's our ego,
*  we decide, and I'm no different than anybody when I make a decision, I decided to this,
*  I choose to do this, but I'm aware that there is causes that make me do certain things.
*  And by definition, I think if there is a cause, there is no free will by definition. Right.
*  Yes. But the thing is, just like you said, we understand so little about human intelligence,
*  the human mind, and especially consciousness that the, this giant mystery, this darkness that we
*  don't understand how, how it, how it feels like to be something, to be a conscious being
*  that because of that, we're not able to really even reason about free will or not. Because
*  there might be some magic that comes from consciousness. The, you know, the, the
*  consciousness might be the thing that makes us different from a car that breaks down.
*  There might be something totally fascinating, totally undiscovered yet that will make us
*  realize that free will is actually real and somehow fundamental to the human experience.
*  So it's sometimes I think we forget when we talk about free will and physics and it all seeming to
*  be predetermined, we forget how little we actually understand about the world. And I think
*  in that mystery, that could be totally new ideas that are yet to be discovered and will make us
*  realize that it's not just an illusion. It is something that is like at the core of how the
*  universe works. Some people believe that consciousness is a fundamental property of the
*  universe. Like it's a, it's a one of the forces of physics, like consciousness permeates everything
*  it's in everything. Like this table is conscious, but it's not as conscious as us. And we're this
*  little peak of consciousness. And if that's true, and if we get to understand that, maybe there's
*  something, there's an extra bonus we get in terms of free will once you become one of those entities
*  that are super conscious. So I tend to be sort of humbled by the mystery of it.
*  Do you believe one day with the technology that keeps improving, we will make
*  robots that will be able to be somehow conscious?
*  Absolutely. I, that's been my dream. That's been, I hope, I hope to do just that. First of all,
*  I believe that all people are capable and want to be good to each other. And I think love is a,
*  is a really powerful thing that connects us and can create better and better worlds, sort of like
*  create better and better societies that improve both the technology, the quality of life, and just
*  the basics of human experience. And I think creating AI systems that are conscious, that are human-like
*  can enable us to be better to each other. Like they can, it's almost like adding more and more
*  kindness to the world through the systems we interact with will inspire us to be better and
*  better to each other. In terms of them being conscious, I think that is an absolute requirement
*  that entities we interact with communicate some element of consciousness to us. Like that's how
*  we connect to each other. The reason we, you and I connect is that we believe that each of us are
*  conscious. And to me, what consciousness means is the ability to hurt, ability to, to suffer,
*  to, to struggle in this world. Because just like you said, without the struggle, you don't have the
*  love, you don't have the pleasure. And ultimately consciousness is an entity's ability to struggle,
*  to suffer. And from that arises the pleasure. And us together being able to appreciate sort of,
*  appreciate the highs and experience together the lows. That's how we form deep connections.
*  I personally think we can create that in robots. And I personally believe it's a lot easier than,
*  than we think. Does it make you afraid sometimes about the fact that one day, hey, hi, like
*  intelligence, artificial intelligence could be, you know, could hurt us or, or, you know, like
*  because we're, you know, because of Hollywood, of course, you know, the movies we watch, but,
*  but it seems like when I hear sometimes Elon Musk talking, you know, like,
*  Yeah. So Elon talks about with AI, we're summoning the demon. He is very concerned.
*  And I talked to him about it quite a bit. He's very concerned about all the different ways AI could
*  hurt us humans. I tend to believe that there's a lot more ways in which AI can make our lives
*  better and can make life awesome for humans. I think humans are the ones that can do a lot of
*  evil things. So I'm less worried about AI. I'm more worried about humans.
*  If I look at what you may have done on, on the course of history, you know, for, for example,
*  in regards to the planet to the scale of the universe, I think what I'm afraid is that we
*  have more of a destructive force than a beneficial force. So if a high take that in consideration
*  in order to protect us against ourself, it could hurt us. And I don't know if you understand what
*  do you think about that? Does it makes you afraid sometime? Not because of AI, but because of what
*  humans are doing that AI could do to us to prevent us of hurting each or herself, you know?
*  Yeah, no, I mean, definitely it can bring out the worst in human nature and
*  provide tools for evil people to do evil things at a larger scale. But I just think
*  it depends what you think human beings are. I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent,
*  we, we start to see the value, the evolutionary value and the value in terms of happiness of
*  being good to each other. And I think AI, if you look at AI as an optimization problem,
*  of how to create a civilization that works well and expands throughout the universe,
*  I think love is much more effective. So AI will help us maximize that. I think there's going to be
*  always spikes throughout as it has been through human history, where charismatic leaders will do
*  evil onto the world in the name of good. You have the Stalin and the Hitlers and all of that. But
*  over time, I think technology will give the good, the good people power and the evil people less
*  power. Now there's a lot of ways in that, in the, that that won't be the case. There's a lot of ways
*  for it to go wrong. And Elon talks about them, but I honestly think in terms of intelligent AI,
*  that's going to bring more love to the world. The thing I'm concerned about is dumb AI. So
*  there's been a lot of discussion between China and the United States recently on autonomous weapons
*  system. This is something people don't, they're afraid to talk about, but there's now a race
*  where a United States has officially said that they're not against adding AI to the world.
*  They're not against adding AI to its weapons systems. So now the US military is adding
*  automation, adding intelligence to its drones, to its anything that can create damage. And so
*  of course, and they did this so in response to China doing that. So you can imagine this is,
*  this is Terminator. You think about Terminator as intelligent systems, they're not, they're pretty
*  dumb. The point is they're efficient at doing what they do. And in the space of war, efficient
*  at doing what you do means killing. So that I'm really afraid of, but those are dumb AI. Those
*  aren't your loving, deep, fulfilling relationships. That's like efficiently being able to fly,
*  to plan the trajectory of dropping bombs, of missiles, of how to do counterattacks,
*  of how to maximize the destruction of a particular facility instead of individuals.
*  And then that can just escalate. And as opposed to the cold war with the Soviet Union, this could be
*  a hot war. And then the consequences, once you allow, it's kind of terrifying. Because currently
*  the drones are operated by humans. So, you know, you have say you have information about,
*  intelligence gives you information about a particular terrorist located this area.
*  And then you use drones to maybe the automation there is to help you figure out what is the best
*  trajectory to strike at that location. So you still have a human that pulls the trigger at the end
*  of dropping the bomb. Now automation and AI and autonomous weapons systems might be where you say,
*  there's a bad guy over here. You figure out how to get rid of the bad guy. Okay. So then of course,
*  the systems will be very good at finding the right trajectory and so on. But there's bugs
*  that can happen, unexpected bugs that the system might figure out that there is this bad guy might
*  actually be in these other five locations. So Mike's might make sense to cover the entire area. Right.
*  And so you might drop bombs on the entire area. And then, you know, that's just okay. So that's
*  going to lead to a lot of destruction at the scale of a city. But then you can immediately
*  take that to nuclear weapons. If you add automation to responding to counterattacks to nuclear weapons,
*  somebody you might get information that somebody's planning a nuclear attack on the United States.
*  And the AI system will immediately respond. And, you know, it can respond at a scale of launching
*  nuclear weapons itself. And so there's all of these possibilities that don't require much intelligence.
*  And that's exceptionally, that's exceptionally concerning. I'm like you, I do not believe there
*  is babies that are born bad. I think people do bad things because of their experience. However,
*  if I look through my experience and from what I can see is some very often men's of power
*  wants more power. That's what makes me afraid with. Yeah, no, absolutely. I listen, I've been,
*  I've come from the Soviet Union. Stalin is arguably one of the most powerful humans in history.
*  He's not talked often enough about by the evils he's done. Hitler gets all the attention,
*  but Stalin has done arguably much more evil than Hitler. Yeah, well, this is human nature. It wants
*  power. We see that with institutions. We see that with governments and nations. I think you see this
*  with the internet. People are really hungry for the distribution of power. Like you see that people
*  are very much distrustful of centralized places of power, of institutions and so on. So I think
*  successful organizations, successful companies, successful governments will be run by people who
*  distribute the power. Like I don't trust myself with power at all. And I think you have to
*  build into the system that no one person can have power, that you distribute it. That's where you
*  have in the financial sector, you have cryptocurrency right now with Bitcoin and all those kinds of
*  things. People are exploring how can we avoid the central bank to have the control? How do you put
*  the power in the hands of people, thousands of people, millions of people? And same way with
*  with military, with any kind of with technology, I think the future looks very distributed.
*  What do you think about militarizing space?
*  The space force, I don't think about it often because right now I'm filled with excitement
*  about space exploration, which is the positive aspect. So Elon, I was born in an era where it
*  was exciting. I don't know about you, but for me it's exciting to look up to the stars and
*  dream about us humans colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets, expanding out to the galaxy,
*  into the universe. That's really exciting. So the possibilities there are endless.
*  Because also the resources are endless. And so I think we get into trouble with militarization,
*  with wars, when the resources are very constrained. So I think for a while we're not going to be
*  fighting. The only wars we'll be fighting in space are the ones that kind of help us.
*  Another nation to compete. Who goes to the moon first, I guess.
*  That's those kinds of things. Or maybe for satellites and all those kinds of communication,
*  and maybe in assistance for cyber warfare, which is also very dangerous. But in terms of
*  space, the wars out in space, I think everything out in space will be
*  positive and inspiring. It's very hard, but all good things are hard, I think.
*  This is where I've been talking to a bunch of people about extraterrestrial life. I'm really
*  excited by, I don't know, it's the other thing. When I look out to the stars, it's exciting to me.
*  I know I think you've spoken about it being scary. But to me, it's exciting that there's
*  intelligent creatures out there, far beyond perhaps the intelligence of our own, that
*  are just too far away to explore yet, but we might one day come in contact with them. So that to me
*  is the ultimate motivator, is to meet other intelligence life forms out there and connect
*  with them. Have you ever met Jacques Vallée?
*  No, but I've been in communication. I hope to talk to him. He's amazing.
*  He's French. I know that there are many theories about, if there's alien, we don't know. But
*  some people think it's from another star systems. Jacques Vallée, to make a long story short,
*  he has a different theory. He thinks it's perhaps beings that could be living in a different
*  dimension than us. And the reason why he says that is when he makes an experiment,
*  when there is a sighting, it's very often of a UFO. Let's say I'm the UFO, you have three guys.
*  They are looking at the UFO very often. One experiment that you can do, and sometimes
*  that is the case, you ask your two friends to walk on the side and there's a point that it's
*  like a corridor. You see the UFO and then you stop seeing it like a corridor. And
*  that's one of the reasons why he's saying that it's perhaps dimension. And I found that fascinating.
*  This is what, to the discussion of consciousness and all that, it feels like we might be just
*  experiencing a very particular slice of this universe. We might not be understanding what's
*  at the higher dimensions or higher dimensions in whatever form that means. There's all these
*  physical theories now that describe a world with dimensions that's much higher than the
*  three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time. So whatever the hell is going on in those
*  other dimensions, it could be something. Unfortunately, this is the sad part. It
*  might be something we can't even comprehend with our human brains, that the limitations are just,
*  I mean, we're just descendants of apes. So it might not be possible to even understand.
*  Is there alien? Is there another dimension? Are they human from the future? Is there perhaps
*  Chinese or another group of people that are working with technology far behind? But you know what,
*  Lex, I had the chance to meet, because of the sport I'm doing, I met a lot of people in military
*  and politics sometimes that I ask them every time. I met one this week and
*  I asked him, I said, is it true about the UFOs there? And he says to me,
*  even before I asked him, I said, sorry, I have to ask you a question. I was in Los Angeles.
*  And I said, sorry, I have to ask you a question. He said, oh, you want to ask me about UFOs? Right
*  away, you do. I said, yes. He saw it in your eyes. He said, yeah, there are things that
*  fly that we don't know. But he didn't tell me, they don't know if it's alien or whatever,
*  but there's things apparently that are detected. And I know you met Fravor.
*  Fravor is fascinating. It makes me sad that- We live in a different era now, that it used to be
*  subject that was ridicules. And now it's so cool that I'm very excited to live in that
*  era. Yeah, it's really exciting, but still the governments are kind of behind the times on that
*  aspect is they're not transparent and they don't communicate well. It saddens me to think the
*  possibility that the US government might be in possession of something that they don't tell the
*  world about because they're just scared. It's because they don't know what the hell it is
*  and they don't want the Chinese to gain the technology or all those kinds of things.
*  Do you think the president of the United States, for example, because the president comes and
*  goes every four or eight years, do you think he would know all the secrets or it would be a guy
*  like, for example, Vladimir Putin would know much of it? I don't think the president even knows all
*  the secrets. The US president. Yeah. I don't think so because they go back and forth every four
*  years. They have the terms, right? So I wasn't sure before, but I think I could trust the previous
*  United States president of Donald Trump that if he knew, he would probably tweet about it.
*  So I think from the, you know, I've worked with DARPA, I work with DOD, Clearance, and
*  I think from the perspective, if you see the world as fundamentally a dangerous world,
*  where secrets are important to have from a military perspective, I think it's very unsafe
*  to tell the president of the United States that you have this kind of technology. So if you think
*  of the world in that way, I hate that that's how that world is viewed because ultimately,
*  I think what's more powerful than the military secrets, and I hope that actually is what will
*  happen in the 21st century, is what's more powerful is to inspire people, inspire the young Elon Musks
*  of the world to create cool new things. If we have technology that we have come, have encountered,
*  that we don't understand, that should only be inspiration to develop that kind of stuff.
*  It shouldn't be seen as a military threat, as a secret to hold on to. I think secrets,
*  I hope we more and more let go of the idea that there are secrets that give us advantage.
*  You know, like in the tech sector, people are more and more releasing the software,
*  they're making it open source. Like secrets don't make sense. They share the knowledge, right?
*  Share the knowledge. Like being afraid to share the knowledge, I think, I hope, is an old idea.
*  It's more, yeah, when you make things more compartmentalized, you know?
*  Yes. Well, yeah, that's the other thing is the bureaucracy of government is like,
*  people only know their own little thing and they don't spread the information. It doesn't travel
*  well. I mean, there's a lot of just inefficiencies there. It makes me sad. It makes me sad because
*  the science, the engineering that happens in governments, like Lockheed Martin developing
*  the different airplanes that they use for military applications, it's some of the most incredible
*  engineering ever. And it's secret because they're afraid to share it with the Russians and the
*  Chinese and so on. But on that topic, I do think somebody like Vladimir Putin-
*  Would know.
*  Probably know some stuff.
*  My God, my God.
*  I would love to know what he knows. But then again, you never know because even he is,
*  people think of him as an exceptionally powerful person, but he's also just managing a bunch of
*  tribes. His power is very limited. He's trying to hold together a bunch of greedy, power hungry,
*  mad men. And he's trying to establish a balance. He might not know everything. So
*  I hope this changes because I think there's nothing more exciting about-
*  I don't even know if there is a human that knows. You know what I mean? Like this idea that
*  there are some alien civilizations that land on the White House and say,
*  Hi, I come to meet the president. And I'm like, why would they do that? You know what I mean?
*  It's kind of absurd.
*  Well, I do think that actually, I mean, that's one possibility, right? Is LART,
*  if an alien civilization really wanted to contact us, I think everybody would know.
*  So I think if there's any kind of interaction between humans and aliens, I think most likely
*  what we're interacting with is a crappy probe drone thing that kind of just like,
*  this dumb thing. We're not interacting with the aliens. I think just like for us,
*  I think humans aren't, when we venture out into space, the first thing that's going to meet
*  aliens is our robots. It's not us humans, because we keep sending robots out. So they're going to
*  make decisions about humans by looking at the robots.
*  I say the famous grays.
*  Maybe they are robots. Maybe it's all BS too, you know?
*  Yeah. So I don't know what that interaction actually would look like if aliens really
*  wanted to reach out, really communicate. And I don't know if we're able to actually
*  communicate with them. That's one of the sad things. We might not be able to,
*  the aliens might already be here and we might just not even know how to see them or know how
*  to communicate with them. There's so much misinformation and sometimes there is people
*  that are very credible that made crazy claims. You don't know what to believe. Like Paul Elyer,
*  the Minister of Defense of Canada said that there are many alien rays that ever... That's
*  what he said. Research it. And that scientist from, I think Israel recently have said something about
*  Trump. He was keeping secret or... You're from Russia. I've been caught during a break
*  in between interviews to talk about, it's like men in black, so to speak. I don't know.
*  He didn't look like he was joking, but I don't know if he was saying that.
*  I didn't know about this. That's interesting.
*  Yeah, you can check on YouTube. It went viral. Yeah, there's a lot of things like that sometimes.
*  I'm like, or Bob Lazar, I'm like, imagine if it's true, man.
*  Imagine if we're like a fish in the water, we live in our own world and sometimes there's a
*  fisherman that grabbed the fish, take him out of the water and throw it back in the water. And the
*  fish goes back to the other fish and is like, hey, there's someone that take me out of the water,
*  then I've seen things that I didn't know. Imagine if it's true. And one other thing,
*  I wanted to ask you because you were consciousness. How about dreams? What is a dream?
*  Well, I'm more and more, I don't know if you're paying attention to this. It's become more
*  acceptable in the scientific community to do large scale studies of psychedelics, for example. And
*  there's a lot of connection between psychedelics and dreams. And it's very similar states. There's
*  a lot our mind does when it detaches itself from reality, that it can just explore a lot of different
*  ideas. It's very possible that dreams is you're traveling somewhere. And the same thing with
*  psychedelics, you're traveling somewhere. I agree. Not traveling through physical space,
*  it's the other dimensions that we're talking about. You're traveling through some other dimension to
*  meet some other creature. People talk with DMT that they meet some elves. I've never done,
*  I'd like to. I don't know if there's a safe legal way to do it, but they all talk about meeting
*  elves and creatures like entities. Like who are they? What is this? Is it because they're high or
*  it's because they're actually meeting something and maybe there's no difference. I mean, that
*  who knows exactly. And that takes us right back to us not being able to really understand
*  how our mind works. I work in artificial intelligence. It's clear that we understand
*  so little about intelligence, some basic things about intelligence. Just at the very sort of basic
*  first principles level, we don't understand what it means to reason, to think, to assimilate
*  pieces of knowledge together from the basics to the complex. We don't understand it. We don't
*  understand how the human mind does it. We don't understand how the human mind is able to take
*  incredible waterfall of information and filter cleanly into just like clean. You only see the
*  things that are important and are able to stitch them together and be able to reason about the
*  world. And at the same time have moments of like genius, of creativity. Like what is that? That
*  also, writers talk about that. That they're almost like communicating with a muse. Like where do
*  ideas come from? This is the Joe Rogan philosophy. But I do know that past civilization, a lot of
*  them were based on shamanism. And you know what? I think it's sad is if someone drink alcohol
*  and when he's drunk he's going to commit like murders or something. We're going to blame the
*  person. We're going to say that's his fault. It's not the fault of alcohol. However, if someone does
*  psychedelic or any things that is illegal and he do something crazy, now we're going to
*  put the fault on psychedelic. And perhaps the person itself is the reason why he's been doing
*  these things. So yeah, it's fascinating how society, like in Canada they just legalized
*  marijuana. Marijuana is legal. But before that, before they did it, like if you talk for example
*  to my dad, my dad is against it. Because the whole mentality is like it's drug, it's bad,
*  but drinking a beer it's fine. I mean what is good, what is bad? And I guess eating chocolate
*  could be bad as well for your health. I mean I'm going to the extreme now, but what is good, what
*  is bad? If you use it for recreation, you use it for an experience, to learn about yourself.
*  It's like the line is very tiny. There's some countries that drugs are all
*  legal. You know what I mean? And I don't know the stats, but I would be interesting to know if
*  they have more crimes there than other countries where it's more strict. I would be interesting
*  to know about that. It fascinates me. Yeah, and I mean we humans kind of just come up with
*  arbitrary lines of what's good, what's bad. That applies with drugs, that applies with anything,
*  that applies with animals for example. We talked about carnivore diet.
*  Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered for the cruelty to animals for example. And I
*  believe the 21st century will be remembered for our cruelty to robots. That eventually
*  there will be a civil rights movement for robots. The ones who choose to be conscious, the ones who
*  have consciousness will say we deserve rights too. We deserve to be treated with respect too.
*  How about the people we put in jail? People put in jail. I mean I think in the future
*  we'll look back and we'll think of ourselves being stupid to put people in jail instead of
*  trying to fix the problem at the base. Of course now I guess it's our ignorance that made it in a
*  way that we cannot sometimes understand what makes sometimes a psychopath a psychopath or a
*  murderer a murderer. But if we can pinpoint the problem and take care of it before, you know what
*  I mean? Or made it in a way that we can reestablish that person in the society. Who knows what
*  was the future is all. It's interesting. We live in an interesting time. You mentioned your father.
*  What have you learned from your dad? You mentioned he was an important part of your childhood.
*  My dad is amazing. I grew up, we didn't have a lot of money but it doesn't mean if I'm born in
*  a nice country that always nice things happen. My dad for me is a big role model because I see him
*  through my life facing a lot of adversity. He stopped drinking when I was a teenager. He was
*  an alcoholic and I've seen him struggle through that. It was very, very hard and I've seen him
*  work like crazy hours, like come leave in the morning, come home at night, burned out because
*  of work through almost all his life to the point that it became a slave of the system.
*  Yes. He became an habit and a normal way of living and it made me realize that I've learned a lot
*  through my father. He taught me perseverance, hard work, when you face adversity to never give
*  up until you achieve it. But also he taught me a lesson that in a way that I don't want to be like
*  him, even if he is happy, it's because I realized I don't think he knows anything else. He works
*  through all his life and I don't want to live to work. I want to work for, you know what I mean?
*  I want to decide when I work. I feel like he lived to work instead of working for a living.
*  Perhaps it's because he did not have choice. He was the older of his family. They were nine kids.
*  His dad, my grandfather died when he was young, so he had to become the father of the family and
*  work to put money on the table. So perhaps that's what made him that way and he became like
*  an habit for him. My dad taught me when I was at school, I was bullied at school. He's the first
*  one who initiated me to martial art. He taught me karate. My dad was a black belt in Kyoko-shin
*  karate as well, but because he was working too much, he didn't have time to teach me and I needed
*  self-defense in order to defend myself. I have a winning a great carer in mixed martial art,
*  but in the school yard, my record is not very good. When you're a kid and you're about seven,
*  eight years old and you're facing bullies that are two to three years older than yourself,
*  it's not the same thing than when you're 25 and the guy is 28. So there is a big
*  discrepancy in terms of maturity. So my dad introduced me to karate. He didn't have time
*  to teach me. Then he put me in a school with a teacher. It was Jean Couture. I grew up with a
*  lot of anger and there were two persons I was afraid of growing up. It was my dad. My dad was
*  very severe, very strict with me. I'm glad he was because I could have become very bad. I could have
*  become a different path. People see me as a nice guy and I am a nice guy. I try to be a good role
*  model, but I could easily have turned towards a wrong path. There's darkness somewhere in there.
*  Yes, there are a lot. A lot of my friends have chosen that path and unfortunately,
*  they are not with me today. Even if I'm from Canada and Canada seems like the nicest country
*  in the world. Like I said, even if you live in a nice country, it's not always a nice thing. It
*  depends on the situation. But that's what my dad taught me. He gave me that because I'm very good
*  at learning by observing people and by observing him. I see the struggle he had with alcoholism
*  and what he did, the pain sometimes that he inflicted to us, to my family. But how he
*  turned, he did that 180 degree and I really admire that. I know it was very, very hard for him and he
*  did it. For me, that's a great role model for me. With your dad being an engine of basically hard
*  work and you finding a balance of being able to work your ass off, but also to be able to enjoy a
*  piece of chocolate. What is a perfect day in the life of George St. Pierre look like? So like,
*  if you were to go through a day that's very productive, but also one that makes you sit
*  back and enjoy and say that was a good day, what's that look like? What are we talking about? When do
*  you wake up? What do you eat? What do you do? It changed over the years. When I was younger,
*  I had a good day. It was like a good training session or achieving a good thing in my training.
*  That's why I was very good at it because I was obsessed. I think to be good at something,
*  you need to become obsessed. To me, performing in my training was everything. When I had a bad
*  training session, I didn't tell my training partner. I was acting like because of my ego,
*  I didn't tell nobody. I was like, hey, then I go in the locker room and I'm like, man. Then I'm
*  playing the training in my mind and I'm saying, okay, I should have done this, should have done
*  and it haunts me. It haunts me, man. It's a training and it haunts me until the next training
*  session when I can redeem myself. That's how it is. When we used to train all together back in a
*  day, in Canada, we had David Loiseau, we had Patrick Côté, we had Dennis Kang, Steve Vigneault,
*  Jonathan Goulet. They were all like the best guys in Canada that were training with each other.
*  Before, we were training in different gyms, but once a week, I made it in a way that I
*  contact everybody that we all join forces and we exchange ideas and we train with each other.
*  I would say friendly competition. It was not malicious, but it was hard training.
*  Our goal was to improve, but it wasn't very competitive. When that day you used to get out
*  of the training session with a bad performance for me, it used to haunt me until the following week
*  when I could give it back and perform better with the guy that I had the most trouble with.
*  That's how it was. That's how you get better. It was not a training where we were trying to do
*  malicious things to one another. You need to be playful, but playful but competitive.
*  That when I had a good training session because of sparring was on a Friday,
*  I had the best weekend in the world. I was going out with my friends, drinking and partying and
*  having fun. That was my ideal day back in the day. Today has changed. My life has changed.
*  I am not the same person I used to be when I went on my knees and begged the UFC for a title shot.
*  I'm wealthy. I'm healthy, most importantly. That's the most important thing.
*  And as good as my career was, my private life is a million times better.
*  People ask me sometimes. They always wonder. They try to ask me. It's normal. A lot of people are
*  curious and they're the reporter. In the sport of mixed martial arts, we say we play basketball,
*  we play soccer, but we don't play fighting. When you expose your private life, we've seen that
*  happen in the fight with sometimes Conor McGregor and Khabib. Your competitor knows that he cannot
*  get to you, so what he will do is he will try to get to someone that you love. I never expose
*  my private life. I never post Instagram of my family or my stuff. That's the reason why.
*  I'm in the business of fighting and people know that they cannot get to me.
*  I believe that because I was bullied when I was young, I didn't realize that when I was young,
*  but it helps me deal with the mental warfare that I had to face later on in my life in mixed
*  martial arts because it's a very ego-tastic sport and there's a lot of intimidation.
*  I was used to this thing when I was young, so it does not get to me. However, the good way to get
*  to me is to go try to get to someone I love. Now, man, I'm going to go crazy. You know what I mean?
*  I'm aware of that. In order to protect myself, I always, because I'm aware I'm a public person,
*  so I try to always keep my surroundings in the private.
*  One of the ways that your friend, mine, Joe Rogan, has been an inspiration, he's got an
*  incredible family. He, for the most part, it started to change recently, actually it's kind
*  of interesting, but for the most part throughout his life, he kept it pretty secret. He doesn't
*  talk about it in his commas. He's a comedian. Comedians talk about everything. He doesn't
*  really talk about it. There's something to that. It preserves the magic of the silence of the
*  private life. I think it can affect the development of the kid if the kid grew up being, oh, he's the
*  son of that guy instead of being his own person. You know what I mean? So for me, it's very
*  important. My parents are older, it's fine, but it taught me a big lesson. When I'm with my friend
*  at the dinner or anything, I talk with the person, always share a thing, but when I'm talking,
*  I'm aware of the audience where I'm in front. Yeah, but oftentimes those people are just
*  incredible. It kind of makes me sad that there's a lot of people that love you, right? And there
*  are a lot of really incredible people and you'll never get to really know their story. I mean,
*  I don't know. For me, it makes me sad. You see them at airports and stuff. People will tell me
*  they listen to this podcast or something like that. I could tell they're incredible people.
*  And it's like a little goodbye of a possible friend. I don't know. It makes me sad. It's lonely.
*  It's almost like celebrity is a lonely thing. So the higher the celebrity, the more lonely you become
*  in some kind of way. But of course you have that little gem of a private life where you can...
*  Personally, I believe every relationship, I don't like to use this term, but it's always a give and
*  take relationship. You can gain something and the person... It could be something not materialistic,
*  something like, oh, he's a good, confident... Someone that can give me good advice.
*  It's a word I would say, like, extensional. If a pilot has a copilot, the copilot has an
*  extensional relationship with him. So he knows if he gets sick or he faint, he's there to make sure...
*  He's there to help. And I think in every relation, it's about compatibility, but it's about
*  extensionality in a way that if that person is extensional... And sometimes we talk about love.
*  Sometimes I think, is it a BS word or not? Because I myself sometimes look at myself in the mirror
*  and when I do stupid thing, sometimes I love myself a lot and sometimes I don't.
*  Because I'm angry at myself. I've done stupid thing. So that means sometimes you could
*  love could be fluctuating. You know what I mean? How about in relationship? Sometimes people,
*  they say, oh, they love each other. But then when they divorce, they go, oh, I want the house and
*  the dog and the kids stay with me. And you know what I mean? If you love... By definition, if you
*  really love someone and let's say you're an old man and you love a woman and she decide to leave
*  you for a younger man, if you really love her, you're going to help her pack and leave. But in our
*  society, sometimes we want to hone something. To me, love includes the missing somebody,
*  the losing somebody, the anger at somebody. It's all the passion, feelings towards somebody.
*  That's all love. It's all part of the thing. It's the ups and downs. The sad thing is when
*  the feelings towards a person, the ups and downs go away, the forgetting. That's the opposite of
*  love. So the opposite of love isn't hate. To me, the opposite of love is forgetting.
*  And that's a much bigger... The depth of human connection. That's how I see love.
*  Sometimes I try to stay positive and I've been asked how I try to... Because I have the image of
*  someone who's positive, but I go through my own demon as well sometimes. However,
*  we talk about love. When I was young, I didn't love who I was at first. That's how I love. I
*  learned to kind of love myself. When I was going through bullying, I believe I was bullied because
*  I didn't love myself. Because I project a very bad image of what I think of myself. I was a kid that
*  lacked a lot of confidence. I was looking down when I was walking. I shrugged my shoulder.
*  When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact. So I was a very easy target for bullies.
*  And I think bullies are like predatory animal in nature. They will hunt the easier prey.
*  The lion don't go for the alpha bull. They go for the one who's old or who's sick, the weakest one.
*  Bullies are the same in society, I believe. I didn't like to be bullied, of course, but I didn't
*  like the person that I was. But I found out through martial art, the respect. My coach was
*  extraordinary to me. He taught me discipline and self-strength. I found out that I needed to,
*  in order to love myself, I needed to change myself. Because when I looked at myself in the
*  mirror, I didn't like what I saw. So I decided to become like someone that I would love. So I tried
*  to look people straight up and trying to showcase a more confident image that I had. And it was hard
*  in the beginning because I didn't really believe in it, but I faked it until I kind of made it.
*  So when I was walking at school, more and more I was learning how to become more confident.
*  And I was taking charge. When the teacher was asking questions, at first I was never
*  answering. I was like this, waiting always to be the last. Then I was, hey, I know the answer.
*  This is the answer. I got out of my comfort zone, so to speak. And I wish I would tell you that I
*  got out of bullying because a Hollywood story, I used martial art to beat up all the bullies.
*  But it's not how it happened to me. It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.
*  And I learned how to, because I didn't love myself in the beginning, I learned how to become like
*  someone that I love. And even now, like I'm by no mean perfect. I do a lot of stupid things,
*  but I learn as a person. And even I do have something stupid, I'm like, shoot, I did something
*  stupid. At least I can apologize to the person if I realize. And then I know that I'm not the
*  person I was in the past. I'm the person that I am right now. So I can learn and become that image
*  of the person that I love. So in a way, the reason I'm trying to be positive and I'm able to stay
*  positive sometime in life is because I'm always trying to be like that person that I love.
*  And I think if you don't look yourself in the mirror and don't love yourself or don't see any
*  positive future for yourself, how can you change your environment if you cannot change yourself?
*  You know what I mean? You will never be happy if you're not happy when you look at yourself in the
*  mirror. So change yourself first, then change your, you know, it's not the environment that
*  gonna change for yourself. You have to go from the inside out, you know?
*  This I learned through martial art. I had a coach who was incredible. He used to drill these ideas
*  in my head and give me confidence, you know, like this telling me all these beautiful things about
*  myself and how he's dead now, unfortunately, peace to him. But he was incredible, incredible.
*  He was very, very strict. I was afraid of him. I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him.
*  He couldn't teach nowadays like he used to teach me because he would be probably in jail, you know?
*  But I'm glad he did it because for that time being, that's what I needed. And I would never
*  have had that career I had in mixed martial art without this because I would never have got out of
*  my comfort zone. It would have been impossible. And in order to improve in life, you need to get
*  out of your comfort zone. It's hard. It's very hard to do. And strive to be the person that you
*  can love. That's beautifully put, George. If you were to give advice to a young person today about
*  life, what would you tell them? If he takes life with the same mentality that I do, if he has the
*  same taste of things that I have, I would tell him, you know, for sport, for life in general,
*  I would say if you will have a dream, you know, like make everything in your power and work very
*  hard, you know, never take no for an answer and go through hell in order to achieve it.
*  Don't work hard only, but work smart. That's, I think, the problems with a lot of people. They
*  work hard. They can work hard. They burden themselves. They don't work smart. Whether it is
*  in science and business, they make bad choices or they're badly informed. In sport, how many guys
*  I've seen ruin their career in the gym? They spar so hard, they ruin themselves in the gyms. They
*  leave their career in the gyms. What I would say to, for example, because my field of expertise
*  is in sport of mixed martial art, I would say to a young kid, make your training playful.
*  When you get ready for competition, you need to try to recreate those
*  elements that make you go outside of your comfort zone. But in everyday life in general,
*  make your training playful. Don't make it like a hardcore competition about who's winning,
*  who's losing. Make it playful so it will increase your, because you will not be afraid of
*  getting hurt or losing. You will be tempted to try more things and it will make you become more
*  creative. That brings up another question about learning. You value knowledge and you're
*  exceptional at basically being very good at learning and figuring stuff out. New things
*  or going deeper on the things you already know. What advice would you have for how to learn
*  effectively? How you say work smart. How do you figure this game out?
*  I believe the best way to learn is learning from other people's mistakes.
*  However, I'm not perfect and I've learned from my mistakes as well. Sometimes it took me a few
*  mistakes to learn the same thing. But especially in the sport of mixed martial art, because we're
*  talking about the failure could have very serious outcome on someone's life and well-being.
*  It's crucial to try to learn from other people's mistakes.
*  Do you study others?
*  Do you study every fight? I'm studying my opponent and I've studied myself as well to know
*  what, how my strength mix versus my opponent weaknesses. How can I make the fight
*  go in a way that I'm taking my opponent outside of his comfort zone?
*  Very often people are good at studying their opponent, but they're not good at looking at
*  themselves in the mirror and knowing what they should do in order to maximize their
*  odds of success. That's why I always thought for me it was important to not be the best at one thing
*  but be very good at everything. That's why I always seek advice from the best in every discipline.
*  I wrestled with the best wrestler I could be with. I boxed with the best boxers. I
*  practiced karate with the best karate fighters. Same thing in Jiu-Jitsu. I trained Jiu-Jitsu
*  with the best Jiu-Jitsu guys. However, when I mix everything and mixed martial art,
*  because I'm very competent in every area, so when I'm fighting someone,
*  I'm very good at identifying where he's the less competent. I know for a fact that because I'm
*  competent everywhere, if I can bring the fight where he's outside of his comfort zone,
*  it increases my odds of winning. There is no certainty. It's all about odds, I believe,
*  because there is always an X factor that you do not control.
*  Yeah, it's fascinating to see you actually because you've been a student of movement.
*  You've been exploring all kinds of gymnastics, all that kind of stuff. There's something reminiscent
*  to like Conor McGregor is one other martial artist that's kind of explored movement,
*  been a scholar of movement. At least from my perspective, it's very sort of Bruce Lee-like.
*  It's almost making a study of the human body and all the possible things you can do. Is there a
*  philosophy behind that that you have? You talk about the human body.
*  You talk about Bruce Lee, man. He changes my life too. He was ahead of his time.
*  Yeah, incredible.
*  A lot of people talk to me and ask me, Bruce Lee would have been able to fight in UFC.
*  I don't think so. I don't know. I think he was a martial artist. He could have
*  defended himself, but to say that he could have competed amongst the elite, of the elite,
*  of the elite fighter perhaps in his time. But for sure, if you put him in UFC right now,
*  the sport has improved incredibly since then. But in terms of philosophy,
*  Bruce Lee was amazing. One thing that just to prove that he was ahead of his time,
*  he was talking about using your longest weapon against your opponent's nearest point.
*  And we see that kick that got popularized by John Jones, the sidekick to the tie.
*  Longest weapon against your nearest point. In boxing is the jab, but in MMA,
*  when you can use all your weapon, that's the kick to the tie.
*  I feel there is kind of three dimensions in martial art. There is the philosopher,
*  Bruce Lee. There is the choreographed people. For example, you see in movies, the stunt people,
*  they're incredible. Or the one that does the forms and karate, jumping, spin kick,
*  back kick, acrobatic stuff, mixed martial art, they are unbelievable. And there is also the
*  one that competes in fighting. That's what I do. I personally specialize in.
*  Well, you also do the philosophy. I do a little bit of philosophy, but that's
*  a consequence of the fighting. I guess we all practice the three dimensions because
*  martial art, I would say whether you want it or not, you have to touch these three dimensions.
*  But you will specialize in one. I specialize through my life in fighting, the real thing in
*  terms of fighting competition. Of course, if you do martial art, you will be able to defend yourself
*  because it's a self-defense. However, you might not be able to fight as an elite in the most
*  prestigious organization. And you might not be able to perform the stunt that, for example,
*  the stuntmen have done in the series I was playing in the Falcon and Winter Soldier.
*  These guys are incredible. They're like real life superhero things they do. To me,
*  it's fascinating. It's amazing. And also Bruce Lee, the philosopher. How many hours he took
*  thinking about these stuff? I'm sure he did not just came out of nowhere. He was thinking. That's
*  mean he slept on this. How many hours? It's just unbelievable. He's like water, my friend. How many
*  times has he thought about water going to bed before he said that? Let me ask a very important
*  fundamental question about martial arts. We're both wearing a suit and tie. Joe Rogan thinks
*  that wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage. Is it a clip-on or is it an actual tie? It's an actual tie.
*  So do you agree or disagree with Joe Rogan that wearing a tie is a martial art's significant
*  disadvantage in terms of combat in a combat scenario? In a fight, I think it would be a
*  disadvantage. Yes. Okay. I work as a security bouncer in nightclubs and event when I was 18
*  years old. Yes. And sometimes I had to work in certain event that I was in suit and tie.
*  I never had to use my force to take someone out when I was in suit and tie. But if I would have
*  had to before going to the table to physically take the guy out, I would have removed my tie.
*  And I would have removed my vest for sure. And I would have called backup for sure. And I would
*  have probably used the element of surprise to be first on the guy. Yes. When you're in a bar,
*  same thing. You call backup first and you make sure you ask the waitress before to clean the
*  table before you go. And when you go, you have to use the element of surprise. Because fighting
*  in mixed martial arts and fighting in the street, it's two different things. And yes, I'm a mixed
*  martial art competitor. That's what I've done all my life. But I had a lot of street fight in my life,
*  a lot when I was in. What's the difference? What's like? Oh my God, it's a huge difference.
*  There is guys that if I would have a choice to fight, like for example, certain guys in UFC in
*  a street fight and fight like other guys that are not in UFC, I would maybe sometimes pick guys that
*  are not in UFC, not necessarily. Because in the street fight, there's no referee that says go.
*  It's the element of surprise. And when you're a nice guy, you're not the aggressor.
*  You always have the element of surprise. That's what it taught me. Oh, interesting. Yes, because
*  if aggression, your sacrifice will not come punch you without warning. It needs to, it needs to
*  trigger some, it's something that needs to be triggered before. So if someone comes because
*  he's looking for trouble, there is sign that he's looking for trouble. So I was just talking with
*  Fast Ruth this weekend about it. And I saw that every, every martial art comes from like some
*  martial art are from exclusive week for competition. Like sport karate, like certain martial art,
*  but traditional martial martial art are for the street are for self-defense. And I start my
*  background in Kyokushin karate. So it's for, and I did Japanese Jiu Jitsu. So my background before
*  I even start training for mixed martial art, my background is in self-defense.
*  And it's very important to understand that in a street fight, the element of surprise is everything
*  and there are no rules. You can go for the eyes, the neck, the, the, it's surprises. So
*  ball game, you know what I mean? You have the chair, the beard, there's so much more thing going on.
*  So the idea of, because you are a UFC fighter, you think you're invincible. This is BS.
*  Anybody can come, like if, if a big guy who punched very hard, most people don't know how
*  to punch, by the way, they don't know how to make a fist and throw it in a forward direction. But if
*  someone knows how to do it, I don't care who you are. If you could be Francis and Genu, someone
*  come behind your head and whang or there's an argument and you get surprised by a punch.
*  You can beat drop and lose a fight. That doesn't matter. The element of surprise is everything.
*  So you were saying remove all the sources of the elements of surprise, all the clear the bar,
*  remove the tie. I still disagree with you about the tab.
*  Just for your information, if someone comes looking for trouble and you see me do this
*  and going sideways, that's my position that I'm thinking, maybe something will happen and I'm
*  about, I'm about thinking about doing the element. I'm about to punch you or to do something to take
*  care of this. See, to flip the table on you then, wearing a tie is communicating the nice guy image.
*  So it actually gives you the freedom for more elements of surprise by wearing the tie. If you
*  take it off, that's more, you're limiting your options because nobody's going to expect the guy
*  in the tie to do anything. I'm a big believer that sometimes it's not only materialism,
*  it's what you project. That's true. Like say I had troubles in a bar and I was able to deflect,
*  the guy was looking for trouble talking to me and I was able to deflect his whole
*  aggressivity by saying like, hey man, that's a nice shirt. Where did you get it?
*  Like saying like something or stupid like this. Then it kind of break, break the momentum and he,
*  but the guy was looking for trouble. I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight you,
*  but I'm not going to wait until you pull, you make the first move because the first,
*  the minute you touch me, you push me or you touch me, you declare war and the war is unleashed,
*  my friend. And I'm taking you out of order with the necessary force. Of course, you know what I mean?
*  That's the thing with martial art. If you use the necessary force to take out a problem,
*  it's okay. But if you, you know, you take advantage of it, that's when it's not all right
*  because it's a weapon. So if someone comes up to me, that's my position and now I'm,
*  I'm assessing the situation, you know, that's, that's how they teach in self-defense here.
*  Never put your hands down. Always hand there because I'm boom or boom. Like, like what, what
*  this is, this is very important and you never, you always, your center line on the side. Yeah,
*  like this. If someone knows martial art, it will recognize that pattern. But if you go like,
*  if someone talked to you and you go like this, that's mean you're telling the guy that you
*  want to fight. You don't want to do that. You don't want to, oh yeah. Um, that's that, that's, that's
*  you know, that's, that's the position because your hands are here, you know, whatever you can do,
*  you're here. Well, also your ear tells a story. It's not everybody that knows that. However,
*  some people might think that it's my mom grabbed me by the ear and pulled me because I didn't
*  listen to her. You know, a real fight in the street and a fight in the, in mixed martial
*  is a different ball game. What do you think is the best martial art to prepare you for street
*  fighting? You know, people often kind of have this discussion of jiu-jitsu, maybe boxing, maybe
*  wrestling. Do you think we talk about a young person studying martial arts to prepare themselves
*  for a street fight? It's often much different than a mixed martial art fight.
*  And I know there is a lot of BS in the world of martial art, like self-defense stuff that like, but
*  I believe self-defense is very important in a way to understand the situation, to understand those
*  situations that might occur, how to deal with it. Because not necessarily that we talk about the
*  technicality, we talk about the tactically, the tactics, you know, like when I'm talking to you
*  about the element of surprise is important. This is not technique. A technique is a punch or
*  techniques that I physically will use to enable my opponent, my aggressor.
*  Tactics is the tactic I'm telling you about is in a street fight. If someone is looking for trouble
*  and I feel the heat rising as the conversation goes, that's the position I'm going to take. And
*  I have to be first. I cannot let him go first. So I have to strike first or do something. This is
*  the first thing that generally I have to agree on. And I think that's the first thing that I
*  to agree on. After that, of course, there's the knowledge. If you're a professional fighter,
*  you have a huge advantage once the fight is started, the war is declared. Now everything goes.
*  But generally speaking, the person that will intervene physically, that will have the first
*  blow or the first punch will have a huge advantage. It's like doing a 100-meter raise and having a
*  head start. And that you can't prepare for with any martial arts. Yeah. And if I'm a smart guy,
*  I know how to fight. If a guy like an heavyweight champion comes to me, I know what to do to
*  disable him. Like boom or here or the neck. And if you blind him, what is he going to do?
*  You know what I mean? So the element of surprise is everything. So that's why it's always
*  good to be the nice guy and not looking for trouble. Because if you're not looking for trouble,
*  you have the head start. You have the option of having an head start.
*  So what you're saying is being a nice guy is the best form of self-defense, maybe a little humor.
*  You know, I have learned that. I've learned that when I was a kid. I was about
*  maybe seven, six years old. We used to play in Montreal. There's a lot of snow. We used to
*  play king of the mountain. That's the first combat lesson that I've learned in my life.
*  And I managed somehow. It was a lot of kids. I managed to get on the top of the mountain.
*  And another guy came in on top of the mountain and he was angry that I was there before him.
*  When you play king of the mountain, it was a mountain of snow. You don't strike each other
*  with just wrestle and push. And I managed to be first. And when he came, he says to me,
*  okay, you want to fight? And I said, yeah. I didn't know what he mean. Like I want to fight,
*  want to wrestle. I say yes. He punched me right in the face. Boom. And then I fall on the bottom
*  of the mountain. Then when I fall down, I remember that vision in my life because I
*  really remember that for the rest of my life. I'm about to stand up and I see the blood coming
*  out of my nose. I see the snow is red because my nose is bleeding. Now I remember the limit of
*  surprises, everything. My first street fight, I lost it. I got knocked out, but I got dropped
*  on the bottom of the snow mountain. And I was like, ah, he got me because I was not expecting it.
*  My hand, I was not expecting a punch. So from there, when I felt the heat during an argument
*  or something was not right, I always stroke first. I didn't win all my fight because sometimes there
*  were more than one guys on me, you know? But I think it's important to not be the aggressor. So
*  you have the element of surprise and always use that in your favor. That's so brilliant.
*  Let me go from the very practical to the most impractically huge question about the meaning of
*  life. You said that when great depths of unrelenting sorrow are punctuated by great peaks of joy and
*  liberation, the result is delicious. So what do you think is the meaning of this whole
*  journey that we're on, this life? What makes life delicious?
*  To me, you know, satisfaction is the end for me. Like, I always, if I'm satisfied, that means I
*  have nothing to live for. I'm not talking only about my career, I'm talking about my life. What
*  do you want in your life? You want kids, you want a family, you want to be champion. What do you want
*  in your life? You have like a long-term goal, short-term goal.
*  In mixed martial art, I achieve what I needed to achieve. I'm satisfied. I'm no longer the same
*  Georges St-Pierre than when I was begging for a title shot on my knees. I move on from it.
*  Now I had a chance to go into movies. Now that same insane, that same insane drive that I had to be
*  the champion in the world, now I put it into acting. Like I'm having a lot of acting class now and
*  luckily for me, the timing was amazing. I got cast for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier,
*  cast for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier that is on Disney Plus channel. It's a huge, huge
*  project to be part of for me because it's like you play basketball, you have a chance to go for the
*  NBA right away. I was very lucky. The timing was just too perfect. And so you need to constantly
*  challenging yourself and having goals to achieve. Keep your brain activated, keep working.
*  And the proof of that is that you see sometimes some old people,
*  like when they retire very often, sometimes you see that they got sick and they die or because
*  they... It's either because sometimes we think we
*  will do something good for them by making that work and giving them a break. So in our mind,
*  we're like, oh, he's going to be able to relax. But in their mind, it's not good because they're
*  not busy. They have nothing to live for. Like my dad is used to work all the time and he has always
*  something to do. He's retired now. I myself now call him by force to find him some job. Hey, dad,
*  can you come in my house? I have this thing to repair. I don't know how to do it. So it gives him
*  a reason not to live because he has other things to do. But what I mean is also in life, I think
*  you always don't be afraid to aim high. Don't be afraid to fix your objective very high.
*  And never be able to reach it. Be afraid of reaching your goals, essentially. I mean,
*  you always have to keep moving it out. You think there's a... It's an interesting question because
*  you've been acting in some really exciting things. Do you think there's a dramatic role where it's
*  basically, you go full Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. Do you think there'll be a full length
*  feature film with D'Or St. Pierre? Like there's a level to this thing. I'm aware that I have to
*  restart as a white belt. And for some people, it could be discouraging. But for me, man, it's great.
*  I love it. I freaking love it. I embrace it because everybody told me I would never be able to do it
*  and it's fine. And also the outcome of a failure in the sport of mixed martial art is much more
*  serious than the outcome of a failure for a movie, for example. If you zig when you should
*  zag in a fight, you get knocked out. If you zig when you should zag and unset, oh, cut, we'll do it again.
*  And I know that I will be most likely be choosing for action martial art roles because that's my
*  background. There is this new trend in Hollywood now when they want someone to play an Italian guy,
*  they're going to choose a real Italian person. When they want someone to play a Russian guy,
*  they're going to choose someone who has a real Russian background. Now they want a real martial
*  art fighter. I've done fighting all my life. I just need to improve my acting skill. But when
*  I train in acting, I get myself out of my comfort zone. I'm not playing a role of a martial art guy.
*  I'm playing like romance, comedy, drama. So when I go on set and playing
*  the role of a badass martial art guy, it's easier. So like in training for a fight, I always make my
*  preparation harder than the actual task. I would love to see where, I don't know if you've seen
*  The Wrestler with Mickey Rourke. Oh, yeah. Those types of films. I would love to
*  you do something like that. If not now, then in 10, 20 years, I could see that. That would be
*  amazing. There's levels to the game, right? Yes, it's gradual. And I'm aware that I don't want to
*  take something on my shoulder that I won't be able to deliver. It's like a fighter wants to go for a
*  title shot right away. It could very well break him. And I don't want to do that because I know
*  I've done some gigs in the past, but I was not focusing on it because I was focusing on competing
*  as a martial art. Martial art is in competition in MMA. But now I take it very seriously. So I
*  cannot do the same mistake again because I've done some stuff. I've done it for the money and it was
*  good. It was fun to be beat up by Jacques-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and everything. But my
*  acting was not on point at that time. So every time I'm going to come back from now on on screen,
*  you need to be sharp because you cannot mess it up. If you mess it up, it's like a loss on your
*  record. You're not taken seriously. So that's how I see it. And it's very fun because I had a chance
*  to talk to a lot of guys. And on top of all the class that I'm having, a few days ago, I was with
*  Danny Trujo. And I always seek the advice of actors when I see some of them because I really
*  admire how they do, how they project their emotion. And I asked him, Danny Trujo, I said to him,
*  he's an amazing guy, by the way, very nice guy. And I asked him, I say, how do you do to be,
*  because you scare the hell out of me, how do you do to be so scary? Like what is your trick?
*  And he tells me, he's like, George, if you threaten things, if you threat someone
*  and you scream at him, I'm gonna kill you. It's not as scary if you're smiling and you say,
*  I'm gonna kill you. Like, and he says also to me that another advice he gave me is like,
*  when you say this, think about you killing him for real, that how you hate him and how you're
*  gonna kill him. So the camera will take the emotion out. Don't try physically to do that.
*  That's the mistake I used to do before. I used to physically show that I'm strong and angry and to
*  be mean. So these are just an example of tricks that I learned sometimes when I met an actor.
*  I always try to learn from everybody that I met in my life. It's a difficult journey because then
*  you have to go to some dark places as a person because you really have to imagine some dark
*  things. It's fascinating actually. I think a lot of the actors, they have
*  sometimes problems because of that. Because now I understand why it's like,
*  if you work on your bicep, your bicep will grow, right? Because it's the stress that you put on it
*  that will make it grow, right? Emotions, I believe, are the same way. If you're used to
*  dig inside of you down deep to make your negative emotion, depressive emotion comes out,
*  if something bad in your life happens, you will fall into those emotions much more rapidly than
*  someone who does not that every day. You know what I mean? Because it's like a muscle memory. If you
*  program yourself to react a certain way, you will reach that point very often. So that's why
*  sometimes you see some guys, we often blame it on drugs, but I think it's also because of the
*  acting. They're used to be so on the hop top and sometimes they go to the down deep so they're
*  both extreme, you know? You got to be psychologically tough and that's life. I'm so
*  excited to see you challenge yourself in that direction. That's one thing that I'm a little bit
*  afraid that happened to me. I really hope I'll always be having a problem to control my emotion,
*  be too much extreme. I hope it does not happen to me. And if I feel that I'm going towards that,
*  I'm going to give up on my new objective and find something else to achieve.
*  But in your personal life, you want to be real with your emotions. You don't want to,
*  it doesn't, you know, just like with biceps, you don't want biceps that are too big.
*  You are real, but you are extreme real. And that's what I think sometimes could happen to actors
*  sometimes when they go too much into their emotion. Like we talk about like sometimes guys that
*  commit suicide, perhaps, you know, I don't know, because I don't know their real life,
*  but it could be something that they get so much into their character. I didn't understand it at
*  first because I'd never had acting class, but after a while that you have acting class, now you start
*  to realize that, yeah, okay, I understand why some actor get caught up in their emotion because
*  that can have an influence on their life, right? You're on a fascinating journey. George, I can't
*  tell you how much it means to me that you'll be so nice to me, that you'll give me so much respect,
*  just that that tells everything I need to know about you as a human being with everything you've
*  accomplished. You waste all your time and you're so nice to me just as a fellow human being, man.
*  I have so much respect. I'm so honored and the energy you give me by just even showing up here,
*  I'll carry that forward for a long time to come. George, I love it. Thank you so much for talking
*  today. Thank you, Lex, for having me on the show. You know, I've been looking to talk to you for a
*  long time. For me, talking to a guy like you, it's a great learning experience because I always learn
*  and life is fascinating to me and all the experiences that we have in life,
*  it's something that can make us grow and this experience for me just makes me grow as well.
*  Plus, we look pretty damn sharp today. Men in black, my friend.
*  Men in black. Thanks, George.
*  Nice.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with George St. Pierre and thank you to Allform,
*  ExpressVPN, Blinkist, Theragun, and TheInformation. Check them out in the description
*  to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.
*  Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
