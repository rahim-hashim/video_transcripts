# Roger Gracie: Greatest Jiu Jitsu Competitor of All Time | Lex Fridman Podcast #343
**Lex Fridman:** [December 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhfmGM6hswI)
*  In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.
*  Winning is not enough.
*  The following is a conversation with Hodger Gracie, widely considered to be the greatest
*  Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now to your friends, here's Hodger Gracie.
*  Let's start with possibly the greatest match in Jiu-Jitsu history, your second match
*  against Buccecia.
*  Let's go through the details.
*  Let's go through the whole thing.
*  So the walk leading up to it.
*  You always do this walk.
*  It's an epic walk.
*  You post that on Instagram, hands up, post that on Instagram.
*  This calm walk towards the mat.
*  Well, let's go to that match in particular.
*  What was going through your mind?
*  You've been away from competition, facing probably one of the greatest.
*  And at that time, many people considered the greatest Jiu-Jitsu
*  competitor of all time in Buccecia.
*  Here's the old man, the old timer getting back out there.
*  What were you thinking?
*  Yeah, I think that's the first time since probably I got my black belt that I wasn't
*  the favorite walk into a fight.
*  I have to say, like a lot of people thought, consider him the favorite.
*  I mean, understandable.
*  You know, I was out of competition for a while.
*  He was just winning everything.
*  So, you know, saying about the walk, like for me, you know, the fight starts way
*  before the referee say go, you know, it's all the focus and concentration that I
*  think is very important for me to start before, like, you know, I almost walk
*  blind to the mat many times I passed like great friends and I couldn't see anyone.
*  You know, they're trying to talk to you and I'm like, I'm a hundred percent
*  focused on my opponent already.
*  I thought that I cannot even see him in front of me.
*  So I think that's what me was always very important to try to clear my
*  mind out from everything.
*  Are you visualizing the opponent?
*  Or are you just clearing?
*  Not at that time.
*  Is there, what's, what's in your head?
*  Is it like a calm river with birds chirping?
*  What is the blank?
*  Just blank darkness.
*  Yeah, darkness.
*  Okay.
*  And that's what we see in that calmness is just blankness.
*  How hard is it to achieve that blankness?
*  It's difficult to say because I think I don't remember when I'll say probably
*  as a black belt, I try to focus like that, not to think because it's probably
*  something you learn is the more you think, the more nervous you get and there's
*  nothing that you're going to gain by thinking of the fight or the possibilities.
*  What, you know, what you can do, what can go wrong, what can go right?
*  Because it's unpredictable.
*  You have absolutely no idea.
*  It's impossible to predict the fight.
*  And you discover that if you just let those nervous feelings go and empty
*  your mind, it actually is pretty effective.
*  It is.
*  It makes you feel better.
*  It's, you know, you, you kind of control your emotion, control the
*  adrenaline on your body up to a level.
*  So it absolutely helps you, you know, focus in the fight.
*  I've learned that in Jiu-Jitsu and in general in life that whenever something
*  feels really shitty, you can just like take that thought and not think about it.
*  Like I do that like on long runs or like a fast run or yeah, in Jiu-Jitsu,
*  especially when I get older, out of shape, like that feeling of exhaustion.
*  Well, you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion.
*  You could just not think about it.
*  Not think about being exhausted.
*  Just, and that somehow relaxes you.
*  I think maybe in the face of exhaustion, all the fears start to creep in.
*  Maybe your muscles tighten up.
*  I don't know.
*  This is for the, the, the amateur Jiu-Jitsu person.
*  But it's kind of funny how you can just take that thought and let go of it.
*  So you get as a black belt competitor, you get used to, you get good
*  at letting go of any thoughts.
*  Yeah.
*  When you mention to exhaustion is, I mean, that's another good example of it.
*  It's, you know, there's a lot of times in the fight you're getting tired
*  and you're getting pretty tired.
*  So it's like the last thing you want to think of it is how tired you are.
*  It doesn't matter because it doesn't.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Quit?
*  I mean, it doesn't matter.
*  It's how tired you are.
*  It's, there's no value thinking about it.
*  There's no value.
*  It's, you just have to go through it.
*  So when you're like, you know, many minutes into the match and you're slowly
*  moving as you sometimes do tying your belt, catching your breath, you're
*  not thinking about anything you're trying to let go of thinking.
*  I'm trying to like to save everything to the fight.
*  Like nothing goes to waste.
*  It's, you know, every move unnecessary, it's just going to make you more tired
*  or it's going to take something out of you.
*  Like, you know, I try to calculate every single move I make, save as much
*  energy as I can so I can fully, you know, be focused 100% in the fight with no
*  waste, especially energy wise.
*  And that's instinctual.
*  Like, minimizing the amount of moves.
*  You're not like explicitly thinking, should I do this or not?
*  It's just, just don't move unless it's absolutely required.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause fight is, you cannot really, there's not really time to think much.
*  You know, it's like, it's, it's, it's your instinct are playing.
*  It's like, it's, you know, you already have your, you know, your, your weapons,
*  let's say, you know, you did the things that you do at, it's just to wait
*  for the perfect moment.
*  The beauty of it is, you know, there's the right moment to everything.
*  If you feel one second too late, doesn't work.
*  No, you get messy.
*  So it's, you know, you're trying to catch that moment.
*  That's his, you know, and for that you have to be fully focused in what you're
*  doing because one second is you out.
*  It won't work.
*  But you're not exactly known as somebody that moves super quickly.
*  So the, so the moment it's not about how quickly you move.
*  It's about the right moment.
*  So you move slowly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not like it's speed.
*  It's not like you have to move the speed of light.
*  It's, it's, it's the move itself or that precise moment.
*  It doesn't have to be super fast because your opponent's not moving super fast.
*  You know, so it's, it's a combination of moving with you and him.
*  I mean, the same thing happens in, in judo and the movement could be really small.
*  Yeah.
*  I think judo is a, is a bit more explosive.
*  And, you know, it's, it's the moves are slightly faster.
*  So he did know he does require a bit more explosiveness in judo.
*  But even just the right timing for an off balance, just a little tug.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not that, you know, moving the speed is not going to count that much.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the timing that you initiate that move.
*  You see that with foot sweeps.
*  There's nothing more beautiful than like a Olympic level athletes going at it in
*  the Olympics and a perfect.
*  And it's just, and you see one man's life flash before his eyes and realize like
*  I'm supposed to be the top three person in the world that I just find they don't,
*  they have this look on their face.
*  Like, I don't know what just happened.
*  It's beautiful to see.
*  You don't see that.
*  I guess you see that in boxing, knockouts and stuff like that.
*  You don't know what the hell just happened.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that precise moment of movement that you get caught?
*  Like is that one split second?
*  That's it.
*  Do you get that in Jiu-Jitsu at all?
*  Cause Judo has because of the explosiveness, because of the point scoring system that
*  incentivizes these giant throws, has these moments where everything just turns on a
*  single moment.
*  Do you have that in Jiu-Jitsu too?
*  Not really because then it's points.
*  Yes.
*  You get like, you know, two points.
*  So it's because I think regarding the submission is not just one precise movement that
*  change everything.
*  I think Judo is the takedown that counts as a submission.
*  Like Ipong, fight over.
*  Jiu-Jitsu don't have that.
*  So you will score points, but I think in terms of submission, you need to get to a dominant
*  position first and then the submission will come slowly.
*  It's a process.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Let's go back to that guy with his mind.
*  So actually in the weeks leading up to it, in the days, in the hours, in the minutes,
*  is there some fear in you leading up to this?
*  I mean, I'm not going to say, you know, that I'm fearless because everybody fears
*  something, you know, the fear is there, but it's like how much you let that control
*  you.
*  I think I was a lot more confident than fearful.
*  For sure.
*  Walk into that fight.
*  Like I was pretty confident that I could beat him.
*  Where's the source of that confidence?
*  My belief on me.
*  This.
*  I can take the world.
*  You can take anyone in the world, but is there a specific strategic, like, you know,
*  talking to Donaher, he believes that there's no such thing as confidence, or rather the
*  way you get confidence is through data.
*  Like that you have proven yourself effective in previous situations, but with
*  Buccecce, you don't have much data.
*  It was a very, the first time you faced him was a very tough, that was also one of the
*  greatest matches of all time.
*  It was very tough.
*  So doesn't that creep in like that doubt because, you know, you don't have enough
*  data to be confident based on.
*  Yeah, I mean.
*  Okay.
*  If I never had fought before, you know, Sunday walk into a fight with someone like
*  that, then would I be that confidence?
*  I mean, probably no.
*  You know, so that history of what, you know, what we've been doing, what we've
*  been achieving does gives you confidence.
*  If that was my first fight ever, I wouldn't probably, I wouldn't be that confident.
*  But the time off.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  You don't have the fear or the actual physical confidence to be able to fight
*  the actual physical experience, the psychological experience of being rusty,
*  of being out of that will come out on training.
*  So you, okay.
*  You, so you simulate some aspect of that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's the training will tell you how you are.
*  Did you increase the intensity of the training leading up to this?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I train, I train normal.
*  Let's say compared to the first fight, the second one's a lot more
*  constant because, you know, like I say on training, the training for the
*  first fight, you were terrible.
*  So what do you mean?
*  I think I was focusing MMA for a while, for a couple of months, and I wasn't
*  really focusing the gear and, you know, by the time I accept the fight and start
*  training, like all my responses on training were off, like all my training
*  partner that I used to train with that I destroyed, I mean, now they like,
*  they're beating me, you know, it's like, I cannot beat them the way I was used to.
*  But, you know, so I knew it was something was not right for the first fight.
*  But then it's, you know, no points is submission or draw.
*  So yeah, for people who don't know, it was in one of Morris, which is a
*  20 minute match submission only.
*  So there's no, the winner is determined only by submission.
*  Otherwise it's a draw.
*  So physically I was, I wasn't myself on that fight.
*  I was tired.
*  My body wasn't responding anyway.
*  So that, so the comp that was different from the first, the second, I think I
*  was confident enough that I wouldn't get tapped out on the first that I was still.
*  Going to fight because he has to tap me out to beat me.
*  And I trust on my defense.
*  I'm confident enough on my defense that he will not tap me out.
*  But in terms of winning, you know, walk into the second fight,
*  I was a lot more confident.
*  What can you say about that feeling when something's not right?
*  Isn't that a thing that breaks people?
*  It's weird breaks.
*  It's weird.
*  Like people crack, they give up, you know, this is, it's a, it's a big test
*  because it's, it's like being really tired.
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's like a lot of people crack because they just feel they cannot give it more.
*  There's nothing more to give.
*  So they just like give up.
*  It's too hard.
*  So what do you do?
*  Just again, take the thoughts out.
*  There is no giving up.
*  I mean, I don't mind.
*  I don't care.
*  Like you just giving up is not enough.
*  It's not.
*  That's always the way you thought.
*  Yeah.
*  About Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never gave up.
*  I mean, I tapped it's, you know, not giving up is not not tapping.
*  That's just stupid.
*  Especially, you know, doing training.
*  Like it's I get caught.
*  I tap.
*  I've never ever hurt myself by not tapping.
*  I get, you get angry, you know, train hard, you know, improve, make, make
*  yourself better, you got caught, accept that you made a mistake, give up, tap.
*  Then try harder.
*  So, you know, the not tapping, it's you're sacrificing your body and, you
*  know, you will never be the same.
*  Like if you let your elbow popped, the elbow will never ever be the same ever.
*  You let yourself go to sleep.
*  Your resistance drops.
*  So it's everybody has a, has a limit of resistance until they, you know, to
*  resist the choke before you pass out.
*  The moment that you, you, you, you, you go to sleep, that
*  resistance will dropped.
*  I've never heard anyone say that.
*  That's awesome.
*  So that's true.
*  So tap this.
*  So that's the reason people usually say it's no, it's the same.
*  Or you get it knocked out.
*  You get knocked out the first time your resistance dropped.
*  Your job gets weaker.
*  So just for the record, I've never got to sleep in, which means my
*  resistance is high, right?
*  I don't know.
*  Must be.
*  Oh, your defense is pretty good.
*  I don't know about that.
*  No, no, no.
*  Um, because it doesn't make sense to me or maybe in my case, I think my
*  understanding of when I'm screwed is pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  Like there's no, no, no, no trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things I regret the most about my Jiu-Jitsu journey is not having
*  given enough time to, um, uh, being in really bad positions.
*  Like the better I got, I think the less I started being in bad positions.
*  Which is because you're a spar.
*  That's like the, that is how you train.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you used to just spar when you spar, like it's difficult to, to
*  being bad positions a lot and you train with better people, but I mean, let's
*  say five, six minute rows, how long you're going to be in a really bad position.
*  Not long, right?
*  So you don't really have time to develop.
*  That's why people, they don't, you know, they don't train being bad position
*  because you have to start there over and over again.
*  To be used to it.
*  Yeah.
*  Or put yourself there.
*  I just didn't have that mindset.
*  I think, I think you start, I mean, part of the fun of Jiu-Jitsu is
*  as you get better and better, you have certain people you go with.
*  You have these puzzles that you figured out that you're playing very
*  specific details you're working out.
*  You're trying to improve your main like techniques and so on, but yeah, just
*  the percentage of time you spend being submitted or being, or trying, even going
*  against like lower ranks, trying to escape basic submissions is low.
*  I don't know if that's true for most people.
*  Probably is right.
*  Most people have very bad defense.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they don't allow themselves to be there because I mean, who wants to get
*  tapped because you will until you, you know, to work on your defense, of course
*  you're going to get tapped or, you know, you're not going to escape.
*  You're going to struggle to escape.
*  So people, they don't want to be there.
*  I regret it most because of the effect it clearly had on how I competed.
*  It was, it was clear that my competition was, was constantly driven by
*  conservative thinking, like don't take risks.
*  I think because of a weak defense, honestly.
*  And I think a lot of the, any of the fear, like for example, exhaustion was accompanied
*  by fear because of weak defense, I think.
*  If I were to psychoanalyze myself and I regretted it, I regret it a lot.
*  But speaking of which, I don't think anyone's ever submitted you in competition.
*  So you're, well, I was a juvenile.
*  Yes.
*  So it's when you were a young person, that still haunt you?
*  No, it's first I was winning that fight by a large.
*  I mean, I think by six points or four or something like that, but I was like, I was
*  still remember it though, huh?
*  By the details.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever beat him again?
*  He never competed again.
*  Whoever you are, please let's, let's do a podcast.
*  We'll talk shit about Hodger the whole thing.
*  No, but what do you attribute to that too?
*  You're a young man.
*  Uh, no, but what do you attribute to that too?
*  You're saying you're confident.
*  You're confident that the top of the world, the number one,
*  but Chacha would not submit you.
*  Um, so where's that confidence grounded and what do you attribute the fact that
*  nobody was able to submit you?
*  First, it comes on training.
*  You know, I train a lot, bad position.
*  Like my difference is good because I've, I practice over and over again.
*  That as much as I practice all my offensive position.
*  So it's, you know, you have to train both equally, not just being a good position.
*  You have to be in bed.
*  So I think that's a very strong part of my game.
*  You know, to be a complete fighter, you know, this complete martial artist, you
*  have to be good in every single position, every single one, those that they, you
*  know, you have a weakness, so it's, you know, to be complete, you should have no
*  weakness.
*  So that was always my, you know, I was always very particular on that.
*  Like it's where my weakness, where am I?
*  What?
*  I don't feel good at it.
*  If you put me in a position where struggle, how do I escape?
*  How do I get out?
*  Everything.
*  Any submission locked, penny position, you know, back mount, everything.
*  It's doesn't matter which position I practice over and over again.
*  So that when I, if I get there in a fighting situation, I will know how to get out.
*  At least I'll have a direction.
*  You know, I will know this is my way out.
*  Do you practice both escaping the bad position and the transition into the
*  bad position, avoiding it because that's how it happens.
*  You know, Jiu-Jitsu, you start in a neutral position.
*  No, the transition then it then becomes that the fight itself is being
*  there is the most important is when you're there, then you have to know how to get out.
*  That that's your weakness.
*  How you know, stopping the person getting there is something different.
*  So there are two different things.
*  It's you either you practice one or the other.
*  So both are important, I guess, but the stopping the person is easier to practice
*  because that comes naturally in training.
*  Yeah.
*  What was the actual process?
*  Like, what was your biggest weakness throughout your, like you just remembering
*  what was annoying to you to figure out?
*  I mean, outside control is always is bottom of second bottom.
*  It's regardless how much you practice.
*  It's not ever easy.
*  You'll never be easy, but it's so annoying.
*  It makes no sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone pins you down.
*  This is someone to move much as a big and strong guy, regardless of who is not going
*  to be easy to escape.
*  So some situations are just hard.
*  That must be the sorry to interrupt.
*  I'm interrupting.
*  I'm not being hijacked.
*  Gracie.
*  He just, but you just made me realize.
*  And if you're really good, if you're, if you're going against like the perfect
*  jujitsu competitor, probably side control might be one of the hardest positions.
*  Is it the hardest position to escape?
*  It's one of them.
*  If the person doesn't want to progress, it just concerned about opinion.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the best pinners in the world.
*  I mean, partially because I've just seen judo people that know how to pin.
*  Yeah.
*  They go skip their second choice.
*  A nightmare is a nightmare.
*  Doesn't matter how much you practice.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a nightmare.
*  And it's also just frustrating.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I think, I guess it is also frustrating because a lot of people in that position
*  will be about maintaining control, not progressing.
*  Yeah.
*  And usually people when they're a mile in a back control are usually trying to
*  progress towards a submission, which opens up opportunities for escape.
*  Yeah.
*  So what's the actual process of just time and time again, putting yourself
*  inside a bottom side control over and over again, starting there, escape,
*  get back, escape, get back.
*  If it mounts you get back any situation outside that stops that again, stop,
*  start again, and it has to be, I'll say five minutes because it's the
*  repetition that will teach you, you know, if you train like three minutes on top,
*  you have time to, you know, one thing and then time out is the repetition
*  there over and over again, you know, when you try to say move over and over again,
*  then you'll see what can go wrong.
*  And is it understanding the details of the movement or actually doing
*  the movement and feeling it?
*  It's, it's both.
*  First, you have to understand the movement and then practice.
*  But most important thing is defense, escape coming second.
*  Because, you know, he's attacking you.
*  Well, the one thing is if he's not trying to submit you, but the other one,
*  if it is, let's say if it's a person is very good, has a very good attack.
*  The first thing is defense, not just scape and expose yourself to
*  an even worse position because that is, it's very risky.
*  When you're trying to scape, you'll always expose yourself to a worse position.
*  So avoiding that it's, you know, first is defense, not getting caught.
*  And then when you scape and don't be in a worse position.
*  So defense in Jiu-Jitsu when you're wearing a gi, what does defense entail?
*  Is it mostly grips?
*  Is it mostly the positioning of your hips and legs?
*  It's, it's, it's everything together because it's a whole body movement.
*  It's, you know, it's a constantly moving your, your arms, legs, body.
*  It's, it, they, they, they have to, everything works together.
*  Going back to the mind of that guy, so confident, no fear at this point.
*  Is there a bit of ego in there too?
*  Yes.
*  Like, like I say, no, I'm not going to say I'm fear, I'm fearless.
*  Of course this concerns that fight.
*  I would have to say it was probably the fight that I got nervous the most walking
*  in because I knew what that meant.
*  That fight.
*  They mean everything for me.
*  All my legacy was on the line because if I lost that fight, I'll forever be number two.
*  Yeah.
*  Forever.
*  And I mean, Boshieche is a great, great guy, great competitor.
*  Jiu-Jitsu is very good, but I'm better than him.
*  I knew that.
*  But he's competing nonstop at that point.
*  He's a, he's a great competitor, you know, taking nothing out of him.
*  He's super tough.
*  Very, very tough.
*  Very good.
*  He's probably the best competitor in Jiu-Jitsu.
*  He won 13 times the World Championship.
*  I won 10.
*  So as a competitor, you know, he has more titles than I do.
*  So, but in terms of, you know, analyzing the game, I consider technically better than him.
*  So knowing all that, everything that I build, all my legacy, it's if I'm not
*  all riding on this match.
*  If I lose this fight, I'm forever number two.
*  And none of that is going through your mind.
*  No, I knew.
*  I mean, it's not at that moment that I already knew that.
*  I remember just before, you know, the curtains open, I'm standing and before
*  they call my name and I mean, my legs were like, I feel the adrenaline kicking on my legs.
*  And I'm like, you know, I'm hitting the legs.
*  I'm like, wake up, you know, get off, get the adrenaline off me.
*  You know, so it's, it was, it was intense.
*  It was intense.
*  And this was in Rio.
*  That was in Rio.
*  So my hometown.
*  So this is, I mean, and you know, Rio is not exactly known for its calmness in its fans.
*  So this is like, wow, wherever they hosted the Olympics the year before.
*  So this is like, I mean, this, like the whole basically martial arts
*  community is watching this.
*  I mean, is there some, uh, was Hanzo there?
*  Yeah.
*  So people are just, I mean, there's a tension.
*  It's also, I mean, I don't know if you felt that in part, but you're
*  also fighting for the Gracie name.
*  Yeah.
*  In our hometown, the greatest Gracie competitor of all time, arguably in the hometown.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, okay.
*  All my family, my best friends, my friends, everybody watching everybody there.
*  There was a lot of pressure.
*  A lot.
*  And then were you thinking that you would be able to submit him?
*  No, it's not that point.
*  Like I don't predict how the fight will go.
*  That I never did because it is unpredictable.
*  It's, I never tried to set any strategy for any fight.
*  I think, oh, okay, that I did, but that was the only time that I
*  set any strategy into a fight.
*  There was a 15 minutes fight there.
*  And for, I said, first five minutes, I'm going to play defense.
*  He's bigger, stronger, younger.
*  I don't want to play his game.
*  And I know he comes in very fast.
*  Every single fight he had, you know, he comes very aggressive.
*  So my strategy walk into the fight, I say five minutes, I'm going to play defense.
*  I'm not going to try to attack.
*  I'm not going to try to match his pace.
*  I already expected, you know, maybe I'm going to start losing the fight because,
*  you know, if he comes in, there's a risk of me maybe getting taken down,
*  or, you know, or something happened.
*  I'm like, I'm going to stick to the game plan.
*  Five minutes.
*  I'm going to start picking up the pace because then it's 10 minutes to go,
*  which 10 minutes is a long fight.
*  So I don't need to start fast, but I'm going to start being more aggressive and
*  then, you know, try to take him down or pull guard, you know, by then I'm like,
*  that's as far the strategy goes.
*  No specific, uh, stay on the feet.
*  Were you comfortable being both bottom and top in this strategic?
*  Yeah, I'm always comfortable being bottom and top.
*  I prefer to be on top because being in the bottom, the person on top dictates
*  the pace of the fight because he's on top over you.
*  So I always prefer to be on top because I can dictate the pace.
*  I can implement my own pace and being the bottom, they can slow me down.
*  So it's harder.
*  So if I can choose, I will always be on top.
*  But I think by then I was like, it's, you know, five minutes hit it.
*  I'm like, he's pretty big and strong.
*  I'm going to spend a lot of energy taking him down.
*  I pull guard.
*  How did it feel?
*  So here you're stepping in, by the way, puzzle math.
*  This is old school as old school as it gets.
*  So calm and relaxed here for people just listening.
*  We're watching the early minutes of the match.
*  Yeah.
*  So just feeling it out.
*  He seems pretty calm too.
*  He must be nervous too.
*  I wonder how you ever talked to him.
*  You guys are friends.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We're friends.
*  Did he ever say how nervous he was?
*  No, we never spoke about that fight.
*  No, no.
*  He probably lays late at night thinking about it.
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  That SOB.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, so you see the first five minutes, no, he kept, I knew what he was going to
*  do in my study, his game, his stand up is most basic is basic in takedowns, leg
*  attacks, double legs.
*  So he goes single or double and he charged in.
*  That is pretty much it.
*  So he's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  He's pretty good.
*  And that is pretty much his stand up game.
*  So you were trying, you get, you get a grip.
*  Yeah.
*  We got penalized.
*  So do you like to use the, do you like to post with your left?
*  You have a right foot forward usually.
*  You're a righty, right?
*  I'm righty, but I know he wants my leg.
*  So I'm playing my stance just because of his game.
*  Oh, you know, all my grips are that the first five minutes was to kind of try
*  to neutralize his attacks.
*  So he wants to get your left leg.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right there.
*  Yeah.
*  So how hard is that to stop that?
*  I mean, he felt pretty strong coming in.
*  So I'm, you know, pushing the head down, trying to play with his balance.
*  Yeah.
*  If, if you, if you see it, there was a pause.
*  Go back there.
*  He charged in.
*  There's a pause me standing in front of him.
*  Yeah.
*  I did that on purpose.
*  What do you mean?
*  Just to just in front of him.
*  Cause you know, he tried and I'm like, you fail.
*  I'm here.
*  There's a, okay.
*  So you could feel the frustration.
*  I could feel his frustration, his frustration, not be able to take me down.
*  Okay.
*  So now, and this is just psychological battles.
*  And you see me walking straight into the middle of the mat and he's circling out.
*  Yeah.
*  See, I'm going very slow recovering.
*  And he's computing like, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Because he just made an effort trying to take me down.
*  He needs to recover.
*  And I mean, you need to recover the other guys.
*  They're waiting for you.
*  And do I, do I go for another take down?
*  Cause this one failed.
*  Don't you need to recalculate the strategy?
*  Yeah.
*  And he kept trying over and over again and keep failing.
*  I think that frustrate him a lot on that fight.
*  I felt, I felt him kind of slowing down suddenly because he was getting nowhere.
*  So we're five minutes in.
*  Yeah.
*  He keeps, so he never got that take down in the, in the early.
*  No.
*  Let's see.
*  So at this point, do you pull guard?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So that's when I felt like he's, he's mentally, he's, he's not, he's worried now.
*  Did you try to pull close guard here?
*  No, I knew he was going to bring Danny in.
*  Okay.
*  Cause that's the defense against pulling close guard.
*  Yeah.
*  But I like that.
*  What do you, I like people bringing Danny between my legs.
*  Cause see, I'm going to close my guard even with his leg in.
*  Okay.
*  He is, he's, he's stopping the club.
*  Well, this is awkward, but I guess I was holding his arm.
*  That's why he felt he had no hand to post.
*  Got it.
*  But still it puts a leg in, but you're able to close your guard around.
*  So you're okay with that?
*  I do that really well.
*  I sweep people from that position a lot.
*  What's the sweep?
*  I just pushed.
*  Okay.
*  It's just like to your left side.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Because he has no, oh, it's almost like a, you mean you're
*  basically around his back a little bit.
*  And he knew that like I swept a lot of people with that sweep.
*  So you see he kept leaning to his left, to my right.
*  Yeah.
*  So I want to push them to my left.
*  So you see him leaning over to my right a lot.
*  What's the right answer for him to like roll or something?
*  No, I mean, he's stuck.
*  He does not really, he's stuck there, but the one thing he did, he kept off me completely.
*  See that he's leaning too, like he's too afraid of my attack now.
*  Because he, you know, he should lean on me.
*  Yep.
*  You know, you should bring the fight to me.
*  So when I fell him, you know, I knew he was like, he's too worried about my attacks now.
*  Oh yeah, that's right.
*  So he can't, if he goes back to the center, he has no like...
*  So he's not engaging now at that time.
*  He's a hundred percent just defending.
*  So I felt that.
*  I'm like, he doesn't want to engage.
*  And he's looking, I knew at that point he wants my foot.
*  Because our first fight, I had the exact the same position.
*  I wasn't holding his arm and he went to attack my foot, which he did, you know, he got into attack.
*  Like a toe hold or what?
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  So I knew he's looking at my foot.
*  Which foot?
*  Sorry, the left, your right foot?
*  My right, yeah, my right foot.
*  Okay.
*  And so I'm holding his arms.
*  I'm holding his arm.
*  And now you're going to the back as an arm drag type of thing.
*  So the moment that I came off, I'm holding his arm so he cannot come up.
*  So, you know, I'm holding his left arm so he cannot post a hand on the floor and come up.
*  And he's holding your right to try to get you, basically to prevent you from attacking.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's an interesting, and he rolls.
*  Yeah.
*  He tried to, he tried to get me off balance.
*  So see now I'm switching, I switched the grip on his arm so I can free my left arm.
*  Can I ask you a question?
*  Like, was there a chance he sweeps you here?
*  I mean, there's always a chance, but very hard.
*  Yeah, but see my left arm is free.
*  Oh, so you can post.
*  Yeah.
*  Why was your left arm free?
*  Oh, because you were using it to, got it, got it.
*  Okay.
*  So I tried the hook.
*  Now you will see.
*  He's still got your arm.
*  But when I knew he's panicking because he didn't move that he completely opened himself up.
*  Like I'm holding his left arm.
*  So by holding their arm, that prevents him from defending the hook on that side because
*  his arm is being held across.
*  So the arm cannot block the hook.
*  And I mean, the hook with your left leg.
*  Yeah.
*  So you'll see when he come up.
*  But I would say, I mean, that's my guess, but Bushesha is, he's a big guy.
*  You know, he was like 110 kilos, 112, something like that.
*  Which is 245.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  So what were you at the time?
*  Uh, less?
*  220.
*  Yeah.
*  220.
*  A nice slim 100 kilo.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  So in his, his defense are not amazing.
*  He's good, but you know, he's not known to have amazing defense.
*  So by being the big guy in the room, when you train, you wish it to get out of
*  situation because of your size, you shake people off, you know, it's because of your
*  size, you shake them off, you get off some bad positions you can, I mean, I could
*  feel on the first fight, I'm side control, you know, something he explode out.
*  So, you know, you, I've seen him doing that a few of his fights, not, you're not in
*  the most technical way, just I'm getting out and he did it because of his size.
*  So, and he did the same thing.
*  Like he tried to stood up when I'm on his back, he completely opened up the hooks.
*  He will see the next move, his head going to come up and he going to try to get off
*  the floor.
*  So basically come up, shake you off kind of strategy.
*  There was no difference for the hooks.
*  I put both hooks in straight away.
*  Oh, his arm is.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm off balance.
*  Yeah.
*  See that I didn't bring him up.
*  He came up.
*  Yeah.
*  And now I'm attacking his neck and he's worried about the hooks.
*  That's fatal mistake.
*  That's like defense always come first.
*  Remember what I just said now?
*  Defense first, cape second.
*  So he's not worried more about the points than his neck.
*  So it was like a progression of mistakes.
*  That's why I think he did, he got frustrated when he couldn't take me down.
*  And then when I pull guard, he was frustrated that the fight wasn't going his way.
*  You know, he's very good about taking down.
*  He tried over and over again for five minutes.
*  And here he was frustrated about the hooks.
*  So he's like, it's almost like the frustration things like, no, no, no, these
*  hooks shouldn't be here.
*  Like I pull guard on the grips that I want.
*  He's not comfortable inside my guy.
*  He's not in the position that he wants to be.
*  He's over leaning to his left, you know, to, to, to, to not, he's not engaged,
*  you're not trying to pass.
*  He's trying to get the foot, but his arm is trapped.
*  He's going to get nowhere.
*  And then when I swept him, some of his words start collapsing.
*  You know, he couldn't take me down.
*  I pulled guard, I'm swept in.
*  He tried to roll me over.
*  No, it didn't get me anywhere.
*  The first movement that he tried to escape, I'm on his back.
*  I mean, now he's lost.
*  Yeah.
*  That, if you just go back to him standing up.
*  See both hook goes in no difference.
*  Like there was nothing on the way of those hooks because he tried to come
*  on coming up, you're, you're high enough on him to where the weight was
*  just probably immense.
*  It just felt too heavy.
*  I mean, you're already, you're already, you're already going for the choke.
*  There's no time to lose.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're not like worried.
*  I'm going to get shaken off.
*  You're going for the chip.
*  No, you got your right hand.
*  I'm not shaking you off.
*  I'm on your back now.
*  We're in this together.
*  Okay.
*  And your, your right hand is opening up the lapel.
*  My right hand is holding his arm.
*  I still holding the sleeve.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you're holding the sleeve, but holding the sleeve and I'm already
*  going for the neck because it's timing.
*  At which point do you let go of the sleeve and open up, help with the
*  lapel or do you not need it?
*  No, I did that, but first I want to try to make a grip like then I need to
*  establish control before I let go his arm.
*  Got it.
*  So I kept holding that a bit longer and then when I fell, okay, I have a good
*  control over the back, then I let go.
*  Do you, okay.
*  So you have like a light grip on his lapel, but you're thinking you
*  know that I need to adjust that.
*  You need to adjust that.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like holding it there and you're thinking, okay, I'm going to
*  get under his chin, then I know it's, I mean, it's now I can't go for it.
*  Cause if it's over, there's no choke, right?
*  I need the wrist needs to be under.
*  Can you choke Buccecio over the?
*  No, I can't.
*  That's just not right.
*  Okay.
*  Anyway, it's not right or it doesn't work.
*  It both.
*  It's not right and it doesn't work.
*  I mean, would you tap to choke on your chin?
*  No, it's just pressure.
*  You hurt, but it's not going to choke you out.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not, let me argue this.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  Let me argue this.
*  I love this.
*  Arguing with the Hodge.
*  You're great thing about jokes.
*  This is great.
*  Okay.
*  Like clock choke is, it was always interesting to me because in judo it's
*  illegal to have the gear on the face.
*  And so it was kind of liberating for me to be allowed to have a gear on the face.
*  No, it's just liberating.
*  No, then you don't have to worry about it.
*  I get, of course it's more effective to go under the chin, but I'm surprised just
*  because the amount of pressure, like it's all about how much you can take it.
*  You can take a lot.
*  But it feels like, no, it doesn't feel comfortable.
*  I mean, sometimes on your mouth, it cuts your mouth.
*  Now you're bleeding.
*  It feels horrible.
*  No, but it feels, that's not the feeling, the feeling.
*  It might not be a joke, but the feeling like, like it's a pressure that
*  everything's just closing in.
*  But it doesn't take you anywhere.
*  Like you're not going to go to sleep.
*  You might not go to sleep.
*  So it's just pressure.
*  Yes.
*  So pressure, it hurts, it's uncomfortable, but it is not going to break your face
*  and it's not going to put you to sleep.
*  So if I don't get the neck, I don't go for the kill.
*  I'm like, I'm holding the, his collar.
*  You know, my, my wrist is almost under it's, you know, I'm trying to kind of dig in.
*  If I can dig in, then I would adjust the collar, but first I need to dig in.
*  Dig in first and adjust.
*  Can you do all that with one hand or no?
*  I did.
*  So you can tighten the choke with just one hand.
*  No.
*  I need the second one to open the lapel.
*  But you're like digging in with one hand.
*  I'm digging in under the chin.
*  Under is under, now I need to go deeper.
*  But that, the going deeper requires a second hand.
*  He does.
*  Okay.
*  He does.
*  And, but that requires you letting go of the other hand.
*  Yeah.
*  I have to let go eventually.
*  Yeah.
*  See?
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's over.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I'm already under his, like the first hand got under the chin.
*  Do you need the hand on the second lapel?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Otherwise he turns and he's out.
*  That's the control of the turning versus the tightening of the choke.
*  Yeah.
*  It does both.
*  It helps tighten the collar and stop the person rolling out.
*  Were you feeling pretty good about this position?
*  Yes.
*  I just felt it's getting tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, because he
*  wasn't super tight from the beginning.
*  It wasn't like the perfect choke.
*  So it was still, I mean, I knew it was like, he's very close to the end, but
*  you know, I still need to adjust.
*  There was still the risk of maybe his escaping.
*  Is it possible for his head to slip out?
*  Yeah, it's possible.
*  Yes.
*  But I'm closing that gap.
*  Yeah.
*  Right here.
*  What did that feel like?
*  Relief?
*  Relief.
*  Like awesome.
*  Amazing.
*  Somebody on Reddit asked, ask him about the cross grip he used to sweep, followed
*  with a genius grips, which when Buchescha was inverted, did you use a cross grip
*  when you sweep?
*  I guess the cross grip in the arm.
*  That must be it.
*  Oh, that's the cross grip.
*  Okay.
*  What's the genius behind that?
*  Or was that just the, do you like that kind of, that kind of grip?
*  Yeah, because I always liked close guard and no one wants to be in anyone's
*  close guard, right?
*  It's open guard is the step to pass.
*  So everybody, when you try to close the guard, they bring the knee in the middle.
*  Like if you, if you're not standing, if you're lower on the ground and the open
*  guard, if you're close to me, you need that knee between.
*  So it's a must.
*  That's when I stopped developing the attack.
*  You know, I managed to have long legs to close my legs around people even with
*  that, and then I just developed that sweep.
*  When did you start developing that?
*  Like, uh, I don't remember when, but I would say before black belt.
*  Okay.
*  So your answer to that is not to figure out how to prevent them from putting the
*  knee in.
*  Is there an answer to that?
*  No, but good guys will always try and get the knee in.
*  Remove the leg out of the way.
*  That's not possible.
*  Well, maybe off balance them enough to where it is not.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, you can try, but like, it's, it's hard.
*  If you can off balance, you sweep them.
*  All right.
*  So that knee is going to see, you're going to have to solve that.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's extremely common to have that.
*  I mean, I, if I'm on your guard, open guard, you know, if you have your legs,
*  if I'm between both of your legs in the open guard, my knee will be between your
*  legs because it's a must.
*  My knee cannot be on the floor.
*  Since Hanzo was there, what did he tell you before?
*  I think just motivate you.
*  I think that's Hanzo always did that fantastically well to motivate me like
*  before in fight a match.
*  I think that, you know, the confidence, you know, his, you know, his energy being
*  around you, it's, I think that's the, is the great thing to have hands on your
*  corner is the motivation that he gives you.
*  What did you learn about Jiu-Jitsu in life from Hanzo Gracie?
*  We got to hang out with him in Vegas a little bit.
*  He's a character.
*  He's one of the, uh, historic coaches and Jiu-Jitsu competitors, but also
*  personalities in the martial arts world.
*  In the world in general, there's very few like him.
*  Hanzo is a fantastic person.
*  It's, it's, you know, what I've learned most from him is like, it's, you know,
*  you can't take any challenge.
*  It's, you know, it doesn't matter where and where, you know, who it's, you know,
*  you have to be ready and, you know, with the warrior spirit that he has, he, you
*  know, he always took any challenge ready or not ready.
*  Was it you that said it or he said it where, uh, not until you go in, uh, you
*  know, to do something difficult, do you discover the strength that you have?
*  So like, if you really think about it, you might think that you don't, you're
*  not good enough, you don't have the strength to take on something difficult.
*  I fully agree.
*  I think we are measured not when we're on the strongest, but when we are on the
*  weakest.
*  That's when we truly measure ourselves or character who we are, not when a
*  position of power or when our position of weakness.
*  Have you surprised yourself?
*  Like how damn good you are.
*  Like, is this, is this really how good I am in this situation where in retrospect
*  you might think how the hell was able to accomplish this?
*  Not how good I am because otherwise I wouldn't be there.
*  So, you know, being there in the first place, it's, it's already not a great
*  thing, but I say, you know, I've every single time I found myself there.
*  I was super proud that I've never cracked.
*  Like I've never gave up ever any second, any fight, never,
*  never been broken in competition.
*  Never even it's not about winning or losing is about you giving up.
*  I've never doubt myself.
*  I always fought to the very end.
*  Always that I'm most proud of.
*  Cause there was moments, you know, it's you're in a terrible position, you know,
*  mainly like there was moments that I was super tired, but like exhaustive tired
*  when it was easy to give up.
*  Like I had nothing more to give, but I pushed, I took energy out of my soul.
*  I'll have to say, cause when my body had zero, my, you know, my spirit, my soul,
*  pull it out.
*  Is that in part, just not allowing yourself to have, um, to have to ever, ever quit.
*  Yep.
*  I have, um, one other thing I regret.
*  I remember like a blue belt match.
*  I remember, I'm not going to say who it was against, but, um, I remember it as
*  just being extremely exhausted and, um, just constantly fighting a guy was really
*  good, mount really good guard passing.
*  And I just remember, um, him passing my guard eventually.
*  So it was just like a finals of one of the IBJF tournaments and then right away
*  going to mount and just, I don't know.
*  I, it was the, the level of frustration.
*  I mean, I quit at that point.
*  Is that I remember that still, like I, it's not about losing, winning or losing,
*  but I just remember I was like, like, I was like teary eyed, frustrated.
*  And then I knew there was a lot of fights still left in there somewhere and I, I,
*  I quit and I regret that to this day.
*  Cause, uh, I think the reason I regret that is cause it gave me an option to,
*  to now quit in every other aspect of life.
*  That this is an option.
*  No, it is.
*  It sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  It teaches you, you know, it makes us stronger.
*  It's like, it made you stronger.
*  Uh, yeah, it makes you stronger that you did that to learn that don't do that
*  again.
*  Um, but still, like you said, just going to sleep in training, I do think it
*  made me weaker.
*  It did make me weaker in the rest of my life too.
*  That those, you know, I've quit a few times in my life on small things and
*  you realize, okay, it's not that big of a deal.
*  It's fine.
*  Like who cares?
*  Like who cares?
*  Um, but that what you learn over time is that voice always comes there.
*  Like, uh, uh, obviously maybe it does for you too, even at the highest level
*  of like, it's not that big of a deal.
*  Like it's okay to quit here.
*  Like it makes sense.
*  Everybody would understand.
*  Um, you know, in some sense, like you're, uh, you know, many people would say
*  you're past your prime in this match with the British show.
*  Like it makes sense.
*  You've been focusing on MMA.
*  It makes sense.
*  No, it makes sense to lose.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I don't know that that's a weird voice.
*  And in some sense, uh, it's that voice and a voice that says like, why are you
*  doing this?
*  Like, this is silly.
*  Does it make any sense?
*  It's just stop.
*  Just stop.
*  Just stop.
*  And, uh, shutting that voice down and never allowing yourself to quit.
*  That's a really powerful thing.
*  Like everybody I've met.
*  Everybody that's successful.
*  Um, yeah, down to the, even engineers, CEOs, Elon Musk, just never quitting.
*  Like when everybody around you says quit, never quitting.
*  It's weird.
*  I don't know what that is.
*  Might be genetic.
*  It might be like using the stubbornness to just never allow yourself to, um,
*  develop that it was basically developing a callous to that voice that tries to
*  tell you to quit, you never quit, huh?
*  What would you attribute that to?
*  It's like how much you want to get to the destination you chose.
*  Like, you know, it's how badly you want to get there.
*  It's if you quit, you're never going to get there.
*  And you always wanted to.
*  I always wanted.
*  Is there some thing you remember from that match?
*  Some things that happened before and after the standout to you just since in Rio?
*  Yeah, there was an interview, you know, like prior to the fight.
*  You know, there was a big fight.
*  We were doing like media every day before we meet, you know, me and him,
*  we were meeting for media and.
*  Like five days before, you know, five, six days before I'm quite chatty.
*  It's, you know, the closer we get to the fight, the more focus I get, the less I
*  talk, stop joking around playing, you know, with people.
*  But I remember I think it was maybe three or four days before we were
*  doing an interview together.
*  I think my cousin, Kira, was there.
*  She was doing one of the interviews with us.
*  And.
*  I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but I just remember
*  we're talking about the fight, of course.
*  And then it was, you know, we're standing beside each other and I'm like,
*  and then, you know, suddenly I chop in and grab him by the neck.
*  I say, I'm going to tap you by the neck.
*  And then he's like, you know, very shy.
*  And then I let go, I say, no, I'm going to tap you by the arm.
*  And I could feel he was like, he wasn't comfortable, you know, with being there.
*  It was, you know, me saying that I'm going to tap him out.
*  There was like, I was so relaxed joking about it, but I'm joking that I'm going
*  to tap him out in a fight that we're going to have him for this time.
*  And yeah, I felt he was like, not comfortable at all.
*  Do you think you got in his head a little bit to give you a little bit of confidence?
*  Yeah.
*  You've said that Jiu-Jitsu is a reflection of your personality.
*  So both your Jiu-Jitsu and your personality, there's a calmness.
*  What is that?
*  Why are you so calm?
*  Is there like an ocean underneath that's boiling?
*  Is this developed or is this your personality?
*  Are you basically leveraging who you are already to develop a game around
*  the Jiu-Jitsu or did Jiu-Jitsu make you calm?
*  I think both.
*  I was always very calm since I was a kid, you know, since very young.
*  I was never very fiery person.
*  So that is a reflection.
*  You know, you reflected on my Jiu-Jitsu, my life, on my fights, the way I fight.
*  So it's a direct influence of my personality.
*  And I think it's also in the day, you know, you develop the more, the more you
*  practice, the more you fight, it's like, you know, you don't want to get nervous.
*  You don't want the adrenaline.
*  And so you just learn how to shut that off from your mind.
*  So the less I thought about it, you know, it's like how many times I fought, you
*  know, let's say the week before the fight, that's when you start more, when
*  you're concerned the most, because now it's getting very close before it's just
*  far away, you know, it's, it's normal to think of the tournament, you get a bit
*  nervous, but it goes away quick.
*  But the fight, you know, the week before now you're constantly thinking of that
*  day and every time you think adrenaline pumps in your heart, accelerate, you
*  know, it doesn't, you know, it makes it, it's like, why am I feeling this?
*  What different will it make?
*  So you kind of, you're shutting that thought out of your mind because you
*  don't want to feel the adrenaline, your heart accelerating, it's not going to
*  add you anything.
*  So it's, you know, it's the practice also that I think I, it helped me
*  to shut that off my mind.
*  Has that helped you in regular life?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  It's, you know, it's suddenly when you go into any, any situation that
*  might be stressful, you know, like an important meeting, no super whatever it
*  is, it's like, how much would you worry about that before worried?
*  It's not going to help you anywhere.
*  It's the opposite.
*  Just going to make you more nervous, your heart accelerate, your ability to
*  think clearly is going to be damaged by that.
*  So it's like the more calm, the more relaxed you are, the better you can think of.
*  Do you ever get angry?
*  Yeah.
*  Like in traffic?
*  Do you ever, do you ever get like not calm, just like you're screaming?
*  No, not in a screaming, no.
*  But just angry.
*  What does angry look like?
*  Is it still calm?
*  Yeah, like a few seconds of complaining, but then it goes away.
*  Have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall or something like that?
*  No, I never get that angry.
*  Cause that's just silly.
*  It's like, it's, it's, it's, if I would have done that, I would not be able to
*  control my emotions prior to a fight.
*  That would be a reflection.
*  Letting yourself lose.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, losing control that will reflect other times.
*  Do you think it has, uh, make you in part made you more emotionally
*  closed off from the world?
*  Like you're, you're, it's harder for you to be vulnerable to others.
*  Probably.
*  Yeah.
*  But I heard that a few times.
*  Got emotionally close.
*  It's yeah.
*  Maybe that I think that influenced it.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever cried in a movie?
*  Yeah.
*  For not for many years before that thing, maybe I'm getting older.
*  Do you remember the movie?
*  Something.
*  No, it's a silly movie.
*  I mean, it's no, I mean, I'll say the last few years I've been crying more
*  than before for some reason, I don't know why it's like silly movies.
*  Like nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I've already, I already just having met you and interacted with you, I can
*  see that you're kind of opening your heart and mind to the world.
*  You could, you could see like, here's this historically great athlete.
*  Now, like the wars have been fought and you're now like waking up to the world.
*  This is cool to see.
*  Probably I'm bringing my guard down now.
*  I don't have to keep it up.
*  You can even do some podcasts.
*  Um, you said you watched like movies beforehand.
*  Sometimes mentioned Braveheart.
*  What were you doing?
*  Did you watch something beforehand?
*  Like the day before?
*  I used to, yeah, I, there was like, I think Braveheart and gladiator.
*  I mean, there's a few others that I've always watched the day before.
*  Cause the day before I used to do nothing.
*  I just want to be at home in bed watching TV, like saving, you know, energy
*  stretching by myself.
*  So it's like, it's just want to save energy.
*  I don't know where's my energy going out, going around.
*  So, you know, those are the movies that I always like to watch.
*  I'm just kind of trying to bring some, you know, hyper excitement.
*  It's like, you know, I'm getting ready to walk tomorrow.
*  So I'm like, let me watch some movies that like brought that, you know, some,
*  that warrior spirit into me.
*  Yeah.
*  What is that about human nature?
*  Braveheart I love even more.
*  Should you put your life on the line for a thing that matters or run away?
*  Just so you can live.
*  It's like running, you may live, but like years from now, when you look back at
*  this moment, would you trade all the days just to come back to this moment?
*  And tell the English you could take our lives, but you can't take our freedom.
*  I mean, man, what is that about human nature?
*  Is there some aspect of like the glory you were able to achieve being more
*  important than anything else?
*  There's some aspect of that.
*  That that's, that's greatness.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  I never pursue glory.
*  So it's, it just came, you know, it is, it came with it, but that was never my goal.
*  I never care for glory.
*  Were you able to experience like, like I'm at the height of this thing, whatever,
*  whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things.
*  Holy shit.
*  I'm flying.
*  I felt like no one can touch me.
*  I can destroy people.
*  Yeah.
*  Prolonged periods of time or just momentarily?
*  I always knew, you know, from before I got to a black belt, like I, you know,
*  it's, I can be great because my, you know, I used to train with the best in the world.
*  I used to, you know, for many years and I used to see my progression
*  with, and everybody else.
*  So I knew I was getting somewhere.
*  I knew I could be the best.
*  And that was, that was always my goal since very, very young.
*  And I always believed that I could be in that over the years that kept telling me
*  over and over again, because I'm getting better and better faster than everybody else.
*  So it's, I just need to carry on with what I'm doing.
*  But I think you've said that you wanted to, and maybe you thought you could be the
*  greatest of all time, like at the very beginning.
*  Like when you sucked.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Not, not the greatest of all time because I never really thought about that, but I
*  thought I'm going to be the best in the world when I sucked, when I sucked.
*  Okay.
*  So what is that?
*  Uh, what is that?
*  Like that self-belief is there a component to that self-belief being a prerequisite?
*  It's difficult to say because that was a decision, I think.
*  Like, why did I believe that I could be?
*  I can't tell you that because I don't know.
*  But you think you decided to be?
*  I decided to be.
*  I decided to be, and I believed I could.
*  You think there was like a day somewhere when you were young where you're like,
*  huh, you're sitting on a couch eating Cheetos.
*  I don't think it was a day, like a moment because for many years I wasn't
*  really training much as a child.
*  I mean, I've done a bit of, I used to train and then stop, done a bit of judo,
*  never stay away from it much, but until, you know, like from 10 to 14, I barely
*  trained Jiu-Jitsu much.
*  I used to, there was no Gracie school near where I used to live.
*  And I was doing, there was a Jiu-Jitsu, a Judo school.
*  I used to go twice a week.
*  I went to a Jiu-Jitsu tournament.
*  I lost in five seconds, left crying.
*  The guy he pulled me in five seconds.
*  Anyway, so when I was 14, I went to the south of Brazil to see my uncle,
*  Hylian, to spend some summer holidays.
*  I was there for like four weeks, I think.
*  And when I got there, my cousin, Hollis, were living with him.
*  Hollis is like bigger than me.
*  It was, I think it's four years, four years older.
*  So I was 14, was already 18, 17, 18, purple belt competitor.
*  And I think that was the first time in my life that I felt what it
*  meant, what it meant to be a Gracie in terms of having a school, teaching,
*  training, you know, living that Jiu-Jitsu lifestyle, what a Gracie meant to be.
*  And I've just, I've loved that.
*  I was out of shape.
*  My uncle was like, you know, incentivizing me to lose weight, to train,
*  but you're not training, why?
*  You know, it's like, you're out of shape, you need to diet.
*  So I used to run every day.
*  I was eating super well.
*  I started, you know, I started, that's when I started changing.
*  So when I go back to Rio, I was super motivated to follow up, carry on.
*  And he, you know, he invited me to go back there to live with him, but I couldn't,
*  it was too soon to change schools and everything.
*  My mom said, no, but maybe next year, if you want to go, you can.
*  So I kept that in my mind.
*  Next year, I moved to the South to live with him.
*  I was 15.
*  And it was him, my uncle, Hillion, and my uncle, Crawlin.
*  They both used to live very close to each other.
*  They used to have their own schools close to each other.
*  So I was with both.
*  And I stayed there for almost a year.
*  I mean, I was the youngest in the academy.
*  There was some, you know, blue, purple bells, normal guy, but they're
*  already competing, training ahead of me.
*  And I just joined the group of training.
*  I didn't compete while I was there because there was no competition at that time.
*  And I wasn't really ready, but it's not about competing.
*  It's more about the training.
*  And I started training every day, started improving.
*  And a year after that, when I came back to Rio, I was already on a mission.
*  I was like, I love this.
*  I'm just carrying on training every day with my uncle Carlos,
*  Carlos Gracie Jr., Gracie Baja.
*  And the one I got there, I was training a little bit there before,
*  but I was just 14, 15.
*  But when I got there, there was one of the most competitors, one of the biggest
*  Jiu-Jitsu schools at the time.
*  There were so many high level world champions, competitors in every single belt.
*  And so I've kind of joined in with that.
*  And I've carried on, I don't remember when, but I remember, you know, looking
*  and saying, I'm going to be the best in the world, but I used to be, I was at
*  the bottom of the stairs, you know, no one really believed me.
*  I didn't shout, you know, to disguise, but, you know, I told a few people, I'm
*  like, I'm going to be the best.
*  And that's, I think I was just losing, but I've never ever doubt.
*  I've never diverged from that mission.
*  I would say.
*  Did anyone believe you when you said you're going to be great?
*  Nobody.
*  Did it matter?
*  Didn't matter.
*  I don't care.
*  I don't need.
*  Even people that like love you.
*  Everybody, my mom, my dad, I mean, no one thought, no one in my family
*  thought I was going to be here today.
*  Nobody.
*  Because I just started late.
*  No, I've never had any start that people, or that kid's going to be really good.
*  No, I was a chubby kid that didn't barely train.
*  I mean, people used to look at me, just another grace.
*  There's, you know, one more.
*  What do you learn from that?
*  Do you think most people lose that self belief?
*  They quit when everyone around them doesn't believe.
*  Yeah.
*  I think if, if those that need approval, yes.
*  I see you shouldn't have approval.
*  I never need approval from anyone.
*  I don't care if you believe you're not, if you're not my problem.
*  It's tough.
*  It's tough.
*  I don't need approval, but you're surrounded by people older, wiser, better
*  than you, and they're kind of directly or indirectly saying you stop being silly.
*  No, no one ever told me that because I, I is not, that was not something that I used
*  to say all the time.
*  I've maybe said this very, very few times.
*  I just, you know, maybe that's the secret.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, if you start shouting, then you just been silly.
*  Then it's not what you really want.
*  Then you saying that for another reasons.
*  If you say it over and over again, because you shouldn't.
*  I mean, why?
*  Well, to push back, one of the reasons you might want to say it is to find the
*  right people that believe in you.
*  Yeah.
*  But not if you say over and over again, then it's just, then you're just bragging.
*  Sure.
*  Cause one thing is to say it, but the other one is to do it.
*  So it's, you know, you say that once or very few times, but now we have to do it.
*  Saying is not helping you getting there.
*  Was there sacrifices you had to make?
*  Everything.
*  Everything.
*  That was my priority in life.
*  Everything was secondary.
*  Like social life.
*  Yeah.
*  Career paths.
*  All of the same.
*  And as from 14, 15, 16, as you get better and better and better and better, it was
*  just becoming sharper, the focus on this thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just over and over again, over and over again.
*  It's, you know, it's just training, training, training.
*  And I mean, how many times I lost.
*  I have no clue.
*  So on the mat, you were getting beat up.
*  I'm getting smashed by everybody.
*  People my age, I was chubby.
*  I was physically weak.
*  I mean, I'm tall, but physically I'm not physically strong.
*  I'm normally strong for my size, but physically, if you want to measure strength,
*  I'm weak because you know, we can measure strength, living weight, living weight.
*  I'm weak.
*  I don't lift.
*  I lift weight same as people much lighter than me.
*  Everybody, my weight lifts heavy, heavy weight.
*  And then people that train with you often talk about how strong you are.
*  They're super strong because I generate a lot of strength.
*  I can create, I put myself in the right angles so that I can be strong.
*  I'm not strong.
*  And the only person who I listen to saying that is a computer.
*  One guy that I fought, Rodrigo Medeiros, I fought him a few times and he's the
*  only one that I heard saying about me.
*  He's like, no, Roger's not strong.
*  He's not, he's technical and he can create strength, but he's not strong.
*  He meant that as a compliment?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  No, I think he was honest because I think he's the only one who could see that.
*  Yes.
*  So I think that's a compliment.
*  So he's technically really strong.
*  So you had incredible match with him.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there insight you have about how you went from a person who was not very good,
*  but had a dream, a confident dream, a vision to somebody that was actually good.
*  Was there something to the practice sessions?
*  Were you getting reps on a specific techniques?
*  I'd never done anything special because I mean, I'm in a gym training equally
*  with everybody else.
*  So I've never did anything on the side different than anybody else.
*  So I've, you know, I was in the school training the exact the same way as everybody else.
*  Wow.
*  In terms of schedule, yes.
*  But what was, can you reverse engineer what was going through your mind?
*  Cause there's so many different ways to actually mentally approach the same exact
*  training session.
*  I'm going to try to beat you.
*  Okay.
*  So in some part is competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you said, you're not going to be able to do it.
*  So in some part is competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Like at the core of it is I want to be better than these particular people.
*  You're going to keep beating me.
*  I'm going to keep coming back at you.
*  And to do that, I have to solve problems.
*  I have to figure out how to do stuff.
*  Well, you catch me once.
*  I'm going to keep on coming, trying to not get, get, get caught in that.
*  At which point did you develop a game that was basically the white, the famous
*  white belt game of the very basics, the very fundamentals of jujitsu, like
*  saying, I'm going to beat you.
*  Never.
*  There was never, there was never a conscious decision to try to, you know, to
*  have a basic jujitsu first.
*  I think there's a big misconception there.
*  Okay.
*  My jujitsu is not basic.
*  Mr.
*  Roger Gracie.
*  It's not, he right.
*  It's not basic.
*  It's not old school.
*  I think people, they just don't see that.
*  It's extremely complex.
*  In a way that is people, they cannot copy.
*  I teach people, you know, I can teach you the cross-collar choke, but the one
*  thing that people, they don't realize is not the move is you need to practice
*  the movement you learn is the practice over and over again.
*  Like it took me years.
*  When I say years, I'm like years after I was a black belt, I was able to
*  choke people out with a cross-collar choking them out effectively years
*  after I got my black belt.
*  So that's something that you learn first day, first week.
*  So I can teach you.
*  It makes no difference.
*  You, you know, the theory, but until you apply it in, I mean, you will help you.
*  Of course, the more details you learn, you know, the, the more tools you have
*  to practice, but it's still very complex because it's not about the move itself.
*  It's about how can you control the movement of the other person?
*  He's resisting you blocking.
*  You cannot predict what he would do.
*  And he's doing a whole bunch of moves to, to block you.
*  Every single move you do a step of the way, because it's a, it's a progression
*  of move from beginning to end till I apply the choke is a progression of move.
*  And there's not one way to get that.
*  There's many ways because how many ways can you blocked?
*  You can put your arm in every single angle.
*  We have both arms.
*  You can bridge.
*  So it's dealing with all that.
*  That's is the, that's is the complex complexity of that position.
*  But that goes for everything.
*  Like every single move, my strong moves outside, it took me years developing them years.
*  So it's, and you're going to tell me that's basic.
*  So go try and do it.
*  What the other person is defending.
*  That's the thing, because most of the things that I do, I've been doing them for years.
*  And I, they know that I'm going to do, and I can still get it most of the times.
*  That's the hardest is when they know what's coming in, you can still do it.
*  And you said that the way you're able to do that, you just have to do it right.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you learn by doing all the steps along the way?
*  And just for people who don't know cross collar choke from the mount.
*  So you just, it starts in a neutral place.
*  There's people on their feet and then you either, then you get to the ground somehow.
*  And then there's the person on top and on bottom, and then there's a guard with the legs
*  between the two people and then you can get past the guard as you get past the guard and you,
*  into side control and so on.
*  You get more and more and more dominant positions.
*  And so Mount is considered to be one of the most dominant positions.
*  It's when you're past their legs, sitting on top of their stomach, putting pressure on them
*  and cross collar choke is using their jacket to, how would you explain that?
*  To choke them with their.
*  So you have the collars, I put my both hands on your collars and when I squeeze, it,
*  it press your neck, it blocks the vein.
*  You go to sleep.
*  So it's a, you, you, you choke people with your hands in the wrist.
*  You put them, you know, you grab the collar, so you got the wrist around people's neck
*  and you squeeze.
*  Yep.
*  The discovery of that is fascinating.
*  I mean, cause it's, it's interesting.
*  It's like, you know, you can imagine there's all kinds of ways to choke a human being,
*  what animals do with their like mouth, right?
*  They put like their jaws around the, and the fact that you can kind of discover this
*  methodology of the right kind of positioning.
*  And then it becomes an art form, like of why this, why not this, right?
*  Or why not this or something?
*  Like to figure out.
*  I think we, we practice that will come easy over time.
*  You figure out what works and what not.
*  And you, and then, and then more further and further details and subtleties start to
*  emerge anyway on that process of beating, of being able to beat some of the best people
*  in the world and the thing they know is coming.
*  What did you, what's the difference in the white belt doing that and Hadrian
*  Gracie doing that?
*  The thing that's so hard to explain.
*  What do you think you're picking up?
*  Is it some tiny, tiny details and muscle movements?
*  It is.
*  It's many tiny details because it's the whole movement itself is the perception from
*  beginning to end, like every step of that movement.
*  It's important and precise.
*  So it's, you know, you miss once one detail on the way he collapsed.
*  So when I say that with the black belt, the black belt has no control over the whole
*  movement.
*  He's thinking beginning and end.
*  So he goes straight to, you know, straight to your neck.
*  Regardless, he cannot read the other person.
*  If it's, you know, if it's time to let go, if it's the time to go for a neck, it
*  should I be pushing here before I get my hand in?
*  You know, is this the right time to go deep or should I deal with this first before
*  the second hand?
*  That's at the beginning.
*  So it's at the white belt, at the very beginning of the journey.
*  Yeah.
*  The white belt, you just think, finish.
*  Yeah.
*  And then as you get progressed, you see that there's like this giant tree of
*  possibilities that you're almost feeling your way down.
*  I mean, would you be able to teach?
*  Explo...
*  Do you even know what you're doing?
*  By the details.
*  Okay.
*  But it's hard to convert into words, probably.
*  No.
*  It's possible.
*  Then you don't know what you're doing.
*  Okay.
*  So what is, what is some most important details that you could say, maybe
*  positioning of the hand, the gripping, is it the positioning of your body, the
*  posture, is there some interesting like insights?
*  It's a, it's a, it's a combination because first you have to put your body in a
*  very strong position that you don't require your hands to hold them out.
*  So the choke is that that's first because I can not use, I can not use my
*  hands on the floor to stop you escaping.
*  Yeah.
*  So if I had to, my body has to handle that.
*  The way I position myself, I have to do it in a way that don't
*  require my hands for balance.
*  Okay.
*  Why is the mouth such a dominant position?
*  It doesn't make any sense, right?
*  Like you're just sitting on top of the stomach of a person.
*  It makes all sense.
*  If you think what's, forget fighting, forget Jiu-Jitsu, like you've never
*  trained, what's the one position, the most dominant position you can get
*  over another human being.
*  One, the most for you, which one it is like the most dominant position that
*  you can get over another human being.
*  So if we were just, cause the way I think about it is putting myself in like a
*  six, seven, eight year old self without knowing any martial arts and had an
*  older brother who'd beat the shit out of me.
*  Uh, yeah, it probably was Mount.
*  It, what,
*  okay.
*  But, well, yes.
*  Okay.
*  So we both didn't know, but if we knew something, it'd probably be back control.
*  If in the back control, you're under the other person, the thing being under is
*  the most dominant position it can be over another person.
*  You mean like a back control?
*  If I'm on your back, you can move, you can roll.
*  I cannot stop you rolling.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, maybe you can even stand up.
*  How dominant is that?
*  Yeah.
*  But if we're the same size, both untrained.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  Do you have you seen kids do they do that?
*  Cause okay, Mount looks and feels like dominance when you're two
*  eight year olds fighting.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know why it feels that way.
*  It could be some animalistic thing.
*  Maybe it is actual dominance.
*  I don't know, but it feels like if you're untrained, you can just buck your way out
*  of it.
*  It feels unstable.
*  It feels unstable to hold Mount unless you know what you're doing.
*  Right?
*  No.
*  Well, if you, if you're multi put both of your hands on the floor, just your
*  hands, I think it's easy to take somebody off.
*  Yeah, maybe not.
*  The thing is easy to remove the hand and bring them out the hands on the floor.
*  I'm straight.
*  I'm leaning in.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  I mean, you don't need to know fighting to hold yourself that.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're right.
*  When you take the arms off and balancing, then it gets tricky.
*  Cause when you're trying to, um, I think what happens, I'm thinking back to eight
*  year old.
*  Cause my brother's five years older than me and he would do the usual, like stop
*  hitting yourself thing.
*  And I think he would be in Mount like hitting me with my own hands, uh, from
*  out of place of love.
*  Of course.
*  Um, I love him deeply and it was very formative and a positive experience for me.
*  Okay.
*  Um, I think, yeah, the weakness is when he takes, well, when the person who has
*  you Mount takes their arms off to, to do something.
*  But even if you keep your hands up in the air, when I'm falling, yeah,
*  when I'm falling, so I'm speaking about untrained people.
*  I feel like they get greedy.
*  They try to do stuff.
*  The other day I watched my nine year old daughter.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm in a friend's house.
*  There's a whole bunch of kids that they playing.
*  And when I looked, she's mounting a boy, her AIDS, her size.
*  He cannot escape.
*  Wow.
*  She probably seen.
*  No, she trains.
*  She's been training for I'll say a year and a half.
*  She's not much.
*  I mean, she's a nine year old daughter, a girl over a boy.
*  Has she seen footage of you?
*  Maybe she picked up.
*  She'd been training for a year and a half.
*  So she has an idea what Mount is, but I mean, it tells about skills.
*  I don't never taught her the Mount.
*  Yeah.
*  Is she has, you know, she had lessons at the Academy like any other kid.
*  Did you make him cry or no, but he couldn't escape.
*  Which, which other position would she be able to hold that boy in the, in the back?
*  He would roll it out.
*  That's true.
*  Like he couldn't come out from underneath.
*  I she's their kids.
*  Like there is no other most dominant position that you can pin the other person.
*  Couldn't you argue from that perspective, psych control?
*  No, no, because I can show you have to, to hold the other person and it's, you're not free.
*  You, you, you cannot release them.
*  But inside control, your hips are not on top of theirs.
*  So they can't buck you off.
*  Right.
*  Can you, if you're holding them a little bit and then you can hit them with one hand.
*  Well, his head is here.
*  You're going to hurt him here.
*  But the time you're doing that, but then he has his arms free.
*  And if you turn towards your legs, then he's away from your arms.
*  You know, even has the perfect angle.
*  I mean, it is a good position.
*  You can hit, you can dominate, but it's not the best position to be over the other person.
*  He can knee you in the head at the same time you punch him.
*  Then there's a knee coming to your head.
*  I love playing devil's advocate with Roger Gracie about two eight year olds fighting.
*  And you, and you, your head is closer to his head.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he can give throw you a punch.
*  All right.
*  Would you choose to be in psych control of a month getting in the head?
*  Well, for a person who in competition prefers neon belly over a mount.
*  Um, but that's my weakness.
*  That's my failure as a human being holding Mount is, is can be tricky.
*  It's very hard.
*  Of course it's hard, but what is easy?
*  Uh, control and neon bellies easier, but to submit is easy.
*  Easier.
*  I'm not saying black belt level.
*  I'm saying, well, maybe even black belt.
*  Is it for what?
*  To hold somebody.
*  To make them squirm and hurt, to create openings.
*  I'm a go to there with a big guy.
*  Yeah, you can't.
*  You can't.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to push you back and come up in the mouth.
*  He can't see it up.
*  Not when he mounted him.
*  The thing is also about Mount is people on the bottom of Mount panic more.
*  So they fight harder.
*  Panic.
*  They're exposed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the most exposure you have because the post arms are free.
*  You cannot touch him.
*  His head is too high.
*  There's nothing he can do that.
*  His legs won't get you anywhere.
*  He might touch your lower back.
*  It's like nothing you do.
*  You do your most exposed being in the mouth.
*  I rarely, you hold me side control a thousand times.
*  The amount of me having to look up for your face, come down.
*  Yeah.
*  Side control.
*  I hug you.
*  You cannot hurt me.
*  Okay.
*  Hold me, but I'm hugging you.
*  If I hug you tight, what can you do against me?
*  It seems maybe it's just from, uh, and again, I'm arguing just for the fun of it,
*  but, um, it seems like a more difficult skill to learn to apply a huge amount of
*  pressure and weight from Mount.
*  You don't have to apply pressure and weight from Mount.
*  Not apply pressure, but be heavy.
*  Right.
*  You don't necessarily need to be heavy.
*  You don't.
*  No.
*  Why do you, as people say, you feel extremely heavy?
*  If I'm putting, if I'm being heavy, I cannot attack.
*  I, I have to choose.
*  I can be heavy just to pin a lot, you know, just to pin them, take the
*  energy out, you know, to make them suffer.
*  But the moment that I decide to attack, I can only be heavy if I'm sitting up straight.
*  That's when my, all my weight can drops down.
*  If I'm high, then I'm sitting on your chest and on your, on your solar plexus.
*  That's the worst position to be seated on the person because that's where he breathed.
*  So you're in a high mount, sitting up straight.
*  That's when you can, I can be very heavy.
*  I can make people, you know, feel my weight and, you know, be very
*  uncomfortable, but I'm not in a position to attack the moment that I want to attack.
*  My body has to lean forward.
*  I have to approach the neck or the arms.
*  The moment that I do that, my weight comes off my hips.
*  It goes to my knees, the way it is off you.
*  But at that point, if you have, now I'm attacking, I'm no longer heavy on you.
*  But you want to be at that point to remove any of the defenses they have, or
*  some of the defenses by getting their elbows.
*  Now I'm like either getting in, trying to get your call or bringing your
*  elbow across to attack the armlock.
*  So what are some interesting details along the way that are tough to get, to
*  figure out what were the big leaps for you from white belt to, to, to the best in the world?
*  It's, you're trying to attack the neck, you know, putting one hand in the collar.
*  You're priving yourself that hand to pace it on the floor.
*  So now you're vulnerable to get breached, to get rollover.
*  Cause if your hands are free trying to roll you over, you're stopped.
*  The moment that you put your hand in the person's collar, now you have to be very
*  careful with your body positioning.
*  Very careful.
*  The distribution of the weight.
*  Yeah.
*  And how, you know, how high you sit, you know, how tall your, your, your, your
*  upper body goes and then the biggest challenge comes as you're trying the second
*  hand, that's the, you know, for the, for the choke, that's the biggest challenge.
*  The second hand, because you already have, you know, you already don't have one hand.
*  Now you, you, you are trying the second hand and if one of my hand is in, you
*  as a defending yourself, you have two hands.
*  One hand is already on one side.
*  This, this side is getting attacked.
*  You have two hands blocking that.
*  I have one hand.
*  There's no help for that hand.
*  I cannot remove anything.
*  That's the biggest challenge getting one hand, getting past two and not getting
*  rollover.
*  But I also have two hands on bottom.
*  I have two hands and can also turn and do all kinds of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  And my whole mind and everything is focused on that second hand.
*  It's a big challenge.
*  It's hard.
*  Very hard.
*  Is there an art to getting the first hand into a place where you.
*  It's less of a art because it's easier.
*  I'll say most times I get my first hand in is when you're trying some move, you're
*  trying to scape, you're pushing.
*  I get the first hand in as an opportunity.
*  And it's going to sit there for a while.
*  And now I go as deep as I can.
*  So the first hand, because the second hand is the hardest, I have to compensate the
*  first thing to be as deep as I can.
*  If I can not get the first hand in deep, I won't try the second.
*  I need that first hand deep.
*  Then I go for the.
*  And it's deep and everything is like super like tight, super tight.
*  The first thing has to be super tight.
*  Otherwise the chance of failing is very big.
*  Okay.
*  Does the opponent usually feel like they're screwed at that point also?
*  No, as you put in the first hand in the moment that I position myself just prior
*  to attempt the second hand, I think the way I, my, my body is positioned the way
*  I'm, I'm collapsing with my weight and they feel this like it's, I'm, you know,
*  this is terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  How long did it take you to figure out how to reposition your weight once
*  the first hand is in very quickly?
*  Because do I get breached out?
*  Okay.
*  So that there's a good feedback.
*  Yeah.
*  Because one mistake you out, like one off positioning you out.
*  But you still have to do that against the best people in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Where's the way out for most people?
*  Like if you were in Mount against Buccecce or some of the best defenses in the world.
*  The way out is to, I mean, is the obviously is to defend themselves and, you know,
*  prevent the first hand to get deep.
*  And I'll say the best thing that they could do is try to change my positioning
*  on the Mount in a way that, you know, push me to a very low Mount, you know, try to,
*  to, to, to, to, to change the way I'm dominating you not to be, you know,
*  to get me off the high Mount pretty much.
*  Are you always, is it a slow, is it a fast thing to go from low to fast?
*  A high Mount.
*  Slow, very slow.
*  Because I need to beat your arms because you're holding me down.
*  And the arms come out.
*  It's a slow, it's a slow process.
*  Okay.
*  And you just, is there like a...
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's, it's, use my legs against your arms.
*  So it's my legs pushing your arms.
*  But how do you get them?
*  How do you get your legs into the elbows?
*  As long as it's, you know, it has to come under the tip of your elbow.
*  Cause now the legs will start forcing your arms up.
*  So your legs aren't like spread out there.
*  No.
*  They're in.
*  Your elbow cannot get inside my leg.
*  Because that means I'm in a very low Mount.
*  And then I cannot attack because I cannot ignore that.
*  Cause the moment that I attack that will, you will start pushing my leg to push me up.
*  What's the secret to getting the second hand in?
*  There's two ways.
*  You go four fingers inside, which is the hardest because with the moment that your two hands are
*  defending, you'll be blocking the, the, the, you know, the way.
*  And I cannot clear an attack two hands against one.
*  So I go thumb in, I go behind the ear.
*  So my thumb and my grip goes, because for you to defend, you need to get there.
*  And when you get there, you elevate your elbow, you suppose the armlock.
*  So it's hard.
*  So you put the thumb in and then there's the dreaded, like the other person just waits for you to loop
*  the arm over.
*  But that, that this over.
*  Once you get the thumb in, it's over.
*  Okay.
*  No, but when I'm there, it's, if I get that it, cause they're bridging, you know, they try.
*  I'm not using their hand to post.
*  Now your head is very close to the floor.
*  When I've tried to bridge and, you know, my forehead would touch the floor.
*  That would be used as a hand, but it's not on the floor.
*  Not necessarily.
*  Because if he's on the floor, my body's collapse over you.
*  So there's no place for my hand for me to work on your neck.
*  So I need some space between us.
*  So I don't completely.
*  Maybe you can bob up and down.
*  I try to keep a gap between us.
*  So that pursuit that takes many, many, many, many years.
*  I don't know if you've seen your dreams of sushi, the doing the simple thing.
*  That's not so simple, but it kind of looks simple over and over and over and over and over.
*  And presumably getting much better.
*  Very simple.
*  It becomes very simple, but you're picking up details probably along the way.
*  There's wisdom along the way.
*  What is that?
*  Is that there's like lessons that you just kind of accumulate over time.
*  Like one training sessions, you'll see maybe like the positioning of the thumb,
*  like this detailed positioning of the thumb or something like this.
*  And then you like, okay, you like load that in.
*  That will be very basic because there is not that many different ways.
*  Maybe one, two, I just do one.
*  Any other is not as strong because it's about getting a strong grip on your collar.
*  I mean, the thumb goes inside.
*  Is it the thumb in or four fingers in?
*  But it's getting a strong grip on the collar as long as it's just holding and feeling strong.
*  So that's just two options.
*  So it's the dynamic stuff along the way.
*  And then some of that is timing too.
*  It's timing.
*  Are you also like making people like faking them out,
*  making them think about something else?
*  No, not at that point.
*  That's not because I cannot fake anything else at that point.
*  Because I will have to change my positioning to, you know, maybe to fake an armlock.
*  Then I have to move out from that.
*  So then I will lose that control I have.
*  So what's the process towards mastery?
*  If you were to convert that to something that generalizes beyond jiu-jitsu,
*  how can you get that good at a simple thing?
*  Practice.
*  That simple.
*  The same exact thing over and over.
*  It's just a matter of how long it will take you.
*  That's true.
*  I mean, like I said, look how long it took me.
*  People give up along the way.
*  There is intricacies to that journey towards perfection.
*  There's a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu for decades and don't get better.
*  No, because they don't train the way they should.
*  They don't train to get better.
*  They train to get tough.
*  That's a big difference.
*  Most people, they train to get tough.
*  So they are tough.
*  Like we were talking before, they don't practice the weakness.
*  You want to be good at, you want to be really good at jiu-jitsu.
*  You have to practice your weakness, not your strength.
*  You have to practice everything, but you have to be equally strong in every position.
*  They're all exactly the same.
*  Your guard top-bottom, side control top-bottom, turtle, half guard, mount, back.
*  I mean, you pick, take down.
*  And then you get into details of escaping triangle, applying the triangle, escaping armlock,
*  different scenarios of, the one thing is defending the armlock when you have your arms
*  very close to your body.
*  The other thing is to defend the arms when your arm is almost getting, and then when
*  you got your arms.
*  So there's so many things to practice that you need to repeat them over and over again
*  until you're confident enough that when you get there, you have a chance.
*  And you can do the same kind of thing for even the final stages of a cross choke from mount.
*  Everything.
*  I mean, of course, like you don't practice escaping the armlock with a full arm straight
*  because that's gone.
*  I mean, you practice escaping the armlock when he takes your arm, you have a chance of
*  trying to escape, but you don't practice.
*  You know, okay, take my arm.
*  When I say go, go, I mean, you got, you know, you put the arm.
*  That is like you get injured doing that.
*  Scape in the cross collar choke.
*  It's I mean, scape not letting the person get there.
*  You can scape.
*  You can practice scaping triangles because you know, it's like it's you have a way better
*  chance of scaping triangle than, okay, mount on me, put both hands in my neck.
*  I mean, it's over, you know, don't be there.
*  What's the best submission in Jiu Jitsu?
*  A choke, I would say.
*  From which position?
*  If I gave you a billion dollars to start in a position like in a submission and you only
*  get the billion, if you get the submission, which one would you start?
*  Cross collar choke in the mouth.
*  Cross collar choke in the mouth, not from the back.
*  No, you have a better chance scaping from the back.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Even with the hooks?
*  Even with everything.
*  Do you think some people will disagree with you?
*  I don't care.
*  I have a better chance scaping from the back than if you mount on me, put my hands on my neck.
*  So if you were facing yourself and I will give you a billion dollars to escape,
*  you would pick from the back?
*  A thousand times over.
*  Like, no comparison.
*  You have like with hooks, with like a triangle?
*  Doesn't matter.
*  You can do whatever you want.
*  Like a body triangle?
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Really?
*  A thousand times over.
*  No questions.
*  So to you, the mount is a super controlling position.
*  It's not just...
*  Because cross collar choke in the mount, the moment that you put both hands on my neck,
*  your arms need to be very close to your body to attack.
*  So that means there's very little space between us.
*  So that means there's very little escape space for you to work on your escape.
*  And the moment that you cannot bridge, let's suppose I have,
*  you know, the person has a good mouth so you cannot bridge him off.
*  What else?
*  You don't have space to try to work on your defense.
*  Being in the back, I have all the space around me to work on my defense, on my arms.
*  I have the mobility to bring them anywhere.
*  So I, because of that, he gives you and me a much better chance.
*  And you cannot, I can move my body.
*  If you're on my back, you cannot pin me.
*  I cannot take you off my back.
*  First, I need to defend the choke, but you have no control over my body.
*  So that means there's still a lot of movement that I can try to use to escape.
*  In the mount, there's no movement.
*  I'm pinned down.
*  I cannot move and I have no space between us to escape.
*  Well, the argument against that, this is great, is that on the bottom of mount,
*  I do have my hands between...
*  So you're saying they're pinned.
*  There's nothing.
*  Between where?
*  You could get them in theory.
*  You could somehow, you could...
*  You can, but then there's no space.
*  They will be squeezed between our bodies.
*  If it's an incredible mount.
*  No, it does not mount.
*  Standing, if I put both hands on your neck, if I'm going to go for the cross collar choke,
*  after I get my hands in, the next step is to pull you close to me.
*  So it's this, my arms needs to be close to me.
*  I can put, there's the hands that could do something.
*  They can come in, but there's a very limited space between us.
*  No, I mean to push your body away.
*  Only through standing, not if your back is against the floor.
*  The argument against the mount, or the argument for back controls being the most dominant position,
*  is even though I have hands, I can't really use them effectively.
*  Not in the mount.
*  There's no space.
*  In the mount, there's no space.
*  There's no space.
*  You can try.
*  I mean, you can squeeze your hand in.
*  There's still things that you could do, but they're so limited.
*  So if you polled the 100 best competitors of all time,
*  what do you think they would answer to that?
*  Do you think most would agree with you?
*  I don't care.
*  You showed me their skills, their ability to see.
*  Okay, so the perfect mount versus the perfect back control.
*  There's no question.
*  Okay, there's no question.
*  For me, I mean, argue with me, like show me, because I'm not being stubborn, because I'm being...
*  Scientific.
*  So explain it to me why the back, it would be harder,
*  it would be better to your position to finish the mount.
*  If you can explain it to me why, I might change my mind.
*  I was trying to, but I don't have the cred.
*  I'm like a middle school science student trying to talk to Einstein here.
*  Okay, besides you, who do you think is the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time?
*  Can you make the case for some of them?
*  Marcelo, Buccecha, Leandro Lowe.
*  I'll have to go with Buccecha, because look at how many titles he has.
*  I mean, he has by far more than Marcelo.
*  Marcelo stopped quite early.
*  Leandro Lowe has eight, but Buccecha is better than him.
*  What do you think makes Buccecha so good?
*  He's a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight.
*  He moves very fast, but he's very agile for his size.
*  So the agility combined with aggression.
*  Yeah, so he's very hard to control him, because he moves fast, and he's 112 kilos,
*  115 sometimes, or 110.
*  I'm not sure, but he's around that.
*  So 240 in pounds.
*  So when you're agile, 240 pounds, that makes it very hard to control you.
*  What about making the case for some others?
*  What about the little guys?
*  What about Marcelo, if you were to make the case for him being the strongest?
*  What makes Marcelo good?
*  Marcelo Garcia is extremely technical.
*  I mean, I think he's one of my favorite Jiu-Jitsu fighters,
*  because in a technical way, I think he's probably one of the best.
*  Because raw technique and a bunch of different positions for submissions.
*  He's not very powerful.
*  Physically, he's not very strong, but he can make himself very strong,
*  and his technique is very, very high level.
*  Have you ever trained with him?
*  No, I fought him twice.
*  Yeah.
*  He's much smaller than me.
*  What happened in those matches?
*  The first fight, I tapped him, I think, five minutes.
*  In which submission?
*  Choke from the back.
*  Collar choke from the back.
*  And the second time, I beat him by points, but a very large, I think 12-2.
*  Actually, just to continue, I wonder if John Donahue would agree with you about mountain back.
*  I can't wait to hear it.
*  This is a bear versus lion conversation.
*  I'm looking, there's statistics about...
*  I'm not letting this go.
*  There's statistics about...
*  Oh, look at that, Hodger.
*  What do you know, looking at Hodger Gracie's statistics for most successful submissions?
*  Choke from the back is the most.
*  So how do you explain that, Mr. Scientist?
*  Because people panic when I'm out.
*  They turn the back.
*  I choked him out.
*  That's one explanation.
*  But for people, it is interesting that, of course, this doesn't capture,
*  but this captures a lot of your major matches.
*  And we should say that you've submitted most of your opponents.
*  So you rarely win on points.
*  Usually wins submissions.
*  Choke from back is most of them, then cross choke from mount.
*  Arm bar is a lot too.
*  So 18 from choke from back, 12 cross choke, 10 arm bar, 5 RNC, rear nakedness, fennel gi.
*  Okay.
*  So Ezekiel...
*  So Ezekiel is very powerful.
*  I took out his strong weapon.
*  Yeah.
*  Also from mount.
*  Also from mount.
*  That's when you can't get the one hand in?
*  No, because the Ezekiel most times I use against people is the attack that as soon as I get to the mount,
*  when they're trying to escape the open up and I get them.
*  It has to be at that initial timing.
*  So it's not a thing you use to bother them in order to create...
*  Either I get it right away or I don't bother trying much.
*  Because you need to keep one hand behind the head.
*  And you're naturally on that position as soon as you mount most of the times.
*  And the moment that you mount someone, no one accept that they go mounted,
*  they're going to expose to get out.
*  So holding the head, it gives you a better way to dominate them initially,
*  to deal with that explosiveness on the beginning.
*  And then, but then you have to let go to try it.
*  You're a very limited holding the head.
*  In terms of goats, Shonji, I feel like he doesn't get enough credit that he deserves.
*  He had an extremely dominant performance in competition.
*  What about Salo and Shonji Hibero?
*  What are your thoughts about what makes them so good?
*  He had a bunch of tough matches with Shonji.
*  Yeah, eight times.
*  For eight times, Shonji, I fought Salo once.
*  I think I'm bringing up a sore point.
*  Oh, did Shonji tap when you...
*  Or did the time run out?
*  And that was the last time you guys faced each other.
*  Yeah, 2008.
*  That was incredible to watch.
*  I think you pulled guard with one minute left working towards attacking.
*  I mean, it's probably very tough to get anything.
*  And for people who don't know, time ran out.
*  You had something that looked like an armlock.
*  And Shonji looked like he may be tapping, but it looked like he might be just celebrating,
*  which is most likely.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  It was...
*  I'm not sure because I think his arm was just straight his arm time finish.
*  So I'm not sure if it was tapping to let go time is up.
*  Because I would say most likely the time was up.
*  Yeah, and also there's a thing where you start,
*  you realize there's only three, two seconds left.
*  You just kind of start celebrating.
*  You realize that Hajji is not going to be able to finish the Sambar in the time left.
*  So you start celebrating.
*  No, I think he tapped to say the time is up.
*  The time is up.
*  Anyway, what do you think that the longevity especially is impressive with Shonji?
*  How long...
*  I think he doesn't get credit as much as he deserves because he pushed his career very far.
*  And the last few years he was on his best.
*  So he's...
*  If he were to stop before, you know, people would remember him on his highest,
*  but he kind of pushed more than his peak, let's say.
*  How hard is it for you to walk away?
*  We'll talk about the journey into MMA as well.
*  But you basically, especially with the second match against Pucheshi,
*  basically walked away on top.
*  Beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time and just walking away.
*  It wasn't that hard, to be honest, because there was something that I was considering
*  for a while because the last few years of my career, let's say,
*  it was fighting MMA at the same time I was fighting Jiu-Jitsu,
*  and it is very challenging to do both.
*  Like I don't...
*  There's no another person who ever did that
*  because the training is a confliction with the way you train.
*  Everybody who starts doing MMA, starts focusing on MMA,
*  their Jiu-Jitsu gets worse because they stop training with the Gi.
*  Everybody, no exception.
*  Was your Jiu-Jitsu also getting worse?
*  No, because I made sure I kept training with the Gi
*  and I kept fighting at least the World Championship once a year.
*  That was my goal.
*  I'm like, I'm going to go for MMA, but I love Jiu-Jitsu and I still want to fight
*  the highest level.
*  I kept fighting once a year for a few years.
*  It was a challenge, especially because the two or three times when I competed at the Worlds,
*  it was right after the MMA fight I had.
*  No Gi, you don't have the grips.
*  So my grips, it made a big difference on my grip.
*  So I was weaker grip-wise.
*  So I felt that.
*  So I knew it was like it's unnecessary risk because if I cannot be 100%, so what am I doing this?
*  But I'm stubborn.
*  I love Jiu-Jitsu.
*  That's like I love fighting Jiu-Jitsu.
*  I never loved MMA.
*  I've liked it, but I think if it were Gracie, I wouldn't have done it.
*  So the thing you felt the most is the grips.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you win a Gi World Championship without gripping.
*  No.
*  Just pretending it's no Gi match, they get to grip you, but you don't.
*  No.
*  So grips are essential.
*  Of course.
*  How can you choke someone?
*  If your grips are weak, your forearms will fatigue and then you will have no power
*  and then you cannot do anything.
*  Yeah.
*  You could still arm lock.
*  Okay.
*  So I meant more not for the submission, but for the control of the game of it.
*  You need to grip to get there.
*  To get there.
*  And if your grips are weak.
*  You also have grips in no Gi.
*  Can't you use those grips?
*  No.
*  This is a thought experiment.
*  So like I'm trying to understand how essential.
*  When I get a no Gi guy go fight with a Gi, they panic.
*  They panic?
*  Of course.
*  Everyone panics.
*  A bear panics when they're in the water with a shark, but that doesn't mean the bear can't still win.
*  When it stops panicking and relaxes.
*  It's not possible.
*  That's another discussion.
*  Can a bear beat a shark in the water?
*  Actually, I need to put maybe a polar bear because they're pretty good at swimming.
*  Okay.
*  I say not possible for the no Gi guy to win.
*  But the bears is a further discussion.
*  What was to you the biggest difference between mixed martial arts and Jiu-Jitsu?
*  What are some interesting differences, some interesting insights,
*  even just about the grappling within both sports?
*  So the biggest difference for me between MMA and Jiu-Jitsu is first is the speed.
*  Like Jiu-Jitsu, like a 10-minute match, I can take my time.
*  There's no dangers that forces me to move fast.
*  In MMA, you have to be 100% sharp and fast from the first second of the fight.
*  Because punches are coming, you can get knocked out anytime.
*  One mistake, you're out.
*  Jiu-Jitsu, you don't have that.
*  I don't have to worry about quick submissions because it's all about the way my body is positioned.
*  My grips are easy to avoid, easy to see coming.
*  It's like a quick submission, a surprise.
*  It only works if you make a mistake, if you're not correct positioning.
*  Otherwise, it's impossible.
*  It's extremely difficult.
*  MMA is not.
*  I mean, one split second mistake and when the person comes, you have to respond.
*  You have to match his pace.
*  I mean, you can't slow down, but it's like you're forced to respond.
*  So it's much faster.
*  It's a lot more physical, a lot more.
*  And you need to be physically much better conditioning, faster.
*  It's explosiveness.
*  It's much harder.
*  Is it possible in MMA to calm things down?
*  They change the rules, yeah.
*  Five minute rules, no.
*  Ah, I see.
*  I just meant actually technically speaking, is there a way to take an opponent that's
*  being exceptionally aggressive?
*  You can clinch.
*  But then he takes you down, he keeps moving.
*  Something is hard to control that pace.
*  You can.
*  If you play defense, you save more energy than if you try to be the aggressor and respond.
*  And even getting to the clinch is very difficult.
*  Yeah.
*  You have no way to hold yourself there.
*  So that was the biggest challenge for me in MMA is the speed.
*  Because I'm a very slow start fighter.
*  If you look at my matches, I start very slow.
*  Because if I go hard, I fatigue faster.
*  So for me, that was the hardest part of this to start fast.
*  What about on the ground?
*  Is there something different, more challenging on the ground?
*  Being in the bottom, yes.
*  The punches, punch coming.
*  How fundamentally different is Jiu Jitsu with punches on the ground?
*  Changes everything.
*  Everything.
*  Which parts?
*  The distance that you allow your opponent to be on you, the techniques that you choose
*  to apply.
*  You have to, your body has to be aware of the punches and you are a lot more limited
*  on your attacks.
*  So you're known for your close guards.
*  How does your close guard have to adjust?
*  How does the positioning of your hands have to adjust when you're on the bottom of close guard?
*  So in the guard, especially in the close guard, you have to either keep the person very close
*  to you or you have to kick him away.
*  That's the thing.
*  The guard is either I'm hugging you or get away from you.
*  And in Jiu Jitsu, you're allowed to have a middle?
*  Yeah, in Jiu Jitsu, you can allow the person to be.
*  What about getting an arm lock or triangle submissions from the guard?
*  Is that fundamentally different because you don't have the middle game?
*  It's much harder.
*  There's barely no open guard in MMA.
*  Very little.
*  Because the open guard, there's a distance between you and him.
*  There's a distance.
*  See how you cannot control.
*  It's much harder to control that punch coming.
*  And I have to position myself a way to block that.
*  And it limited my attacks, my options of attacks.
*  Is there a reason, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you do open guard much
*  in Jiu Jitsu and Nogi.
*  Is there a reason for that?
*  It's harder with the explosive person because when they're moving fast,
*  then you have to try to slow them down.
*  So you like guards that allow you to control the person?
*  Yeah.
*  And closed guard is the ultimate control?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not ultimate control, but closed guard puts you in a position that I'm attacking
*  and you're defending.
*  You cannot attack me from my closed guard.
*  I'm...
*  We can agree that there might be one or two attacks, but it's like very, very,
*  very limited and depends who you're fighting against.
*  I hate the closed guard.
*  Being on top against a good closed guard is very...
*  No one likes it.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  It's one-sided.
*  So you're in the guard and he's one-sided.
*  The person in the bottom has the advantage.
*  I can be completely relaxed in my closed guard and I cannot be completely relaxed.
*  You know what the most annoying thing is?
*  There's somebody who is both good and extremely confident with the closed guard
*  because they have that smug energy about them.
*  They know how much unpleasant, how much work it takes to pass this.
*  Anyway, especially people with longer legs.
*  Is there something you wish you did differently in how you started training at MMA in that
*  trajectory in figuring out how to train, how to get good?
*  What have you learned about getting good at MMA from having done it?
*  If you were to start now, for example?
*  I think I would have to dedicate it more.
*  I didn't dedicate enough.
*  Both like literally time, number of training sessions.
*  Training.
*  But also mental.
*  Training wise, physical.
*  A lot more the physical part of it.
*  The strikes, everything?
*  The strikes from the beginning.
*  Because I love Jiu-Jitsu.
*  I truly love all the aspects of it.
*  Fighting, training, the practice, the competition.
*  I don't have that for MMA.
*  So it's hard to give your heart to it, something that you don't have the passion to it.
*  Like Jiu-Jitsu, I gave my heart to it.
*  I did everything that I had to.
*  MMA, I never, I didn't do that.
*  So that's why it was...
*  I won't say it was wrong for me to have to do it because I don't regret doing it.
*  I always, you know, looking back as a kid when I decided to be, to take Jiu-Jitsu for life,
*  I already knew that at some point I would have to do MMA.
*  There's almost like that's the path of a Gracie.
*  When you're ready, you go do MMA.
*  So there was a duty versus a love.
*  Yeah, there was not a choice.
*  There was like I have to.
*  That's just the life I took, it will lead that way.
*  Are you proud of that step?
*  You know, go against the natural love and towards more duty.
*  I think I don't regret it because if I hadn't done it,
*  I would feel there was something missing.
*  So I don't regret doing it.
*  I would regret not doing it.
*  The tricky thing is the choice to go to MMA
*  could have compromised your ability to win against Buccecce.
*  And it didn't.
*  And it's a fascinating case study.
*  It still doesn't make sense to me.
*  After all those years, you're able to come back
*  and go against the best person in the world and beat him.
*  Yeah, and I had to because the first fight we had,
*  I had something stuck in my throat for a long time.
*  So you think about that.
*  Oh yeah, I'm like as soon as that first fight finished,
*  I had that got stuck in my throat.
*  At that point, I knew I'm going to have to fight him again.
*  I knew.
*  I always knew.
*  Because there's no choice.
*  I have to.
*  Oh man.
*  All right.
*  Well, in terms of Nogi, who do you think is the best Nogi competitor of all time?
*  There's no question.
*  I don't think it's right to say the best competitor of all time
*  because he's still very young.
*  I think that's something that he can be in the end of when the person...
*  You don't want him to get lazy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  No, but you cannot praise someone in the middle of his career.
*  You cannot call him the best ever.
*  He's 26 or 27.
*  So he's great.
*  He's very good.
*  He's ahead of all of other competitors, I think.
*  He's having an amazing career.
*  He's doing amazingly well.
*  So when he finished, when he finally retired, then you can argue.
*  It's like...
*  You know what?
*  There's wisdom in that.
*  It matters how you finish, right?
*  Of course.
*  It's very interesting.
*  I think that Nogi is relatively new, that Nogi scene.
*  There was not a scene before.
*  I think he started now on his generation, his time.
*  Because before, when I was competing, Nogi was just ADCC.
*  There's nothing else.
*  Every two years, first was only in the Emirates.
*  You had to go there to compete.
*  So there was not even a scene.
*  There was this one tournament that gives a lot of money to competitors, to fighters.
*  And brings fighters from other modalities.
*  Mark Carr, Van Arsdale, some wrestlers, Greco-Roman.
*  You know, they can compete against each other.
*  And they create that set of rules, try not to favor anyone.
*  So that was it.
*  So you cannot be called the greatest Nogi of all time if you only have one tournament.
*  Every two years.
*  Only in the Emirates, they have to be invited too.
*  But I think now, it grew a lot.
*  Now we have so many different tournaments.
*  Now we have a scene.
*  You have people that only train Nogi.
*  They're fully dedicated to Nogi.
*  And you have supervised different tournaments.
*  So now it's professionally.
*  You can do just Nogi now, which before was unheard of it.
*  Because you have one or two tournaments.
*  If you cannot be called a Nogi fighter, fighting once every two years.
*  Twice every two years.
*  Yeah, now there's entire systems that are optimized for Nogi.
*  That could be fundamentally different.
*  What do you think about the body lock?
*  This passing with the body lock, I don't know if you get an understanding of it.
*  I think it's okay.
*  It's a popular way to, what is it?
*  Maybe to apply.
*  To stay tight.
*  To stay tight.
*  Very close to your opponent.
*  So he can't create distance.
*  He can't push away.
*  But somehow it shuts down the hips as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Makes it more difficult to defend.
*  Kind of trap your legs.
*  Your back gets stuck against the floor.
*  Are you scientifically curious about these new developments?
*  Do you think, do you have answers in your head to them?
*  Most.
*  So body lock is one interesting one.
*  Obviously foot locks is another.
*  And that'll mean just the foot locks, but the whole control aspect of foot locks.
*  That's interesting.
*  And there's other interesting stuff.
*  John is really into the wrestling aspect.
*  But not wrestling, wrestling, but wrestling everywhere.
*  Jiu-Jitsu at all levels of the plane.
*  That's very interesting because obviously Jiu-Jitsu has not really been,
*  unlike freestyle wrestling and so on, has not been a systematic, scientific,
*  rigorous exploration of wrestling.
*  It's like you're on your feet and you're on the ground.
*  Not, not, it's a lot of interest.
*  John is academic.
*  He tried to, you know, numbers, mathematics, everything.
*  You kind of are too.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I mean, I am because you have to understand what you're doing.
*  Everything, there's a step by step, like logistically, like details.
*  Every single move, there's a reason for it.
*  There's things around that happens.
*  It's the more you know, the better you are, right?
*  The more knowledgeable, compare it to whatever.
*  So I think with the foot locks, with the nogi, like if you look back,
*  you know, if you think of, used to be seen as a really bad thing to attack the foot.
*  It wasn't seen as a good option of attack.
*  Mainly.
*  What is that?
*  Respectable gentlemen don't attack the leg or what?
*  No, because if you look back, you know, the tournaments, the one they were created,
*  all the rules and everything else was to simulate a real fight with no punches.
*  But now having a gi.
*  I mean, if you ask what is jujitsu, like what are you trying, what's the main goal of jujitsu?
*  To dominate your opponent.
*  What's the main goal of fighting?
*  It's we're fighting.
*  It's of course, submission is the ultimate goal.
*  But the, you know, before that, the main goal is to dominate you.
*  Like we're fighting, I have to dominate you and then the submission comes.
*  And foot locks, it's, I don't require any domination on you.
*  I don't, I don't need to be in a dominant position to attack your foot.
*  And if I attack your foot, you're still free to knock me out.
*  If your body goes down to my foot, I can still come close to you or stand up and I'll punch you.
*  So it's not a good position to be in a real fight.
*  Yeah, to attack in the foot.
*  I mean, how many times you've seen that go bad, that went bad in MMA fight.
*  I mean, of course you had some sort of success with the hiruko.
*  It's no questions, but how many times went wrong?
*  People were knocked out attacking the foot.
*  So you can't say it's the best position to be.
*  It's okay to go, but it's a very high risky position to go.
*  So that's why it's not in a real situation.
*  It's not seen as a good thing.
*  So when you translate that to Jiu-Jitsu, when attacking the foot,
*  it's not seen as a good thing because when you reflect that to a real situation,
*  it's not going to go down well.
*  So it was always seen as an easy way out, easy cut.
*  You're trying to do the easy path.
*  You can't pass my guard, you can't dominate me.
*  And then you're trying to attack my foot.
*  That's why it was always seen as a, you know, not as a best, a great submission, a way to win.
*  But the sad side effect of that is it was completely underdeveloped because of that.
*  Exactly.
*  Of course.
*  So people never really developed that.
*  But now the determents, the fighting, it got completely, not completely, but it got so,
*  it's not longer seen as, you know, as a simulation of the real thing.
*  Now it's a sport.
*  It's only seen as a sport.
*  So now it doesn't matter if you attack my foot, you can't dominate me.
*  It doesn't matter if you attack my foot, you cannot punch me.
*  So why is it bad now to attack the foot?
*  It's just not seen as a bad thing anymore.
*  And now it got really developed.
*  I don't know.
*  That's another bear versus shark question.
*  But, you know, there is, in a street self-defense situation, it's possible to imagine where
*  foot locks would be effective for highly.
*  But I guess if you invest 10,000 hours, it's better to invest it in chokes.
*  Yeah, to dominate.
*  If I'm, you know, if I were fighting, it's way better for me to be on your side control
*  on the mount where I can pin you, be completely safe than to stay inside your legs trying
*  to attack your foot.
*  People would argue that there's a lot of very dominant controlling positions
*  in the whole foot lock game.
*  Right.
*  It is, but it can go bad very quickly.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, no, I mean, there's some great ways to control someone that he cannot escape,
*  but he can go bad very quickly.
*  That's the thing.
*  Well, even back control can go bad very quickly on the street.
*  So mount, I don't know, is mount a really good position?
*  Then there's no good position then.
*  There's no good position.
*  There's no, there's.
*  Every position, there's a risk.
*  Okay.
*  Attacking the foot is a way higher risk than side control mount back.
*  As I'm saying, the back is not the best way to pin someone unless you underneath me.
*  Because I, if you try to rotate, I can sacrifice the back and just allow you to be in the mount.
*  Okay.
*  There you go.
*  Would you prefer mount or back mount where they're flattened?
*  Like.
*  Still mount.
*  I thought I'd get you.
*  So yeah, going back to Gordon, what do you think makes that guy so good?
*  We were just a ADCC.
*  You got to see him historically dominant performance.
*  His dedication, the way he trains and how much he trains.
*  And of course you have to add his mind, his belief to really try to be good, the best.
*  So, you know, I don't know what his goals are, but I know he's tried to be better than his
*  opponents.
*  So his belief are very strong.
*  His dedication, he probably trains more than everybody else.
*  I mean, I haven't seen firsthand it, but from what I hear interviews with him and everybody
*  else training, I, you know, the way everybody trains, you know, trying to, for my little
*  knowledge I have, I'll bet he trains more than everybody else.
*  And most important, how he trains.
*  And when I, I kind of already knew, but when I heard John podcast with you the other day,
*  John was explaining the preparation, the training for the ADCC.
*  And that kind of gave me a very strong idea how they've been training all these years.
*  So, you know, when we said it's, you have to work on your weakness.
*  So you have no weakness.
*  He trains a lot on his weakness, which not everyone does that.
*  You know, if you look other, I'm not going to name, but, you know, other main schools
*  went like very strong competitors, great competitors, super tough people, but super
*  tough, not great because they train, they spar very hard.
*  That makes them tough.
*  If you want to be good, you have to work on your weakness.
*  Because when you spar, like we're saying, how many times you're going to practice
*  scaping a bad position, like a submission hold or a pinning position, side control,
*  mount, or it's very little the amount of time you get to spend on those positions.
*  If you don't start there.
*  So that he's very smart the way he trains.
*  And part of that is also cerebral.
*  It's not just putting yourself in those positions, but
*  talking through different ideas.
*  Like they talk, they like experiment.
*  It's very like at first glance, it's like philosophical almost.
*  You're trying to create systems constantly.
*  You're trying to understand how this fits into this big picture.
*  And then he goes back to what is jujitsu, what is fighting.
*  He's fighting for dominance.
*  You know, he's fighting for the ultimate dominance positions, which is back and mount.
*  There's no others.
*  And from that you finish.
*  So if you look back at his, you know, over the years of his past fights,
*  before he used to mainly focus in legs.
*  And over the past few years, now he's mainly focusing in finishing from the mountain back.
*  That's when he became really good.
*  So part of that is Mr. John Donahue.
*  What do you think?
*  You've known John for a long time.
*  What makes that guy interesting, special and good?
*  What have you learned about jujitsu and life from John Donahue?
*  He's super smart.
*  I mean, eccentric and he lives through jujitsu.
*  He's 24-7 thinking better ways to teach how to make his competitors better.
*  And that as a coach, when you have that dedication as a coach,
*  that it makes the most difference for your athletes.
*  Which other big team you have that coach with that motivation?
*  All the other schools is either someone that competes, that push the training,
*  like André Galvao.
*  He's one of the competitors.
*  So he brings the hype in everyone else, but he doesn't have the time.
*  He doesn't spend the time working individually.
*  I mean, I'm sure he does, but it's limited because he's also a competitor.
*  And, you know, looking most of the other big schools, like
*  you don't have that now.
*  All the leaders, the main coaches for the other big schools, they have other things,
*  other things in their lives.
*  They don't fully dedicate it to the athletes.
*  John does.
*  Look at the interview.
*  He spends hours and hours a day studying how can await the system
*  to make his athletes better.
*  Look at the results.
*  I enjoy just sending back and forth.
*  You can actually just get him.
*  You control him essentially by sending interesting videos and you could just see his mind.
*  He's going to do research on that because I kept sending him videos of bears because he claimed
*  that a lion would beat a bear because I'd love to get your take on this.
*  Okay.
*  So the bear is much bigger, much stronger.
*  But his take is that the bears don't have experience of fighting to the death.
*  That's not part of the culture.
*  They're more scared.
*  In fact, he keeps sending me footage of like even like a small mountain lion scaring a bear away
*  because they don't want to fight.
*  So his idea is that it really matters your life experience, how much you fight.
*  It's not necessarily the skill, like the dimensions, the characteristics you have.
*  But then I send him, yeah, I'll show you.
*  I'll save this.
*  People should Google this.
*  It's bears fighting of any kind.
*  It's pretty much the most epic thing ever.
*  Here, I'll show you.
*  Like look at these guys.
*  The cardio though is interesting.
*  You know, it's funny.
*  I was going to mention that because I was, you know, flipping to the internet.
*  I came around that video.
*  Look how big these guys are.
*  No, they're huge, but see they don't bite each other.
*  You think it's just play?
*  They're trying to, no, intimidating because they don't want to get hurt.
*  So they try to size each other up.
*  You see the whole fighting is sizing each other up.
*  There's a lot of pushing and the fur is so thick so the claws doesn't really damage much.
*  They're using the tree so maybe they, yeah.
*  I mean, there is bites, but see, there's very little.
*  So the whole time they're trying to intimidate the other one, like winning the fight by their size.
*  And mostly about like the way drunk college kids fight, which is like some kind of display
*  of dominance versus actual.
*  Yeah, they're not fighting to kill.
*  And bear or tiger, you know, they fight to finish unless the other one runs away.
*  Yeah, the lions and tigers.
*  Yeah, I, but look at the cardio.
*  Look how bad their cardio is.
*  I wonder how my favorite part is when one of them just like stands behind a tree.
*  It says, all right.
*  He's holding.
*  He's getting the breath.
*  Let me catch my breath.
*  He sits down.
*  It's like, all right, you can't, it's over.
*  It's like, it's the equalizer.
*  It's like, it's the equivalent in the forest tapping out.
*  All right, all right, you got me.
*  Look, they're both like, just shot.
*  And, but see, the thing is that I was trying to make an argument for is that
*  we get this rare footage.
*  It's not rare.
*  I mean, there's like hundreds of videos, but it's not millions of videos because there's
*  a huge number of bears.
*  And I was trying to say that there's some badass bear we don't know about.
*  Cause he just goes in there and just does work.
*  And we just don't know about it.
*  Cause he's like, see, the thing is if you kill a lot of other animals, you probably
*  have a territory that nobody's going to mess with you.
*  So it's very hard to catch the, the, like the Hydro Gracie of bears, you know,
*  he's just going to be sitting there doing nothing.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I feel like, of course, when you corner him, John will say that if you put a bear
*  and a lion in a cage, the bear will win.
*  If it's like, if it's the, if they're forced to be to the death, but I don't know.
*  Oh, let me ask you another ridiculous thing before I ask you serious questions.
*  So Joe Rogan thinks that a tie is an effective way to attack somebody.
*  I don't know if I can't believe I haven't in the time in Vegas, I didn't talk to you
*  about this.
*  I think it's not.
*  Have you ever explored this as the best choker in the world?
*  Have you ever explored the use?
*  Cause like, just who has the jacket, but the tie to me is a pretty shitty way to choke
*  somebody.
*  Like intuitively things like it's a good way, but it can slide around.
*  It's, it feels like if it feels like there's no, there's no way to really pin.
*  You need to.
*  Right.
*  So you use it the way you use a belt.
*  Essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  But then I would guess so.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't, I don't think it's, and I think if it gives you, it actually has the reverse
*  effect, which it gives you the, the false sense of confidence that you can use it.
*  And instead you'll just distract you.
*  So he's thinking a stronger way than the color or just a strong way.
*  Yeah.
*  Stronger than the color.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't see how maybe just like in a street fight scenario, right?
*  Like, but by the time you grab the tie, the guy goes punch your nose.
*  What, what, what George St. Pierre thinks is the best use of the ties to actually like
*  what do you call that?
*  So basically to all balance them, which is an interesting point to like,
*  I mean, that can be used to, yeah.
*  Well, you could use the jacket for the same kind of thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't really fully tested it.
*  It's a jacket or tie for that perspective of unbalancing, of balancing the person.
*  It can be, yeah, because you, you know, you have control of the person's neck,
*  the collar, you know, the jacket moves.
*  So for the purpose of off balancing the person, I would agree with George.
*  See, the thing is, that's the thing about martial arts is you can say all kinds of bullshit,
*  but until you really test it in over a period of years, the competition, you won't really know.
*  I think like that's where my gut says, um, just how easily the time moves.
*  My gut says the collar, there is something really powerful about the jacket.
*  There's like the way it sits.
*  I mean, the fact that the arms trap it from rotating,
*  like it's a weird piece of clothing.
*  It's a really dangerous piece of clothing that we put on ourselves.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, and it's kind of cool that we've developed this whole martial arts system
*  that allows you to use that to, to, to do a lot of damage.
*  It's very interesting.
*  So when we're saying something that you develop over the years of practice over and over again,
*  going back to the fissures of the mountain back by experience of attacking people,
*  they, people always had a much higher chance of escaping from the back than from my mount.
*  So it's, I feel if, if I mount and you get both my hands on your neck,
*  you cannot escape.
*  If my hands are deep, it's over like that.
*  I don't remember anyone escaping,
*  but I do remember if my hands are deep on your collar or even real naked choke is still a hassle.
*  Like, so you are clean.
*  You have some data on this.
*  Is there some aspect to you, to how your body is the characteristics of your body
*  that, that fits a particular set of techniques?
*  So if we just look at you just too broadly,
*  do you see most techniques being able to work for most people?
*  Like what you're saying about mount versus back control, is this,
*  is it possible for a different body type to mount is not as effective?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  I'll say very big people.
*  They should amount.
*  You don't think of yourself as big?
*  Not big.
*  I mean, fat.
*  Oh.
*  They should stay off the mount.
*  Why is that?
*  That's a con.
*  It's mobility.
*  It's like, it's, I think, you know, you don't see any, you know, like there was a few ways,
*  like 160 kilos, like, you know, two pounds.
*  I don't know, 270 pounds.
*  A lot of fat.
*  It's, you need a bit of mobility and that wouldn't, it would play against you.
*  So even back.
*  A great mount requires mobility.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So even though it doesn't look like you're moving very much when you're doing mount,
*  that requires mobility because you have to reposition and weight redistribution.
*  Constantly adjusting your body.
*  All right.
*  The legend goes you got very good by training mostly with lower ranks.
*  What was your training like in that environment?
*  So when I first moved to London, I was 20 years old.
*  I opened my school there and I had nobody to train with.
*  I had one guy that was teaching with me a black belt, middleweight.
*  He was good.
*  And that's it.
*  Braulio was, he moved to the same, he moved to England the same time as I did.
*  But he was in Birmingham.
*  So we did got together, maybe twice a week, closer, when we were preparing for something.
*  If not, then not very often.
*  As often as we could, but let's say not that often.
*  And I had just color belt students.
*  There was no one high level.
*  There was no one world champion in any belt to train.
*  Then you need to create a scenario that simulates, that can simulate.
*  You know, like a realistic fighting.
*  So I think on that aspect, you know, when people said, you know, people ask,
*  why do I have such a basic game?
*  I think that also influenced me sharpen up all my skills when I moved there.
*  Because, you know, when I'm, when you practice with people,
*  you know, lower level than you, you cannot, there's nothing to learn from them.
*  Or, you know, you can learn things in practice with them, but I would say
*  very complex things on them.
*  It is not the best.
*  So I sharpen up all my skills.
*  So, you know, that when I really improved everything that I already knew to a higher level.
*  But how can you sharpen something if the resistance is much lower level than?
*  A purple belt can make it very hard for you to skip side control.
*  Doesn't have to be a world champion black belt.
*  It's, you know, if it's one is holding you, it can be very hard.
*  What about on the attack?
*  How do you, how do you become literally by far the best person at the cross choke from mount
*  by training with purple belts?
*  It's sometimes purple belts defense way better than black belts.
*  Okay.
*  See, a lot of people listening to that would be like, that makes no sense.
*  Hadja Gracie.
*  How does that make any sense?
*  Because like a lot of the black belts, even world champion, they get to the black belt.
*  They're really good in what they do, let's say in the guard, you know, on top or the bottom position,
*  but their defense are not like very, very few people high level have a very good defense
*  because they don't practice.
*  Then that goes back to how you train.
*  You know, you can be very tough, very tough.
*  It will make you terrible defense because you're not going to practice your weakness.
*  So your weakness is still going to be terrible.
*  You can have the best guard in the world.
*  Impossible to pass the day people pass your guard, you're nothing.
*  Like it's your guard is high, the highest level, but your side control defense or not,
*  your mount defense or not.
*  So some purple belts, they practice this, you know, the mount way more than the black belt did.
*  So the naturally the difference is better.
*  So they get to experience the defensive position much, much, much more.
*  And especially training with you, they get really good at defending.
*  And then over and over again, you attack them with the same thing over and over again.
*  They know what's coming.
*  They will block.
*  They will develop a defense over that way better than most other high level black belts.
*  So both put yourself into really bad positions with low ranks
*  and just keep attacking the same way over and over and over.
*  Yeah.
*  And with that, you're able to be at the top of the world at the world championships.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, can you give some, what was the preparation like to a world championship
*  with the lower ranks?
*  I mean, I did a lot of boxing, a lot of conditioning.
*  Conditioning is a big part of it.
*  But the one thing that helped me extremely living in England, in London,
*  was training judo at the Budokai in London.
*  That helped me massively because it gave me the motivation to learn something new
*  because by then at the Budokai, the stand up was, I'm sure today it is too,
*  but by then it was even higher than it is today.
*  Like there was some very high level judo guys training there.
*  And the first time I went there, my stand up was terrible compared to theirs.
*  I mean, it was bad, but compared to them, it was terrible.
*  So I was getting thrown like a child.
*  And that motivated me to keep coming back and get better.
*  So that made my jiu-jitsu much stronger.
*  I became, my base got better, my top game improved, my pressure game improved.
*  Does Neil Adams train?
*  Ray Stevens.
*  Ray Stevens.
*  No, I've never met Neil Adams.
*  Ray Stevens.
*  Have you met Neil Adams?
*  He's the voice of judo.
*  I don't know if you watched the tournaments, he's incredible.
*  Yeah. Ray Stevens is a silver medalist in the Olympics.
*  He won European, he won a lot.
*  So you did some judo training.
*  What's your favorite throw? Like a Soto?
*  Like Uchi Mata, I'll say.
*  If I would pick one.
*  So that made you better at jiu-jitsu as well.
*  Yeah.
*  And back then, like for the first, I'll say maybe three years, maybe four,
*  I went to Brazil for like two months before every major tournament.
*  Got it.
*  So I say, you know, I moved away from the school and I really focused.
*  I was really well prepared with my judo and everything else,
*  sharpen up my skills and then went to Brazil to train with like really high level people.
*  So that way I would manage to compete in the highest level.
*  What advice would you give to, let's start with a complete beginner.
*  So, you know, a bunch of people come up to me, they still want to start doing jiu-jitsu.
*  What advice would you give them?
*  Try to absorb as much technique as you can and try to be as relaxed as you can.
*  Don't, you know, don't desperately try to fight so hard.
*  Like learn and move slow.
*  Move slow and relax.
*  That's the hardest thing to do.
*  The hardest.
*  You know, you know what I find with people, it seems like
*  it's hard to even know that you're not relaxed.
*  It's like the introspection.
*  They don't even know what it feels like to relax.
*  Not even know they tense.
*  Yeah, right.
*  They try to relax you look at you see what?
*  What do you mean relax?
*  I'm relaxed.
*  Exactly.
*  The arms are shaking.
*  You feel it.
*  And in terms of going slow, they're like, yeah, I'm going slow.
*  No, you're not.
*  Yeah, there's a grace and elegance of movement that you can probably pick up from a lot of other
*  disciplines.
*  For me, I think that came from just learning piano at a young age.
*  That's for I think any mobility thing to learn how to move efficiently,
*  you have to know how to relax.
*  It's just the fact that you can like body can be tense or it could be relaxed.
*  Just knowing that fact.
*  Now imagine you show the stance.
*  Yeah.
*  They could play piano well.
*  No, everything has to be relaxed.
*  I guess some of that is mind too.
*  But just knowing that and being self-aware.
*  But see, like, even me, you know, approaching a thing I'm not.
*  I don't know anything about being a beginner.
*  You're going to tense up.
*  No matter.
*  And like, it actually takes a conscious effort to think to relax.
*  I mean, that's massively.
*  That's why learning things as an adult is much harder than as a child.
*  Like, it's very hard.
*  And as an adult, it's like to get to the highest level, it's not possible.
*  Because you will never relax the way you should.
*  Yeah.
*  Relax in the way that you become like water, but then you solidify in the right places.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there advice you can give to an adult?
*  So like somebody that has a job, like a hobbyist, like how to progress?
*  How to get?
*  I mean, train.
*  Just need to train as much as you can.
*  Not, you know, five, seven days a week because you're going to get injured.
*  I mean, two or three times a week to start is the best way to, you know,
*  to initiate your Jiu-Jitsu journey and practice the same thing over and over again.
*  When they don't work, it's just because you're not doing well,
*  not because, you know, you have to learn something else.
*  Do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques that seem
*  to draw your heart in?
*  Like, for example, I'll give you an example.
*  You're going to yell at me, but I never learned the close guard.
*  Well, it just never connected with me.
*  You could say it's body mechanics, whatever.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  The point is it's just like my heart never connected with it.
*  You know, the way I justified it to myself is I felt like when you're bad,
*  you're using the close guard, just like you could use the half guard to stall.
*  I was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner because I thought,
*  or open guard in general, I have no options to stall, so I'm going to learn.
*  My thinking was, let me do the guard that enforces me to learn.
*  And then I fell in love with the butterfly guard and open guard and so on.
*  And I never really understood the close guard.
*  And the other thinking was, do I really need to understand the close guard?
*  Because it's always by choice that I go there.
*  So I can avoid not really...
*  I mean, you can avoid anything you want.
*  You don't have to do anything.
*  In this life, yes.
*  It doesn't make you complete.
*  That means you have a weakness.
*  But you want to be complete as a...
*  This is the question.
*  How valuable is it to be complete to get good?
*  Depends how good you want to be.
*  Okay, let's go.
*  Well, there's several questions there.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  To be the best in the world, do you need to be complete?
*  Of course.
*  The best in the world?
*  Of course you have to be complete.
*  Otherwise, somebody's going to be better than you.
*  So to understand to defend, you have to be also good at the offense in every single position?
*  Otherwise, you have a weakness and someone can capitalize on that weakness.
*  Okay, what about to be like a hobbyist?
*  Then you don't have to.
*  But can you...
*  Or is it still bad?
*  I mean, it's not bad.
*  Nothing is bad.
*  As a hobbyist, you start late.
*  It doesn't matter how far you're going to get.
*  As long as you enjoy it, just train as much as you can.
*  If it's twice a week, twice a week it is.
*  You'll be limited how good you will be training twice a week.
*  Of course.
*  Then the guy that trains twice a day.
*  The more you train, the better you get.
*  But you have to select what you train.
*  That's what I'm asking.
*  So...
*  I don't know.
*  Yes.
*  But for how long?
*  Like, at some point in your life that you might try something.
*  See if you like it.
*  You know, at some point in your life that you might,
*  okay, let me try close guard.
*  You might not like it now.
*  Maybe in two, three years from now.
*  Still don't like it.
*  I kept trying it.
*  Listen, because listen, it's very difficult to get any respect in Jiu-Jitsu.
*  It's hard to get to black belt and beyond in Jiu-Jitsu at a respectable place
*  and not have a good close guard.
*  I mean, then don't do it.
*  It's not necessary.
*  I'm being a rebel.
*  No, it's not.
*  I'll say because it's not a position that you under pressure.
*  That if you don't know, you'll be in trouble.
*  You're not going to be in trouble not to know the close guard.
*  You're just going to go straight for open guard.
*  I mean, the main limitation is if you don't do close guard a lot,
*  that you don't quite...
*  You don't get a full complete picture of understanding how to attack close guard
*  when somebody puts you into a close guard when you're on top.
*  So it's nice to know both sides of it, just to understand.
*  You can have a pretty good understanding of how to defend from the top and not having any bottom.
*  Some of it is also just like the length of legs and just the geometry of your body.
*  Nick, I'm sure Marcel Garcia has a good close guard, but...
*  I've never seen it.
*  That's the point I'm trying to make.
*  In theory, you can imagine it.
*  But for a hobbyist, I think it's interesting to think of that.
*  Is it possible to focus on a small set of techniques that help you to develop
*  still into a good Jiu-Jitsu player and still enjoy and still be able to be...
*  Most people hobbies in the Jiu-Jitsu world, 99%.
*  People there compete.
*  Even the people that compete.
*  One percent max.
*  And you have high level competitors, have no clue what close guard is.
*  Thank you for me.
*  No, I think you would say that most people don't have...
*  Close guard is such a difficult position to understand for me.
*  Maybe one day we'll brainwash.
*  Yeah, good.
*  I felt it's too easy to stall versus attack.
*  That was my main concern.
*  I want to be forced in every way to always be attacking, to always be moving, to always be...
*  It felt like if I got really good...
*  I've seen it happen with half guard too.
*  When people get really good at half guard, it just feels stally.
*  If you just look at the matches and so on,
*  you just slow things down to a thing that's not...
*  You don't get reps on learning.
*  You don't get action in interesting ways.
*  That was my worry, that I'll get old and fat and just sitting in close guard all day,
*  holding on to the white belts trying to kill me.
*  That's the other thing for hobbyists and for everyone.
*  When you first start, I think,
*  you have to relax in the face of the fact that you're just getting your ass kicked non-stop.
*  Yeah.
*  That can also be really tough on the ego.
*  I think probably the right way to see that is you're growing as a person.
*  You see that clearly when they are in a bad position, let's say, side mount or mount.
*  Like a beginner, he will never relax on those positions.
*  The moment that you say go, they're trying to push you out the next position.
*  There's no relaxation and work on the defense.
*  Like, no, it's out and go until I have zero to give, until I'm exhausted, my arms cannot move.
*  It's kind of fun to watch, actually.
*  What's the role of drilling?
*  Do you like drilling?
*  I do not like drilling, but I'll tell you why.
*  I think fighting is mechanic.
*  Right?
*  So it's very important to drill a move until you learn the mechanic.
*  Of course, it's important.
*  If someone want to teach you an armlock, you want to practice that movement until you learn
*  the mechanic of it, but the guy is not resistant, so it's easy to apply.
*  So you apply as many times as you have to until you know the mechanic of the moves,
*  until you can apply the mechanics.
*  The moment that you know how to apply, there's no more point in drilling.
*  Now you have to practice.
*  Now you have to practice with resistance.
*  Of course, you're not going to practice with the guy fully resistant.
*  The guy is better than you because he's not going to give you a chance to practice that move,
*  but you have to practice with resistance.
*  So where does drilling come from?
*  Most of people, they flow drill and everything.
*  I think whatever you do, you condition in your body to do something.
*  You repeat the same move over and over again.
*  Your body is conditioned to apply that movement or the technique.
*  Drilling is not realistic because the other person is not resisting.
*  The flow movement or whatever.
*  After you go beyond when you already know the mechanics, the drilling with no resistance is
*  not going to teach you anything because you will never know how to apply the movement with
*  resistance.
*  So it's pointless to carry on drilling after you learn the mechanics.
*  You're making it sound easy to learn the mechanics, I would argue.
*  You can drill as many times.
*  I'm not limiting how much you drill.
*  You drill as long as you had to.
*  I mean, it doesn't matter how long.
*  The benefit of drilling, I'm just playing devil's advocate with you.
*  The benefit of drilling is that you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in.
*  So what are you going to gain with those reps?
*  Understanding the mechanics of the movement.
*  What I would like to argue is you don't necessarily need a resistance to deeply
*  understand the mechanics of something.
*  I agree.
*  There's some moves.
*  I bet you, you could drill your way to an incredible mount.
*  Mount is a good example of that.
*  You don't really need a...
*  What?
*  I can imagine a world in which the resisting opponent is not essential for developing some
*  of the very fine details of the mechanics.
*  Which one?
*  Because I don't know any.
*  What?
*  You say mount.
*  Yes.
*  What you're going to achieve by drilling with no resistance after you learn the mechanics?
*  In mount.
*  But see, what I'm trying to tell you, the learning of the mechanics isn't a thing where
*  you get a certificate and you're done.
*  You're going to learn the fine details of the way you redistribute your weight.
*  You're going to learn how to move your...
*  I don't understand mount.
*  Against a dead body.
*  Everything you do is a slow process and timing.
*  You have to understand moving.
*  The guy is resisting.
*  I'm not going to grab you and apply the movement.
*  I need to grab you and feel when is the right time to do.
*  It only comes with movement.
*  If you're not fully resistant, how would I know?
*  You couldn't infer through it.
*  It's like...
*  With no movement, with no resistance.
*  Like armlock.
*  There's some resistance.
*  Okay, armlock.
*  Let's see armlock.
*  Okay, let's say you've been drilling for a week.
*  Five hours a day.
*  You should be an expert with the mechanics.
*  But now, are you going to carry on drilling with no resistance?
*  No.
*  You have to.
*  Yes.
*  After that week, drilling five hours a day, the armlock,
*  you still have no clue how to apply the armlock against a resisting opponent.
*  No clue.
*  Zero.
*  Yeah.
*  So you don't know the movement, you know the mechanic.
*  Which is...
*  How long you have to drill and how...
*  That doesn't matter.
*  It varies of the person.
*  You can do for a month.
*  After that month is over, you should understand how the mechanic works.
*  You still have no clue how to apply the movement against a resisting opponent.
*  You will never ever know how until you apply with a fully resisting opponent.
*  That's the only way to know...
*  To really learn the movement.
*  Yes.
*  Well put.
*  But the question is, can you have a small percentage of time when you go against the
*  resisting opponent to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes to perform that movement
*  and you spend a large percentage of other time just practicing the mechanics of it?
*  So like...
*  Do you need to, as you get better and better at technique,
*  to basically drift away completely from drilling and more into the sparring?
*  I'd like to...
*  I just...
*  You like drilling?
*  No, I don't like drilling.
*  I see...
*  Well yes, I like drilling, I would say.
*  But I just see it always bothered me in the jiu-jitsu community
*  how few people really saw the value of drilling.
*  I've seen it in wrestling, especially in the Russian style of wrestling.
*  The value of drilling.
*  I don't necessarily mean that it's like a dead body or like a dummy or something like that,
*  but just getting the reps in.
*  Really focusing on the high amount of reps.
*  I agree in wrestling and judo.
*  I agree that drilling is very important.
*  Initial drill a thousand times each move.
*  Yeah, judo is a really big one for that too.
*  It is.
*  Because it's the movement, the timing, it's the precision of the movement.
*  Yeah.
*  It has to be perfectly.
*  Because it's one movement.
*  You learn about the timing of the movement when you're fighting,
*  but during fighting you only need to know the time.
*  Because your body movement is exactly the same when you drill.
*  That's really well put, yeah.
*  The mechanics is much more important there.
*  Yeah, but it's completely different for jiu-jitsu.
*  Because let's say from jiu-jitsu, like the armlock, for example, we use that as an example.
*  Let's see from the clothes guard.
*  Even my clothes guard.
*  Before I go for the armlock, I need to have a set of grips.
*  Let's say I have your collar and your arm, right?
*  And then when you're drilling, I'm going to grab your arm,
*  I'm going to grab your collar, and I'm going to drill my body
*  until I can apply the armlock and finish.
*  And I can do that a thousand times.
*  Okay, now we're fighting.
*  We start with the grip.
*  The moment that I initiate the armlock attack,
*  you will defend the armlock, it will not work.
*  So it's not the one movement that will get me to attack the arm.
*  There's a combination of all those things that I need to do.
*  I need to feel about your weight.
*  I need to get you close to me.
*  There's so many other things involved that I need to feel
*  that only comes with a fully resistant opponent.
*  Yeah, so pretty quickly it has to be live.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it comes how you practice, how you train.
*  You're starting on that position and just saying, let's go.
*  And the moment that we disengage from that position, we go back.
*  That's when you really learn.
*  Because everything that you do wrong, you're going to go back there
*  and you're going to try again, try again, try again.
*  And the repetition, it will teach you,
*  have a feeling of timing when to go.
*  If there's other combinations, which you always have to go with it.
*  By the way, for the internet that's currently yelling at me
*  for arguing with Hadji Gracie about drilling,
*  that's called playing devil's advocate to strengthen, to explore ideas.
*  I'm not actually arguing.
*  Okay.
*  I forgot to ask you, if you had to fight against the Bear, Lion,
*  Gorilla or Anaconda to the death, which one would you choose?
*  And would you be able actually to win against any of them?
*  We'll have Bear, a Lion, a Tiger, an Anaconda.
*  Oh, a Gorilla too, Gorilla.
*  You can go Gorilla.
*  I'll probably choose the Anaconda.
*  I mean, you're not allowed to run away though.
*  So you're in a cage.
*  Do you have to kill?
*  Still the Anaconda.
*  Okay.
*  So the other one.
*  I think I have no chance against any other ones.
*  Zero chance.
*  I might have a tiny little against the Anaconda.
*  Just wait it out.
*  You don't think it's possible to be...
*  It feels like technique can do something against these animals,
*  but they have so much strength, so much aggression.
*  The real naked choke, translated into Portuguese, is kill the lion.
*  So ever since I was a kid, I always thought that maybe if I get behind a lion,
*  the real naked choke, which in Portuguese it says mata-leão.
*  So mata-leão means kill the lion.
*  So I always thought that that's the only way to kill a lion.
*  If you're fighting against a lion, go behind and put the real naked choke.
*  I think you put him to sleep.
*  The name mata-leão is like kill the lion.
*  Someone came up with the name.
*  Somebody must have.
*  Maybe someone was going to fight with the lion, choked him up.
*  There you go.
*  Honestly, do you think...
*  Actually, yeah, you understand controlling positions.
*  Do you think like an animal like a gorilla or a lion will shake you off?
*  If you had back full, you're locked in.
*  Well, I'll say the one that will have the biggest chance of staying there is the lion
*  because it's just in her body.
*  Yeah.
*  It's smaller than a tiger, I guess.
*  I think tigers are bigger.
*  Yes.
*  So do you think they can shake you off, though?
*  I think I'll have a bigger chance of staying against a lion's back than any other animal.
*  Still not answering the question.
*  Do you think you have a chance?
*  If I start on the back?
*  You got to start full locked in, full controls.
*  Let's say it's a small enough lion you can actually have a full...
*  I'll guess so.
*  I mean, I would like to believe so.
*  Okay.
*  Just like you said, somebody must have been able to do it.
*  Throughout your journey in Jiu Jitsu, have there been low points?
*  I guess there have been points where you really doubted yourself.
*  No, I never really doubted myself.
*  There's low points in defeats.
*  Those are the low points when I lost.
*  How did you deal with defeats?
*  I just went back to the gym next week and said I need to get better.
*  Every time I lost, I'm like, I need to get better because I need to choke them out.
*  I need to submit them because win by points.
*  As a black belt, I have very, very little loss.
*  I would say...
*  I mean, I don't like to sound like a crying baby, but I'll say most of those loss was very, very controversial.
*  Yeah, it was not a dominant, clear performance.
*  It's about referees and points and so on.
*  Everything was...
*  Since I was very young, I always fought against my opponent and the referee.
*  If there was ever in my whole life, since I was a kid, there was ever a doubt,
*  you always go to my opponent.
*  Always.
*  That was just something that I had to deal with my whole life.
*  What's the motivation behind...
*  What led to the fact that you win most of your matches by submission or in dominance?
*  Because that's the only way to prove you better.
*  And I never fought to win tournaments.
*  That was never my goal.
*  That was the consequence of me trying to be the best.
*  Like, I don't care how many titles I have.
*  I care about...
*  I need to beat all my opponents and not win because win is not enough.
*  I have to submit them.
*  That's the only way to prove I'm not better.
*  That's the only way to prove I'm the best.
*  To submit them.
*  If I win by advantage or a point, that means I was better than them that day.
*  That does not mean I'm better than them.
*  If there's no hope...
*  And if you didn't...
*  If I take you down, pass your guard, mount you and submit you,
*  there's zero question who's the best.
*  Like, there's nothing you can say about it.
*  If I foot sweep you, you put your butt on the floor,
*  I get an advantage.
*  We're carrying a fight and you're not winning.
*  It means nothing.
*  It not even means I'm better than you.
*  And if that happened, that would haunt you.
*  It is for me.
*  It's not enough.
*  I wouldn't be happy.
*  What advice would you give to young folks who look at you,
*  who are able to accomplish from a place where you're not very good
*  to becoming the best in the world at a thing?
*  What advice would you give them?
*  To have a journey like that, to have a journey where they could be
*  successful in their career and their life to such a high level.
*  Determination is the most important thing.
*  You need to know where you're going to get there.
*  So you need to have a goal, whatever that goal is.
*  Like, you need to set that goal for yourself so you know where you want to go.
*  And to have the determination to get there.
*  And be sure that you will fail many times.
*  Like, you cannot let your failures bring you down
*  because you will fail many times.
*  Everybody does.
*  So you said you didn't look to external sources of belief.
*  You just believed in yourself.
*  Is there something to that where you have to try to,
*  like, be your own source of belief, flame the fire within yourself?
*  Was that something difficult to do?
*  That was just very natural for me.
*  I said, you can surround yourself with great people.
*  That is extremely important.
*  Don't surround yourself with failures because they will,
*  they're not going to push you to, you know, they don't know what it is, how to get there.
*  I mean, everybody knows, but it's, when you surround yourself with winners,
*  you know, you will know what it took them to get there.
*  Use them as an example.
*  Yeah, there's a certain kind of aura to people that just achieve great things and being around them.
*  But it's still, it's hard to find people that, especially at that early stage.
*  Any area.
*  Yeah.
*  Any area.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Greatness has a certain, I think it's almost humbling just to see, okay, any human,
*  like at least that's the lesson I learned.
*  Almost any human can do, can be great.
*  I mean, one, I've used Muhammad Ali as a great example.
*  Look at his belief.
*  Look at how much he believed himself before he was Muhammad Ali.
*  Look at the, you know, determination he had, the way, the confidence he had fighting,
*  even on his loss.
*  That never changed him.
*  Now, when he fought Foreman, George Foreman, I, not one person in the world
*  thought he was going to win that fight by himself.
*  He never doubted himself.
*  Everybody else did.
*  He won over all odds against.
*  So it's, I mean, when you look at people like that, you can,
*  you don't have to be a boxer to try to, you know, follow his example.
*  But see, those are like epic giant battles, but I feel like you fight the same kind of battle
*  when you're young and your parents tell you that, you know, just with their whole energy,
*  that this is silly.
*  Don't be silly.
*  Don't, don't be silly to chase.
*  It's harder.
*  It is harder.
*  But as a kid, it's harder to deal with that because, I mean, to go against adults,
*  especially parents telling you otherwise, like the amount of strength you need is gigantic.
*  I don't even know how much strength you need because that was not my case.
*  So I can understand what you have to go through with the force of your parents telling you,
*  you know, otherwise.
*  But it's how much you want, it will dictate how far you're going to go,
*  where you're going to go.
*  So it's, you know, if you can break through that, you get nowhere.
*  It's that simple.
*  And actually, one of the really nice things the internet does that I would give advice
*  to young people is like you can find, even if your parents are not a source of that,
*  your teachers, your community, you can find people on the internet who believe in you.
*  It's kind of cool how the internet opens the possibility of like a community of like 10,
*  11 year olds, like building shit.
*  I see this all the time, engineering.
*  I mean, they're fueled by belief.
*  They want to create the next trillion dollar company, right?
*  There's that fire in their eyes and not for the money, obviously,
*  but to do something with the impactful.
*  And I think that fire is extinguished often by teachers and parents.
*  Because I think the logic that parents have and teachers, they look at a kid and they don't,
*  on the surface level, they don't see greatness, right?
*  They just see kind of mediocrity.
*  And so to them, it's like, no, right, the world is more complicated than that.
*  In order to get great, you have to like, they somehow kind of always try to be reasonable
*  with you.
*  And in so doing, extinguish the flame.
*  It's weird.
*  I think most people are afraid to even try.
*  So you can call them cowards for not trying because you are a coward for not trying,
*  not putting yourself at risk, right?
*  So I would say a big part of society are cowards for never trying,
*  never pursuing what they really want.
*  It's so, there is a weight, a pressure, everyone, most people, a lot of people,
*  I'll say around you, that because they were afraid to try, they don't incentivize people
*  to do so because they want everybody to be like them.
*  Because imagine if everybody around you suddenly are not afraid and everyone is trying,
*  and you look yourself in the mirror and say, I was too scared.
*  I've never tried.
*  So you feel really bad about yourself.
*  So it's easier to have people around you that think exactly like you than otherwise.
*  So that reflects a lot on the kids.
*  It's, you know, society almost like pressed them down to be like everybody else,
*  to have a normal life, normal job.
*  It's, you know, don't take risks because you can't lose it all.
*  I mean, that's the worst thing you can tell everybody.
*  Take all the risks, lose it all a few times.
*  That's how you're going to build things.
*  Especially when you're young.
*  Yes.
*  You can recover much quicker.
*  Exactly.
*  What's the point of not trying?
*  You should try and you will lose everything.
*  Doesn't matter what it matters to lose everything.
*  It does matter.
*  It will teach you resilience.
*  You know, try harder, go after.
*  You know, don't live a normal life because otherwise,
*  you know what we're here for.
*  Take big risks, take a lot of them, fail and fail and fail and fail.
*  Fail you a thousand times until you succeed.
*  And then you're going to be the most proud of yourself.
*  Like it's this, that's, that's, that'd be priceless.
*  It's that then we'll change the world.
*  It is true that most people are not necessarily cowards, but have cowardice in them.
*  It's most people are just afraid to try, you know.
*  And a lot of it comes from a place of love because, you know, if you try and you fail,
*  you get hurt.
*  It hurts.
*  I mean, it's not, it's not a pleasant thing to fail.
*  I mean, you feel terrible to think, you know, when I lost any tournament was a good thing.
*  You know, when taking, when I was getting beat up at the gym over and over again was a good thing.
*  When I was getting there and getting smashed by all the good guys.
*  I think I liked it.
*  Well, I hate it, but it's my resilience that, you know, make me carry on until I succeed.
*  I think I like to get tapped.
*  Well, I'm the most competitive, one of the most competitive persons you know.
*  I hate to lose, but it's, I accept.
*  I mean, I just need to get better.
*  Every single time I lost in the championship, I hate it.
*  I've never screamed.
*  No one never saw me screaming, shouting that, you know, I got robbed.
*  You know, I should have won the referee.
*  Yeah, boy, you know, screw me over.
*  I mean, it's okay.
*  It happened.
*  Shit happens.
*  I need to get better because I don't want to be in that position ever again.
*  So when I fight, if I'm better, if I tapped him, there's no question.
*  I don't need to wait for the referee to decide that there was points or no points.
*  If you know, his interpretation, that made me better.
*  Because I was even more determined to be better.
*  In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.
*  Winning is not enough.
*  It's just objectively speaking.
*  What you learn the most from is really wanting to succeed and then failing.
*  And doing that often.
*  That's the reality from a parent, from a teacher perspective, from anybody,
*  from people you love.
*  If they really want to do something, help them do that thing.
*  If you think they're going to fail, good.
*  Help them do that faster so they fail faster.
*  The only way to succeed is failing.
*  There is no other way.
*  That's what people have to understand.
*  Without failing, there is no success.
*  Since you've gotten a little softer, a little more emotionally open,
*  what's the role of love in the human condition, Hajo Gracie?
*  Probably the most important thing.
*  That's the basic of everything, right?
*  Love brings the best of us.
*  If we had more love and compassion from the other person,
*  I think we would be a more evolved species.
*  The world would be a much better place than it is now.
*  Did Franz's family help you along the way?
*  Yeah, a lot.
*  I always had a lot of love and help from many people.
*  That's why I succeed.
*  I never got here by myself.
*  I had a lot of people who loved me, believed in me,
*  and helped me get to be here today.
*  Well, I'm glad they did.
*  I'm glad you're here today.
*  I'm a huge fan.
*  It was an honor to meet you.
*  It was an honor to hang out with you in Vegas,
*  to hang out with you again today.
*  I've just been a huge fan for a long time.
*  My pleasure, man.
*  Thank you for everything you're doing.
*  Thank you for this conversation.
*  It was awesome.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Hajo Gracie.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, let me leave you with some words from Hajo Gracie himself.
*  Jiu-Jitsu is simple.
*  You just have to do it right.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
