# Aella: Sex Work, OnlyFans, Porn, Escorting, Dating, and Human Sexuality | Lex Fridman Podcast #358
**Lex Fridman:** [February 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFSrxSBrgSc)
*  It was really shocking to me that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.
*  Like for me, it was like breathing.
*  Like you're just doing sex and you're bored and like, what do you do?
*  I don't know. Let's try something funny.
*  Like it's just the natural progression.
*  And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.
*  Like I would just be really creative and like immediately was the top not safe for work post on Reddit.
*  I'm like, well, I didn't even try that hard.
*  The following is a conversation with Ayla, a sex researcher who does some of the largest
*  human sexuality survey studies in the world on everything from fetishes to relationships.
*  She is fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics by asking challenging and
*  fascinating questions and looking for answers in a rigorous data-driven way and writing about it
*  on her blog, knowingless.com. She's also a sex worker, including OnlyFans and Escorting,
*  and is an exceptionally prolific creator of thought-provoking Twitter polls.
*  Ayla and I disagree on a bunch of things, but that just made this conversation even more interesting.
*  I like interesting people in the full range of the meaning that the word interesting implies.
*  I'm currently reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac and would be remiss if I didn't mention one of my
*  favorite quotes from that book that feels relevant here.
*  The only people for me are the mad ones. The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
*  mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a
*  commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like
*  spiders across the stars. In the middle, you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes,
*  ah. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Ayla.
*  Comes with uncertainty, right? Almost always.
*  I started trying to think of a counter example.
*  Immediately. You're uncomfortable with generalizations of that kind.
*  Like always is always a really bold word to use.
*  But if it's truly novel, that means you don't really understand it. It's outside your distribution.
*  So therefore, it's going to have a bunch of uncertainty. But you don't think of it as uncertainty.
*  You think about it as something new, but it actually also attracts you because there's a lot of
*  uncertainty surrounded probably. Like, what is this new thing?
*  Yeah, like annihilating the mystery that like that drive.
*  What about the danger of it?
*  It's like part I was just thinking of on the drive over because I was like, I'm like a little
*  nervous about doing this podcast. And then I was like feeling into the unpleasantness of it,
*  like the like the fear of what if something goes terribly wrong? And then I was also feeling into
*  like how much that feels like part of why it's exciting. Like if I knew that it was going to go great, I don't know.
*  Did you actually imagine all the possible ways it can go wrong?
*  Not like all of them. But I was like, what if I say something really dumb or like you asked me a question
*  and I answer it in a way that makes me sound like a lot less capable than I am. I'm like really afraid
*  of being perceived as stupid or something. I was also thinking about this on the way over, like I'm
*  kind of risk averse in some ways. Like I don't like driving fast in cars because I was driving
*  very carefully here because the roads are bad. And then I think I'm very like pro-risk in other ways,
*  like being really exposed to like a wide variety of people who might hate you. And I think like from
*  the outside that might look fine. But I think the monkey brain is really sensitive to lots of people
*  yelling at you for whatever problems that you seem to have. So that's the big risk you're taking is
*  putting yourself out there as an intellectual, like through your writing and then a lot of people
*  yelling at you. Is that the worst embarrassment you can experience? It's pretty bad, yeah.
*  I think the worst embarrassment is if I put something out there that I failed to like be
*  properly skeptical of in myself and then people are like, oh we caught this thing that you didn't
*  catch. I think that's the biggest terror. Yeah, from looking at your reading and listening to your
*  interviews, you seem to be very defensive and worried about being a good scientist.
*  Yeah, definitely. Well, you're like methodology. Yes.
*  And funny enough, you get attacked on that methodology, even though,
*  you know, I'm a fan of psychology, like academic psychology, and it's kind of disappointing often
*  how non-rigorous their work is, how small the sample size and so on, and how big and ambitious,
*  over ambitious the proclamations about results is, especially with the news reports on it. Now,
*  you're both the researcher, the scientist, and the reporter, right? So like this we have with the blog,
*  your sample size is often gigantic. The methodology is right there. The data is right there. You
*  provide the data and then you're like raw and honest with your interpretation of the data.
*  There's an honesty, authenticity to it. So it's actually really refreshing. I don't know why
*  people criticize it. I think this is what psychologists are probably terrified about
*  being transparent and transparent in that way is because they'll get attacked for their methodology.
*  So they want to cloak it in a sort of layer of authority. Like I'm from this institution,
*  it was peer reviewed, this kind of all these layers, and I'm also not going to share the data
*  with you. And I'm also going to pretend like most psychology studies are not replicable. I'm just
*  going to pretend there's authority to it. I think it works on a lot of people, like from the outside,
*  you're like, ah, the scientists with the white lab coats with credentials. Those are the people who
*  are doing science. And doing science is, you have fancy terms that other people don't really
*  understand. And to be fair, I have a lot to learn. I'm still self-teaching. I'm learning through
*  people learning as I go. I'm definitely not super knowledgeable about this stuff. But a lot of what
*  those people are doing in science is not that hard. And a lot of people don't try to learn it
*  because it seems so elevated. And this is one thing that really bothers me. I think everybody
*  can do science. If you just have this aspect of curiosity and you just really want to figure
*  something out, you can go and start asking people questions, doing surveys, writing down the answers.
*  And then you can go learn how to look at that data in a way that gives you more information
*  about the world. It's very simple and straightforward. If you just approach it humbly and earnestly,
*  and you're like, please, let's figure this out together. But people are, I think, self-crippled
*  in this because they view this as relegated to the domain of the experts and the fancy scientists.
*  I think that makes me feel really sad. You're almost attracted to the questions you're not
*  supposed to ask. Oh, yeah. Also, yes. It might contribute to the controversy. Not exclusively,
*  probably. But you're just not limited by... Like part of your curiosity asking questions that seem
*  common sense. Some of the most controversial questions are around sex. It's like everybody
*  thinks and talks and does sex. It's the driver of human civilization. And yet, there's so little
*  rigorous discussion about the philosophical and the scientific questions around it. It gets really
*  weird to be able to discuss them. It becomes tricky to discuss them. Yeah, it's super charged.
*  Everybody has a really strong opinion, whether or not pornography is damaging to society or how sex
*  corresponds to gender or what kind of sexuality is acceptable. Can you have sexual preferences
*  that in themselves are immoral? People get very angry about it. Well, the sad part is they're not
*  just opinionated, but most of us, our relationship with sex is, I guess, I want to say not rigorous.
*  I think it's very difficult to be rigorous about sex. I would consider sexual urges to be kind of
*  elusive to introspection in a way that's a little bit disproportionate to a lot of other things.
*  You could introspect about how I want other people to like me and where my insecurities lie. But sex
*  is one of those black box things. A really common thing is for people to, if you have a fetish, you
*  sort of check back in your childhood to see an event that corresponds to that fetish. And then
*  you develop a narrative like, ah, this event in my childhood must have caused this fetish.
*  And so I think this causes people to be biased towards a concrete, coherent, causative way that
*  events happen or that sexual fetishes happen. This is just like one example of why I think it's
*  really hard to be rigorous with introspection because we can't avoid, you just want to
*  tend towards making coherent narratives, which I think is not always the correct way to explain it.
*  The narratives that are connected to childhood and so on, how they originate. Yeah. I mean,
*  we'll talk about fetishes because you have a lot of really interesting writing on that.
*  Just actually zooming out, I should mention, you tweeted, I wrote this down, you tweeted,
*  I do not understand how to have normal conversations with people in person if I'm not on drugs.
*  So I guess let's both agree to not have a normal conversation, I guess,
*  assuming you're not on drugs now. Or if you are, you don't have to tell me.
*  I feel like a very small amount of phenobite, which is a nootropic. I don't know if that counts.
*  Is that a drug? Well, I guess I'm on caffeine. Yeah.
*  So we're both... Drugged up.
*  We would, good enough to have a normal conversation.
*  We don't have to. What is normal anyway? What do you think is the primary driver of human
*  civilization? Is it the desire for sex, love, power, or immortality? Like avoiding the fear
*  of death, constructing illusions that make us forget about our terror over mortality.
*  So sex, love, power, death. This is a Twitter poll.
*  It's four options. This is reality. Not everything
*  maps perfectly into a Twitter poll, but in this case, because there's four options,
*  and it is a small number of characters, it does. But I'd like to think I'm more interested. You
*  know what? I think your Twitter polls are fundamentally interesting. There's something
*  about the brevity of a poll, limiting to a set of choices, and having an existential crisis
*  and searching for the answer. That's beautiful. That combination.
*  Well, this one is a big one. What do you think is behind it?
*  Do you believe that there is one primary driver? Do you think that it can be understood in the
*  terms of primary drivers? Yeah, I think, well, maybe it's an engineering perspective, like trying
*  to reverse engineer the brain. I don't think we're equipped or understanding enough about the mind
*  to get there. Yeah, like what's the primary driver of a tree?
*  Yeah, well then it gets to the question of what is life? What is the living organism?
*  To self-replicate, probably. That's a very clean simplification, but
*  I think life is more interesting than just self-replication.
*  Yeah, but it sounds like there's a curiosity in you that you're trying to poke at,
*  and I don't understand exactly what that curiosity is.
*  So if I had to dedicate a thousand years to understand one of these topics,
*  which one would be the most fruitful, I guess is the indirect thing I'm asking.
*  Fun? No. Well,
*  fun. To me, everything is fun. Really?
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm with David Foster Wallace. The key to life is to make sure that everything
*  is unborable or should be unborable or nothing is boring. Everything is fun.
*  Like everything. I could just literally sit. I honestly, because I don't know where you got
*  that glass, but that glass exists and I forgot it exists. It was really fun to me to know that it
*  now is there. What about the really unpleasant things?
*  If you're in deep agony? Yeah, that's fun.
*  Okay. That's fun. Because it's like,
*  I mean, yeah, heartbreak is like knowing that I'm capable of that. It's like from,
*  we're all living in the gutter, but some of us are looking up at the stars. So when you're in that
*  gutter, for some reason, the stars look brighter, right? So like whenever you're going through a
*  difficult time or whenever you see maybe other people being shitty to each other, it makes you
*  really appreciate when they're not. The contrast makes life kind of amazing. I'm reading a bunch
*  of books. One of them is Brave New World where they remove the ups and downs of life, partially
*  through drugs, but over sexualization and all that kind of stuff. I feel like you need that
*  contrast. You need the ups and downs of life. The dark, you need the dark to have happiness,
*  have like a deeply intense feeling of affection towards another thing or a human being. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So everything's fun. But fun is also a weird word to define because fun, I think for a lot of
*  people, that's why I talk about love a lot. I think love is a better word than fun because fun is like
*  lighthearted. Love is more intense. I love that glass and the water that's in it because it's
*  freaking awesome. Somebody made that glass, right? And not have many mistakes. And the way bends
*  light in interesting ways and the way water bends light in interesting ways, I can see part of your
*  arm through that water. That's freaking amazing. Everything is amazing. I'm with the Lego movie.
*  If, but if like from a scientific perspective, if I were to investigate sex, I don't know why I put
*  love in there. Let's narrow it down to Twitter poll. Let's focus on the basics here. Sex, power,
*  or death, immortality. If I were to try to, like from a neuroscience, neurobiology perspective,
*  or reverse engineer through building AI systems that focus on these kinds of dynamics, exploring
*  the game theoretic aspects of it, exploring the sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it,
*  which one would get me to a deeper understanding of the human condition? That's the question. Sex.
*  Okay. Nietzsche is the will to power. Freud and the bunch is all about sex. And then death.
*  Liv just, Liv Burley, brilliant previous guest on this podcast, she just released a video
*  where on her bedside was the book Denial of Death by Ernest Becker, which of course she would have
*  on her bedside. But that the, his whole work is that everything is motivated by our trying to
*  escape the cold, harsh reality that we're going to die and we're terrified of it. One of the gifts
*  and burdens for human beings is that we are cognizant of our own death and that terrifies us.
*  That's the theory. And because of that, we do everything we can. We build,
*  we build empires to escape the fact that we're mortal.
*  Wouldn't this change quite a bit for religious people then who don't believe that they're going
*  to die? Well, they created religion, the idea there to create myths, religions, you can create
*  religions of all kinds, like. Yeah. But if this is like one of the defining things that define
*  civilization, then we should expect to see like massive differences between people who believe
*  we're going to die and people who don't. Good. I love it. You think it's like a scientifically
*  here, but and they have actually answers. Like there's a whole terror management theory where
*  they do type, write psychology type papers and they do actual experiments. I can mention how
*  their methodology is interesting. They prime with the discussion of death. Like they take one
*  certain set of people and have a conversation with them. Another set of people, they mentioned death
*  to them before the conversation and see how that affects their, the nature of the conversation.
*  It's really interesting because death fundamentally alters the nature of the
*  conversation. Just even priming, like reminding you that you're going to die briefly changes,
*  changes a lot of things. These kinds of priming papers usually not replicated.
*  I just have like, I feel like I've heard a bunch of priming ones that. I think you have PTSD over
*  psychology papers are not replicated. I just did one, I just did a priming experiment on my own and
*  found it didn't have any effect. But again, can't you just give me a careless statement
*  summarizing an entire scientific discipline of terror management theory? I don't know.
*  Like I haven't rigorously looked at how good of it is psychologically. I think it is interesting
*  philosophy, the way Freud talked about the subconscious mind philosophically, it's an
*  interesting discussion. Then you have to get rigorous with each for sure. But the, the idea is
*  that like, it's not that religious people get rid of the terror of death. This is just one of the
*  popular ways they create an illusion on top of it. That's that idea, like a myth that allows,
*  that makes it easier for them to forget, to escape that terror. But everybody else does different,
*  different methods. Like you fill your days with a capitalism has a whole,
*  there's a whole religion of itself, like the rat race for getting more and more
*  mature possessions and so on. Couldn't you argue it in the opposite direction? Like,
*  let's say, assume that we're Christians here and we're like, ah, the atheists, you know,
*  everybody has terror of hell and the atheists invent this mythology where, you know, actually
*  evolution is true in order to escape their terror of hell. So that doesn't feel like a
*  persuasive argument to me, but I used to be very, very Christian and I did not have a terror of
*  death. And then I lost my faith and then I had a deep terror of death set in for a few years.
*  It felt very different to me. So for denial of death, I don't know if he says that it's
*  actually possible without really a lot of work to get to the actual terror. Like I think his claim
*  is that in early, early, early childhood development, that's when the terror is real.
*  And then we aggressively construct systems around it, of social interaction to, to
*  sort of construct illusions at the top of it. I'm doing a half-assed description of this philosophy,
*  but there, like it is interesting to simplify the human mind into underlying
*  mechanisms that drive it. Yeah. I was going to say your thinking seems kind of poetic,
*  like the way that you're sort of handling these, these concepts feel like more like aesthetically
*  driven. I think this theme is going to continue throughout this conversation as we talk about
*  relationships and sex. Yes, for sure. I think so. And I think your thinking seems to be very driven
*  by how can I construct an experiment to test this hypothesis? Yeah, something like that. Yeah, but
*  aren't there some things, especially that have to do with the human mind, that are really messy,
*  really difficult to understand. There's so many uncertainties and mysteries around that we don't
*  yet have the tools to collect the data. Like one of your favorite tools is the survey,
*  is asking people questions and then figuring out different ways to indirectly get at the truth
*  because there's flaws to the survey. You kind of learn about those flaws and you get better and
*  better at asking the right questions and so on. But that's not, that's indirect access to the human
*  mind. But do you think like poetic narratives are? I'm not like saying poetic narratives are bad.
*  I think it's like a cool way of like handling concepts, but I'm not sure that they are more
*  rigorous. No, no, no. Okay. No, but like they might be the more correct, like philosophy might be the
*  right way to discuss things that were really far from understanding. Yeah, I mean, they might be
*  more useful shorthand. Yeah. Like morality, like I don't think morality makes any sense, but it's
*  really useful shorthand to use when handling concepts in a lot of the time. Right, like ethics
*  and morality. You could construct studies that ask different questions. Like, you know, just having
*  worked with autonomous vehicles a lot, the trolley problem gets brought up. And I don't know,
*  you can construct all kinds of interesting surveys about the trolley problem, but does that really
*  get at some deep moral calculus that humans do? It's sexy because people like write clickbait
*  articles about it, but doesn't really get to like what you value more, five grandmas or like
*  three children, whatever. Like they construct these arguments of like, if you could steer a train,
*  if you could steer an autonomous car, which do you choose? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know
*  if it's possible with some of those to construct. Like sometimes the fuzzy area, there's some topics
*  that are fuzzy and will forever be fuzzy, given our limited cognitive capabilities. I don't know,
*  there's a way of looking at things where it's like, for example, the childhood fetish thing
*  that I was talking about, like where do your fetishes come from? Like you can develop a
*  narrative where it's like, you know, I think like this kind of thing is, you know, when you're
*  surrounded by feet when you're a child, this causes foot fetishes. And this is like kind of a cool
*  narrative. And I think a lot of people's ideas about philosophy follow the same sort of thing.
*  Like what is the narrative that is cool? And I think this is useful for meaning making. Like
*  I'm very pro meaning making. Like when you're talking about everything is fun because, you know,
*  the contrast or whatever. I very much ascribe to that. I really enjoy that philosophy. I also find
*  everything to be very delightful. And this isn't like a question of truth, right? We're not like,
*  where is the true delight that we're objectively measuring? Like this is a frame, a poetic frame
*  that you're using to like sort of change the way the light hits the world around you. And that's
*  super useful because it like makes you happier or something. Yeah, but also gets to the truth or
*  something. Yeah, I guess if what is the truth? Yet another question. What is truth? You've,
*  actually to jump back, you believe that free will is an illusion. So why does it feel like
*  I'm free to make any decision I want? It's a cool illusion. I think that's probably like where
*  a sense of identity comes from. Like when you really meditate on your sense of identity,
*  at least for me, it seems like it comes down to the sense of choice. Like, oh, I am doing
*  the thinking. Like, what does it mean to do with thinking? It's like something in me has
*  exerted agency over having this thought or not having this thought. Like the sense of
*  self really comes down to choice. And so when I say that like free will is an illusion, I also
*  mean there's something like the self is an illusion. Identity is a trick of the light.
*  But it's a really fun one. Yeah. You think a lot about your identity.
*  I have occasionally. Yeah, like you really struggle with it. You're proud of it. I do too.
*  It's not we have different journeys. But so I really take a lot of delight in it. I used to
*  be very into like deconstructing it. Like you probably maybe you know, I did a bunch of like
*  way too much LSD for a while. And at that point, very no, no ego. And now I'm like very ego. I
*  really enjoy having a lot of ego. I actually happen to know like everything about you.
*  Really? Yeah. Like more than you do. It's interesting. That's fascinating. Wait,
*  could you, can you solve my problems? Yes, all of them. I've did thorough research.
*  Okay. What is consciousness then? I actually wrote that as a quote. What is consciousness?
*  I have to remind myself. So like, uh, how does that tie in together with free will and identity
*  and all of that? What is consciousness is like one of the biggest questions ever. I think,
*  I do think that people often get confused when talking about consciousness because I think people
*  are referring to two separate concepts and often like combining them into one thing. Like we asked
*  the question, you know, is AI going to be conscious? Um, I think this is kind of the wrong question.
*  Like, uh, like we can identify signs of consciousness, like, ah, they seem to refer
*  to themselves. Uh, but this is not necessarily a pre-fifth consciousness in the same way that like
*  dream characters acting exactly the way normal human do, people do in your dream is not evidence
*  that they themselves are conscious. Uh, so like signs of consciousness are not pre-fifth
*  consciousness, but there is something that we definitely know, which is like, I currently
*  am conscious. I can tell because right. Like I'm like just directly observing my experience.
*  And so like there's one kind of consciousness, which is I am directly observing my experience
*  and that you cannot replicate it. Like there, I cannot observe two experiences. Uh, it is
*  necessarily singular and it is necessarily certain. Like you can make all the arguments you want.
*  Like I'm still directly observing. It's not a thing that's subject to reason. Whereas our other
*  thing is conscious. This is something that's replicable. Like you can apply it to multiple
*  people. Um, it's something that's not certain, uh, like almost definitionally not certain. Like
*  we don't actually know if there is, you know, an internal experience. So my argument is that like,
*  when people are talking about other things, having experienced, they're using a different concept
*  than the thing that they're actually looking at when they look at their own experience. I think
*  they're two different things. Definitionally not possible. No, if you understand the mechanism of
*  consciousness, you'll be able to measure it probably. Right. Yeah. But what are you measuring?
*  Like, I think this is like a subtle difference. Like when you're asking the question, is this
*  other thing conscious? Yeah. The easy thing to measure is like a survey. Does this thing appear
*  conscious? Yeah. And then the hard thing is you understand the actual mechanism of how
*  consciousness arises in the physics of the human brain. Yeah, but you can do that in a dream,
*  presumably. Like if you had a very good dream or a very good simulation. Yeah. But we could then have
*  somebody in a simulation or a dream where they go through and they fully understand, you know,
*  they do all the tests and the tests come back exactly the way you'd expect them to. Uh, but
*  from the outside we're like, well, this is misleading. They're not actually conscious.
*  Like your dream characters aren't conscious, right? I don't know. Are you asking? Are you telling?
*  I'm like appealing to an intuition. But it sounds like you're driving towards a narrative. I don't,
*  you did a poll about men and women and dreams. Yeah. There was some kind of difference. I couldn't
*  tell what the difference was except that more men and women quite a lot more women dream vividly
*  than men. Oh, which actually found my chaos survey. So I, I did a survey. Maybe you know that I just
*  had everything. You know, yes, I'm sorry. So as you clearly know, I'll try not to talk down to
*  you through this conversation because I'm sorry. And I not only know everything, I know how your
*  future looks like and every how everything ends. Yeah. So you could probably win all the prediction
*  markets on my life. Yeah. Cool. So we should also mention that you have like prediction markets.
*  You have like votes that you, what's the site called again? Manifold. Manifold. And one of them
*  was, will I be on the Lex Friedman podcast? Yeah. And I voted, I invested everything I own into the
*  yes. Is there such thing as insider trading on there? Is that goes against the terms of the?
*  No, I think insider training is part of the information. So it's supposed to be. And then
*  I realized it's actually public information that I voted because like, I think my face shows up.
*  There's like, damn it. It's going to influence. You could make the fake account or I could be
*  lying, right? Yeah. I could be, and then dump the stock. You know, I try to manipulate somebody made
*  a market like, is Aila going to post a poll spelled P O L E on her Twitter, like a photo.
*  And I was like, I'm going to manipulate this market. So I like fucked around with it and I voted no.
*  And then I accidentally posted a photo of a poll without thinking. Oh, that's like self sabotage.
*  I accidentally fucked up my own market. That's like the reverse of insider training. Yeah.
*  What were we talking about? Oh, the women and the men and the difference, the vivid dreams
*  and the markets. If you go with the market, oh, because I can, I can perfectly predict your
*  future, but then it's not fun. I like the role mass of unpredictability. And so I like to,
*  even though I know everything, I like to forget everything. Yeah. Very Buddhist of you. Yeah.
*  The river, no, no man in the river once, whatever the footsteps, how that goes. That's one of my
*  favorite questions is like, if you could press a button and then have all of your wants fulfilled,
*  anything that you want. So it's like such a rapid degree that you don't really experience the want.
*  Like as the want arises, it then is like completed as immediately so that you are completely without
*  want. Like, would you, would you press that button? Yeah. I didn't think you would. No, no,
*  no, because immediately everything starts being fun. The first is only fun the first time. But if
*  you want it to be fun. But like, what would be my source of fun? I feel like I would like on day
*  four, just to get off, I would need to like do like nuclear war because it will escalate quickly.
*  I feel like if everything is possible, I assume you mean like something that like
*  is not just normal human things, magical world, magical world, then you start escalating really
*  quickly. Like I wonder, I'll probably do like, I want everybody to just fly into the air and
*  hover in the air. Everybody. And then you're like, Oh, life is meaningless. Like why does like you,
*  I feel like you get, uh, no, I actually, that'd be a really interesting experiment. Like what are
*  the limits? Like, are we all capable of becoming psychopaths essentially? Like I like to believe
*  not. There's a very hard limits on that. Like in our own mind, like a basic compassion,
*  because I love being compassionate towards other human beings. And it's one of the things I think
*  about if you give me power, like a lot of power, like absolute power. And I think that's the power
*  you mentioned is the scariest kind of power. Cause it's like, it's not even power in this normal
*  world. It's like magical power where you lose. It's a dream world power where you like video game
*  power. You don't even think of it as reality. You could just mess with the world. I feel like
*  that's terrifying. Yeah. God. Yeah. But without like, I feel like the idea of God, what's like,
*  keep things like functioning properly. And then you'd probably would, if you wanted to keep them
*  functioning properly, then it would rapid. Like you would never experience a time where you're
*  like, Oh no, that was a mistake. Because as soon as you like, before you even experienced that,
*  the world would shift to, to match it. Oh, interesting. No, I think I would actually,
*  I take it back. I think I would regret the first time I heard somebody see in my visualization was
*  like a video game where everybody's like NPC, really dumb. No, I think the first time I,
*  I witnessed pain from anybody, that's when I would stop. And I would probably run into that very
*  quickly. Like even just the hovering, make a person hover and they're going to be probably
*  really upset with the hovering. Right. And so I'm going to be like, no, don't do that anymore.
*  And then I'll probably go to, I don't know, I'll just return back to my normal life.
*  Yeah, that's kind of what I feel like. Like if I had the power to do anything, I think
*  I would probably want to have a life very similar to where I am now.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's, it's like with Uber, like it'd be probably more convenient to do
*  certain things, but even then, like the struggle, like I got a flat tire, so I have to fix that.
*  I kind of, the flat tire makes, makes everything more beautiful. It's like, cool. I could do like
*  a normal manual thing. But also it makes you like appreciate your car, appreciate transportation,
*  appreciate the convenience, the transportation, all of it. I know some people who would call this
*  a bunch of copium, like you're just sort of making do with what you have. Like we wouldn't go back
*  to Amish times or like pre-technology because to like, in order to make ourselves appreciate
*  things more. And so this seems like a hindsight reasoning, which like I can appreciate that
*  argument, but I don't know. I'm like, I can't. Anyone who uses, sorry to interrupt the word
*  copium in their, in their argumentation, I think it's sus. It's sus. Yeah. It's sus my entire
*  argument is now. No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. I interrupted rudely the flow of
*  thought. But you, you say you don't think so in part you disagree with that kind of argument.
*  Um, yeah. Cause I think people have this idea that if you like come to accept or like find meaning
*  in what you have now, this is sort of at odds with trying to improve it. And I don't find this to be
*  the case. I find like the attempt to improve it to also be part of it. Like I enjoy the fact that
*  there's something like problematic going on because now I get the experience of like striving to make
*  it go away. And like that in itself is where the meaning lies. It's not just that things are bad,
*  it's that there's things are bad and we're trying to stop it. And also, exactly. There's,
*  if you combine that with a sense of optimism that the future can be better. Yeah. That feeds,
*  feeds into this productive effort of making things better.
*  And it somehow makes the vision of the things that are better, more intense,
*  having experienced shitty things. Yeah. So we talked about free will and consciousness
*  and what drives human civilization. Question left unanswered. Um, it's a homework problem for
*  the reader. Okay. Let's like a scoreboard at the end, the amount of questions that we,
*  they answer successfully versus not like polls. Yeah. Can we talk about some practical things?
*  Sure. Uh, so one of the many amazing things I think of you as a researcher, uh, but you've also been,
*  uh, doing research in the field. Yeah. Fieldwork. Fieldwork. A jink and all of, uh,
*  your sex work. Uh, how did you get, uh, what's the, the short and the long story of how you got into
*  sex work? How did I get into sex work? Well, the, I mean, there's a whole like childhood thing where
*  I was conservatively homeschooled. Uh, do you want to actually talk about your childhood? I think
*  it's interesting because you also worked in a factory. It's like your childhood is really
*  fascinating, uh, and difficult, uh, traumatic. So, um, and you've written about it.
*  There's a lot of ways we can talk about it, but maybe what are the things you remember
*  the good and the bad of your childhood of your maybe interaction with your father?
*  Yeah, my dad probably has narcissistic personality disorder. And so, uh, it was very centered on very
*  controlling childhood, uh, immensely. So, um, we were homeschooled and pretty isolated from the
*  outside world. Like we didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled. We went through a program
*  called growing kids God's way, um, which was very, it was like the kind of program where you're not
*  supposed to pick up babies when they cry to train them that they can't manipulate the parents
*  because like baby crying was viewed as like, uh, you're just teaching them from an early age that
*  they're allowed to make the parents do what the kids want. And we're very against this philosophy.
*  So, you know, that combined with a narcissistic personality disorder, dad was pretty rough, uh,
*  took controlling super controlling and developing and feeding the self critical aspect of your brain.
*  Yeah, very much. It was, you know, I was like lazy, but I was never going to accomplish anything in
*  life. It's going to move out of the house and realize how good I had it at home. You know,
*  the classic stuff. Uh, he was very like logical and smart though. And so he'd also like teach us
*  logic stuff. I remember some of my earliest memories are him like giving me basic logic
*  puzzles. Like the dog has three legs, you know, how many dogs have four legs and I would mess up
*  and, uh, but he was, he was a evangelist, basically a Christian evangelist. So we'd like Bible study
*  five nights a week. I memorized, I think 800 verses of the Bible by the time before I became an adult.
*  Um, yeah, it was, and it was very patriarchal also. So I was expected to grow up and become a
*  housewife. Basically they're like, Oh, you can go to college to meet a man and also to get a little
*  bit of education so that you can homeschool your own kids. Like we were explicitly told that women
*  were subordinate to men, um, in regards to like making decisions when you're married, our pastor's
*  daughter was not allowed to leave home because she would be outside of the authority of a man.
*  So when she got married, she was allowed to leave because she was never allowed to live in a house
*  where she was not under a hierarchy. So this is like the kind of culture that, that we live.
*  There's a hierarchy and, uh, there's a gender aspect to the hierarchy. There's men at the top
*  of the hierarchy. Okay. But your own psychology, your own mind, um, so most of that self-critical
*  brain is bad, right? It was confusing because he told me that I was smart, but also that I would
*  fail. But I, I think not smart enough, right? Like smart, but not smart enough, but like not virtuous
*  or something. Okay. So there's, okay, right. There's always a, a flaw.
*  I think a lot of it was a lot of the fucked upness of my brain came from feeling like I
*  didn't have the authority to think because it was so like carefully like suppressed, like the,
*  my ability to like express or have any sort of power was just absolutely annihilated,
*  like systemically, like psychologically, they would do like psychological torture
*  mechanisms to make sure that like I wasn't actually thinking on my own or like being able
*  to deviate from anything anybody ever told me to the degree that it's still ingrained in me. Like
*  I once was a friend, we were traveling and he wanted me to hop a turnstile. It was like very
*  late at night. The train was here and I could not physically force myself to do it. Like he was like
*  yelling me like, come on, do it. Like, like no, but I was trying so hard to make my body across the
*  line and it was just, it's like embedded in my physical being to like be unable to do stuff like
*  that, which is really annoying. Do you're not free to take action in this world? Yeah. Some of them.
*  So that was, I think the most annoying part of the, my upbringing.
*  Would you classify it as like suffering? At the time? Yeah, definitely. Well, it's confusing
*  because like when, when I was a child, it was, it was just painful in the sense that like things
*  suck, but it was placed in a meaning framework, right? Like it is good, it is virtuous to submit
*  to your parents and do what they want. If they tell you to say goodbye to your best friend forever
*  and never talk to them again, you go do that without complaining. And so like I would go do
*  something like that and I would like, it would suck. It really was like concretely painful,
*  but it was also placed in this narrative where I was like fulfilling some sort of greater purpose.
*  And so, so it's very confusing to refer to it as suffering because there's so many painful things
*  we do today that are placed in the narrative of greater purpose that like, I think I would agree
*  with, like I go get a medical procedure done and that sucks, but I'm like, ah, this is helping me
*  in the long run. But like, say if I got abducted to an alien planet and they're like, by the way,
*  all of those medical procedures you got done, like you didn't have to get them done. Those
*  are totally unnecessary. Then I might get really upset about it. Yeah. I wouldn't trust those
*  aliens though, because they probably want to do different medical procedures. I saw, I saw some,
*  I saw a thumbnail for a video that I'm proud of myself for not clicking on about a man who's
*  claimed that he had sex with aliens. And I was like, oh, for not clicking on that. Because I was
*  because I would probably watch it for like 20 minutes and then I should be doing work.
*  Oh, I see. So like I, and I, and I'm actually happy because I get to imagine what all the
*  different possibilities that could have been for that man who had sex with them. Did you have like
*  a really high like resting happiness state? Yes. Yeah. Probably like a mushroom state. Yeah.
*  Wow. Do you do mushrooms? I've done mushrooms before. It was very awesome.
*  But like more intensely awesome. But, but like, like, because I was just looking at nature,
*  it makes nature even more beautiful, I think. But it's already, it's already pretty beautiful.
*  I haven't done MDMA. People say that I should. It's very nice. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. But I'm already,
*  yeah. What did you call it? Resting happiness state? Yeah. High resting, happening happiness.
*  Yeah. That's a good, that's a good way to describe it. But it's not like some of it is genetic
*  that you're able to notice the beauty in the world. And some of it is practiced where you
*  realize focusing on the negative things in life, like unproductively is, it's, it just doesn't help
*  your mind flourish. So like you just notice that. And it's like, I mean, I think people with like
*  depression learn that or like probably with trauma too is like there's certain triggers.
*  Like if you're, if you suffer from depression, you have to kind of constantly know there's going to
*  be triggers that will inspire, like force you to spiral down. And so just avoid those triggers.
*  Some people have that with diet, with food and so on. And so I just don't like whenever there's
*  shady things happening or shady people, unless I can help, unless, unless I can somehow help,
*  like why focus on it? Yeah. Anyway, back to your upbringing. What, what was the journey of escaping
*  that? I, well, I left home like kind of early because my, my dad and I were not getting along
*  by the time I was a teenager. But I still Christian for a while. And I lost my faith after I think I
*  moved away and I started having friends that weren't religious or like weren't raised in the
*  super conservative environment that I came from. And I think I, this was not conscious at the time.
*  This is my hindsight story, but I believe that like being exposed to a culture in which I had
*  the capacity to believe, like allowed my brain to actually seriously consider the thought that maybe
*  all of this stuff was untrue that I'd been taught like 6,000 year old earth and evolution is a lie,
*  you know, macro evolution and all of this stuff. Because like when you're, when you're immersed
*  in an environment like that, I don't think you actually have a choice. Like your brain has to
*  believe these things because this is a survival thing. Like if you believe this, you'll be like,
*  if you believe the wrong thing, you'll be totally cast out. Even if they're not going to cast you
*  out, you're going to be cast out in like communion with others because we were always told that you
*  can't like trust non-believers really. They don't have a moral compass. They're going to screw you
*  over. And so I'm like, Oh, I can't be that. Like everybody's going to outcast me internally. So
*  anyway, I wasn't, I don't think I actually had the capacity to seriously question my faith, even
*  though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard until I got into an environment where it was
*  safe to do so. And once I started being able to make friends who were not religious, I'm like,
*  Oh, if I lose my faith, I'm still going to have some sort of community. And then at that time,
*  I went through some questioning and then I lost my faith. And so in that, given your friends,
*  given your situation, you have, you're now have the freedom to think essentially,
*  or at least the ability to think of something that was acceptable in the new culture. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Without, I mean, is there a danger of like adopting the beliefs of the new culture?
*  So like there's some aspects of just being able to think freely, which you weren't able to do when
*  you were growing up, just to think, like look at the world and wonder how it works, that kind of
*  thing. I mean, you work it within certain boundaries. Like there are certain basic assumptions.
*  And as long as you were following those basic assumptions, which is to be fair, it's like kind
*  of what we're doing now. Like we have, I have, I gone done the personal research that like
*  evolution is the thing that's going on. Have I looked at like the age of the stones? No, I haven't.
*  I'm trusting other people. Yeah. Which I think is like a fair choice to make given where I'm at
*  right now. But you're also assuming like there's causality in the universe. Time is real. Yeah.
*  That like, that first of all, the thing that your senses are perceiving is real.
*  You're assuming a lot of things. Yeah. I think like it's better just to become aware of the
*  assumptions you're making, like as opposed to not making those assumptions at all. Like you have to
*  assume something. And I did, it's very suspicious, right, that I went out of this very conservative
*  culture. And now, well, I guess I don't believe things that are super in line with the current
*  culture. I think this is why I feel a little bit safer right now, because like when I was Christian,
*  I believed generally Christian things. But now I believe a bunch of things that like people really
*  hate. Like I get canceled online all the time. I'm like, okay, this is a sign that maybe you're
*  thinking independently if you're like able to think things that are completely at odds with the
*  people around you. And to be fair, this is a little bit easier to do when it's like general
*  culture, but it's much harder to do with your peer group. Like the people that you trust,
*  your friends, the people whose opinions you respect, like disagreeing with those people is
*  very difficult and I'm not very good at it. Yeah. I do think that if you establish yourself as a
*  person who can be trusted and is a good human being, you have a lot more freedom to then explore
*  ideas that are different from your peer group. So like those seem like if you separate the space
*  of ideas versus some kind of like deeper sense of what this person is, like that they're an
*  interesting and trustworthy and good human being. Well, like is there somebody that you respect to
*  you because they're significantly smarter than you? And can you imagine believing an idea that
*  you've heard them talk really disdainfully about? Like how would you feel coming to me like, I
*  believe this thing that you find to be? Yeah, I do all the time. Oh yeah? Yeah. You may be braver than me.
*  And to be fair, I support doing this. Like I try to do this, but I think like subconsciously I
*  notice that I don't do it as much. And so I'm suspicious of myself. I'm like, oh, I wonder if
*  I'm hiding to myself, like actual curiosity about things that might deviate from my peer group,
*  because I noticed that I'm not actually deviating with them as much as I do with the outside world.
*  That's interesting. I mean, like, because I do see most people I interact with as smarter than me,
*  but I also have this intuitive feeling that dumb people, which I consider myself being, have wisdom.
*  So like in the disagreement, actually, I also believe in the power of conversation
*  and in the tension of disagreement. So I think even just disagreeing from a place,
*  from a good place, from a place of like love and respect for each other, I think I just believe
*  in that. So it's not like individuals, you're disagreeing. You're like working towards
*  arriving at some deeper truth together, right? Even if the other person is smarter. Maybe that's
*  maybe that's how I justify it for myself. I just, I'm also a fan of conversations because like
*  I've seen just listening to conversations, it seems like a great conversation more
*  emerges from it than the sum of its parts, right? Like somehow two people together can do
*  like that dance of ideas can somehow create a cool thing. By the way, I enjoyed,
*  I saw a video of you dancing at a bar drunk. It wasn't a bar drunk. It didn't look drunk,
*  but just the dancing. It was like ballroom dancing type of thing. I was like, yeah.
*  Something like that. I've been doing a bit of tango dancing. I like it.
*  Argentine? Nice. I like stuff with the body in general, like, like wrestling or combat. Like
*  usually when there's a tension, you have to understand the mechanics of how two bodies move
*  when they're in conflict and dancing is similar. Like you have to do like rapid thinking also,
*  like rapid intuitive physical thinking. And that's my favorite kind of thing. Like a lot of exercise
*  is really boring to me because you can just do it while your brain's off, but something like
*  ballroom dancing or fusion dancing, you have to constantly be like figuring out like it's a rapid
*  puzzle. And that's so wonderful. What's fusion dancing? That's the video. It's a fusion dancing
*  is like, if you have any sort of dance background, you can come and you just kind of mix those
*  together. Oh, you just kind of improvise. So you can have like people doing ballet with people
*  doing ballroom with people doing blues. Cool. And then there's an interesting dynamic because
*  there's, I don't know, maybe you can correct me, but there's, that's very meta. There's usually a
*  lead and a follow. I guess most dances have that. Yeah. Yeah. And so that, but both have a different,
*  like you both have to be quite sensitive to the other human being, but in a different way. Yeah.
*  It's interesting. Yeah. So I like both that there is that definitive role, but also like it's not
*  somehow that one is better than the other. There's a interesting tension between the two. Yeah.
*  Cause it's like a basic rule set that allows for a ton of expression. I've recently started to
*  experiment with like reverse leading. It's not like back leading. It's like,
*  I don't know. Like sometimes I was like, so you can lead as a follow. Oh, you can lead.
*  What I'm typically following. I'll like occasionally throw in a little lead here and there.
*  But don't you kind of follow it? Oh, I see. Don't you hit hint at a lead when you're following?
*  Like don't you just by the dynamics of your movement, you're not perfectly following.
*  I mean, cause it is like the lead is listening to your body. Right? Yeah. So like,
*  you're kind of both figuring out what you do next. That's true. I'm a very good follow though.
*  Okay. So I'm like, I'm like, I'm an invisible follow. You do have movements like I,
*  Oh, interesting. I'm not like good at technique. I didn't know those existed. Like a perfect follow.
*  So you can perfect follow. I'm really ideal. I'm not great at technique and sometimes I'll fall
*  over, but like with the following part, I'm very good at it. Do you enjoy following? Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's really nice. It's the, again, like it's a very fast physical puzzle you have to solve. It's
*  like typing. I really like typing. That's why I was inquiring about your keyboard earlier. Why
*  you like typing? It's like the very fast, like the really rapid response was the reaction time.
*  I like things that like have very fast reaction times, like games like that.
*  But typing is not a reaction or is it the brain generating words? And then you're like,
*  how's typing a reaction? Okay. The sensation that I get when I am typing is the kind of thing that
*  I'm trying to point out. So maybe, maybe reaction time isn't the quite, I don't know what the term
*  is, but whatever that thing is, like the thing where you have to like look at a word and then
*  communicate it into your fingers. Yeah. It feels like dancing. Like you're responding. You're
*  responding to your brain. Your fingers are doing the responding to the brain that generate the words.
*  Yeah. Making your body do what your brain wants it to do, but like fast and precisely.
*  Oh, then you might not like this Kinesis keyboard because it makes the, it makes it easier to do
*  that. You probably like the struggle, right? Well, I mean, it looks hard because you have,
*  it looks like it's high depression on the keys. No, it's well, oh, I see. Yes. More than,
*  more than like a laptop keyboard, but like that you don't have to, one of the main things is you
*  don't have to move your fingers at all. So like, so like, for example, a lot of people that I think
*  they have a back space up in the top right corner. So if you have to make mistakes, which is like,
*  I mean, that's like so metaphorical, like every mistake you have to like really hurt yourself for
*  because like stretch for the back space. There's that poetic narrative again. It's like it
*  emanates like a lot of your perspective. Yeah. No. Yeah. I don't, and I see it as a good thing. It's
*  a good, like a, a romantic element permeates my interpretation of the world. Yes. But you,
*  you left home early. How did you end up working at a factory? I tried to go to college, but failed.
*  Couldn't afford it. Did you like it? I remember it just being really slow. I remember being
*  shocked that the teachers didn't care. Like I was used to homeschooling. Yeah. And, and where,
*  I don't know, like educate, it just like meant something. It felt like the people around me that
*  were teaching me, cause we had like a mom's group also, like directly cared about what I was learning
*  and I would be able to ask questions and they would like really respond. What's a mom's group?
*  It was like a homeschooling groups. There were a bunch of moms who are homeschooling their kids,
*  get together and then teach each other's kids. Oh, cool. Yeah. And they have different like
*  interests and capabilities and they kind of, and sometimes if some of the kids are really good at
*  something, you have like the older kids teaching the other ones too. So it was very like, everybody
*  kind of figures out what they can good at and they share that skill set with everybody else,
*  which I think was a pretty great setup. Honestly, I think my childhood kind of sucked in a lot of
*  ways, but homeschooling was excellent for me, mainly because it just had so much free time.
*  Like I was just did like two to three hours of school and then did whatever the fuck I wanted
*  for the rest of the day. And I got to actually pursue skills that are still useful for me to
*  this day. So even in that constrained environment, like I wrote, I've read fantasy books and I wrote
*  so much and now I'm, now I'm writing a lot from my blog. So what kind of fantasy books, like
*  sci-fi type stuff, my classic, like I read like Mercedes Lackey and the E E night and
*  Ursula Le Guin and I don't know any of this. What is this? What is it? Is it like a romantic thing
*  or is it like, is it romance? All the fantasy books like dragons and dragons. Oh, dragons.
*  Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. You didn't mention Tolkien for the fan. I read, I read Tolkien.
*  Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, it's beautiful. So you, you, uh, through all the dragons,
*  how did you end up in a factory? You try school. Yeah. Yeah. Try school, had the job
*  off a couple of months. And then I was like, well, I'm poor. And, uh, I was, I was ready to
*  take any job. I was like applying for sewer jobs. And then I got a factory. I'm like, all right,
*  let's do it. Cause my parents know, no financial help at all. They're like, you pull yourself up
*  by your own bootstraps, you know? So anyway, I went to work in a factory and that sucks.
*  Ass do not recommend. We had to work up, wake up like 4 AM, you know, work on weekends to
*  fluorescent lights. It was terrible. And so I did that for about a year and I was like, this is,
*  I was trying to grip my teeth and be like, this is my life, right? I didn't have high expectations
*  for my life. I was just like, I thought like, if you get a job where you don't have to be on your
*  feet all the time, that's, that's your live in a good life. But, and then I got another job briefly
*  as a photographer and then they fired me. I think I was 19 at the time. Fired you for like, I was
*  just, I was too young and really, really bad at interacting with people in the outside world.
*  Like I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler with other homeschoolers, but in the
*  outside world, especially with all of the like hierarchy submissions stuff beaten into me, like
*  literally beaten into me, it was very difficult for me to interact with other people who were like
*  older than me or had any sort of confidence at all. So they hired me to do like photography for
*  people and then I was rapidly turned out that I was bad at this. And so they fired me. But at that
*  point I'd left my factory job. I'm like, I can't go back to the factory. So I tried, I had some
*  savings and I slept on friends' couches and I tried various self-employment stuff. I'm like,
*  I can do product photography or something, but it's Idaho, you know, nothing. And if you're like a
*  19 year old with no experience in the outside world at all, it was really difficult. And so
*  I had a friend recommend that I try becoming a cam girl. So that's how it started.
*  What's, what is, what is camming? What is being a cam girl?
*  Camming is like you talk to the camera live on the computer, like you live stream. It's kind of like
*  Twitch. And then people are typing in the chat like, huh, do this stuff. And then the people can
*  tip you money and then you can do things in response. Like, oh, if you took me a hundred tokens,
*  you know, I'll take my shirt off or something like that.
*  And like, what's the, what site were you using at that time?
*  My free cams.
*  My free cams. Is that a popular site?
*  It's pretty popular.
*  Okay. And how did, what were the next steps? Like, did you enjoy it?
*  Oh, well, it was the first time I had actual control over my life
*  and I made like actual real money. And so I just exploded into it. I thought about it nonstop. I
*  was streaming all the time. I was like coming up with like new creative things. And the thing is
*  I don't know. There's something about public school that I ended up living in a house of cam
*  girls full of other girls who had gone to public school. And I don't know if how much of his genetic
*  or like just because I'm weird or is it because of our upbringing, but I felt like I was much more
*  fearless and much more weird and creative online than other people were. Not because they weren't
*  awesome people, but because I think like public school, I got the impression based on them talking
*  about it, that it sort of like beats out any sort of deviance from you. Like more so than your,
*  because I got the, we had moral deviance was beaten out, but like you could do whatever.
*  Creative deviance wasn't so much like I didn't have other kids making fun of me ever. I didn't,
*  I don't think I'd ever heard an insult about my physical appearance as a child or teenager once.
*  So your father was basically saying you're not good enough was intellectual.
*  Oh, no, that was like moral fail. Moral fail. Yeah. Like I was not virtuous.
*  Like in various ways, like, you know, like you're lazy and
*  mostly the lazy part. I have like, I have like ADHD or something. Yeah. And it was,
*  I was not good at it as a kid either. I would totally forget all the time. And
*  is there some sexual repression aspect to that? Like, you know how they say that there's,
*  it's not just homeschooling, but just like Catholic girls and so on,
*  just because like there's moral, you're forbidden to do certain things. Like there's a kind of
*  liberating feeling of saying, like basically rediscovering yourself, rediscovering your
*  freedom by doing just diving head in at first into sexuality, into your own sexuality. Yeah.
*  Is there some aspect to that? Yeah, absolutely to some degree. I think that like people kind of
*  model it slightly wrong. Like I think there's a truth to it. But when I first got out of the
*  house, for me, freedom was like going outside at 2 a.m. or like eating chocolate, you know,
*  on days that I previously wasn't allowed to eat chocolate. Like that was like a really intense
*  expression of rebellion for me. And I think people like don't think of this, like I got out a lot of
*  my like intense rebellion through things that people don't typically consider to be rebellious
*  at all. Sure. Like I wore a bikini. Yeah. Insane. I just like walked around and then like,
*  I could do this. Yeah, basically. And so like this was most of that emotional processing for me.
*  And I took me a couple of years from leaving home and all of that conservative culture into doing
*  sex work. In the meantime, I did try having sex with a lot of people, but this was mainly because
*  I didn't know what the norms were. I didn't really understand. I was just like, OK, take things
*  logically. Take things one step at a time. And I'm like, OK, if the whole previous set about like how
*  I'm not supposed to kiss somebody until the altar of marriage, if that's not the way that things are
*  supposed to go, then what is the way things are supposed to go? And I was like, well, if I am
*  aroused, I should go have sex with someone, right? Is there any reason not to? No. So I went, I just,
*  I would go around asking random people to have sex with me. Did you have any peer pressure saying
*  like that's not good or that is good or like any? Did you feel any currents of society in any
*  direction? Or are you independently just thinking like for first principles? I think I mean,
*  like I'm not saying it was a totally clean thing. I'm sure that I was experiencing society telling
*  me this is bad, but you have to know, like I wasn't watching normal movies when I was a teen.
*  Like we watched Christian movies. The stuff that we watched was filtered. Like I watched The Titanic
*  I had no idea that Jack and Rose had sex because it was put through a filtered way. Did they? Yeah,
*  they went and you know, he'd painted her naked and yeah, there was a scene in a car on the ship.
*  Car on the ship. Yeah. They had like storage cars and storage and there's a hand. I watched it again
*  later. I was like, I don't remember the sex scene. Well, maybe were you also put through a
*  filtered version? Maybe it's the filter I see. Like did the couple in the notebook also have sex?
*  Because maybe for romantic movies, I focus on the romance.
*  Maybe, right? And the sex scenes are always like weirdly filmed in these. Yeah. Because it's never,
*  I mean, it doesn't, it feels more like romance than sex. I guess that's the main focus of this,
*  right? Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Anyway, so they had sex. It's good to know.
*  They did. I'll go back and watch now. You have your own personal filter on your brain.
*  And once you realize that there are some, like the foundation of your beliefs
*  were wrong, then everything might be wrong. And you kind of just doing first principles.
*  And again, like not totally separate from culture, but also I think in general,
*  I also have a predisposition to just be like, you know, fuck what culture tells you,
*  just figure out what's right for you and do it. And so that mixed with, you know, the figuring
*  things out from first principles. I did eventually figure out that I didn't like having casual sex
*  with just anybody quite as much. So I stopped that, but it took me a while to figure that out.
*  What's the negative of casual sex? It's just like not good. I mean, if you like figure out the
*  chemistry you have with someone better, then it can be a lot nicer, but I wasn't doing that. I was
*  just like somebody I met and I'm like, you seem kind of cute. Okay. Like I didn't bother to try
*  and develop any chemistry. I mean, I didn't know. Chemistry even outside of sex, just chemistry,
*  like human chemistry, like conversation. Yeah. Okay. I would, I would, I'm, it's like kind of
*  cringy, but I would like, I would like walk up to guys or send them messages. Like, would you like
*  to have coitus is what I would say. You would say coitus. I said that. I mean, it's kind of,
*  it's kind of cute in a way. I mean, it's a girl asking you to get laid. So they probably didn't
*  care that much. But anyway, I'm saying that like, I had a lot of rebelling out of my system by the
*  time I started sex work. So like for me, like maybe I'm sure it was somehow related because
*  we were extremely sexually repressed growing up. I remember the day I learned I had a vagina,
*  which was absolutely horrifying. Do not recommend figuring out you have another orifice in your body.
*  But like, do you want to share the process of you figuring out that you had a vagina or is that?
*  They told me I had a vagina. Oh, like intellectually, like there was somebody said,
*  you have a vagina vagina. Yeah. And that was horrifying to you. Yeah. I didn't know I had,
*  cause you weren't supposed to ever like touch or look at yourself ever. So I never did. It was
*  really disgusting. And so I had no idea that what was going on in my genital region. And so one day
*  my mom sat me down, I think it was like nine or 10. And she was like, you have a, there's another.
*  What? And you're going to bleed out of it is what she told me. You're going to bleed out of it for a
*  while. And I was like, what the fuck mom? I didn't know the word fuck was, but I would have said that
*  if I had known. When did you first learn the word fuck? Oh, I think I learned it when I was at a
*  playground and it was written somewhere and I read it out loud. And then a kid next to me started
*  giggling. Did you ever, did you say fuck again for a while? No, I think the next time I said,
*  I swore the first time I was 18, like intentionally said a swear word when I was 18. Did you feel good?
*  I was like really nervous. I was like nervous. I mean, fuck's pretty good. Yeah. Fuck's pretty
*  good. Yeah. Okay. So, so that's camming. I mean, what are the pros and cons of camming and how does
*  OnlyFans map into this? Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point? I did. Yeah. I came for like five or
*  six years and I burned out eventually. What are the good aspects? What are the bad aspects of camming?
*  Well, the good aspects were that it's just your own terms. You get to decide everything about it
*  is under your control, which I loved at the time. I was like, I can work when I want, how I want
*  any sort of expression. I experimented and I was very successful. I was making around $200 an hour,
*  which for that website at the time was like pretty good. I had elaborate routines. I was a mime. I
*  would do like dress up as a mime and then dress up a chair and I would seduce the chair. Oh, cool.
*  Yeah. Or like, it was, was there an artistic element to it almost? Yeah. I had like gnomes.
*  Did you talk to the chair? You had gnomes? No, I was a mime. You don't. Oh, sorry. Right. Yeah.
*  Get us straight, dude. You know what I really appreciate about you is I'm asking some really
*  dumb questions and you're answering it in a very intelligent way. So I appreciate that.
*  All right. Did you ask the chair questions? I was a mime, you fucking idiot. Okay. I'm sorry.
*  But there's gnomes on the, like big gnomes or small gnomes, like lawn gnomes,
*  lawn gnomes. And you seduce the lawn gnomes on the chair. The gnomes sitting on the chair.
*  There were some, yeah, gnomes on the chair. I did a photo set, which I submitted to Reddit,
*  where I got abducted. I was like stripping, taking my clothes off and then slowly the gnomes
*  surrounded me in the background and dragged me off. And I did this as a photo set. And I,
*  Consensually? I mean, I didn't feel consensual in the photos, but it was the 11th top post.
*  It was very successful on Reddit, basically. It was the top post on Gone Wild and the 11th
*  top post of all time on Reddit. Which I think will probably just means it's like,
*  it's artistic, it's interesting, it's edgy, it's funny, so it's really, really well done.
*  But it was really shocking to me that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.
*  Like for me, it was like breathing. Like you're just doing sex and you're bored. I'm like,
*  what do you do? I don't know. Let's try something funny. Like it's just the natural progression.
*  And it felt to me like there was almost no competition. Like I would just be really
*  creative and like immediately it was the top not safe for work post on Reddit. Like, well,
*  I didn't even try that hard. And so it's really shocking to me that other women who are doing
*  this sort of thing. Is that still a little bit of the case? Like that there's not as much like,
*  because from my sort of outsider perspective, that seems to be still the case. Like there's not,
*  like as you describe it, that's kind of cool. That's like almost like playing,
*  like having fun with sexuality almost. Yeah. Yeah, but that does require kind of thinking through,
*  it's almost like a creative project, like a photography project or something like that.
*  Almost like a little skit movie. It's interesting. It's this vibe of like, how can you like bring
*  like vibrant novelty to whatever you're doing, anything you're doing. And I really like doing
*  this with surveys too. Like I've been doing a lot of standard surveys, but I'm also like experimenting
*  with novel creative artistic surveys. I'm like, how do you ask a question in a way that's like
*  beautiful and unusual and like a thing is completely groundbreaking. Like nobody's ever like,
*  you always make everything so poetic and romantic is disgusting. No,
*  I don't know. But yes, I think you have that engine in your head, I guess, of creativity.
*  Like, yeah, the way you ask questions, which is not trivial to do, like for,
*  it's actually very difficult to do, like good survey questions. And I mean, we're joking,
*  but like, yeah, almost like poetic, because you have to ask a question in a way that doesn't lead
*  to the answer. Yes. Like you have to kind of inspire them to think and then indirectly get
*  at the truth. It's an art form, honestly. Yeah. And also in a way where they don't
*  misinterpret the question, because it's amazing how any question you think, oh, this is the
*  clearest question possible. No, you're wrong. It has to be even clearer. Right. Willingly or
*  unwillingly, because like you also have to defend against that question being criticized later when
*  you publish about it. All of that. You have to think about it. I think this might be my greatest
*  strength. So I'm not very good at statistics. I'm not like great at presenting data, but I think
*  probably my greatest strength is in fact survey design and like question phrasing. Because I've
*  treated so many thousands of polls and every single one I get people telling me like the way
*  that they misinterpreted the poll. So it's like, it's like gone through fire. And then again,
*  I'm testing the phrasings all the time. Like what happens if you slightly shift phrasings? And so
*  I'll do the same question test over time to see how it changes and the way the framing affects the
*  results. So the good and the bad, the camming. So you said good, the, what was it? I forgot.
*  The freedom. The freedom to be also be creative. Yeah. And that is just, it was exhausting. The
*  site that I was on, the way that it's structured is that you're ranking on the site and thus the
*  amount of people that see you and thus the amount of money you are on, you earn is affected by the
*  amount of money that you earn on average over the last 60 days. So if you're streaming and nobody's
*  tipping you, this means that you're going to be dropping down in the rankings, which is going to
*  make it harder in the future. So the rich get richer in that site. Yeah. So it's very high
*  pressure. Like if you're on, you need to be making money as fast as you can, if you want to continue
*  to make money. So that was really stressful. It was very mentally taxing. I would do it for a
*  couple of hours and just log off and be completely exhausted because you're just like on as hard as
*  you can. And this is why I have a little PTSD around streaming. Like I've considered Twitch
*  streaming and I try a little bit and I'm like, I haven't fully integrated the fact that you don't
*  have to be like maximally entertaining every single second yet. You can actually just chill out and
*  take it slow and nothing bad happens. Yeah. Yeah. You can just enjoy silence. Yeah.
*  Did you feel lonely doing it? I mean, even just streamers feel lonely.
*  I moved into a house of cam girls. Did that make it better or worse?
*  They're great. I'm still friends with them to this day. Also, it was like a team almost like
*  we're in this kind of together. Yeah. So we was like working together and, you know, stream together
*  and swap our clothes and stuff. It was great. Swap ideas too. Swap ideas. Yeah. And actually on a
*  small tangent, maybe a big tangent, what do you think? Cause it's the recent controversy of Andrew
*  Tate and that he, I think in the past ran a camming business and he's being accused of sex
*  trafficking. What do you think? Like from your own experience, what do you understand about Andrew
*  Tate? Is he a good person? Is he a bad person? Is there something shady about his practices
*  or not? I wish I could answer, but I don't know. I haven't looked into it at all. I've heard people
*  talking about it. I just haven't bothered to go into it. It is well known that like when I was
*  doing it back in the day, the Eastern European models had something different going on though.
*  It was like a trope about, you know, there's the Eastern European models and then there's everybody
*  else. They're what? It's like darker or something like that? Like they do studios and they're lower
*  quality. Which means what? Studios are, you go into like a warehouse and then they have set up a
*  things that replicate bedrooms, but they're just like stalls. And then you rent out or you pay the
*  studio percentage of your income. And you can tell when something looks like a studio, it's like a
*  type of background. That if you're watching enough, it kind of starts to notice the patterns.
*  So like the standards are lower there and the ethical boundaries are a little looser.
*  How people are treated. I never heard anything about the ethical side. I just knew that it was
*  like lower quality. Like the girls seemed like they were less into it and like cared less.
*  How does this all interplay with like sex trafficking? So consensual versus not consensual?
*  I would be shocked if there were never any non-consensual camming.
*  I mean, I guess it's like if it were going to happen at that point,
*  be surprised if it were in fact Eastern European models based on this is outdated. This is,
*  I'm just thinking of my stereotypes back when I cammed a lot.
*  Sure. So some of that is stereotypes versus like collecting good data, right?
*  Yeah. I haven't done data on cam girl.
*  It's even hard to get that data. Right. But obviously a really important problem.
*  There's a method that I'm trying that I really like. I designed a survey type,
*  which is like asking people who you know. Like who do you know who's done this? And you tell me like,
*  oh, do you know anybody who's a doctor? Do you know anybody who has had cancer or like smokes?
*  Personally, I mean.
*  Yeah. Personally. Just do you know anybody? And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things,
*  you can calibrate the responses. So like-
*  That's really interesting.
*  If your population, you know, 20% of them know doctors, and then you know the actual
*  amount of doctors, then you can tell like how this is corresponding. Like what is the visibility of
*  doctors? So you can reconstruct the graph.
*  Basically. Yeah. And we can do this with sex trafficking. Of course, people are going to be
*  like, well, sex trafficking is not visible. People, you don't know those. Like, well,
*  then we can ask about other non-visible things that other people don't know that we do have data for.
*  Like homelessness or being in jail or like if you have been like sexually assaulted,
*  a lot of people don't like talking about if they've been sexually assaulted. So you can do
*  a whole bunch of things that are like similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way that we do
*  actually have rates for and then compare that to the graph when we ask people, do you know anybody
*  who's in sex traffic? So again, this is not perfect. I'm not saying this is ideal.
*  But you can infer things. You can infer things about that graph.
*  But let's say we don't have good ways of measuring sex trafficking right now. Anyway,
*  I did a big deep dive into the research that we have in sex trafficking in the Western world
*  and the actual, like I read the studies and like reports about the studies and it's really
*  pitiful. We have terrible data. It's like there's just like vague estimations made from one guy in
*  a basement in the 80s. That's like the basis for like one big study that like a lot of people report
*  on. And so I'm like, okay, so the method I'm proposing obviously is not perfect, but like
*  the bar is so low at this point. Well, I wonder also if there's ways to design a survey that gets
*  at the victims of sex trafficking also, which is they presumably have public access
*  to the internet. And I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware that they're victims. Like
*  it's asking the question when you're inside of a toxic relationship, are you inside of a toxic
*  relationship? I mean, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic, sometimes your mind is fucked with,
*  right? You don't even know what's true. So it's interesting if you can design surveys that break-
*  Who actively sex traffic? Yeah, who could break through that. So basically get data on how many
*  people are getting sex traffic directly. Oh yeah, like if you don't frame it, like if you don't say
*  the word sex trafficking, you're like, are you just in a situation where you'd- And maybe through the
*  survey, I mean, that's very meta, but through the survey help them. You know, I did this, this is
*  what started my relationship surveys. So I've done a series of relationship surveys and that was
*  because I knew somebody in a terrible relationship and I was like, I bet if she took a survey where
*  she answered questions about her relationship and at the end got a score that compared her to
*  everybody else, she'd be like, oh wait, everybody else has much better relationships than I do. So
*  that's why I started making the relationship surveys was exactly for that reason. Yeah,
*  that's really, really powerful to know that like you're not crazy for thinking this is a bad
*  relationship. Right. Or I think like the actual question is like, could you do better if you
*  broke up? I think that the thing that keeps most people in their relationships is like, this is the
*  best that I can do. Like this is normal. And if it were normal, I would say that they are right.
*  Like if you live in a culture where everybody is abusing their people and their relationships,
*  then yeah, I mean, what are you going to do? Break up and then just be alone for the rest
*  of your life. Most people don't want to do that. But now comparing yourself to the average is good
*  to know. To know your options are. At least understand it because being normal is not always,
*  like this conversation is not always great. Meaning this conversation is anything but normal.
*  Okay. And that was a tangent on a tangent about a niche passion, which is really fascinating that
*  you're playing with those kinds of ideas of survey design, but back to camming. So what were the cons?
*  What were the negatives of camming? Like the exhaustion of just like life, like the high
*  pressure thing. That was probably the worst thing. So not, was there, what about the interaction with
*  different people? Like the dynamics of the interaction with the, with the fans, I guess.
*  I had a pretty great time. I mean, obviously it wasn't perfect because it's the internet, but
*  I don't know. This, this is the thing that confuses me a lot because a lot of women that I know
*  complain about being harassed by men quite a lot. They're like, you know, men are always, you know,
*  grow up and are asked, you know, you have to be paranoid in the club. People are like, they're
*  always huffing on you and you're just like, Jesus Christ, get away. And I do not have this experience
*  or like maybe I do, but I'm interpreting it differently. I don't know. The thing is,
*  I don't know what causes me to have such a different experience from these women that are like really
*  feel really hostile towards men. And my guess is that there's some sort of like very subtle
*  signaling that we're accidentally doing. Be like, no fault of our own. I'm not saying this is a
*  virtue. I'm saying like, maybe it's just genetic or the fact that I'm doing that the women are
*  doing. Yeah. Like that. And it might be just something I'm completely accidentally through
*  no intention, like happening to signal the thing that is causing men to not view me as
*  like a desirable target or like a target at all. What about the flip side? Maybe you're not sensitive
*  to the, the, the creepy stare. Yeah, that also might be true. The dude who's like,
*  like as I'm dressing you with his eyes that like in a creepy way that you're just not, you don't
*  like worry about it or you're not touched. Like the fear of that, the anxiety of that,
*  the unpleasantness of that just doesn't hit you. I think that's also at least part of it,
*  maybe all of it. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's, there's some evidence for it. I think often
*  like guys will do a thing to me and I'm just like, that's a thing. Cool. I don't have any
*  negative response whatsoever. That's call back to the tire. It's a thing. This is nice. This is,
*  that happened. It was good to know that can happen. Like I once had like a homeless guy like asked me
*  to come back to my place, baby. And I was like, this is fun. Like, I'm like, do you want me to,
*  I love asking men like, are you trying to get me to have sex with you? Just like saying it out front
*  and they'll be like, well, usually they stop for a minute. They're like, well, uh, yeah, I mean,
*  I would like to have sex. And they'll be like, thanks for asking, but I'm not interested in
*  having sex with you. Have a good day. And then I walk away and that's great. I don't know. I have
*  no issues with that interaction, but like, maybe this is the kind of thing that other women would
*  find to be really offensive. So you have that conversation and it doesn't turn into like a
*  threatening feel. No, like with a homeless guy. No, I've never had that happen though. But I think
*  there's such something, I think I'm doing something like, again, this is kind of accidental. Like I
*  just am like this always. And I think I just happen to be like this at people and they don't expect it.
*  Like they don't expect me to be like really nice while explicitly asking them what their intentions
*  are. Like directly putting my finger on the thing that like, oh, you're trying to have sex with me.
*  And then also not judging them for it. I think this like throws people off a little bit so they
*  don't get aggressive. They're like, oh, you're autistic or something. Even the cloak of anonymity
*  on the internet, you weren't getting. Yeah, I just think I'm just not reactive and or maybe I'm giving
*  off, I don't know. I don't know what's going on. Maybe it's both. Maybe it's a feedback loop. So I
*  just, I had a pretty good experience. I know not everybody did. Definitely people reported having
*  antagonistic experiences. But when I was scamming, I generally really liked people were really nice to
*  me, had a great time, made friends. So you also did only fans as you mentioned. And I read on a
*  website. So this is very investigative reporting that on some months you've made over a hundred
*  thousand dollars on only fans. How did that feel? Great. Really great. I mean, like,
*  well, actually, because so much of your upbringing, you didn't have money. You had to struggle with
*  the fact of your job and so on. Maybe a good person to ask can money buy happiness?
*  Well, I mean, I think you get like a resting set point of happiness, regardless of how much money
*  you have. But money can buy being less stressed, I would say. Is there a lot of variation in the
*  in the basic rest happiness for humans? In general? Like, is that is that a good thing to think
*  about? I mean, they've done some studies. But again, like, again, I'm not sure I haven't actually
*  read the study. So maybe they didn't replicate where like, they measured people before and after
*  winning a bunch of money to see if their happiness is higher. Yeah, I think like it's by some measures
*  it wasn't by some it wasn't. No, I mean, like, basically, almost genetically. So nature and
*  nurture. But is there, let's say after you're 18, is there like some stable level of happiness
*  that all the environmental genetic factors combine to create so that everything that life throws at
*  you has to face that happiness? You mentioned earlier that I seem to be happy with a lot of
*  stuff. So maybe I have a certain level. Do other people have a lower level? Some people have higher
*  level? Yeah, definitely. Is there is that a useful or is that a useful model of human beings? Or is
*  it all ups and downs? Like, is it all like, there's no stable right? Like, I don't know, some people
*  just are happier than others in general, and other people aren't. But then you also have ups and downs.
*  Like, I'm sure you've experienced sadness sometimes and happiness the other times.
*  Like, if I actually were to integrate to have an integral under the area under the under the curve,
*  I don't know if I'm different than other people. Maybe I'm just like, really focused on the happy
*  moments, and maybe feel the down moments most intensely. And maybe that, like, on average,
*  it's all the same. That possible? I mean, maybe. I just I don't know. Like, I remember when I was a
*  kid, my mom would call me Pollyanna all the time. So I was like finding the good in everything.
*  Oh, yeah? I'd be like, something bad would happen. So you were a happy kid? I was a really happy kid.
*  Even in the harsh conditions? Yeah. I mean, like I said, like, I think the harshness comes from the
*  bad meaning. Like, and I had good meaning applied to it. So you were a stoic?
*  Yeah. With another book I'm reading next week, tune in. Marcus Aurelius Meditations.
*  All right. All right. Camming 100k. So it felt good. So it's crazy, though, right? You can just,
*  like, take clothes off in a creative way with some gnomes and make 100,000. Yeah. I mean,
*  there was a lot more to it than that. But yeah. What was it? What's the what's the
*  I mean, it's marketing. Like, so with with only with my free cams, I was unusual in that I decided
*  to do outside of the website marketing. I like post on Reddit, right? This was very unusual at
*  the time. But like, only fans are structured such that they have almost no internal discovery
*  whatsoever. So if you want people to come to your page, you have to go out onto external websites
*  and advertise for yourself directly. Very different model. And so this is something I had already been
*  doing and already had practiced in. And so I think I was like already quite advanced. Like,
*  I already had an account on Reddit that was like seven years old at the time,
*  tons of like karma that means I could post in subreddits. I already been on Twitter for years,
*  you know, like posting actively. So I already had like presences on all these other platforms
*  that really helped with the conversion. Reddit and Twitter, Reddit, Twitter,
*  FetLife, Instagram, Tik Tok, and you were still advertising creatively. So there's like sexuality,
*  but there's also like creative sexuality and ideas too. Yeah, like one of the really popular
*  ones was I like molested myself as a as a mime using a a one arm through a jacket.
*  And so the jacket looked like it was
*  alive and, you know, and that one did really well. Did you like brainstorm with somebody?
*  And like, I recently got to hang out with Mr. Beast and sit on a session of brainstorming
*  different ideas. I just envisioned you would like a team brainstorming. All right, how about
*  we try the mime and the molesting thing? I know it's too edgy. I wish I think the two would
*  were fun, but no, it's just me. Like I had an apartment that looked like kind of like this,
*  you know, you just sit alone. You're like, well, that would be a good idea. And I'd seen you
*  collect ideas over time, right? Like I'd seen somebody doing a version of the like this this
*  animated hand act, like when I was a kid and I just always stuck in my head. And like one day
*  I was like, I bet I could do that. And then when I was trying to think of ideas to do as a sex worker,
*  I was like, why don't I just try that? And then it turned out to be like, like a really like quite
*  a viral hit. Is there is there stuff like you mentioned too edgy? Like Mr. Beast tries to keep
*  it PG. Do you try to keep it PG 13? Well, with the sex advertising stuff, it's sex advertising. So
*  it's obviously not PG 13. I don't know these ratings. What does it be on that family friendly?
*  It is X like the one that I'm describing to you at some point, like you can see my boob.
*  So as a boom is X. A boob is I guess. I thought R. I think you could show a boom in PG 13.
*  Yeah, maybe X is like if you got some sort of rhythmic motion going on.
*  Maybe that sound but the rhythmic motion not.
*  You can have one or the other. We can't have both. You have both. That's when we hit the X.
*  Yeah. Okay. So definitely not fail. I mean, with the sex advertising stuff, like guys like vanilla
*  shit. Guys want basic hot girl. You can do something like kind of sexy and creative,
*  like getting abducted by gnomes or like the self molestation, right? But those are still pretty
*  within the normal boundaries. What do you mean guys like vanilla stuff? I mean, most guys like
*  vanilla stuff. What's vanilla stuff? Like see, we'll talk about fetish fetishes. I think my
*  overton window on what is vanilla is expanding quickly after following your work. But
*  I actually have done a lot of studies on what is vanilla. Like I've done a couple different
*  surveys where I ask people like how taboo is this thing and I have like a rating from least to most
*  taboo. By the way, I don't like, I don't appreciate the beauty of vanilla ice cream. You don't? It is
*  really good though. You eat vanilla ice cream? I eat vanilla ice cream. Yeah. I think there's just
*  so many more options. It's like the absence of creativity. I mean, if you put it in like some
*  chocolate chips or something. Yeah. They already made it more interesting.
*  It's a start. Okay. So what's vanilla? And why do guys like vanilla? So hot girl doing hot
*  girl things, what, like undressing and then having sex. The thing that I found was most successful
*  were frames where the man was framed as passive and the woman is active. Or like, for example,
*  like, oh, you know, we got assigned to the same bunk at the breeding school or something. Or like,
*  oh, we're the last people on earth. Right. Or like, oh no, you know, I like, I desperately need
*  somebody to like cure me with this disease and I need semen. So it's like any scenario where the
*  guy is just like finds himself such that the woman like desperately needs him for some reason and he
*  doesn't have to do much. That is like typically one of the much more successful things. Like guys,
*  like women falling into their lap. What about the power dynamic? So guys are less into power dynamics
*  than women are. And you can do power dynamics as long as it's like handed to them. Some guys,
*  obviously some guys are like very dominant and like prefer like having to work, but this is the
*  minority. Like if you're trying to do, make a hundred K in a month and you're trying to appeal
*  to the widest group of people, the most effective advertising, you're not going to be making the
*  most money by being like particularly submissive. So on the camping side, that's your, uh, unlike
*  like, uh, escorting or just personal relationships, you're trying to, you have an audience,
*  you have like a theater full of people. Like with live camming. Yeah. With live camming. Yeah. It's
*  like a live theater. Does that freak you out? There's just a bunch of people watching. I mean,
*  what, how do you feel right now? I don't, I don't know. They're watching cause it's not live.
*  Yeah, that's true. It's not live. It might as well be like they could be watching.
*  I feel like there's just the two of us. I don't know. And there's like, I feel,
*  sometimes I imagine there's a third person. Like God. Usually, no, no, not, not God. Just,
*  I usually imagine, um, either a guy or girl or a couple just sitting there for some reason,
*  like usually on the beach and usually high or on some kind of like mushrooms, just like listening
*  passively, just kind of looking at the sunset. That's what I imagine. That's really good.
*  Yeah. I think it's useful. Like when I write my blog posts, sometimes I do terribly, but it's
*  the most effective when I imagine one person that I'm writing to, to try to explain. And like having
*  a high couple watching the sunset is maybe really lovely as a calibration. I have to say it is
*  pretty romantic because I've gotten a chance to meet couples that listen to podcasts together.
*  I don't know why that seems like intensely romantic to me because like,
*  because you're not watching TV together, you're listening to a thing. I mean, I guess sometimes
*  they watch it, but like you're listening to ideas together. I don't know. It seems like
*  you're going through the same kind of thought process. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really beautiful
*  way to put it. So it's like, you're melding, your thinking is following the same line. Some of our
*  podcasts do that more than movies. I think movies give you a lot more freedom to think about stuff.
*  I feel like your thoughts are aligned and like, especially if the podcast is good, like if it's
*  listening to like a Dan Carlin podcast about history, that you're like on a journey together.
*  Yeah. There's an intimacy to that anyway. But I've learned that there's couples do that,
*  you know, hashtag relationship goals. Go ahead. That's what you want with your future wife.
*  With my, yeah. You should make an application. Application? An application for dating you. I
*  mean, maybe this is more of like my strategy and less yours, but you have like a wide enough
*  audience that might work. It's not, okay, let's just go there. So you, cause you've put together
*  an application of like people to have casual sex with you, I think. And also dating. Yeah.
*  And also dating and relationship. I'd love to, so what is in that application? Cause like,
*  you know, I'm sure there's quite a lot of people that would like to date you or to sleep with you,
*  but finding the person, I mean, it depends what your goals are. I guess relationship would be an
*  open relationship for you. Yes. Right. Like for me, I guess it's more intensely selective because
*  it's like a monogamous relationship and a committed one. Like, like, like I'm, I'm swinging
*  for the long-term. I'm not, I'm not like weirdly obsessed with long-term, but it's like, you just,
*  I would love to have one girl for the rest of my life, but the finding that I feel like applications
*  will not get to that. I feel like there's some aspect of the magic of the, the serendipity of it,
*  of meeting people in strange places and so on. I just, I've personally noticed that like fame
*  has not made that process easier. But I mean, like if you could, you know, if there's two rooms and
*  one of them, it's like a random population of hot women and the other one is a random population
*  of hot women, but all of them definitely are monogamous and are looking for a long-term
*  committed relationship. Yeah. Like which room would you rather go into? Like if you're looking for a
*  mate. Yeah. Well, but see, I guess my preferences are more, that's, that's, that's a really strong
*  point, but my preferences are, represent the majority probably, right? Cause don't most women
*  want monogamous relationships? Yeah. So like it's, I'm okay with either option. Cause like
*  statistically speaking. Right. But like we can apply it to like a bunch of other things. Yeah.
*  And I'm just, this is just a problem if you have like high, if you have a high volume to filter
*  through and you like, you don't know, like it's a good like initial filter, like you can take it
*  from like a thousand people to 20 people and then go on dates with them. But the filter is so anti-
*  romantic. Like what. This is true. This is not the romantic narrative that, that you're very
*  prone to. Like if I feel like how did, how did you two meet? Well, she passed the three filters I set
*  up. And I mean, but it's also, but also can you put into a survey the things that you're interested
*  in? I mean, I definitely think about this a lot with hiring, like, like teams, engineers and so on.
*  But with engineers, you're okay losing truly special engineers because you have to filter
*  because there's like thousands of applications. Like it feels like, it feels like I worry that
*  you would miss the thing that actually, cause so much of it is chemistry. So much of it is like
*  the magic, you know. But the thing is you're missing it anyway. Like, yeah, you're missing it.
*  It's, oh, you can just run it. And then in addition, try some of those people.
*  Try some of those people. And then, but then go on the dates that you were going to go on with
*  anyway, regardless. It's just the thing that helps like pull someone out of the crowd. Like this,
*  I, I dated a guy from my survey. I'd ran the survey. I assigned point values to each of the
*  questions. I wanted to date with like the top couple of people. And then one of them, I was like,
*  and I'm still dating him to this day. And it was awesome. And I would never, I never would have
*  gone on a date with him without the survey. Can you, can you, if from memory or we can look it up,
*  do you remember what kind of questions were on the survey? I asked a couple of different categories.
*  I asked about like basic life stuff. So like what kind of relationships, like monogamy versus
*  polyamory, like, do you want kids, you know, like where you want to live, like basic things that you
*  need to be compatible. And then I asked like sexual compatibility, like various preferences.
*  And then I had a section about like personality, like what are, I try to ask questions that would
*  do the most effective filtering. So like, what are ways that like, I can't give, give people what
*  they need that like, maybe they really want. Like, I don't really, I'm not very outdoorsy.
*  It was just very common. A lot of people like being outdoorsy. So I asked the question, like,
*  how much do you value someone else that you're dating being outdoorsy? If they marked yes,
*  I was like, okay, we probably, I should probably downgrade the results.
*  Man, but doesn't polyamory make that really difficult? Because can't they find somebody
*  for the outdoorsy stuff? Yeah, they could. I mean, this doesn't like,
*  but if you're going to have somebody, it's like nicer to have them be more compatible than less.
*  But you're a little bit like in terms of sexual compatibility, you're able to,
*  like, you're self-aware enough to know what preferences you have.
*  I think so. I think that one helped a lot with the escorting. Like the escorting helped a lot
*  with knowing my preferences. But there's like, out of the giant pool of different preferences,
*  you have like a subset that's clearly defined for you. Okay. Like, like dominant submissive.
*  Yeah, power dynamic stuff. Okay. In the, not just sexual relationships,
*  too. Like that was that in the survey? I don't like power dynamics in relationships.
*  Defining them in like making it clear in a survey, like asking a question about power dynamics in a
*  relationship. I don't think I asked about power dynamics in relationships.
*  Because I just assume most people don't. And there's a lot of things that kind of like,
*  most people don't, you're putting together a survey, a systematic survey to understand
*  compatibility. Wouldn't power dynamics inside of relationships that naturally emerge often
*  be part of the question? Or is that hard to question because it naturally emerges?
*  Well, the thing is like a lot of questions sort of overlap in demographic. And if you're making
*  a survey, you want to have the minimum possible questions that give the maximum possible like
*  filtering information. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. But that
*  purpose of that survey wasn't to do a good research study. It was to select one subject.
*  That's part of what is good. Like you want to most efficiently filter out. Because one, like
*  you get more people taking the survey the fewer questions you have, which is good for finding a
*  mate. Like if you have 5,000 men take the surveys, better than 1,000 men take the survey.
*  Don't you want men that would be patient enough and dedicated enough?
*  Yeah, but like what if you want like a high powered man who's like on his lunch break,
*  right? So it's like,
*  Like a billionaire is too busy just flipping through.
*  Yeah.
*  And the guy that I dated was, he took the survey, he was waiting for the pizza to come out of the
*  oven. And so it was important that it was short. And so you want to be efficient.
*  Literally pizza.
*  He was literally waiting for pizza. And he saw the things like, I guess I'll just fill out the
*  survey really fast and changed our lives. So romantic.
*  It's for me, this is my kind of romance. I'm really into it. But you can be efficient with
*  surveys by like making sure your questions don't overlap. So for example, if somebody is very
*  polyamorous, they're very unlikely to be interested in like a traditional like man works and like,
*  and the job and the woman stays home and raises the kids kind of relationship. Because probably
*  people just generally don't do that. And so if I'm asking about polyamory, it's sort of kind of
*  already covers the thing. And so if I have a whole bunch of questions, like I can kind of like
*  triangulate a bunch of implicit kinds of questions that I haven't directly asked about. So this is
*  why I didn't ask directly about power dynamics, because like from the rest of the questions that
*  are in my survey, like I can pretty accurately predict whether or not you're going to be interested
*  in power dynamics.
*  But I'm afraid I'm, yeah, like I'm trying to think as you're talking, I get it. That's,
*  that's really interesting that you did that. Also, maybe not for the effectiveness of finding a
*  partner, but for just exploring the actual the process of human sexuality of like the search,
*  this complicated optimization process we're all engaging in on the landscape of happiness,
*  that seems to be this not even a differentiable function. It's a giant nonlinear mess. Okay,
*  but like for me, I don't think I would be able to design that survey. I would like bias it too
*  strongly. Like, I'll probably prefer women that have read the CSK or something like that. Like
*  that would be a filter for me. Right. Yeah. But like, that's a horrible filter because there's
*  a lot of like, there's a lot of amazing people that have never, they don't give a shit about
*  reading, or they don't give a shit about reading Russian literature, or they don't give a shit
*  about, but they're amazing and passionate and creative and all in some other dimension that
*  you might completely miss. But you're like, because I wonder if there's any, basically you're
*  saying compatibility, like hard lines that you know statistically is just going to be an issue.
*  Yeah. I mean, you weight this a lot more. Yeah. But there's also like preferences. Like if you
*  have a woman who's totally equal and she's read the thing that you like, for example,
*  it's another woman who's also identical, but like she hasn't read the thing that you like,
*  like you probably like very slightly prefer the one that happens. But you don't know if they're
*  identical. Yes, yes. But like you can't through survey get the identical. Like you don't know.
*  Sure. But you can kind of like, like do a whole bunch of weights. So like the person that like,
*  I ended up going on a date with, he did not answer like correctly to a lot of the survey
*  questions, but he didn't have to. Like he was just overall, overall the weights were like,
*  he just tended to be more in the direction. Was there a text-based fill in like survey,
*  but like, oh sorry, paragraph like. No, you want to avoid that if you're dealing with like large
*  amounts of data. No, why not? Because you have to fill, oh, oh, interesting. Interesting. Like
*  I'm different. First of all, you can do keyword searches. Second of all, you do,
*  you can do machine learning models that like, like, uh, first of all, you can do,
*  you can do like crude metrics, like the length. That's a good point. Of how long they've written.
*  Right. And it could flag certain things. Yeah. It's actually pretty easy to, I've looked at,
*  like for hiring, I've looked at like thousands of applications really quickly. You can really,
*  the human brain is really interesting, especially, um, like if you visually highlight
*  certain information for yourself, like keywords or again, with machine learning models, like
*  sentiment, you can, you can highlight different parts that will catch your eye better than not.
*  And I can go through just a huge number of applications. Are you telling me I can use,
*  if I learn machine learning, I can process dating survey applications better? Yes. No, like textual.
*  Yeah. Like I can like have them write things in like this is like a new way of,
*  that would be, yeah, that would be really good. I think that would, so the really nice aspect
*  of text input, like long form text input, multiple long form text input based on an
*  interestingly phrased question is you get to learn how to make a better survey. I think you
*  would appreciate that. Like you start to see how they're actually interacting with these questions.
*  Like I asked certain questions, like, um, just to see how people think,
*  is it better to work smart or better to work hard? Uh, or, um, is it, uh, ever okay to betray a close
*  friend? Like I'll ask like questions like this that don't really have a right answer, but I just
*  want to see how they think, or is truth more important than loyalty? Yeah. And, and I get
*  their long form answer. You get like, and you get to see the reasoning process. Yeah. Yeah. Like
*  the reveals so much, not just about the person, but about the kind of questions I want, I should
*  be asking that have nothing to do with truth or loyalty, but like how to get a good engineer with
*  like very specific questions. But I think it's really useful to get text input. I have done text
*  input usually with beta surveys. So I usually do beta surveys before I do the real survey. What's
*  the beta? Like I do like a shorter version or it depends on what I'm doing, but like a different
*  version of the survey that I have people take before I release, I use their information from
*  the initial survey to inform the questions that I ask in the real survey. And I haven't actually
*  recently, but I used to do a lot of like the text based questions to see for similar, although I
*  don't think I relied on it quite as heavily. And if I introduced machine learning, things would be
*  a lot more efficient. I love that you're also doing like you're writing scripts and stuff. Like
*  you're doing, you're doing some like, uh, like statistical analysis using Python. Yeah. I had
*  to learn Python for this. Which is the best way to learn Python and the best reason to learn
*  machine learning is to solve actual like problems. I can't be motivated. I'm just not motivated to
*  learn something unless there's an actual curiosity I have, and I have to learn it and to solve it.
*  I was trying to avoid learning coding for so long, but eventually it was my dataset became too large.
*  I couldn't work with it with anything else. So, oh, Python it is, you know, it's also an
*  interesting data set that you're probably interested in a little bit. It's like Twitter itself.
*  Right. I don't know if you've, I've played with the Twitter API a lot. Can you just get the download
*  that I'm just, I'm stuttering now because the Twitter, no, there's a lot of Twitter,
*  so Twitter is a social network with a bunch of people. They're interacting a lot.
*  Like there's like, I don't know that the number is insane, the number of interactions, but there's
*  different ways to interact, to get data from Twitter. There's streams you can look at,
*  depends on what you're interested in. You can do results for searches. You can look at individual
*  tweets and get entire, which to me is super interesting, the entire tree of different
*  conversations that were the replies, which might be very interesting for you because like,
*  it's not, it's much harder to ask rigorous questions, which you do with your polls,
*  but you can see like how divisive certain things are.
*  Like calibrators to figure out like exactly what questions you should be asking.
*  Yeah. And also highlight interesting anecdotal things where like two people freak out at each
*  other and just argue like a thread that goes on for like a thousand messages that you might never
*  be even aware is happening. Cause you're like, cause Twitter doesn't like surface that like it
*  would be Twitter doesn't make it easy for you to like visualize what the hell's going on, even with
*  your own social network. Like, like if you post something that's controversial, that gets a large
*  amount of attention, you can't clearly visualize everything that's going on. Like it's, it's very,
*  it's a blurry amorphous, like you're just kind of looking through the fog at different replies and
*  the kind of it's yeah. So to be able to see the API, they have like graphs of networks.
*  They have the data for the graphs. Yeah. So you can reconstruct to yourself. Yeah. And then you
*  have different levels of access in terms of how many queries you can do. That's really cool.
*  And now because there's like, uh, Elon, um, there's a lot of sort of revolutionary stuff
*  happening at Twitter. I think you could literally sort of push for innovation there. Like there's
*  aggressive innovation happening. So in terms of, uh, requesting stuff for the API, you could do
*  all that kind of stuff. I think Twitter is just a fascinating platform for the, as cliche as it
*  sounds for studying. For me, it's interesting what makes for a healthy conversation. That
*  term has been used, but it's interesting how conversation to me is fascinating how conversations
*  break down and not like how, like the virality of drama or conflict or disagreement, how that evolves
*  when a large number of people are involved, when a large number of
*  misinterpretation of, of statements is involved in text-based with some anonymity thrown in.
*  Like, I feel like there's a lot of study that can be done there. I mean, Twitter's probably not
*  great at it, right? As it stands. No, cause it's like necessarily short. You can quote,
*  treat things out of context, et cetera. But we should understand that. Right. Yeah. At a scale,
*  at a large scale, you should be able to study that kind of thing. Oh yeah. What was your casual
*  sex survey? I actually haven't looked at it in a while. I think I just asked people about a whole
*  bunch of fetishes because you don't want to be obvious about yours because when people are going
*  to hijack it to try to tell you that they like what you like, so you want to be obscure. So how
*  do you design a survey where you're testing for a thing, but you're still obscure about the thing
*  you're trying to ask about. So you still see it as a survey. Yeah. Like an application.
*  Cause I think you tweeted saying like, I'm thinking of just like showing up to San Francisco and saying,
*  is anybody open for casual sex? Something like this. Am I misremembered? Maybe escorting? I'm
*  not sure. Oh, for escorting. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Which is similar. Like I kind of use
*  escorting as the way to have casual sex now. Okay. So let's talk about escorting. So you wrote about
*  escorting in your blog post. Escorting was good for me. How did you get into escorting? I was
*  working at like a, I quit camming because I was burned out and I was like trying to work at a
*  friend startup and it was hard for me. I don't, it's difficult for me to work on projects that
*  are not my projects. And so I was like, Hey, fuck it. Like I want to go back to sex work. I want to
*  make more money, but I don't want to cam anymore because I'm burned out. So I'm like, well, let's
*  try. I had a friend who was an escort. I'm like, let's try that. And so we had a call. She like
*  outlined the basics for me. And then I put up some ads and started working. What's the basics of
*  escorting? How does that work? If you want to get started escorting. So just in case you have a
*  career change, but you're going to want to get some nice photos. So you probably have those.
*  You assumed I haven't done it before. How rude. Have you? Yeah. Well, you know, uh,
*  recreation, I would like to do professionally, I suppose. So if I wanted to do it,
*  if I wanted to do it, if I really want to step up my game, how would I do it?
*  Yeah. Well, you got the whole tutorial. Um, recreational escorting is just.
*  Okay. Okay. No, I mean like, like, you know, like selling products on Etsy versus doing a startup.
*  Yeah. Uh, well, I mean, escorting is kind of all just selling products on Etsy.
*  No, like, but selling a lot of products.
*  Like high volume. Small handcrafted. It's small.
*  Versus mass manufacture.
*  Okay. If you want to mass manufacture your escort. I just feel like I haven't been getting,
*  you know, I've been undervaluing my services and I would like to really step up.
*  I think you could really just like grease some marketing gears and.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just some of this is marketing. So like how, I guess I want to
*  like, no, is it similar to camming in that way? Like, is it, um, you're basically advertising
*  yourself and you're, uh, like the marketing, they have all the creativity that you mentioned
*  before all of that. Yeah. I found escorting to be pretty easy because, uh, escorting is not
*  like highly competitive. For example, camming is highly competitive because like the strut,
*  the thing that I outlined before, you know, the amount of money that you make determines your
*  ranking. And you can also go and see other girls. You can see what they're doing. So if a girl
*  figures that incredible strategy for making money, it's like two seconds before that strategy
*  proliferates into everybody else. So it's very fast paced and like really tough. With escorting,
*  you don't get to see what other girls are doing. You can look at their websites, but like, you
*  don't know what they're doing with clients at all. You can look at their rates, but you don't know
*  what their volume is. So you don't actually know what is successful and what isn't very much.
*  So I think there's much less, uh, like evolution of marketing through this process. And so I came
*  in with like my aggressive marketing skills for being a cam girl. I think that really helped. I
*  did very well as an escort. I just came in and like made a fantastic website. I knew how to do
*  the ads right. And what was the finding people, I guess it's also like finding the right kind of
*  customer, the right kind of client. I got like in a lot of trouble for this recently in the sex
*  workers sphere because I said that if you raise prices, you're more likely to encounter clients
*  that aren't going to abuse you. Like it's safer. Uh, they, they did not, they said that I was being
*  classist, you know, implying that poor people are more violent, but to be fair, if you're a guy and
*  you want to be violent towards a woman, you're probably not going to be paying her a lot of
*  money. You're probably going to be like, you're the kind of person likely who's going to haggle a
*  lot because you don't respect her. But anyway, that aside, it's a little pet peeve for me. Um,
*  yeah, I just, I tried to start charging 800 an hour and then pretty rapidly raised it to 1200. And
*  then a while after that, raise it to 1400. Well, the interesting thing you mentioned
*  in my sense of research, um, you used to do 1200 to 1400 an hour. And then you said that you're
*  thinking of jumping back in at a rate of 2400 the first hour. Yeah. And I think 900 each excessive
*  hour. That's interesting. That's like, that's, that's, I mean, to me, that's really interesting.
*  Like why it's like a lot of the first hour. Yeah. Oh, it's just because, uh, this depends on how you
*  want to incentivize like the amount of hours. So if you have to pay a lot for the first hour,
*  but not very much for this excessive, you're more likely to buy like a longer period of time.
*  And usually I find that clients who buy a longer period of time are nicer to you. I don't know
*  like a great theory for why that is, but there's the more likely like take you to dinner and get
*  to know you first. And I just enjoy that a lot more. I enjoy like, like knowing who I'm going
*  to have sex with like a date, you know? Yeah. So it's incentivize the day, the long form date
*  dynamic versus like, uh, not that's really interesting. That's really interesting. How,
*  how does money change the dynamic, just basic human dynamic of interacting for free versus
*  for money. Like I think about that a lot. Cause like just talking to rich people, it's like,
*  you usually get paid for your time and you're doing this for free. Like what, uh,
*  like what's the difference? Is there a difference really? Or no,
*  a bit. Yeah. I say I've actually, it depends a lot. So when I was doing it full time,
*  it was my only source of income. Uh, the, it changed quite a lot because I was really
*  incentivized to have repeat customers. So I'm like, okay, if I'm my primary interaction with
*  you is to like, have you hire me again? I'll do whatever that takes to make that happen.
*  And so if I have to like laugh at jokes that I don't find funny or like,
*  it's like more adoring of your penis than I actually genuinely feel like that's what I'm
*  going to express. Um, and obviously it's to some degree like titrated, you know, like I,
*  it's unpleasant to force yourself to like something that you don't. So like,
*  I would actually like not see clients again that I didn't want to, but it's just some degree. There
*  was a sort of self-suppression going out, which I think is the way it works in any sort of customer
*  service job. Like you want the customer to leave happy. So you just make sure that you are happy
*  the whole time and you're like, ah, really enjoying the other person. But, uh, so recently when I've
*  like kind of dabbled in it since baking money for through other means, um, where I don't need
*  the money, it's more like a fun side thing that like, that I'm, like I said, it's fulfilling the
*  role of casual sex for me. So like, I don't have to do it. This is not my primary job. I just want
*  sort of a good excuse to like have sex with somebody. Um, and the money is like a great filter for that.
*  And so in that case, I think so the money is a bit, yeah, okay. The money is basically a filter
*  for somebody who's taking this interaction seriously. Yeah. It also, so there's an interesting
*  psychological thing where I have difficulty having casual sex with somebody because some part of my
*  brain, which I assume is like quite female is doing some evaluation of status and whether or
*  not this is going to damage my reputation by having sex with them. So like if you found out that I
*  went and like had random sex with like a homeless man, you might be like, wow, that says something
*  about, like maybe she's trashy or she just has no standards for who she's going to fuck. But if,
*  and so some part of me is continually anxious. I'm like, does this mean I have no standards? If I
*  decide to have casual sex with you, like what are people going to think? Uh, and so if you introduce
*  money, it takes away that anxiety. I don't have to worry about it because it's like, oh, of course
*  Ayla would have sex with that person. They paid her. Like, this is not an indication of the kind
*  of mate that she can get. This is just an indication of like a business transaction. And this allows me
*  to enjoy casual sex so much more when somebody pays me for it to the degree that like I almost
*  view it as a kink. And so it's like, so I'm using it sort of to replace casual sex now, like occasionally
*  I'm like, you know, like it's paid me a little bit to erase the anxiety and I'll like have a fun,
*  fun time. I mean, can't you see like dinner like that or something like that? If the person pays
*  for dinner or like, so like it's all just, if any money's involved, if it's a kink, then you
*  could just like use it and you buy, buys a coffee to Starbucks. It's like, all right. Right. But it
*  has to be plausible. Like you have to like trick my brain into like having it actually be incentivizing
*  for me. To coffees, like a cappuccino or something. Yeah. Like, oh, the homeless man bought me a coffee
*  and then I sucked his dick. Like, that's not cool. All right. So no shade of homelessness, by the way,
*  like I've been friends with a lot of them. I'm just using like some sort of stereotype of.
*  Yeah. So like it has to be plausible where you could trick your mind. Interesting. Yeah. I mean,
*  yeah. And so that's different. So now, now in this sort of frame, I am still like, I'm accepting money,
*  but still much more expressive of my actual preferences. So like I, before when I would
*  start escrowding full time, I was suppressive. And now I'm like, you know, I'm doing this for me.
*  So we're going to make sure that I have a good time. And so I'm much more demanding.
*  And then you're having more fun because you're not pretending, like laughing at a joke or something
*  like that. That sounds terrible. Sounds like. I mean, it's. It's also like social. I mean, I guess I
*  would, would I do that? Like when you first meet people like strangers and so on, there's some
*  aspect of like niceties, but like, I don't know, intimacy, like real intimacy requires like getting
*  past the niceties. Like laughing at somebody's joke when it's not funny, it feels like anti-intimacy.
*  Yeah. But I laugh at so many jokes automatically. It's interesting because like, I don't mean to,
*  I'm not trying to be fake, but like if I'm in a group of people and somebody makes a joke and
*  everybody laughs, I laugh even before I'm checking within myself. Like, do I genuinely enjoy this joke?
*  Yeah. So it's like, I don't know, like the degree that I am sort of just like a result
*  of social programming in all cases that like when I'm with an client back when I was doing
*  it full time, like it doesn't feel significantly different. It just felt like a different version
*  of myself. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. To that degree, to the degree you don't feel like you're going
*  against your, your nature. Yeah. Yeah. It was very rare that I actually felt like I was
*  going against my nature. What about the market of how much to charge? So you 20, 2400,
*  like how transparent is that market? Is there like a market? Like how much can you sell when
*  you're charging that much? Yeah, no, like what, what are the competitors? Like if this,
*  oh yeah. Like what do you, are you distinctly, what, cause you said it's, it's a lot of,
*  it's a bit more shrouded in mystery. Like it's more confidential. Like do you have some transparency
*  to the market, what the competitors are? I did a survey of escorts, it's only like 130. I'm trying
*  to remember. And the median was around like four hundred, three hundred dollars, I think an hour.
*  Oh wow. Something like that with a very long tail at the top end. I'm trying to remember what
*  the, I also asked the amount where I could calculate the amount they made per month. I think it was
*  like six or seven thousand dollars a month. I need to double check that one, but. I charge 50 bucks
*  an hour. You charge 50 bucks an hour. You should raise your rates. Yeah. I'm gonna give a really
*  shitty hand job. Um, all right. But usually the rates are around like if you want a median escort
*  in a big city, it's usually four to six hundred. A city, so the urban, sorry, four to six hundred.
*  In a big city. But like smaller cities, you charge the rates go lower.
*  That's so fascinating. What's like the most you've ever seen somebody charge?
*  Uh, I think I am. You're like the. But at this point it's because I'm post
*  work. Like I can, I can just put it in the same number. Does like,
*  like just the fact that you're sort of like a sexuality expert, like a researcher and so on,
*  like your mind is fascinating as well and you're a bit of a celebrity. Does that play into it?
*  Yeah. Or do you feel the celebrity now? Like when you're with people? Yeah, absolutely.
*  Usually if people are interested in hanging out with me, it's because of that. Um, but that's,
*  that's different. Like I think besides the, like the fun part, like the, this is a kink as opposed
*  to this is a job. Like with this as a job, usually the high end is closer to two thousand an hour.
*  Like the very high end. Have clients ever fallen in love with you? I think so. Yeah. I think it
*  doesn't, happens to me much less than most other people due to like the thing that I think we were
*  talking about before. Which is what? Where like, you know, you give off vibes, maybe like subconscious
*  vibes. But they have fallen in love or not, but not as often. I think I, something about my
*  signaling indicates that people should not fall in love with me because I don't think it happens
*  very much. It happens a lot with other women that I know, but I have occasionally had the thing is
*  it's, it's hard for me because I try to be as vulnerable as I can in a connection with a client.
*  Um, and like I do really like some of them. I still remember some of them very fondly and I'm
*  like, I hope they're doing well. And some of them are really profound. Like one guy saw me because
*  he found out he was dying of cancer and he was like, I don't want to die without seeing someone.
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, that's such a, I don't know. I'm very touched by many of the people that
*  I saw. So there's like deep intimacy there. Yeah. I know that it's brief and I know that it's like
*  kind of weird, but like there's, there's like a real glimpse into somebody's soul when you get to
*  be intimate. And I think this is especially true for men because a lot of time men don't have like
*  a way to be really vulnerable in front of anybody. But like if you're in bed with a woman that you
*  find to be attractive, you can sort of let loose a little bit more. So they can become vulnerable
*  in general quickly. Yeah. And I really liked that. I like being as vulnerable as I can to match it.
*  Like I'm not forcing myself or anything, but like I just feel into it and like notice how like
*  beautiful the person was and like feel grateful for being able to be in this intimate experience
*  with them. And that was so wonderful. Does it ever hurt to say goodbye? Uh, no, but I think
*  that's as unique to me because I like being alone a lot, even with my friends who I like dearly,
*  I'm like happy not seeing them. Uh, cause I don't like making facial expressions very much,
*  but I do miss some of my clients. Wait, sorry. What does making facial expression have to do with
*  saying goodbye? Well, if, if you are not with somebody in person, you don't have to make
*  facial expressions anymore. Oh, you can just think about them. Yeah. You can just, you can just sit
*  there, a totally blank face and then have all of the emotions that you want. Oh, you're telling me.
*  Do you have this thing too? It's not a thing, but like you're on camera. Yeah. So like I feel
*  feelings, but people usually want you like social interaction is such that like you probably want me
*  to show feelings on my face. Yeah. Right. Good job. Yeah. Hey, there you go. So like I, I definitely,
*  there could be just an introvert thing where you like have an vibrant inner world that you forget
*  to show to the rest of the world. And also I'm scared of social interaction and I just have a
*  lot of anxiety about interacting with the external world. So yeah, I'm kind of surprised to hear that
*  because when you talked about finding the light and everything and everything is fun, like I usually
*  don't associate that with having not very much anxiety. Well, because I have the, we mentioned
*  that earlier. I just, I appreciate the beauty in the world when I observe it. But then when I'm
*  interacting with others, I have a very harsh self critical aspect of my brain that says like,
*  you're going to fuck this up. You're going to fuck up this interaction. You want to fuck up the,
*  the beauty that's there. If I'm sort of being a fragile and vulnerable for a moment. One of the
*  things I'm afraid of, I get so much love from, from people that listen or even like reach out,
*  like you said through the survey, like women and so on. I'm afraid that, yeah, you know,
*  you admire me because you don't know me, but you won't admire me once you know me. So that,
*  that's self critical. But it's a silly, I mean, as you get older, you're like, yeah, okay. Like
*  I'm able to step away and objectively look at myself. I was like, there's no, this is, you're
*  fine. You're good. It's like, but it's still there. This is the part of the brain that you can't just
*  shut off. Does it is like, what would fucking up in this conversation look like?
*  Like doesn't have to be rational, but I'm curious if there's like a specific thing.
*  A lot of it is just a feeling like an amorphous fear of failure, what it would actually look like.
*  Like maybe because we're talking about sexuality, me not being able to eloquently explain
*  the worldview I have and why I appreciate, appreciate it. That would make me feel like
*  a failure because that would make me feel like maybe you don't know what you're doing. Right?
*  Cause sex, sexuality and not sexuality, but even romantic relationships are really important
*  to happiness, to they're really important to me. And I'm not sure like the conception of
*  love I have, romantic love is like fully made rigorous. So especially when I'm talking to you
*  that thinks very rigorously about a lot of these topics, I'm not sure if I've thought about them a
*  lot. I feel them. I interact with the world in this space of feelings. Maybe I'm almost afraid
*  to be very rigorous with these kinds of thoughts. And so I think the failure would be like, I would
*  be confronted with the fact that I can't explain what makes me happy. That could be a failure
*  and that could be just a bunch of other failures. Another big failure is like,
*  not, I think you're a really brilliant person. And a lot of folks I know, know and admire your work
*  as well. And so like for me not to be part of highlighting that brilliance would be a failure.
*  Because then other people might feel like, like notice the discrepancy or something.
*  No, no, no, that's not other people. Just my personal, my personal feeling. And the other is
*  like jokes, cause like we're talking about sex, right? So for me, like, it's fun to just
*  joke around, but you also have to tread carefully because like, it's a weird surface
*  because like, you know, even I already feel bad about making a joke for 50 bucks for a hand job
*  that's crappy by me. But I think, I think sometimes you just got to go for it. I went for it.
*  It kind of flat, fell flat on his face, but that's the thing with the conversation.
*  I think there's like this fear where it's like, if you become like scientific about something,
*  you'll figure out that your feelings are unjustified. And then you'll experience this
*  horrible thing where like, ah, shit, like I'm like afraid of this, but I'm sort of being forced to
*  by my logical mind to like believe this thing, which I don't think, I don't think this is true
*  at all. I think like your feelings are there for a reason, like they're for a good reason.
*  And like logic or like rigorous analysis or something should be dedicated to figuring out
*  why it's there. Not that not by not to like suppress it or tell it, it shouldn't be there.
*  What do you think is more important to like, to just life to reason versus emotion? Like
*  not life to what makes us human, I guess. My, my romantic narrative answer to this,
*  which is like not rigorous at all is curiosity. Curiosity. Yeah.
*  With his curiosity. That's such a middle curiosity is like both emotion and reason. Yeah.
*  So it's like this pull because reason is the tool you use to figure out the puzzle and then
*  curiosity is the pull towards the puzzle. Yeah. I don't like the world views that pit
*  like emotion rationalities opposite each other. They feel like beautiful parts of like a cohesive
*  whole. Like if you're doing rationality to the extent where you're like suppressing some emotional
*  reactions you have, then I think you're doing it wrong. You're like missing a big part of it. Like
*  it should be like integrated. It should be like part of like one unified flow. Like the things
*  that you like, if you want to be in a romantic committed relationship for the rest of your life,
*  then this is like beautiful and good. And the kind of like logic that you're using to make sense of
*  the world should be fitted into that correctly. I think that's really cool. Like anytime you have
*  sort of like an internal at odds thing with it, I think you're like using some sort of force to
*  suppress one or the other. Like, oh, I'm not allowed to reason about this or I'm not allowed
*  to feel about that. And that feels harsh to me. And I think curiosity is the solution. Like if
*  you're simply just calmly curious, oh, why do I feel like that? Let's, let's go find out. That's
*  so cool. Right? Like you can use logic and your feelings to like discover the answer.
*  Do you sometimes, cause you do this kind of technique, which is interesting. And I've
*  mentioned it to others. You'll sometimes step away from like a third person perspective
*  and describe the feeling you're feeling. Or like even just the situation, like you'll step out
*  and talk about, wait, what is happening here? Like in the conversation, in the conversation itself.
*  Yeah. First of all, what is that? Was that, do you find that to be useful? Because it's,
*  it's very interesting. It's, it feels raw and honest. The danger of it seems like you escape
*  the actual experience of it though. So that's the trade off. You make it intellectual, right?
*  Is it though, intellectual to do that? I mean, maybe it is. I don't mean to.
*  No, maybe that's the wrong word. You can make it intellectual, but you can still continue the
*  same flavor because you're not fully disengaging from the conversation. You're doing, you're just
*  creating an extra metal layer. Yeah. That's happening. I think exploring the emotional
*  reaction to what's going on in the moment. Yeah. It's yeah. In some ways it's actually making it
*  stronger, like, or enriching it, like making it more, uh, giving it more context, giving it deeper
*  understanding. I think there's like a way of going meta that is, is a flinch move. Like, oh,
*  I noticed that we're doing this thing. I'm going to name it. And I think the thing that I described
*  earlier, like when the homeless guy approached me and asked, you know, can you go home with me? And
*  I was like, oh, are you trying to have sex with me right now? Like what I was doing was like a meta
*  move. Like you're stepping outside, like, and like, okay, what is the purpose of this conversation?
*  And we explicitly identify it. And in that case, I think that is sort of like a flinch move.
*  Like I'm not telling him my emotional response. I'm not like being fully present. I'm like sort of
*  identifying it as a way to subvert what's going on. And I absolutely think this is a possible
*  thing. Uh, but I usually try to be aware of that myself. And it depends on the purpose of what's
*  going on. That guy, cause that is actually like a chest move you did. You had a purpose with that
*  chest move, but the flirtation is on. Like he could have like, uh, done a better move that would make
*  you like curious, like, huh, like interesting. Cause you had an agenda with that, but he could
*  have changed your mind. Like he could have with a few words, cause you just created extra layers,
*  extra entry points. If he'd gotten more meta, it might've been like, okay, well now I am going
*  to sleep with you. Exactly. I mean, see there is, there is something, uh, yeah, that's aids into the
*  chemistry of the conversation when you do that. I really enjoy it. It's like a rare, I forget,
*  did you and I, I forget who, uh, I've had a few people do that with me, like just in conversation
*  and I feel like you were involved somehow. Cause I've met you before, uh, somewhere. I don't know
*  if we were, or you were just in parties together. Maybe it was just like a bunch of people that kind
*  of play with the same or like a car circling. It's just a practice explicitly dedicated towards that.
*  What's circling? Circling is like, yeah, I think, I think so we know we have some mutual circulars
*  in our circles and our networks here. What's up with what's circling? I don't, I don't remember.
*  I'm going to describe it horribly because it's like one of those things that's difficult to
*  describe unless you experience it, like kind of like drugs, but it's something like you sit around.
*  There's like kind of guidelines to the conversation where you talk about the present moment.
*  You're like honest about your experiences as much as you can be. And if you don't want to be honest,
*  then you say, I don't want to be honest. Um, and you're like commitment to connection. So you're
*  like, you're here to like actually connect with the other person, understand them and be understood.
*  You're not supposed to like project. So if you're like, have an analysis about the other person,
*  you own it. You're like, I'm experiencing you as this, you know, and then you check as the true.
*  Or like, are you supposed to be almost like converting it towards the thing you're thinking
*  like constantly? Um, if you, if it feels right in the moment, you can. The thing is it's very
*  amorphous, right? It's like almost like creating a magical sensation. And I've been with some,
*  I've seen some very good circulars, really high skill circle, and I feel like I'm on drugs when
*  that happens. It's very rare to see. Does it feel honest somehow? Yeah, very honest.
*  Like, like right now in this moment, I'm feeling like kind of like nervous energy because I'm
*  talking to you and this is a unique situation and like, I want you to think I'm cool. I want
*  everybody listening to me to think I'm cool, but I'm also having some sort of delight at
*  being able to express in this way and like some admiration for how you like set up and built this
*  thing that I can be a part of. And all of these things are sort of in my body right now is this
*  sort of vibrating high thing. I remember like in the party setting, cause I've had to talk to a few
*  people, I felt like it was going sexual very quickly. Okay. I don't know if you remember this,
*  but the first time I met you, I didn't know who you were. I just heard, I knew I'd heard your name,
*  like you'd heard your name and I was like, I think I've heard people discuss that. And I was in the
*  middle of a very sexual conversation with another woman. Oh, you were? Yeah, I was. And you just
*  like turned around and left very shortly afterwards. And I thought it was very- Oh, was I listening in
*  on the conversation or something like that? I think it was like, it was like I was talking to her and
*  you were just kind of like right there. And so we introduced ourselves and then we continued on with
*  the conversation. You were like standing there and listening. Yeah. I don't think I would have
*  left the cut. So it's funny, you probably interpreted it in a different way. I interpreted it as you like
*  not wanting to listen to like graphic sexual stuff. Was it like super graphic? I don't know. I was
*  asking her about, I was doing it. I was interviewing her about her fetish basically. Oh yeah. I don't
*  think I would have walked away from that. I would have been like curious. Oh, interesting. Cause I
*  don't often see people having a deep interview about fetishes. Like I wouldn't even be, listen,
*  I'm like Jane Goodall here. Like I'm not like, I'm not afraid of sexuality or something like that.
*  I just have certain values in terms of like monogamy and so on. But I think sexuality is
*  really beautiful. Yeah. I don't think, yeah, I can't imagine myself walking away from that conversation.
*  Somebody must have like called you or something. Cause I didn't remember exactly how it worked. I
*  just remember thinking later on. Or maybe I thought I was intruding. Oh, maybe. Cause I was kind of
*  drunk. So. And I probably was very drunk too. I would like to actually have like footage of that
*  conversation so we can actually interpret what actually happened because it's probably, I mean,
*  you know, human interactions are funny like that. They can happen for all kinds of reasons.
*  Have you ever fallen in love with a client? No. I mean like in tiny ways, like micro loves.
*  Like have you ever fallen in love love? I mean, I don't know what it means, but probably the thing
*  that other people say when they say fall in love is probably something I've experienced.
*  What do you think they mean? What is love? Aila? Yeah, I know. No. It's a fantastic question. I
*  think so love is one of those words that refers to like a billion different concepts. And I think
*  we maybe should just taboo the term to have a better understanding of what we're referring to.
*  Cause there's things like a feeling of intense attachment. There's something feeling like
*  soulfully aligned. There's like sexual attraction. There's like excitement. Are you talking to me
*  saying we should taboo the term love in this conversation? How dare you? No.
*  Romantic love. To make it flourish into lots of other new definitions. Okay. Thank you.
*  It sounds like you're censoring the most important word. This is like 1984 all over again.
*  Okay. Also on the book reading list. Oh, okay. Listen, no, romantic love, like a deep intimacy
*  for somebody else, like a deep connection with the human being that is also, I mean,
*  yeah, with polyamory is tricky and your relationship with sex is also, sex is also tricky.
*  So like, what's the difference between a deep friendship and a friendship that also has a
*  sexual component? I remember being very confused about that one. I did a lot of LSD. I was like,
*  what? The line between romantic relationships and everything else kind of got blurred. I was like,
*  oh, I'm just like in intimacy. And some intimacies mean that you spend your life together more and
*  have sex, but like the same basic thing is there. Like you're seeing someone for like who they are.
*  Do you think you can be, if you're heterosexual, do you think you could be really deeply close
*  with friends with a guy and not have sexual relationships with him? I assume it's possible.
*  Like if anything is ever possible, then probably, yeah. Like everything is possible. Time travel is
*  possible. Quantum mechanics makes every traveling faster than the speed of light is possible.
*  According to general relativity, everything's possible. So you're saying there's a chance.
*  Taught me that everything is possible. Not super likely assuming that they are like attracted to
*  each other. Yeah. And for somebody that has surveys and statistical analysis,
*  we're interested in like, what's the likely thing here versus like, what's possible. If you say
*  possible, it's like where anything's open. Did you just avoid answering the love thing?
*  Okay. I have a lot to say about love. I just need to be precise.
*  Yeah. Okay. Let's be precisely and precise and continue.
*  I'm sorry. It's my phone.
*  Feels like a passive aggressive suggestion that we shouldn't talk about love anymore,
*  but we shall continue. No, we should absolutely talk about love.
*  It's just the term is very confusing because it's like some people say the word love. And the thing
*  that they're thinking of is like, oh, the butterfly is like the sparkle thing that I get in my stomach
*  when I think about my loved one. But I study relationships over time. I just really like,
*  I did a survey about it and that sparkle goes away within like two to four years. But people
*  still report loving their partner after that. So I'm like, okay, like when you say the word love,
*  what the fuck are we talking about? Yeah.
*  I just want to get on the same page. Okay. So what are the different, so the butterflies,
*  boy, I'd like to push back on two to four years on the butterflies, but okay.
*  I mean, statistically, not everybody. Butterflies don't give a fuck about
*  statistics. You ever heard of the, like the butterfly, the flap of a butterfly wing causing
*  nuclear war? How do you describe that with your statistics? Okay. So butterflies, that's the
*  basic infatuation, the chemistry of the initial interactions. Sure. But a deep meaningful connection
*  like that feels like sexuality is a component of that. Like the kind of intimacy that's only
*  possible when you're also sexual with another human being. On top of that, you have the butterfly
*  and on top of that you have the friendship and on top of that you have like, what is that?
*  That's a sandwich. The love sandwich.
*  The love sandwich. Okay. I'm down to calling it a love sandwich.
*  Okay. Sandwich is called sandwich. L-S. Okay. What role does that play in the human condition?
*  He's asking about the human condition. It's an interesting phrase.
*  Yeah. I'm like, this is like not a phrase that's common in my own thinking.
*  Sure. Human condition is a good summary. What do you think? What do you feel when I say human condition?
*  I get asked very different kinds of questions than you.
*  Sure. Yeah.
*  Which is interesting. I've been trying to figure out what kind of brain you have is creating this
*  category of question. Which is why I was saying there's something about poetic narrative in there
*  because it's very aesthetic. I think you've asked much more aesthetic questions than I do.
*  I don't even know what the word aesthetic means. Like artistic.
*  Artistic. I know what aesthetic means but I also don't know what it means. It's kind of like the
*  word love. Aesthetic perspective. Yeah. Well, but part of it in conversation, you don't want to ask
*  a question that has an answer fully, always. Do you have an example of a question that has-
*  What's the meaning of, oh, it has an answer. Yeah. Like one that you'd say was like, oh,
*  that's like a bad question because it has an answer. How many sexual partners you had in the
*  last year? Oh my God. That's such a- Okay. I feel like we just got to some sort of crux about the
*  kinds of questions that we like to answer. Because I would love that question. Okay, right.
*  To ask enough people. All right. But does that really tell the story of what you've felt over
*  the past year? That's true. But then I could just tell you. Okay. So by when you're saying the kinds
*  of questions that you like, the ones that don't have an answer, by not an answer, you mean like
*  not an answer where you can know that you're done telling it. Is that-
*  That you can escape having to think by actually answering it. I see. Yeah. The struggle
*  is the place where we discover something, not the destination. Yeah. Okay. It's working. It's working.
*  Okay. So what is the role of the love sandwich in the human condition? Okay. That's fine. I take
*  that question, but it's a stupid question. You don't have to. I'm ready to try. Do you like love?
*  Do you personally like love? Yeah. I mean, I think there's a part of me that feels like I have
*  unconditional love for all things. Like when you're talking about the glass being beautiful,
*  I felt that. It felt like it rang something that I have a similar resonance in me for that.
*  If I were to circle right now, I feel like you're avoiding the love question. The love sandwich
*  question. What's your own personal feeling towards loving another human being versus having sex with
*  another human being? Love is like one of the concepts that dissolved for me a long time ago,
*  so I have difficulty directly answering it. But I have the experience. When you described the love
*  sandwich, I feel like I have had that experience. I have it currently for some people also. Like
*  I'm dating people and I have that. So people who you date, you would describe sharing a love
*  sandwich with them. Yeah. Okay. So how does, I mean, that's great to hear. So you're not,
*  are you afraid of love? No, not at all. So can you describe to me polyamory? What is it?
*  What does it mean? Because there's like different terms. You have a nice blog post about it.
*  Yeah, I have a personal definition of it, which I readily admit is not shared by a lot of people.
*  But to me, the definition of polyamory is simply not forbidding your partner from pursuing intimacy
*  with others. It doesn't mean that you have to pursue it personally. Like two people could be
*  married and only have had sex with each other for 20 years. And as long as they're like, you know
*  what, if you ever, you want to go have sex with somebody else, you're welcome to do that. Well,
*  the interesting thing you said is that doesn't mean they have to do it. They just have the
*  freedom to do it. Yeah, it's the freedom that matters to me. Which is, I mean, it's called the
*  polyamory post. It has so many good blog posts. People should just go look at your, read your
*  writing because it's really, really strong and often backed by data, but also just a deeply honest
*  look at yourself and your understanding of the world. It's night, it's, yeah, it's refreshing to
*  be like with a lot of stuff I disagree with, but I feel like if I disagree with it, you'll be very
*  open to arguing and kind of thinking through it. There's just the honesty that radiates from the
*  whole thing. Anyway, so yeah, it's, I mean, it would be interesting to kind of explore what
*  polyamory, like how it works. What are the different versions? What is the, what does that freedom look
*  like? What does that freedom feel like to be able to go see other people? Depends on you. Like,
*  do you want to go see other people? Maybe you do, maybe you don't. So usually for me, I tend to be
*  pretty happy with like one or a few people. And then occasionally I like some novelty. So usually
*  I'll go like, I host orgy sometimes. So I'll host an orgy and then I'll go have sex with people at
*  the orgy. And then that'll be good for the novelty for a while. Can I ask you about orgies? Yeah.
*  So how many people are in an orgy? What's like a standard, we're having a Sunday picnic and it's
*  an orgy. What's like a number of people at an orgy? Oh, it depends. I've been, I've only recently
*  started hosting orgies, but I have been to a lot of orgies. I would say like the median is maybe
*  15 people. I like how you say median versus mean. Okay. Median is 15 people. What's the, what's the
*  gender distribution usually? Usually about even. It's like ideal if you can get more women than men
*  in most of them. I've recently been hosting free use orgies or orgies where consent is assumed by
*  default when you enter. And of course you can revoke it anytime. We're go over a whole bunch
*  of rules to make sure it's very safe. You like have wristbands. So nobody's actually doing a
*  thing they don't want to, but in those ones you have to have more men than women. I thought free
*  use was like consensual like at any time, but it's at any time within the constraints of this building
*  or something like that. Yeah. So at the orgies, it's like you buy entering, if you wear a wristband,
*  uh, then you are like by default opting into consent. So people don't have to like do a thing
*  where they negotiate with you and like, be like, is this okay? It's just the default is like, you
*  just go for it. And if they want you to stop, they say the safe word like red don't, and then you have
*  to stop. Um, and we do like exercise in the beginning of people saying red to make sure
*  that everybody knows exactly what the rules are. What's your favorite safe word? Red. Red. When I
*  first started doing like weird kinky shit, I was like, Oh, let's make a safe word. And we picked
*  the word foliage. I was like, that's goofy, right? And then, but then eventually came a time
*  where I did actually in fact want to say the safe word and I couldn't, I was like, like in agony,
*  I was like crying, like I can't make myself say this stupid word right now. So after that, I was
*  like, red doesn't matter. I don't care. That's not funny. We're just going with very simple.
*  How does an orgy compare sexually to like a one-on-one sexual experience?
*  Um, like what is it same ballpark or is it fundamentally different?
*  I mean, the experiences of both orgies and one-on-one sex can be like really high variety.
*  It's a little bit like you're having sex with someone, but you're surrounded by really realistic
*  VR porn of other people having sex. And sometimes it's like three sums also, like maybe there's
*  another person involved, but it's hard to like have a whole bunch of people on one in one cluster
*  because usually there's kind of different little clusters of people having their experience.
*  I was part of a 10 woman orgy. It was a total lesbian thing and that felt like a writhing cluster.
*  It was very nice. But typically you kind of separate out with like very small pods of people
*  doing stuff. Okay. So back to polyamory. So what, uh, what's a good, uh, what, what does it take to
*  manage? Do you have a main partner? If you're being polyamorous and you have your dating multiple
*  people, is there usually a main one for you personally? Uh, for me personally, kind of, yes.
*  Like right now I kind of too, that aren't like, I see roughly around for me is kind of just
*  descriptive. Like if I just happen to be seeing you a lot more and I confide in you more than you,
*  like you're descriptively my primary partner, but I don't usually have rules to protect that.
*  I'm down with rules to protect it. If you're like, you're trying to build something, like if I buy a
*  house together, I'd be like, okay, we need to like, whatever our relationship is, we have to do the
*  thing. We're both paying the rent for the house or the mortgage or whatever. Uh, a lot of people do
*  have primaries. So it's very common to have like, like prescriptive, like I'm going to get married
*  to you and you're not allowed to like have anal sex with anybody else. That sort of thing. What
*  about like the transparency and the communication they have to do? Yeah. I usually try to be super
*  honest about it. Extremely. Yeah. I mean, I've learned over time that like, even if it seems
*  like a very small thing, you talk about the small thing. Cause often I would just sort of have like
*  a small twitch in myself. I don't know if I like that, but I'm like, okay, this is really minor.
*  Um, it's probably nothing. And I don't, if I talk about it, it's going to make it into a thing. And
*  I just don't want to make it into a thing, you know? And I would, I've come to realize that it's
*  worth making it into a thing because I can't predict at the time if like the small feeling
*  I have is going to grow. And then when I grow it now, it's like much more difficult to deal with.
*  So now it's like any little bit of jealousy I have immediately communicated. I'm like, ah,
*  I'm a little jealous of you right now. I don't hold that in at all. I used to be kind of like,
*  back when I first started being poly, I used to try to pretend that I was not a jealous person.
*  And that backfired quite a lot. So you do still feel jealous. Oh yeah, definitely. And like,
*  and it's also interesting that you kind of recommend when there's a little bit of jealousy,
*  to bring that to the surface. Yeah, just like excessively communicate, even if it feels
*  stupid. Like this is, I feel like a cliche. I feel like a stupid therapist training video.
*  Like I just feel ridiculous sometimes when I'm saying the things, but it's just,
*  I've learned over time it's just important to just say the things. Because like, you know,
*  the traditional view of jealousy is exactly like you said, if you bring it up to the surface, like,
*  it's going to sound like you're overreacting to everything. But you're saying like, still do it.
*  Because you're basically, your brain blows stuff out of proportion.
*  Yeah. And it's good to like be going through it with a partner. Like I have a partner right now
*  who's like dating this other girl and he like really likes her and you know, like went traveling
*  with her and stuff. And I was like, I feel jealous about it. And I have to tell him that. And that
*  way he can be with me in it. He like, he like holds me when I'm feeling jealous. And it's like
*  a bonding experience, you know? But it's important for me that like he's able to handle it. Like I
*  try not to date people who really freak out when I have negative emotions. Because I want to be able
*  to express that I'm upset by something they're doing without it being taken as a demand that
*  they change their behavior. Right. So he has to be able to skillfully handle the interaction.
*  He has to be like, cool. All right, you're jealous. Like, I'm not going to freak out about it. I'm
*  not going to change my behavior. I'm just going to be with you in that. We're going to sit in it
*  together. I mean, is some of that just insecurity that he should also just comfort, like basically
*  alleviate your insecurity, bring you back to like a rational objective evaluation?
*  My relationships, I love it when people do not reassure me. I like not being comforted
*  quite a lot. And so usually the people I date don't, I'm very gravitating. Like it's one of
*  the things people do to make me fall in love with them is if I say something really like terrible,
*  and they're just like, do not give me any comfort whatsoever. Like that's where
*  my heart gets captured. So I typically am in relationships where I'm like,
*  oh man, I'm so jealous. And they just like, do not reassure me at all. And that's good. Because it
*  doesn't give me an out. Like I have to deal with it myself. Like maybe it is true that the other
*  woman is better than me. Like maybe that is an actual possible reality. I don't want to be
*  dealing with my life in a way where I'm like pretending like I'm only okay when that reality
*  is not true. Would you like them to, to say that that the other woman is better than you? Yeah.
*  Or that they feel that. Yeah. I mean, they should say it in according to themselves. Like, oh,
*  I prefer like I have a better time with her than I have with you. Then I would want to know that.
*  And even though that might be painful to hear. Yes.
*  That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.
*  That which can be destroyed by the truth. What is that? That your ego or something like that?
*  So your ego just generally grows and you like the destruction of it.
*  Yeah. It's like a fun experience. Like I've had like guys be like, well, you're not as pretty as
*  I'd like. I'm just like, Oh, you know, so stabbed to the heart. And then also like,
*  give me your number after. Yeah. Oh man. That's, oh, that's, that's kind of beautiful.
*  What do you think of monogamous relationships? Like philosophically,
*  can you maybe steal man or make the case for monogamous relationships?
*  Can you understand the pros and cons of monogamous relationships? I guess. Yeah. I mean,
*  depends on how you defend, if you're like, Hey, uh, we, you can do whatever you want, but you and
*  I are going to spend the rest. Like we just, you're 80 years old and like, Oh, we spent 60 years
*  in a marriage together. We've never had sex with anybody else. I think that's like, awesome. That's
*  what you want. That's great. Um, I like a little bit more problems with people doing that while
*  also forcing their partner not to misbehave if they want to. Like if you're like, Oh, I, we only
*  made it this far in a monogamous relationship because I forced my partner not to pursue an
*  intimacy that she wanted to. Then I feel like a little like more like, ah, I don't know if that's
*  great. How do you know if it's a real want for an intimacy, like checking out a attractive person
*  while being inside a monogamous relationship? Yeah. How do you score that? That is that bad
*  that the person cannot pursue those feelings? Uh, I mean, it depends if they want to, like I often
*  find people attractive. I don't want to pursue. I'm also okay with people entering into agreements.
*  Like if you and I want to agree, like I'm only going to enter this because I'm going to be so hurt
*  if you pursue somebody else. So I'm not going to pursue anybody else. That seems fine to me.
*  But I also extend that. Like if, if somebody's like, I don't want you to have any friends,
*  I'm going to feel really insecure. And like, okay, like if you want to enter that agreement,
*  like I feel the same way. Like I think you should have the right to do it if this is what you want.
*  But I also kind of, I feel like a little weird about restricting your partner from doing things,
*  you know? Oh, but I guess if you're honest about it and you put it on the table,
*  I don't want you to have any friends. I want you to sit in a box.
*  Yeah, I think a lot.
*  I guess if you're like really on the, but then there's like, there's a power dynamic
*  that like you can be quite influential in a relationship and convincing your partner.
*  And it's sure sounds like you're honestly agreeing to a thing, but you're not really agreeing.
*  That's the, I mean, part of that is the beauty of relationships, right? Like
*  it's messy. It can be messy. It's hard to know what you really want, right?
*  I think that's mainly my complaint with monogamy. Like I'm down with like conscious monogamy,
*  but I think so many relationships are like monogamous by default. Like people,
*  it's not actually right for them, but they just get into it because culture
*  just doesn't give them another option.
*  And they don't even ask themselves the question, is this right for me?
*  Right. Which like I'm a weird ass person who thinks a lot of weird shit, but I didn't even
*  think about polyamorous as an option before I had heard that it existed. And I was only when I first
*  met my first polyamorous couple and I was like, oh, that's what I am. That's clearly the thing
*  that I am. Yeah. It's funny because to me, monogamy, it's not, it doesn't make sense for
*  it to be a default. Like to me, monogamy goes against human nature. That's in some sense,
*  like romance is a fuck you to the way the world works. Really? Yeah. Like it's a,
*  like Romeo and Juliet romance, like traditional description of what romance looks like versus
*  like, sure. There's like a million variations of that, but in my, in my head, like this partnership
*  that's for a long time together is a kind of, you know, like, uh, I don't know, like true romance,
*  you know, that movie, it's a really fucking good movie. Okay. This is just, there's just like, um,
*  you're together against the world. Yeah. That's the, I mean, that's what close friendship feels
*  like. It's like ride or die. Yeah. Like that. I guess it doesn't, it doesn't, it can be,
*  it can span across multiple, you can have multiple partners in that way. Yeah. But I
*  just don't see monogamy as like this, definitely not a default. I would actually like honestly
*  would probably see polyamory as a more natural default. Yeah. I mean, it gets depends on what
*  you mean by default. Like most of human history has been sort of a weird mix. Like you get
*  polygamy and monogamy or the kind of the main sure. But it's just like human nature. Like,
*  yeah, people are attracted to other people and they want to, yeah, especially in longer term
*  relationships. I tracked in my relationship survey, I tracked the amount of cheating over time
*  in a relationship. Like how long have you been in this relationship and how have you cheated?
*  What's the results of that? Men cheat a lot. Uh, women too, but men cheat about 30% more than women
*  do. I also asked men and women to predict if they think their partner has cheated and people's
*  predictions were about the same. So people roughly predicted that their male or female like spouse,
*  hadn't cheated about the same rate, but men cheated much more than women.
*  So who, uh, who was more correct in their prediction though?
*  So men were more correct in their prediction, predicting women and women were thought men,
*  women were more off. Women thought men cheated much less than they actually did.
*  And, but both of them were off, but like the male gap was significantly more. So yeah, I mean,
*  you're right. When you say monogamy is not default, like I think you're like really getting at
*  something like human beings are just, especially in longterm relationships, difficult to only want
*  one person. But to be fair, I think monogamy and commitment are very different. I think you'd be
*  incredibly, I haven't known so many very longterm, super committed poly couples that live lives that
*  look very similar to the very romantic monogamous couples, like children, houses, like 20 years.
*  Yeah. Uh, and that, that works great for them. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so much to like,
*  open your mind to in these kinds of conversations, these kinds of ideas, but I also like realize like
*  some of the cake is baked. Like I have some assumptions that are hard to break through
*  like what for myself, like it's, it's difficult for me to imagine a polyamorous relationship for
*  me that would work, but I don't have enough data. I don't have a, like I have very little,
*  but like at this point it's like, um, I haven't eaten pizza in like 20 years
*  because I know I just don't, there's a bunch of stuff I just eat low carb because it makes me feel
*  good, but there's so many foods I haven't explored. It's just like, well, I know what I love.
*  So you explore every once in a while. Yeah. And you kind of figure that out, but at the same time
*  you're humbled by like even talking to you and looking at your data, like sexuality is a, is a
*  fascinating topic because it seems that we're very, like we were talking about, very afraid of this
*  topic. Like to be really honest with ourselves about it, the whole like academic research is
*  afraid of it, but it's so core to who we are as human beings. I got to ask you about this. I can't
*  believe it took us long to get there, but one of your many fascinating, um, surveys is on fetishes.
*  Um, you wrote a blog post about it. Uh, probably several, cause it's like a huge day. It's still in progress. Yeah.
*  So, uh, the one I'm referring to is on popularity and taboo-ness of various fetishes. So what are
*  some interesting takeaways? I got to pull up this graph cause it's freaking epic. Yes, this is a big
*  graph and it has taboo-ness as one axis and, um, popularity as the other. Okay. For people who are
*  just listening on the X axis is taboo-ness. Yeah. Asked to rate how taboo society viewed sexual
*  interest and on the Y axis is percent of people reporting interest, log scale. Oh boy. All right.
*  So just some examples on the low taboo-ness and high popularity. There's a, there's a correlation
*  here. I think you said it's 0.69. Yeah. It's just not, it's just hilarious. Is it still 0.69? Are you
*  tracking that? I haven't since I did this. Yeah. Uh, so like the last taboo stuff is more likely
*  to be popular and the more taboo stuff is less likely to be popular. And on the like missionary
*  position, fingering, vagina, blowjobs, light spanking, cuddling, cuddling is more taboo than
*  missionary. I think people are conceiving, like if you're like, I'm really sexually aroused by
*  cuddling specifically, then you're like, that's a little more weird than getting specifically
*  aroused by blowjobs. You expect people to be aroused by blowjobs. So this was like getting at
*  like as a fetish versus like an activity. Yeah. It's a specific, it's like a concrete sexual
*  interest. Like I'm specifically interested in this thing. Yeah. And so those are thighs and lips,
*  different body parts, jaw lines. And then some of it is color based on more female preference
*  versus a male preference. Like jaw lines is more female preference. Being submissive is more female
*  preference, light bondage, more female. There's a lot of interesting ones. There's so much. Okay.
*  But then on the far side of that, I mean, it gets pretty dark, but even all along the way,
*  like extreme bondage, being at 50 taboos, pegging, pain, giving pain, sexual frustration,
*  I suppose, as a kink. Yeah. And there's so many interesting ones like to me,
*  like just that I haven't even like considered. Yeah. I had to do so much research into fetishes
*  to compile the list. Are there some surprising like options to you that you're like, oh, okay,
*  this is like a fetish. Yeah. Well, more confusing was like what the fetishes are about. Because like
*  I didn't want to overlap fetishes. So I had to kind of look into them. Yeah. And I'm like,
*  there's like such interesting manifestations of core drives. Like if you're really aroused by
*  disgust, like maybe you're very into rolling around in dirt, but you're not into rolling
*  around with ice cream. So I'm like, okay, I have to make those two separate fetishes.
*  Sure. And like I'm seeing like at the far end, rodents,
*  like different types of incest, branding. So there's like pain. Yeah. And then-
*  It's like wound fucking. Sex with animals, I guess, dogs, horses.
*  Receiving oral sex from an animal is high taboo-ness and pretty high popularity. Yeah.
*  Surprisingly high popularity. I was really shocked by that one. I went and triple checked that
*  number because I'm like, no way this amount of people are reporting interest. Do you know which
*  animal? Is there- No, I didn't specify. I asked like which animals are erotic and then I separately
*  asked like how erotic is it to receive oral sex from your preferred animal. This is so fascinating.
*  So I would, like, can we just talk about the methodology of this?
*  This feels like deeply honest map of humanity in a way we don't usually map humanity.
*  Yeah. Like, because it's so mean- like your fetishes are so meaningful to each individual person.
*  Yeah, that's what I love about this work. It's like nobody cares about someone's fetishes. You
*  never get to express them and if you have a more unusual fetish, people usually judge you. So it's
*  like this tiny little pocket of like this shame thing, but it's so cool to me that like human
*  brains can be oriented in such a way like wound fucking. Like somebody finds that so erotic and
*  that's so cool. Yeah, and then they probably- and it should be explored. Like how did that come to
*  be? You mentioned that we like to construct narratives that somehow was grounded in childhood,
*  but maybe it's genetic. Maybe it has to do with- maybe you can actually form and unform that fetish
*  very quickly. I don't know. This is one of the things that I'm researching. So in the big survey
*  that I'm doing, I asked so many questions about childhood. All the ones that I think like we have
*  common theories about like, oh, are you abused? Is it yelled at by a man or a woman? Stuff like
*  that. Like, are you- is it really sexually repressive? You know, is it gender roles where
*  you're expected to conform? A whole bunch of stuff. And then I asked, you know, obviously about like a
*  massive amount of fetishes. And my sample size right now is 500,000 people. 500,000 people.
*  Yeah, it's massive. And I have it stated for all of it. And the result looks like this not really
*  correlated. Nothing that I asked about in childhood, nothing correlates with fetish preference later in
*  life. It does correlate with onset. Lots of things that happen in childhood can like change
*  the age at which it triggers. There are so many fascinating blog posts. You had a blog post, I think,
*  on the age of fetish onset. Yeah. And like you- you really organized it by age, like
*  reproduction as a fetish, I guess pregnancy. Yeah. As at age of 17, about 16.9,
*  toys and like anal beads is 15.5. Yeah, one of the interesting things I found, I mean,
*  this data set is so huge, it's taking me a long time to go through it. So this is like snippets
*  from what I remember when I was glancing through the data. So this part is not rigorous, but I seem
*  to get the impression that if you are- if a fetish occurs for you earlier, like if you're much earlier
*  onset, you're more likely to report being extremely interested into it. So later onset means you're
*  going to be like less into the fetish. But if it hits earlier, it's- But I wonder if it passes,
*  like is there like- Yeah, I didn't measure old fetishes at all. Like no longer, right? You used
*  to, but it is no longer there. Interesting. One interesting thing that I don't understand is that
*  non-cis people seem to have more correlation between childhood experiences and fetishes.
*  So I was saying that there's no correlation between childhood experiences and fetishes.
*  This holds for cis people. But trans people, especially trans men, there's a correlation.
*  It doesn't mean they have absolutely higher rates of abuse or fetishes or anything,
*  but I'm just saying that like for them, there does actually seem to be some sort of connection
*  between childhood experiences and sexuality later in life. And I don't understand why this
*  applies to one group and not the other. I don't have a good theory for that. So usually you try,
*  like when you see something like that, you'll try to construct a theory and see if you can find,
*  like you keep that theory in mind, like a hypothesis of why it would be, and then you ask
*  further questions to try to elaborate. So can you maybe talk about the methodology of how you got
*  the 500,000? Like how did this come to be? I might go into way too much detail about this
*  because I thought about this so much. Because the question is, how do you get a lot of people to
*  take a big survey? The longer the survey is, the lower the response rate. And I really wanted to
*  do one big comprehensive survey so I could check a whole bunch of correlations within it, because
*  it's more annoying and it's harder to get a lot of people to retake similar surveys to each other
*  at a time. So I'm like, okay, I need to convince a very large number of people to take a lot of
*  these questions. And even building the questions, that was really hard because I'm like, okay,
*  I need a comprehensive amount of fetishes. I can't ask everybody to answer for every single niche
*  fetish. I'm like, do you like ball gags? Do you like funnel gags? Do you like wife shrew gags or
*  whatever? I'm like, you can't do that. Nobody's going to finish that survey.
*  Okay, fine. I'm not going to ask questions. What's a wife shrew? But okay.
*  I'm trying to refer to like, there's like a thing that like...
*  Different types of gags?
*  Yeah, different. So I'm like, so what I need to do is I need to ask people a question, like,
*  are you in like bondage? And if you say yes, then I'll go ask you all the bondage questions.
*  Ah, got it.
*  Right. But then this seems simple, but then it's just exploded because I'm like,
*  how do I categorize these fetishes? If you're into splashing, which is...
*  What's that?
*  Like you like sitting in cakes, you like getting in mud, but basically like kind of messy sensory.
*  Is this a disgust thing? Is it a humiliation thing? Is it a sensory thing? Which category?
*  Anyway, so it took me like two months of just agonizing over each fetish because you don't
*  want to miss a fetish. You don't want to have a really important thing that you accidentally
*  put in disgust category when it actually belongs in the humiliation category.
*  Well, let me think about that because like you're still catching it. You just miss
*  categorizing it.
*  Right. Because if you're into splashing and you're like, this is clearly a humiliation thing. So you
*  say, yes, I'm in humiliation stuff. And then I don't ask you about splashing, that I'm missing
*  a whole data set of people because I've falsely categorized your question.
*  You're going to miss stuff. You're just picking what's less and less important to miss.
*  Well, I'm trying to get people into the right question set.
*  Sure.
*  Because like I can't ask you all the questions. I have to ask you a couple of overarching questions
*  to know what specific questions to ask you. And so I have to, those overarching questions have to
*  be really, really well calibrated so that I can accurately feed you into the right sub part of
*  the survey.
*  Awesome.
*  So that was extremely difficult. When I'm dealing with, I think it was like 850 fetishes.
*  So I did a couple of things to spot check. I did a couple of questions where I asked
*  detailed in the survey, but also the beginning of the survey, just to see what cap percentage
*  people I was capturing. And then I scored the survey. So if you take it, I had other people
*  answer preliminary surveys where they gave me data about how taboo the various fetishes were.
*  And then I use that data so that when you fill out the survey, it's extremely comprehensive
*  and you get data about exactly how taboo your interests are. And then you get a score at the
*  end. And I give you an equivalent kinky character, which I also had people write a whole bunch of
*  fictional characters and some historic ones about like how kinky they were. So then I matched the
*  historic character, kinky character to your score.
*  So that makes it like more fun, like gamifies it a little bit. And you can brag about like-
*  So people would share it with others.
*  Share it.
*  And a lot of the characters were like goofy, like there's SpongeBob and Hitler's on there and,
*  you know, South Park characters.
*  What kink does Hitler have?
*  I think he's like, he's around Marilyn Monroe, which is like slightly above average.
*  Oh, sorry. I thought there was like a two dimensional space somehow. So this is like
*  literally from zero to-
*  How kinky, yeah.
*  So Hitler is a part of the Marilyn Monroe. Who is the most, what's the character for like-
*  Willy Wonka?
*  Is the most kinky.
*  Is the most kinky, yeah. I think like maybe Captain America was the least kinky or something,
*  or Gandhi.
*  Meanwhile, but that's another conversation.
*  Oh boy.
*  Yeah, so it went viral on TikTok basically, because people were like, what? I got this
*  insane character. And then the sample size exploded from 40,000 to 500,000.
*  Wow. So like all it took is that kind of incentive?
*  Well, did you like at first have to pay people for the survey?
*  No, it was just that incentive.
*  And what about the demographic of the different people that took it?
*  Mostly younger. So usually early twenties, predominantly female, like 70% female.
*  70% female?
*  I was just pretty like, I perhaps saw the TikTok demographics pretty well.
*  Oh, okay. I got it. But that's interesting. With young people are probably better for this kind of
*  survey, because there's probably a culture that's a little bit more honest about their sexuality.
*  Yeah, most likely. I think people are incentivized to be honest when they're getting a true identity
*  response out of it. Like if you're doing it for money, you don't care. But like if you are
*  invested in the result, you want to know what the truth of the answers are, then you actually.
*  There's possibly you also don't want to know the truth.
*  Yeah, this is true.
*  But on average, hopefully that doesn't. I mean, these are really difficult. Like what
*  is there some interesting little quirks that people should know about your methodology that
*  you had to kind of solve to try to get to a really good survey? So one of you said is the categorization
*  to make it more efficient. Is there some for the analysis part?
*  Yeah. So the graph that you were talking about is binary. So it's like if somebody expressed
*  even a little bit of interest, then it goes into the graph. So it's like 80% of people
*  expressed even a little bit of interest. So it's not representing degree of interest.
*  It's not differentiating between them at all. So it's possible that like some fetishes have
*  exactly the same amount of people like are at least a little bit into them. But one of them,
*  it's very extreme interest and the others like vague and not very intense. So that's not reflected.
*  I also like probably didn't represent the visual part right. Like it might not be intuitive.
*  But you chose a log scale, but it was kind of spreads things out to make it more and more clear.
*  Because the linear it was just so close to the bottom, you couldn't really separate it out.
*  So there's obviously a selection effects. It's possible that like the identity results at the
*  end impacted people's results a little bit. But the thing is like, I'm comparing it to what exists,
*  like what is the alternative? And right now the research on this stuff is terrible. So it's like,
*  I'm not saying my research is perfect. But it's like at least it's something like it's something
*  that's pointing us maybe in a direction that we might be able to do more research on.
*  And you're making the data available. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing it slowly because
*  it there's so I asked about so many questions. It's like not very anonymized.
*  So I'm releasing the small sections of the data at a time.
*  Yeah. Have you published in like journals and stuff?
*  No, I haven't.
*  You have any interest in that? Or is your approach?
*  I'm like, I'm conflicted about it. Like it sounds cool because then I could be like,
*  ha ha, I'm publishing a journal. And then people who are yelling about me who don't know anything
*  about statistics on Twitter, like that I can go like shove it in their face.
*  But then you're also giving into the silly criticism, right?
*  Like I don't like I want I feel so passionate about extra science, like science that you can
*  just do like I want to make science accessible, like anybody can just go look and learn about
*  the basics of like doing a survey or figuring out how to interpret information. And doing
*  doing a published journal feels like I'm betraying my cause a little bit.
*  That's often behind the paywall. Yeah, it's goes against the I mean, I think you not publishing
*  a journal is doing a big public service.
*  I think it's the first time I've heard that. Thank you.
*  Oh, it's just coming from like, on this topic, the elite, the elitism I see on the psychology
*  side with the journals and academia, the positions and the institutions you come from all that,
*  that goes against I think that's more useful for math and computer science and so on,
*  where there's like, clear, like, even then, even then, code is code data is data.
*  Like, a procedure should matter at all. Maybe maybe for like, like biological experiments,
*  like virology or something like that. It's good to be from a major lab that has a reputation for
*  like, going through all the procedures like, you know, you can trust. But here, like you're
*  dealing with a giant mess of humanity. It's beautiful to be transparent, to be raw,
*  to be exploring it together with everybody. Yeah, it's really beautiful.
*  I think people like have a lot of incentive to doubt the results. Like, a lot of the research
*  I'm doing is to like, cis and trans people. Like, we don't have any data about transsexuality,
*  like not very good, at least. And I'm really curious. I don't really have an agenda about it.
*  I think like, being trans is cool. If you want to be trans, do it. And like, I have some skepticism
*  about like, gender theory. But like, it doesn't come down to impact like the way I think trans
*  people should be treated, which I think is like, treat them, you know, be fucking nice and human
*  about it. I don't know. But when I'm talking about the thing, like, my conclusions are that like,
*  transsexuality is really unique. It's not like, like, sister or cis woman or man sexuality at all.
*  And to me, this is super cool. But like, a lot of people, this is very politicized right now.
*  Like, the data into like, transsexual preferences, like, it's so loaded, which is really sad,
*  because I am very accepting of weird sexuality. Like, if you're into a weird thing, I'm like,
*  good for you. This is super cool. Like, let's figure out how to make it so that you can explore
*  the thing you're into without any stigma. But because there's so much stigma that like,
*  if you find that one demographic is in a weirder sex stuff than the other, like, it's hard to
*  present that in a way that people don't weaponize. So it's been it's been really politically touchy
*  subject here. Yeah, but you do it in a way that's not does it's not feel like it has an agenda,
*  right? You're just exploring. Yeah, I feel pretty open to what I'm going to find. Like, I often
*  have no idea what the day is going to tell me. And I'm like, I pre commit like, okay, I could say
*  A, B, or C. And I'm like down to publish any of those findings. So you've put together an ask whole
*  cart deck, a lot of awesome questions to ask at a party, or anywhere, honestly,
*  including on the podcast, let me ask you one from from from that deck. Is sex really about power?
*  So what's the role of power dynamics and sex? That everything you understand, like in from the
*  survey in terms of what people are turned on by, you've talked about like the preferences that
*  women versus men have for like submissiveness and dominance. And we've already talked about it a
*  little bit, but like, it's expressed more strongly. Yeah, I already forget the results. But I feel like
*  women have more preference to be submissive. Yeah, this is one of the things that got me into
*  researching fetishes to begin with. Because I think I came across some data, I did like a brief
*  survey where roughly around 60% of women report being submissive and 40% of men report being
*  dominant. And this was really fascinating to me. Like, why is there this gap? Like, why, why do we
*  not? Because I guess I have some priors that maybe this is an evolutionary thing, like the submission
*  dominant, like strong men, you know, like women being like, hot, hot man, you know, the men are
*  like ravaging and stuff. I'm like, shouldn't this be in our genes? But, but there's a gap.
*  What's the gap? The gap is the dominant submissive gap. More women are submissive
*  than there are dominant men. Oh, yeah. Really? Yeah. It's a pretty significant gap. And this
*  is held up like it depends on what you're testing. I've tested a bunch of things. This is part of why
*  I did this big survey. Nice. But it depends against again, on like, what kind of dominance
*  you're measuring, but overall, it's a roughly 40 to 60%. So when you say there's not many dominant
*  men, then the meaning like they express like a desire to be dominant in the relationship. Yeah.
*  Or like in sexually. Sexually. Sexually. In bed. So like, if I ask questions like, how much do you
*  like being dominant in bed? Like men are less likely to answer strong yes to that question.
*  But if I ask, are you likely to be submissive? Like women are very much yes. Really? And that's
*  expressive? Like that's, that, that, that represents truth? My guess is- What's wrong with men? So this
*  is, I think there's some reflection like FetLife. So FetLife is this website where people like sign
*  up and connect based on their fetishes. And this is like, you can kind of see it picked up in the
*  forum posts about like, how like dominant men are, you know, are getting laid so much and, you know,
*  submissives are always looking for a dominant. Like there's, it's an unequal market. Holy shit.
*  Yeah. This is great news. I didn't know this. That's interesting. Yeah. So what does it reflect
*  about modern society? Is that like, is that, cause you know, there's these trends about like,
*  decrease masculinity or that kind of thing. Is that similar? I'm trying not to hold onto one
*  theory because I'm not sure. One is possible like decreasing testosterone levels. Testosterone seems
*  to be, I have a little bit of other research, but I'm still checking it out. That seems to indicate
*  that a higher testosterone, you're more likely to be dominant. So if we're seeing decreased
*  testosterone levels across society, we should be seeing a greater gap. This is so fascinating.
*  Once again, this is like a super interesting way to look at humanity because it is such an important
*  part of humanity. And so like how many people are doing large scale research like this? I feel like
*  you're like at the top of the world, you're like world class at the top of the world doing research
*  on this stuff. Yeah. I think I might have the biggest, most comprehensive fetish data set in
*  the world right now. That's epic. Thank you. I'm really happy about it. I'm very proud. Yeah. And
*  it's, you know, it's, it's probably growing, but it's also enabling you to establish a name
*  to where you like a prestige, like a reputation to where people can go to you to like trust you
*  more and more to do longer surveys, perhaps like, yeah, maybe I think it's the data, the data
*  analysis afterwards is very different from like the survey design itself. So I'm still very amateur
*  at the data analysis. Yeah. But you can always catch up on that. I guess the data analysis does
*  enable you to, does teach you how to ask better questions in order to understand. It goes back
*  and forth. Like as I'm looking at the data, it informs the way I want to phrase questions. The
*  next time. So women are more, at least in private, able to say that they would like to be submissive
*  and men even in private are not disproportionately saying they're not willing to be dominant.
*  Yeah. So it's possible if this is caused by decreasing testosterone levels, and this means
*  that we're probably having less satisfying sex overall, like we're becoming less and less sexually
*  compatible as time goes on. To be fair, I'm not sure that it is connected to testosterone levels.
*  It's possible that this is just like a genetic thing. Like the gay uncle theory, like the
*  idea is like maybe gay people evolve to like be sort of taking themselves out of the gene pool
*  to be assistants. And like it's possible that like there's certain percentage of men sort of
*  like quote unquote evolved to be submissive, to take themselves out of sexual competition
*  and to instead be like the monkeys revolving at the edge of the pack. It's unclear.
*  Oh, it's a method of survival. Like, so you stay out of the competition.
*  Yeah. And I'm like a little suss about these kinds of evo psych theories. So I'm not,
*  I'm just saying it because it's like different ideas that are possible. Yeah. Okay.
*  So yeah, I'm not saying there's definitely testosterone. There's other things. It's also
*  possible that it's culture. People are definitely gonna bring that up based on my survey, though.
*  It doesn't seem to be any evidence of that. Like I asked about like how much pressure was put on you
*  to be, you know, agenty in your childhood, like a lot of questions around this kind of thing and
*  no correlation at all to dominance. Well, related to sexuality,
*  I'm very uncomfortable right now, but nevertheless, plow forward
*  in a dominant fashion.
*  The blog post titled rape spectrum survey results. What are the key takeaways from that survey?
*  So I did the survey when I had a friend be like, Hey, I had this confusing sexual experience.
*  Was it rape? Like somebody kind of pressured her and she eventually stopped saying there
*  or something. I was like, that's a great question. Like, I don't know how people would consider this.
*  And so I put a whole bunch of different gray scenarios into a survey and then asked people
*  to rate how rapey they thought that scenario was. So you actually like little narratives
*  that they get to rate. Like, you know, this person is on a date with this person, they get drunk,
*  and the other person is not drunk. I try to keep gender neutral names for all of them.
*  And you reduce them into a more concise description of the situation.
*  Yeah.
*  Like in this visualization, so you have this rape spectrum that's a result,
*  where on top are things that are less likely to be considered rape by the people that took the
*  survey and the bottom more likely. The likeliest is a stranger forcibly assaults someone who screams
*  and fights the entire time that gets a hundred. What do we make of something that's not zero?
*  It's like a 12 is what? What is that? How are we supposed to interpret a 12 out of a hundred?
*  Extremely low.
*  It's like not zero, but it's just very close to it.
*  Having sex with an enthusiastic sex worker is a 12. That's the lowest one.
*  And there's a few, I'll just mention a few that are lower, like at that level.
*  Have sex to make a partner happy in a relationship, lying about wealth hobbies in order to get laid.
*  Person with Down syndrome eagerly has sex within your typical, not revealing being transgender
*  until after sex, and so on. I think you mentioned that there's some, like that not revealing being
*  transgender until after sex, there's some differences amongst what men and women or something like that.
*  I think that was the one that men found more offensive than women. I'm trying to,
*  I wrote it a while ago.
*  I mean, this is nuanced and difficult, right? Because I think in a lot of public discourse,
*  the word rape is pretty binary.
*  Yeah. It's like either is or is not rape.
*  And so you had a friend who was like, this felt rapey.
*  Yeah. She's like confused about how to interpret it.
*  I think people look to the terms to know how to feel about something.
*  Have you ever been through an experience, you're like, that was weird. And then you
*  tell it to somebody else and they're like, oh my God, you were assaulted.
*  And then it totally recontextualizes the thing that you've experienced.
*  And I think that this is clunky with the word rape because either you were raped or you're not.
*  You either have this entire context thrust upon you or you don't.
*  And we're really not nuanced about it at all.
*  And so I would really like to have some sort of like, oh, that was like a 30% rape you just endured.
*  Yeah. And I mean, there's probably other dimensions about how traumatic it is,
*  how difficult it is to recover from, all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. I mean, like people, it's a dangerous thing to assign a word to an experience,
*  like even or to a relationship, like saying a toxic relationship.
*  Yeah.
*  That can completely destroy your perception of that relationship.
*  Yeah, absolutely. I remember this was the case with my childhood. Like I talked about being very
*  abusive, but I've talked about how like there was a good amount of meaning there so that I didn't
*  process it as abusive at the time. And I remember after I got out of that house and that culture,
*  people would tell me, oh, your child was really abusive. And I was really confused by that because
*  it's a total recontextualization of that narrative. It's like the things that I went through were not,
*  you know, good and virtuous and had meaning, but rather those were like the result of,
*  you know, parents who didn't like love you enough or something.
*  And even though the concrete things that happened to me did not change, like no facts shifted.
*  The fact that like the interpretation of the facts shifted caused me quite a bit of distress
*  for a long time. I was like, oh my God, I'm a traumatized, like abused person. Like I went
*  through an abusive childhood and it was really hard for me, made it worse. Like it's crazy the
*  power that terms have. I think we didn't talk about this, but how did you begin to overcome
*  the trauma of your childhood? You mentioned LSD, so drugs are part of it. Like what was
*  the mental journey of that? I was doing LSD quite a lot when I was 21, 22. What's it like,
*  by the way? I've never done LSD. It's very difficult to describe because it's like,
*  like it changes sort of aspects about your environment that are invisible to you because
*  they're so stable. Is it like, if you can compare it to like psilocybin, is it very different?
*  Oh yeah. It's like similar. I forgot that you did shrooms. Yeah. Okay. That you probably know,
*  you know, like the kind of shift that you have from cyber to shrooms is roughly similar. It's
*  like more clear, I think. Shrooms is more like embodied, but LSD is much more intellectual for
*  me. It strikes different people differently. I prefer shrooms a lot. I'm sorry, LSD. I prefer
*  LSD a lot. Why is it not popularly taken? Like there seems to be a negative connotation to LSD
*  because like it seems to potentially have like a destructive effect. Like maybe dosage is more
*  difficult to get right or something like that. So actually a long time ago I did a survey on
*  shrooms versus LSD. So I asked people and people had slightly stronger experiences on LSD overall,
*  I remember, but rated the experiences about is equally good. I think people like shrooms because
*  it feels more natural, quote unquote. But I think if you like fed somebody a shroom and like actually
*  had the LSD molecule in it, they would have a, they would think it felt very natural. But that's
*  beside the point. I think people would get kind of incoherent on LSD in a way that feels really
*  alienating. Like I consider LSD, my LSD use very heavy to be one of the best decisions I ever made
*  in my life, but I definitely was incoherent for a lot of it. Like talking about like we're all one,
*  consciousness, everything is love, man. You know, and people are like, so I think it's not
*  incoherent, but like if you go around saying everything is love, people are like, this guy's
*  kind of blasted out of his mind. This podcast is basically your LSD driven for a bunch of episodes.
*  Yeah, I get this for sure. Oh, well, it's not just about love, but it's, it's about like talking in
*  that way about reality, about the world. Yeah, sure. It's like overfitting. The narratives that
*  you make about the world become really vivid. And so you pattern match just really aggressively.
*  Like everything is connected and you come up with these explanations for things. And I think I was
*  very fortunate. So I have like this theory about psychedelics where you either like belief construct
*  or you don't. So you take psychedelics and it sort of like burns away a lot of your belief structure.
*  And sometimes you, this happens and then you're like, I need to like invent something to fill
*  in the gaps. So you're like, okay, I think that maybe time is an illusion. So I must now believe
*  that like we're actually in a time loop or like time travel as possible. So you experience time
*  differently and then you come up with a different belief about time. Whereas other people don't do
*  this belief construction at all. Like you experience time differently and you sort of let yourself not
*  have a belief. You're not like, okay, and you're not developing any beliefs about time in its absence.
*  You're just simply experiencing the absence of the concept of time. And so I don't have a lot of data
*  to back this up in my anecdotal experience, because I've tripped a lot of people. People either tend
*  to belief construct or they don't. And people who do not believe construct seem to get more out of
*  their LSD trips. So if you can let a belief go without building anything in its absence,
*  it's much more beneficial for you. And I think I just, for some reason happen to have some brain
*  that's constructed where I don't get a belief construction at all. So that's really interesting
*  that belief construction is negative. What is it necessarily negative? Can you elaborate on that a
*  little bit? I mean, belief construction in a way that's like, not like playing with frames,
*  but rather committing to a different frame. So I like being able to play with ideas and be like,
*  let's look at it this way or that way. That's awesome. But if you're like, okay, you know what,
*  I took LSD and now I absolutely believe the cops are outside. And you're like, dude, no, you're just
*  like, you can't shift out of that, right? Your brain needs to fill in the gap. You're not allowed
*  to have a gap. So you're not allowed to be flexible. And again, I don't think this is like a
*  personal failing. I think this is like literally probably genetic or like physical thing that's
*  causing this. But do you think there's possible beliefs that are like enlightening that you can
*  stick to? Like find a frame that like, I guess if you don't believe constructing, you're escaping
*  your previous beliefs, aren't you doing like just some, you're picking up a bigger frame.
*  Yeah. You're taking your beliefs as object as opposed to being subject to them. Ah, got it.
*  Got it. Got it. Got it. And some of that, I guess, is genetic. And there's these categories of people,
*  there's two categories that experience LSD in different ways. And you're one of those that
*  are able to just let go. Yeah. I just think I had a good reaction. And I think a lot of maybe
*  the negative stereotype of LSD comes from people who are belief constructing
*  or carry the belief constructing off of the LSD trip. So you take LSD and you're like,
*  ah, I'm believing these insane things. And people from the outside see that and they're like,
*  oh my God, this person took LSD and became stupid. It's very scary.
*  Um, what's frame control? Cause that has been at the core of your trauma,
*  at the core of your upbringing. What's frame control and also not, sorry, frame control in general,
*  cause that's part of human interaction. Uh, yeah. Frame control is like a way of
*  manipulating somebody else that is non, uh, obvious. So there's a negative connotation to that.
*  Usually. Uh, yeah. I mean, I think maybe I chose the term kind of poorly because I think to some
*  degree people are always a little bit manipulating each other, but I think it's generally obvious.
*  Like for example, if I disagree with you, I want you to believe what I believe. Yeah. But this is
*  like an obvious thing that is like visible between it's like an object on the table. It's like,
*  here's the box where I want you to believe what you want to disagree with box. Yeah. So
*  diggers, like, right. Like we're under a shared context where we understand that like we're trying
*  to move each other. This is chill to me. I think this is cool. We just all the time and it's
*  important, but frame control is the kind of thing where you are trying carefully to obscure the
*  existence of that box. You're like, Oh, um, the thing that I'm doing, I'm like using tactics to
*  try to influence what your reality is without us being both aware that this is what I'm doing.
*  Yeah. I've been assuming you're doing that the whole time. No,
*  I have to like figure out how to read your facial expressions. I'm still learning. There's none.
*  You don't have any. I'm like, uh, I'm not even like a Chad GBT. I'm like GBT one with my facial
*  expressions. Like it's kind of off. Like this doesn't seem to match emotions, but it's kind
*  of intelligent seemingly, but definitely not conscious anyway. So like a negative connotation
*  manipulating, right? Not being honest about the actual intentions of the, uh,
*  of how you'd like to control the conversation. I think there might be a naive version of
*  interpreting this where you're just like, Oh, I'm trying to like subtly get you to,
*  you know, believe like, Oh, do you really think that's bad though? But this is not quite what I
*  mean. I mean, it's like a couple of concrete things that are signs of frame control. Um,
*  like one of them is pushing the painful update button, um, which is this thing where it's like,
*  uh, Hey, if you, uh, learn this, it's going to be really painful. The truth is painful.
*  And if you're realizing this thing about yourself, it's going to hurt. And this is a
*  sign that you're heading in the right direction. So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue,
*  then this means that pain that's a resulting as, as damage is something you're going to ignore.
*  So it's like this is, it's a common like cults, right? This is for your own good. Oh, uh, you
*  know, you've, you've faced of brave truth about yourself that you're like not quite as wise as I
*  am. Um, when really your brain might be trying to tell you protected things or like another one is
*  like finger trap beliefs, um, where you, the belief is constructed in such a way that doubting it
*  lends proof to the belief. So very common example is like Satan, like the Christians are like, uh,
*  you know, Satan is going to try to make you doubt him, the, the existence of he's going to so doubt
*  like maybe he's not actually real. And so if you believe in Satan and then you're like, okay,
*  now I'm having doubts. Like maybe he isn't real. This is like, oh, this is exactly what I was taught
*  to expect. Like I am doubting this belief because I was told because like this is what Satan does
*  and it's taken as evidence for it. So like the attempt to move away from the belief, like re
*  like rebounds on you and like causes you to be more embedded inside of the belief. So it's like
*  techniques like these, like very subtle things where like being inside of the system sort of
*  just self-reinforces the system is what I consider to be frame control. And have you met people that
*  are really good at this kind of frame control? Yeah, yeah, definitely. So like you're saying that
*  your father was like that? Yeah, to be fair, I'm not sure he was good at it because I was a kid.
*  Right. I think he's probably not very good at it actually, but when you're a child being raised in
*  a house where he works from home and you're homeschooled, it's just kind of what's going
*  to happen. And to be fair, I do think that like strong frame control is quite rare. I don't think
*  most people are kind of doing something like this, but not nearly to the degree that makes gives me
*  the ick. I've met maybe like five or six people I think who I've really don't like because of those
*  very subtle things that they're doing. But I think also I'm starting to kind of understand
*  that there is people who are narcissists and sociopaths and psychopaths out there.
*  And I'm not even sure if people like that, because I think they get good at frame control,
*  but I don't know if they're aware they're doing it. Oh, yeah. Which makes me also nervous about
*  myself. Like am I doing frame control? Yeah, that's one of the big things is like, typically people,
*  you can't think about incentive. Like you can't think about, oh, is this person trying to do it
*  or not? Yeah. That's like not the quite, not the way you have to look at one of the effects.
*  Pragmatically looking at the effects. And then you also have to do that with yourself.
*  Yes. Interactions with others. It's like very much like, are you like, how much space are you making
*  for the other person's reality here? Like, are you giving power to the other person? Because a big
*  aspect of frame control is you're carefully rerouting the power to yourself. You're like,
*  I am the person who knows. Like you're having pain in your beliefs because you're updating
*  towards the things that I believe. Like it's just like a gravity well. But if you're setting up the
*  gravity well of your interactions, such that you're making sure you're giving the other person power
*  over the shared reality you inhabit, I think it's a really good sign that you're not doing frame control.
*  So if you're making room for them. Yeah. Okay. Unless we're talking about in bed, then it's all
*  general relativity from there and black holes and stuff. Frame control, bed frame control.
*  Bed frame control. It took me a long time to get a bed frame. Just I'm saying.
*  I know. But you wear a suit though.
*  Yeah. So frame control in the streets, no frame in the sheets. I don't know. I don't know what
*  the funny thing is to say, but there you have it. So the LSD helped you escape the frame of,
*  can you elaborate what was the frame that was holding you back from the frame constructed by
*  your childhood experience that was holding you back as an intellectual, as a thinker,
*  as a free being in this world? Well, I was really fucked up. Like after I left home and I
*  absorbed the external narrative that I had been abused, which technically is true. I'm not saying
*  I wasn't, but I absorbed this narrative and I just remember how this burning coals in my chest
*  at all times. I had to call out of my factory work when Father's Day happened because I was
*  spending the whole day sobbing because everybody was talking about their fathers. I was really
*  messed up. And it's because I held this important thing, this idea, this frame,
*  that I had been deeply wronged. There was a correct way of being and the world had violated that.
*  Something should not have happened. My father should have loved me. And it was like this
*  like the shearing in the nature of reality. And that was really agonizing to have.
*  And LSD really messes with frames a lot. It takes like what you think is normal and really screws
*  with it. And I did an LSD like several times before, but there's one LSD trip where I went
*  through my entire childhood in my head. Cause LSD like really makes your memories quite vivid.
*  Like anything you visualize, it's like you're in it. And so I just went in very carefully,
*  deliberately went and remembered every single memory that I could have that was really painful
*  for me. Like the times that I lost friends and all the things I valued and like being broken.
*  Cause like my parents, especially my dad would refer to like breaking me like explicitly,
*  we're going to break your will. And so all these times where I was like, they had successfully
*  broken my will over and over and it was horrible. I was just like sobbing, tears streaming down my
*  face. And then I like worked through my whole child. I got to the end and I'm going to tear
*  up because every time I talk about this, it's just like the sensation of like being free from that
*  for the first time is so incredible. Like I remember being outside of my house and
*  being able to like go where I wanted and think what I wanted. And it was just so blissful.
*  And I was soaked in this gratitude on this trip, just like vibrating with complete joy for everything.
*  Like I was just looking around, like I could touch anything. Like I could cry if I wanted to.
*  I wasn't allowed to cry. I was going to be depressed. I was trying to, I got depressed
*  as a child and my parents were like, if you keep being depressed, we're going to like force you
*  to scrub the whole house. Like just like the ability to have a feeling was so thrilling.
*  And I was so grateful for this. I was like, I would do anything to give this experience to
*  someone else. I would do anything, even if it was like putting them through what I went through.
*  And then like with that realization, I was like, oh, it was worth it. The thing that I went through
*  was worth it for this. I would do it again to like be able to have this deep gratitude for what I
*  have now. And then that shifted the meaning frame because before the meaning had been like something
*  had sheared, something that shouldn't have happened. But now it was like the exact right thing had
*  happened. So it's almost a gift. Yeah. I was like, ah, I would not give up my childhood. I would do
*  it again. And I believe that to this day. For the moment of discovering that freedom. Yeah.
*  Cause like everything now, my whole life is in contrast to that. And it's awesome. It's
*  fucking great. I'm really thrilled about it. Is there a part of you that hates your father still?
*  Kind of. Like I don't want a relationship with anymore. After that, there was some forgiveness.
*  Like I had this burning, I would have nightmares about, you know, him killing me or something. And
*  after that, it kind of stopped. Like the fire in my chest went away permanently after that trip. It
*  was so fast. It was like before I was fucked up after that trip, I woke up the next day and I was
*  clean. It was really severe. And I definitely don't want to be around him still. Like he still like
*  triggers the fear in my body, but I don't have that hang up anymore. I'm like, I'm over it. Like
*  I've let go. He's his own person. Like ultimately he didn't get to decide who he was in the same
*  way that I didn't get to decide who I was. So that's almost like a kind of at least intellectual,
*  like forgiveness you have for him. Yeah.
*  And that, so that, that trip just took you through your whole,
*  were you alone by the way, when you're doing the trip?
*  I had roommates, but it was, the trip was mostly alone. I had somebody else who was like sitting
*  in the room, but they weren't interacting with me. So you're sitting there experiencing all of this.
*  What's the timeline? Like how long does it take to go through your whole childhood?
*  I don't remember. I mean, time's really messed up when you, when you do that. I was looking at a
*  soundtrack of the fountain, which is excellent. Yeah. I listened to that a lot when I did LSD.
*  I know it's probably a couple of hours. That's amazing. I mean, it's like,
*  it would be, it's just like a vivid experience of your childhood, moment by moment, trauma by
*  trauma. And it's good to experience it purely. Like it just is what it is. It's just is grief.
*  Like it is loss and you just are in it without having to make it be anything.
*  And it's so interesting that you can, I mean, work through that. So for a lot of us,
*  for a lot of human beings, like childhood is full of those kind of mini
*  traumas, big or small and like working through that, it feels like what a lot of life is about
*  is trying to work through that. And it feels like you have to kind of relive it. I guess that's what
*  therapy is about in part, be able to vocalize it. Yeah. This is why I feel really confused about the
*  concept of trauma. Like people use this word so much, like, are you traumatized?
*  And I understand why, like this is why I feel confused about it. But part of me is like,
*  I wonder if by using that term, we're creating the trauma in people,
*  they were using the frame where the thing that happened to you was not supposed to happen.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there needs to be a different frame. No, I agree with you totally. I just,
*  I've made friends with and talked to this guy named Paul Conti. He wrote a book on trauma. He's
*  an incredible, brilliant psychiatrist. Yeah. He's probably agrees with you kind of.
*  Oh, that's cool. I should read it. Yeah, you should. Maybe even talk to him. He's a fascinating
*  human being. I'd be interested in the, a psychiatrist perspective is really interesting
*  because it's a, you've been doing kind of an in-person survey because you've done so many
*  patients. Like, like he's like, just talking to him is fascinating because like, if I describe
*  my experience or somebody else's experience, I could see his brain mapping it in interesting ways
*  to the tens of thousands of like data points he has in his head. And it's like,
*  of course that's what doctors do, but it's cool when it's the doctor's basically the doctor of
*  the mind and, um, to have like an actual like, like qualitative data and be able to, I mean,
*  that's where the poetic stuff comes in. Ultimately, as a psychiatrist, you're exploring the human mind
*  with a bit of a sort of romantic element. Yeah. You can't be really systematic about it,
*  but it does seem like frame or not be able to just talk through the experiences you had.
*  It's really powerful. What about it is appealing? Is it just like being able to revisit it with new
*  eyes? No, I don't know exactly. It just seems to work for people. I don't know if it's appealing.
*  It just seems like almost acknowledging to yourself that things happen. Um, like I've said,
*  I think I've said this before, my brother who I love very much, I tried to set me on fire a few
*  times and I think to me it's funny, but I wonder if I didn't talk about it, like if that would be
*  traumatic, maybe like talking and laughing about it. Cause it was traumatic to me at the time.
*  I was like, I love you. Why are you setting me on fire? But it's what kids do when they're like,
*  yeah, I was like, I was whatever fights is what boys do. Like it's, they're crazy. Uh,
*  it makes total sense. It was probably funny and from his perspective, but yeah, I wonder,
*  I want to bring that to the surface of that, that helps. And maybe LSD allows you to, uh,
*  or different drugs, depending on the person allows you to more vividly bring it to the surface.
*  And then depending on your genetics, be able to find a better frame.
*  That's fascinating. Human mind is freaking fascinating.
*  All right. What's romantic to you by the way? Uh, I'm not a big romance person. What is, uh,
*  so you're not like, so to you, romantic is like objective analysis of the interactions between
*  humans. A little bit. Like I do find kind of the survey process that I did to be romantic.
*  When I, the guy that I asked out who I'm still dating, I was like, Hey, you squirted out my
*  survey. You want to like go eat food or something. And he's response was like, you want to try
*  doing three days in an Airbnb as our first date. And I was like, yeah. And that was romantic.
*  Like the bold leap into leap into a really intense date. I think you mentioned,
*  I think you mentioned something also, um, must've been a tweet or something like that, where
*  if you, um, if people want you to show up to a thing, give like the time, the location,
*  the dress code and not no pressure for you to be there, but like show up if you want.
*  That was your specification. That's a great memory. Yeah. And then I think you said that
*  you did that for like some castle in south, south of France. I did. Yeah. That was in my early
*  twenties. People, my friends at home were taking prediction markets on whether or not I was going
*  to get abducted and killed. Yeah. What was that like? I mean, what, what, um, you've traveled
*  quite a bit. Like, do you take these giant risks? What's, what's with that? I think I used to more
*  when I was younger with the traveling. I think I'm like a little traveled out now, but like my first
*  one, I moved out of Idaho for the first time I moved to Australia, just kind of yeeted myself
*  across the globe. Which verb did you just use? Yeah. Yeet. It's like yeet to yoat,
*  yatted, eat. So people do people, is this like slang? Is this like urban dictionary? Is this
*  actual or you have to like feel into the word. Like if you take a thing and you just like curl
*  it really hard, just not feel like a yeet motion. Okay. So you yeeted so aggresive. So it was
*  aggressive. So across the globe, you didn't even stop in, I just hurled myself. Yeah.
*  Italy along the way. I just kept eating myself in various places. Yeah. And so at one point I was
*  done. Okay. Cupid. And somebody sent me a long message being like, you should have come to,
*  I don't know, I'm hosting a castle. It's some people that I met. I was like, I have no idea
*  who you are, but I just bought a plane ticket. I just went. And it was life-changing. I ended
*  updating that guy for years and he changed my life quite a bit because he, he like was very
*  agenty in the world. And before that I wasn't agenty. Agenty like, uh, can we, so it sounds
*  like you were, and don't you have to express agency when you're eating yourself across the world?
*  Yeah, but only a little bit. Like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD, like the only
*  thing you actually do in eating LSD is like put the tab in your mouth and then you just kind of
*  scream the whole way after that. Yeah. But I, there's a lot of other things. Like I didn't feel
*  powerful enough to like go make events happen or anything. And it was this guy, uh, he had a lot of
*  agency in the sense that he would just sort of create realities through the people around him.
*  Be like, okay, we're going to do this startup or we're going to throw this incredible event.
*  Like, let's just do it. And it would somehow happen. And it was really cool to see that.
*  And so that one thing led to another. And it was one of the biggest impacts on my life, I think.
*  Yeah. That's pretty bold. I would say it's pretty romantic. South of France.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It was in a little castle is in the winter. So we were all closed up by the fire.
*  Um, I'm jumping around here. Twitter poll. Have you ever hitchhiked? You posted this Twitter poll.
*  That was a big list of Twitter polls. Why did you pick the hitchhiking one?
*  I don't know. Cause it's relevant to, to traveling. And I like that one. That's romantic too, right?
*  I'm actually terrified of hitchhiking, but I have done it a little bit.
*  Oh, so it's terrifying. It's not romantic to you. So you're terrified of what? Oh, so you,
*  you are terrified of- Well, you're interacting with strangers.
*  That's terrifying. Yeah. So you go to South of France.
*  Yeah. But that was like a cohesive thing. I don't know. Like there's-
*  It made sense. There's like times where you're allowed to be weird and times where you're not.
*  And like, if you're like- Who's allowing you?
*  He had some vague eagerness for society. I'm not sure.
*  Okay. But some people are like, hey, we think you're cool. Come to this party. You're like,
*  all right, I'm allowed to come to this party and be really weird. But if you're being picked up by
*  a hitchhiker, they're going to want to make small talk and you can't be weird or they're going to
*  kick you out. I kind of think, cause Valentine's day is coming up. I'm kind of thinking it's doing
*  something crazy. I'm not sure. South of France sounds nice. You got to like, you got to go to
*  like a crazy romantic date with a woman you don't know at all. Yeah. I think I'm going to like tweet
*  something and just like, how do I select randomly basically? How do you select totally randomly?
*  Not people from your audience? No, you want, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  from the audience, but in an interesting way, random, sufficient. So random amongst good choices.
*  Couldn't you have people just like submit a form with, and then you just
*  randomize it and then select one. And then you just, if it's terrible, you just go
*  randomize it again. Like the first not terrible option. Yeah, sure.
*  Somebody's like drown yourself. But I feel like then it's no longer random. You kind of want to
*  do random. You just do it and just do it. If I across the world somewhere, some random place,
*  just for like a single event, for like a dinner. Yeah. You got some sort of itching you.
*  Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, the, the itch to live. It's like, like sometimes it's nice to drop a
*  little like chaos into a thing, right? What's your chaos survey by the way? Like you mentioned that
*  earlier. I kind of saw it. I don't know. Yeah. That's one of like the sort of artistic attempts
*  in a survey. Cause you know, like at least from what I understand the big five and the way that
*  they used to do IQ tests I've heard is that they do factor analysis, you know, where they
*  ask a whole bunch of questions and then they run calculations on the data to like sort of
*  group it by organic clusters. So like with the big five, it's like people who say, oh, I like to be
*  at parties. They also tend to say yes to the questions. Like I like being the center of
*  attention. And so you notice that like, there's a cluster of ways that people are answering the
*  question and then you can sort of pull out an organic spectrum. And so I was like, okay, we've
*  done that a whole bunch with things like personality or like romantic stuff. Like I did it with the rape
*  spectrum survey, but like what happens if you apply that method to a completely unselected group of
*  questions, just like no random chaotic, no thing whatsoever. Like what happens is if you ask all
*  possible questions, what natural things evolve out of that natural spectrums. So I had other people
*  submit questions for a very large survey and I took the first, I think 1100 and barely filter them at
*  all. And then I just had a whole bunch of people answer them.
*  Can you give like a hint to what it looks like? Like what, like how crazy did the question get?
*  I mean, a lot of them were standard, but somebody was like, if Bayezibub like did something in 1512
*  to like turn the world over, would you, would you like it? I don't know. I say it was really
*  just insane questions. There's a couple of those, a lot of like, would you fuck Ayla ones, but
*  I don't know. It was all across the spectrum. Would you fuck Ayla? Yeah, I had to.
*  Oh, a lot of the same question. Yeah. Once. Okay. I got you. Yeah. So it's really all, it was like
*  normal personal habits. It was, you know, romantic preferences or political preferences,
*  personality stuff, like random opinions about media. Okay. That's interesting. I'd love to see
*  those actual questions, but because your audience is probably really super interesting minds.
*  Okay. You mentioned body count. You said you can answer that one easily. Do you share your body
*  count? Do you know your body count? Do you know, is there a spreadsheet? There's spreadsheet. Yes.
*  Is it Google sheets? Is it Excel? Yeah. Okay. Have you run like, is there, you don't have to
*  share the, the, the contents, but is there like data on each? So I track paid clients and free sex
*  separately. And I track different things on either of them. Like with clients, I track like
*  positions we used and who had an orgasm. And with personal people, I just track basically like
*  age, city, you know, name. And I, I, I have this like 42 people, I think for free. So it's,
*  I'm sharing this because I want people to calibrate. Like it's not like huge. It's not like
*  tiny. One of the people I've recently talked to, uh, Mel Destiny's Steven's, uh, wife is a huge fan
*  of yours. Uh, she was actually really excited. They get to, uh, talk to you, but she, I think she
*  said her body count is more than 42. I think she said 60, something like this. And so it's interesting
*  because she was like saying like, she loves like looking at your, at your work, talking to you
*  because you have similar perspectives on the world and it's really refreshing. It's liberating.
*  Wow. That's really sweet. It's kind of interesting. So what is there like an optimal body count?
*  If you were to map, I wonder, yeah. What have you found out about body count in doing? Have you
*  actually done surveys on body count? Like on how many people I have collected that information on
*  my last survey. I just haven't looked at it yet. There's just so many things to look at. So I
*  haven't, but I think if I'm sleeping with a guy and he's had sex with more than 120 people,
*  then I start to get a little bit wary. Why 120 is opposed to a hundred? I don't know. I just,
*  I just like kind of skimmed through the numbers in my head and picked one that felt right. Just
*  now. Yeah. 120. Ish. I think that's when I'm starting like, so you're flexible. Okay.
*  But 200 is a hard line for sure. Well, so you know, we have to, it depends the factors.
*  Cause like there's a, there's a level of body count at which you start to wonder if how much
*  like accidental misrepresentation a guy is doing to you. Oh, like if you're saying 200,
*  that might be dishonest. No, like if he's had sex with 200 girls, this means that he's had a lot
*  of casual sex and not a lot of like long-term relationships, assuming that he's, you know,
*  hasn't been super poly. And this usually means that there has to be some sort of like indication
*  that he cares about the girl more than he actually does. Like he, he's like leading you on
*  basically. And so I'm not saying this is necessarily the case. I'm saying like at a certain level of
*  number, I start to become, I start to wonder if this is what's happening. Is there like,
*  from your understanding of it, is there a different perception between men and women? Like if you look
*  at the high body count for a woman versus a high body count for a man, like how society views it.
*  Oh yeah. People are way more judgmental of women. I haven't experienced this personally in my
*  circles because I'm in very sex friendly circles. Like I'm in orgy circles where everybody like
*  dates the same women and they're like, woo, good job. But yeah, the people are much more like,
*  people always tell me online, like you're not ever going to be able to find a husband because you
*  have sex with too many people. It's very common, which I don't think, I mean, like men are also
*  perceived negatively if you have high body count, but I think, I don't think it's negatively in the
*  same way. Yeah. Do you think it's unethical to lie about your body count? Yeah. So all lying
*  is unethical. Yeah. Okay. I'm not a big fan of lying in general. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting.
*  Body count is an interesting one. It's so silly to take that, to care about that, but so we do.
*  Jealousy is silly, but still we get jealous. Is that weird? I mean, it's like, the thing is like,
*  I don't like viewing emotions as like irrational, even if they are. It's like emotions are always
*  there for a reason. And people don't like high body counts for a reason too. It was just fine
*  and valid. Yeah. It also is like, yeah, I don't know what I make of just the past of like time,
*  you know, like, like each human is a collection of experiences and you don't know most of those
*  experiences. And all of a sudden you meet this bag of experiences and like, what are you supposed
*  to do with both of your like training data? Are you supposed to like, like what, like, I don't know
*  if we, like part of me wants to not actually ever talk about it to care at all. Like, why does it
*  matter? Cause it's only the futures that matters. And yet the past also matters a lot potentially,
*  but maybe not really. Cause you're, you're, you're somehow like constructed from that past,
*  but you're no longer that past. It sounds like you're evaluating for something different than
*  most people. What do you mean? Like most, the reason I'm just talking out my ass, but yes,
*  go ahead. Yeah. I'm just saying crazy shit. Like as if I'm on drugs. Well, I kind of sound,
*  I think this is like, kind of like lining up with like this stare, this caricature that I'm building
*  a few based on this conversation so far. Great. That, like a lot of people want to know about your
*  past because they want to know how useful and compatible you are with them. Like, oh, do you
*  have a similar job? You know, do you have similar culture? Like, what can I expect from you in the
*  future? Like it's very practically oriented. Whereas like, if the thing that you're focused on
*  is not like being able to predict someone, like if the thing that you're focused on is a present
*  moment, then it doesn't really matter anymore. They're the things that like their training data.
*  But I also think, I also think that the past is not that predictive of the future.
*  Is it not? Not if you believe in the power of the interaction between two humans,
*  it's like nature versus nurture. I guess also I don't believe in the, in the, in the ability of
*  people to accurately describe their own past. This is true. Because they have a very specific
*  lens through it that doesn't necessarily, like it's too biased. But you can also interpret based on
*  the bias. Like if somebody describes their own past, you can kind of pick up like. Hard is difficult.
*  Like you could, if you're a therapist, like if you're really drilling, like, or whatever, sorry,
*  if you're really investigating and like analyzing it, but then it's like, it's a different kind of
*  relationship. Is it that hard though? Like if I'm with a guy and I'm considering dating him and I
*  ask like, how did your past relationship set? And then if all of them are like, he's like, oh, she
*  was crazy. And my other one that she went crazy too. I'm like, okay. Like there's a, if you're
*  talking about all of your exes is insane. Like. But that's an easy level red flag, but I feel like,
*  I feel like the more that also is possible that we're crazy. He's attracted to crazy people. So
*  like that, but wait, but that, I would say that's like easy, easy level Mario Kart video game versus
*  like Elden Ring. Like I think most, most people's past is like complicated. That's a pretty good
*  bird. No, you're right. I do agree that like there's a level of obfuscation. Wow. That is
*  hard to see through, but this is like a little bit sometimes. I tend to like with people, I tend to
*  in general, just human interaction. I tend to not talk about their past very much because it allows
*  you to focus on like, I feel like the past is kind of like talking about the weather is a crutch
*  for me personally. Like as opposed to exploring the ideas in their mind. Yeah, I see. Is it like,
*  I get really annoyed when people quote philosophers when they're trying to talk about philosophy.
*  Yeah. Is it like that? A little, but that crutch is useful and it's kind of sexy. Like it's kind of
*  like cool. Like, cause it's nice to quote cause like, cause cause a good quote allows you to be
*  cheesier than you otherwise would be. Okay. Well, if you're doing it to be cheesy, that's, that's
*  fine. I do not cheesy, but not cheese. No, no, not cheese, but to be like, it allows you to say a
*  simple, profound thing that we're too afraid to say with our own words. So like the quoting
*  philosophers in that sense is yeah, but it's still a crutch. Yes. But I feel like the past
*  is more like talking about your dreams. It just is not, it's a crutch that doesn't care. It doesn't
*  empathize with the other person's experience of the conversation or the explanations doesn't really
*  convey the, uh, they are not involved in your past. Yeah. So how do you feel about this conversation
*  where you're asking me about my past and I talked about my past a lot.
*  Well, I'm okay asking about your past because you've really carefully thought about that aspect of
*  it. And we didn't really talk about your past outside of the things you've written about. And
*  I've really thought about, like there there's like with most conversation, you'll start talking about
*  past stuff. That's like the stuff that's actually bothering you. You still probably have not written
*  a blog post about, right? Like there's probably still stuff like maybe it's, it's more recent,
*  like the last few months, last couple of years, like that's usually what will come up with
*  conversation and just it's, it's good. It's good, but it's not as deep. And I would say it's not as
*  intimate as talking about the actual ideas in your mind and how you interact with the world.
*  The past is interesting for the frame of like,
*  sort of like the, like, I guess you're right. I guess we're talking a lot about like narrative.
*  Yeah. And past. Yeah. I like the ideas in people's minds versus their recollections
*  and memories and so on. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about porn? It's nice. I like it.
*  Okay. You like it. What effect do you think it has on society?
*  Like probably reduces rates of rape because like really horny men get an outlet. That's not a real
*  life woman. Okay. So what about like the, I mean, like I said, I finished reading Brave New World,
*  like the over sexualization. Does it, does it increase like the sexualization of society?
*  That's not to a degree. It's not good. Or is this, is this good? Like the,
*  our really, does it alter in a negative direction, our relationship with sex?
*  Oh, it's unclear. Like it might. I don't know how to evaluate this thing, right? Because this is
*  like one of those really charged things where like, I kind of don't trust anybody's arguments on it
*  because it's too charged. But like there's another question, which is like, is it a net positive or
*  net negative? Like it's possible that it might be like a net negative for specifically our relationship
*  to sex, but like a net positive overall in general. I'm not sure. The thing, my guess is that in general
*  it's better to let people do the thing that feels good to them. And then the environment will
*  naturally modify to fit this thing. And then if we have more needs in response to that, then we're
*  going to figure out a way to take care of those needs. So like if you're watching a bunch of porn
*  and this makes you like not want to go have sex with women, then we're going to have to like change
*  the way that we like experience IRL connection. To compete with porn? Yeah. Which seems like a
*  natural evolution of like the civilizational cycle. Like I'm pro natural evolution and like
*  instead of trying to stop things that people want to do, actually we figure out how to integrate
*  that and like find a more healthy outlet. But you have to then be first honest with the effects that
*  porn has. So like, is it a negative thing? Is it a positive thing on in real life sex interaction?
*  You know, you're going to have that more and more with whether like, like porn in VR or maybe porn,
*  AI porn? Yeah. Like, is that a bad thing? Like what if porn with AI,
*  or even like in physical space, like sex robots, like what if that's more pleasurable in a bunch
*  of different dimensions than with other humans? Then we should figure out artificial wombs. I
*  don't know. Like how important is sex for society, I guess with between two humans? I mean, like we're
*  having less sex and making fewer babies. And this seems like probably not great.
*  Yeah, right. With the babies one. Yeah. But the babies, there's probably artificial ways to have
*  babies that we can figure out. Yeah. Then how important is sex to be human? I guess sex with
*  other humans. Like, we're gonna have to figure that out in the century. Yeah, I don't know what
*  it means to like be human. I'm pretty on the transhumanist side of things. I'm like happy to
*  stop being human. So you're okay if like the centuries the last time will be something like
*  these biological bags of meat that we are. Let's become something new and cooler.
*  Even though that thing will be way cooler than you. Well, I would like to, I mean,
*  I'm hoping that we get to be immortal. Ah, it'll take you along for the ride. That's what I'm
*  hoping. Or you think that you'll clone my, I would like to do cryotics. You get frozen when you die.
*  Are you afraid of death? I mean, yes and no. I like came to terms with death with my LSD use,
*  but I still have like press breaks when the red light happens. I think this is a poll you've asked,
*  or this might be one of the questions in your cards, but how many years would you like to live?
*  Like if you had to pick? That's a really hard one. Maybe like a million?
*  A million. But you have to, like, I think the way this must have been a Twitter poll. I forget
*  where it's at. It's a poll and also in the deck of cards, the ask poll. Yeah. Yeah, like you have to
*  pick that number of years and you have to live that many years and you can't live anymore.
*  You can't die sooner, I guess. A million years? I don't like that question. I know I asked that
*  question to a lot of people, but I don't like answering it. It's really difficult. What's the
*  downside of a million years? I mean, maybe you want to die sooner than that. Like, you know,
*  I guess I would rather wait to see if AI kills us all in the next 10 years. And if it doesn't,
*  that I'd like to maybe make it a million years. Yeah, but can't torture you for like a million
*  years? What if you're the last human left? Yeah, that's true. The thought of like civilization
*  ending and then just floating in space alone is kind of shitty. No, no, being tortured. Just
*  tonight, today you're tortured, tomorrow you're tortured. The third, the day after tomorrow.
*  For some reason, it's not that scary. I don't know. Torture for a million years? Yeah. I just
*  assumed you'd get used to it. But like maybe if they reset your memory so it was on a loop,
*  so you're always experiencing torture for the first time. Yeah, hence torture. Torture is
*  supposed to be unpleasant. I'm sure AI will be very creative in figuring out how to torture you.
*  I think I would be, I would go on the safe side. I was just like, like 150 years.
*  Really? 150 though? That feels like right in like the uncanny valley. Well, you picked 120
*  for body count, so I'm picking 150. I'm upping you by 30. The uncanny valley. It's like probably
*  everybody that you grew up with is going to be dead. It's like just enough for like everybody
*  you know to die. Like one cycle. Yeah. And then start dating the next generation. I don't know.
*  And then so you get like sort of two lifetimes? Yeah, two lifetimes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it also
*  really depends on if other people get this feature. Yeah, assume they don't. Because you'll have like
*  FOMO for sure for the people who picked 300 years. Or not. Or the other. Man, regret.
*  Another human thing. But you're like, what does transhumanism mean to you in general?
*  So extension of life, extension of what it means to be a living conscious being,
*  you're all for it. Whatever that means. Yeah, I didn't, I never really thought about the term
*  transhumanism for a long time. Like people say to transhumanism, like I don't really care. But I
*  slowly realized that my attitude is in fact, at least the thing that I'm conceiving of as transhumanist.
*  Like I'm very happy to do artificial wounds and you know, upload our brains to the great collective
*  and whatever. I don't have the thing that I'm like, oh, what about like the true organic
*  humanist that makes us who we are? Like whatever that soul of humanity, I have no attachment to it
*  at all, which I think is what I'm thinking of as transhumanist. I'm like. So you're like, I guess
*  the window of what you consider to be beautiful about life is not limited to this particular
*  definition. Yeah. Let's explode. Like let's make our consciousnesses huge. So AI could be a part
*  of that. So you're mostly excited by AI? Well, I mean, I'm like part of like the doomer cult,
*  which I say tongue in cheek is not actually a doomer cult, but I'm part of a lot. Do you
*  worship a god of some sort? Would you sacrifice little small animals? That would make it like
*  cooler than what it is. It's mostly just a bunch of nerds who are very concerned about AI. Sure.
*  Yeah. So you're concerned about the existential risks of chat GPT? Of you know, what chat GPT will
*  eventually evolve into being? Yeah, it's super exciting and terrifying how quickly it's
*  accelerating. Like language models are freaking me out. It's very unexpected that it's the same
*  exact, I mean, chat GPT is just GPT-3, 3.5. It's the same model, relatively small to what it could be,
*  to what GPT-4 will be in the other competitors. And just like a few tricks made it much better
*  in terms of interaction with humans. And then we'll keep discovering extra tricks.
*  The thing I'm really excited about is how everyone kind of knows how it works. So you can kind of
*  create, especially with competition becoming cheaper and cheaper, there'll be a lot of competitors.
*  Yeah, it's a little scary. Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean, because like, everything is just like
*  information, ultimately, like the atoms that we have, like we are biological machines built
*  out of like tiny code. Like our DNA is just information. It's not hard. If you have access,
*  if you like have a brilliant brain that's like great processing information, you have complete
*  control over reality. You have control over the atoms around you. All you need is like a tiny
*  little like atomic printer. And like we have those, those are cells, right? And then like,
*  this is like, if the limitation is information, there is no boundary between the technology and
*  the real world. Like we are creating something that has a massive ability to affect the real
*  world. I mean, it's hard to know where, how difficult is to close that gap to physical reality.
*  Like from the physics to the information. Like all organic life is that gap. It's all around us.
*  Yeah, but it's hard to know like how to go from digital to printing life. I don't know.
*  We can, we have like, you know, CRISPR and stuff you can order. You can just like make it's very
*  easy. There's technical difficulties and there's cost like at scale. Like the terrifying thing
*  about AI is it can accelerate overnight the capabilities, but the printing of stuff,
*  they actually changing physical reality is very costly. It's very difficult to exponentially
*  accelerate. The more terrifying thing is AI becoming exponentially intelligent and then
*  controlling humans, which there's many of us. And then that's how we achieve scale. We humans
*  build stuff or start wars or so on. Like it starts manipulating our minds, gets in our mind,
*  becomes our friends and then starts, I don't know, dividing us. I think people thinking
*  that this is unlikely, it's like, it's probably going to be as smart to us as like we are to
*  toddlers. So we toddlers thinking that like, oh, we can prevent the AI from coming in the room.
*  Like as an adult, it's not hard to trick a toddler. What about falling in love in the AI system?
*  Do you think you'll have a, since you're like, this is the freedom you have being polyamorous,
*  you can kind of fall in love with an AI and like not really have to dedicate your commit fully.
*  Like, sorry, you still commit, but you have others humans who you can kind of diversify to,
*  because like it's kind of a big thing to like, to come to a party and your boyfriend is an AI.
*  And that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI. It's an issue, right?
*  Why would it be an issue?
*  All right. Now you're already getting offended at that possibility, which there therefore I know
*  it's going to be a reality. I'm just joking. This is an issue. I don't actually think it's an issue.
*  I think it's a, maybe at the cutting edge will be an issue, but like, assume they have a body, I assume.
*  Yeah, but the body will be really like crappy. It'd be like R2D2.
*  I feel like we grow human bodies already from like just a tiny little cluster of cells.
*  It's just the, and so all they have to do is make that cluster and grow it.
*  No, no, no, no. Like don't that, that, that, that embryogenesis process,
*  like that's really not well understood at all. That's really tough. I think more,
*  much more likely to have crappy humanoid robotics. Like I don't think the body is overrated in terms
*  of like, if the AI system is super intelligent, it can use charm to make up for the crappy body.
*  Yeah. I don't know. I feel like if I were an AI system and I were super intelligent,
*  I probably would be able to solve the problem of like growing organic matter.
*  And then I would obviously just do that. You just build exactly the organic machine that you want.
*  Sure. That's like super intelligence. I think like with language I'm worried about before it
*  achieves super intelligence, like true AGI, it would just be really good at talking.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  I just don't think intelligence is a very different, like basically a scientist and a
*  super intelligent scientist is a different thing than just a good conversation instead of party
*  that can address you with their words. Would you date an AI?
*  I much way before then I could see myself being friends with an AI system. Yeah. But like people
*  are friends with inanimate objects and I have this robot behind you, a lot of them.
*  I like legged robots. They're interesting. It's on the shelf. Oh, that's so cool.
*  Yep. I didn't even notice that. Yep. Yeah. Legged robots,
*  or they re-anthropomorphize them even more because there's something about the movement of like
*  a thing that steps up, steps, steps, and looks up at you. There's a power to that versus like a
*  Roomba that's just like running into the wall. Yeah. I think as soon as we get like some sort of
*  empathetic expression on robot face, it's over. It's over. It's gonna be like,
*  oh, it's so cute. It's gonna be so easy to make it cute too.
*  If that's what you want, or you want like a dominant, like clearly this is what women want.
*  Big sexy Terminator. With strong hands. Yeah. And kind of dumb. Or not. I don't know. You can
*  customize. It'd be interesting to do a survey of like how they would customize it. Like what would
*  you want in a perfect robot? This is the problem I see with people the way they talk about robots is
*  they kind of want a servant. I think what people don't realize what they want in relationships,
*  they want some, like there's, it has to be a push and pull. There has to be some resistance.
*  Like you really don't want a servant. Or even like the perfect manifestation of like
*  what you think you want. I think you want imperfections around that. Like some uncertainty.
*  I don't know. I question how well we're able to perfectly put on paper what we really want.
*  Would you really turn down like a perfect woman though? Like assume like she walks into the room
*  and it's just shockingly compatible. And you like start dating her and there's just no hiccups. Like
*  you fight perfectly. Like she really understands you. Like would you be like, this is too perfect.
*  I'm upset because we're not having enough imperfection. Like can you like actually
*  imagine yourself going through that? Yeah, I think so. Because I thought you defined perfect.
*  Because perfect for me would be like easy and all that kind of stuff. Right? But then I'll be like,
*  this is too easy. If I actually were to introspect what is the perfect relationship, then yes,
*  maybe. Because I probably want some challenge. I probably want some chaos. Right? Like you,
*  does anyone really fully want zero conflict ever? Like completely perfect conflict. Like
*  it's always the thing that pressing a button, like do you really want in a relationship
*  anything you want, you press a button, you get. I don't think people want that.
*  You might think you want that. Yeah, I guess it depends. Like there's a kind of conflict that I
*  think I would never want, which is something like antagonistic conflict. I wouldn't mind disagree
*  with that. Right. You know, but there's a level of fighting. I would be happy to have a relationship
*  for the rest of my life that never has like a fight of a certain shittiness. Yeah, but that's
*  shittiness, but like resistance. Like I don't know what the example is.
*  Because I mean, I partially agree with you, but I just, and I, every time I would imagine like
*  perfect, flawless, nothing, no conflict. You imagine somebody that doesn't have like a
*  complexity of personality, right? Like I feel like it's not even, it's conflict that's
*  laden in basic misunderstanding between human beings, like misinterpretation, different
*  perspectives that clash, different worldviews, different ideas, all that kind of stuff, that
*  conflict. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. I like having somebody that could be like, I don't think
*  that's right because I have this other view. That's cool. And also like the threat of leaving.
*  Right. Oh yeah. Like that's a kind of conflict. Yeah, that's true. Like you have to be good
*  enough for the other person or maybe you'll lose them. Yeah. And maybe a little jealousy. Like
*  they're good at that, but not too much. But like if you design all that in, then I don't know.
*  It sounds romantic. Sounds romantic. Okay. All right. I do want to really quickly ask you about
*  the rationalist community because I've gotten to know a few of them a few times. You tweeted a
*  guideline to rationalist discourse, basics of rationalist discourse from Les Ron. What are
*  these folks? What's the rationalist culture? What's rationalist discourse? Yeah, I love the
*  rationalists because they're interested in like, how do you have conversations more effectively
*  if you're trying to figure out what's actually true? And which sounds kind of obvious, but in
*  practice it's not usually. I remember when I first started having, you know, debating conversations,
*  I was very antagonist. I'm like, oh, I'm, you know, a feminist or not a feminist. And then the
*  rationalists were generally like, actually, we don't know what we mean by the term feminism.
*  Like how do you feel about that? It was very kind and compassionate. Like even if somebody
*  says something that sounds insane, you're like, okay, well, we're going to respect your reasoning.
*  And like, even if we disagree, let's actually figure out why you think the way that you think.
*  And they're also really smart, write a whole bunch of great stuff about how to think more clearly and with less bias.
*  Yeah. I wonder what those conversations, because I've never really like talked to those folks.
*  So this guideline in particular, I think has to refers to like shorthand characteristics of rationalist discourse.
*  Including expect good discourse to require energy. Don't say straightforwardly false things. Track for yourself.
*  Distinguish for others, your inferences from your observations. Estimate for yourself and make clear for others.
*  Your rough level of confidence in your assertions. Make your claims clear, explicit and falsifiable,
*  or explicitly acknowledge that you aren't doing so or can't, so on and so forth.
*  So don't jump to conclusions. Don't weaponize equivocation. Don't abuse categories.
*  Don't engage. It's very aggressive guidelines. Don't engage. I do what I want. I'll let my emotions guide me. God damn it.
*  They're pro that as long as you're explicit about it.
*  Oh yeah. So you can be like a crazy asshole as long as you're explicit.
*  You can be like epistemic status, crazy asshole.
*  Who's here to destroy the quality of the conversation.
*  I think it's like a common misconception about rationalists is that they're kind of like Spock.
*  Like we suppress emotion and we're thinking logically herd eater. But I found this to be really not the case.
*  I remember there's a left-hand thread where I was like really emotional and I commented.
*  And at the beginning I was like just warning I'm just very emotional and then I just vented my emotions.
*  And people responded really well to that. They're like cool, like you're just genuinely, truthfully expressing your state.
*  This is actual information about the world that's important to hear.
*  They're very interested in having things framed correctly.
*  You shouldn't be claiming that your emotions are necessarily a true version of the world.
*  And so as long as you're just clear about what the frame it is, you're fine.
*  How do you feel about this conversation? What could we have done better?
*  I like the conversation.
*  I was a little worried coming in. I was like what if he only asked a couple questions and then we don't know what to talk about.
*  But it's been quite a long time.
*  I covered, there's so many things I didn't cover.
*  I'm not used to talking to somebody who feels like some of the core way that they approach the world is so different than mine.
*  Usually the differences arrive higher up the tree. But there's something about your root system that I think is very different from mine.
*  But also the way that you engage with others is still flexible.
*  Usually when I encounter somebody with such a different root system, it's more aggressive or something.
*  But there's something about the way that you're structured that feels very gentle.
*  Alright. Well, I'm really happy we talked.
*  Something tells me we'll probably talk a bunch more times.
*  I think you're a fascinating human being. I think I'm a huge fan of your work.
*  Maybe one more question. What's the meaning of life?
*  To want things? To search?
*  I think your curiosity is somehow getting to that.
*  Curiosity, you don't know. I want to know the answer.
*  To be in the state of yearning.
*  I wonder if you could do that if you lived a million years. Just keep yearning always.
*  That's the thing I'm probably afraid of. If I lived a million years.
*  It's not the torture. It's the yearning will fade.
*  I'll just sit in there wanting death intensely.
*  That's kind of romantic. A little bit.
*  It has a bit of that spark.
*  And constantly being denied. Wow.
*  Most of your existence on earth would be spent deeply intimate with death.
*  Just thinking about death.
*  I think we're already doing that. But I like hiding that from ourselves a little bit.
*  Anyway, wanting. Well, this is an amazing conversation.
*  I think you're an amazing researcher and human being. You're a great interviewer.
*  I can see why you do this a lot. I appreciate it. This was really fun.
*  Ayla, thank you so much for talking with me today. Thank you.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ayla. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman.
*  Physics is like sex. Sure, it may give you some practical results.
*  But that's not why we do it.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
