# Barry Barish: Gravitational Waves and the Most Precise Device Ever Built | Lex Fridman Podcast #213
**Lex Fridman:** [August 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J48bm21q8_A)
*  The following is a conversation with Barry Barish, a theoretical physicist at Caltech
*  and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector
*  and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational
*  Wave Observatory, is probably the most precise measurement device ever built by humans.
*  It consists of two detectors with four kilometer long vacuum chambers situated 3,000 kilometers
*  apart, operating in unison to measure a motion that is 10,000 times smaller than the width of
*  a proton. It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science, a measurement of gravitational
*  waves caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events in the universe, occurring over tens of
*  millions of light years away. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the
*  description. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my conversation with Barry Barish.
*  You've mentioned that you were always curious about the physical world and that an early
*  question you remember stood out where you asked your dad, why does ice float on water?
*  He couldn't answer. This was very surprising to you. You went on to learn why. Maybe you can
*  speak to what are some early questions in math and physics that really sparked your curiosity?
*  That memory is something I used to illustrate something I think that's common in science,
*  people that do science somehow have maintained something that kids always have.
*  A small kid, eight years old or so, asks you so many questions usually typically that you
*  consider them pests, you tell them to stop asking so many questions.
*  Somehow our system manages to kill that in most people.
*  So in school we make people do study and do their things but not to pester them by asking too many
*  questions. I think not just myself but I think it's typical of scientists like myself that
*  have somehow escaped that. Maybe we're still children or maybe we somehow didn't get it
*  beaten out of us but I think it's, I teach it in college level and it's to me
*  one of the biggest deficits is the lack of curiosity if you want that we've beaten out of
*  them because I think it's an innate human quality. Is there some advice or insights you can give to
*  how to keep that flame of curiosity going? I think it's a problem of both parents and
*  that parents should realize that's a great quality we have, that you're curious and that's good.
*  Instead we have expressions like curiosity killed the cat and more. But I mean basically it's not
*  thought to be a good thing. Curiosity killed the cat means if you're too curious you get in trouble.
*  I don't like cats anyway so maybe it's a good thing.
*  That to me needs to be solved really in education and in homes. It's a realization that there's
*  certain human qualities that we should try to build on and not destroy one of them is curiosity.
*  Anyway back to me and curiosity I was a pest and asked a lot of questions. My father generally
*  could answer them at that age and the first one I remember that he couldn't answer was
*  not a very original question but basically that ice is made out of water and so why does it
*  float on water? He couldn't answer it and it may not have been the first question. It's the first
*  one that I remember and that was the first time that I realized that to learn and answer your own
*  curiosity or questions there's various mechanisms. In this case it was going to the library or asking
*  people who know more and so forth but eventually you do it by what we call research. But
*  it's driven by if you're hopefully you ask good questions. If you ask good questions and you have
*  the mechanisms to solve them then you do what I do in life basically. Not necessarily physics but
*  and it's a great quality in humans and we should nurture it. Do you remember any other kind of in
*  high school maybe early college more basic physics ideas that sparked your curiosity or mathematics
*  or science in general? I wasn't really into science until I got to college to be honest with you
*  but just staying with water for a minute I remember that I was curious
*  why what happens to water you know it rains and there's water in a wet pavement and then
*  the pavement dries out what happened to this water that came down and I you know I didn't know that
*  much and then eventually I learned in chemistry or something and water's made out of hydrogen and
*  oxygen. Those are both gases so how the heck does it make this substance it's liquid.
*  Yeah it's but so that has to do with states of matter. You've I know perhaps LIGO and
*  the thing for which you've gotten the Nobel Prize and the things much of your life work
*  perhaps was a happy accident in some sense in the early days but is there a moment where you looked
*  up to the stars and also the same way you wondered about water wondered about some of the things that
*  are out there in the universe? Oh yeah I think everybody's looks and is in awe and is curious
*  about what what it is out there and you know and as I learned more I learned of course that we don't
*  know very much about what's there and the more we learn the more we know we don't know I mean we
*  don't know what the majority of anything is out there it's all what we call dark matter dark energy
*  and that's one of the big questions 20 when I was a student those weren't questions so we even know
*  less in a sense the more we the more we look so of course I think that's one of the areas that
*  that almost it's universal people see the sky they see the stars and they're beautiful and
*  and see it looks different on different nights and it's a curiosity that we all have. What are some
*  questions about the universe that in the same way that you felt about the ice that today you
*  mentioned to me offline you're teaching a course on the frontiers of science frontiers of physics
*  yeah what are some questions outside the ones we'll probably talk about that kind of
*  yeah fill you with uh get your flame of curiosity up and uh firing up
*  yeah you know fill you with all well first I'm a physicist not an astronomer so I'm interested in
*  physical the physical phenomenon really so the question of uh dark matter and dark energy which
*  we probably won't talk about are recent recent there in the last 20 30 years or certainly dark
*  energy dark energy is a complete puzzle it goes against what I'll will what you will ask me about
*  which is general relativity and Einstein's general relativity it basically takes something that he
*  thought was what he what he called a constant which isn't and and uh in if that's even the
*  right theory and it represents most of the universe and then we have something called dark
*  matter and there's good reason to believe it might be an exotic form of particles um and that is
*  something I've always worked on on particle accelerators and so forth and it's a big puzzle
*  what it is it's a bit of a cottage industry and that there's lots and lots of searches
*  um but it may be a little bit like you know looking for a treasure under rocks or something
*  you know it's hard to we don't have really good guidance except that we have very very good
*  information that is pervasive and it's there and that it's probably particles small that the
*  evidence is all of those things but then the most uh logical solution doesn't seem to work something
*  called supersymmetry and do you think the answer could be something very complicated
*  you know I like to hope that think that most things that appear complicated are actually simple
*  if you really understand them I think we just don't know at the present time and it isn't
*  something that affects us it does affect it affects how the stars go around each other and so forth
*  because we detect that there's missing gravity but but it doesn't affect everyday life at all I
*  tend to think and expect maybe and that the answers will be simple we just haven't found it yet
*  do you think those answers might change the way we see other sources of gravity black holes
*  the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study it's conceivable uh the black hole
*  that we've found in our experiment and now we're trying now to understand the origin of those
*  it's conceivable but not doesn't seem the most likely that they were primordial that is they
*  were made at the beginning and they in that sense they could represent at least part of the dark
*  matter so there can be connections dark black holes are how many there are how much of the mass
*  they encompass is still pretty primitive we don't know so before I talk to you more about black
*  holes let me take a step back to yeah I was actually went to high school in Chicago and
*  would go to take classes at Fermilab watch the buffalo and so on yeah so let me ask about you
*  mentioned that Enrico for me was somebody who was inspiring to you in a certain kind of way
*  um why is that can you speak to that sure he was amazing actually uh he's the last
*  this is not the real I'll come to the reason in a minute but the he had a big influence on me at a
*  young age he uh but he was the own the last physicist of note that was both an experimental
*  physicist and a theorist at the same time and he did two amazing things within months in 1933
*  he it was we didn't really know what the nucleus was what uh radioactive decay was what beta decay
*  was when electrons come out of a nucleus and in near near the end of 1933
*  he the neutron had just been discovered and that meant that we knew a little bit more about what
*  the nucleus is that it's made out of neutrons and protons the neutron wasn't discovered till 1932
*  and then once we discovered that there was a neutron and proton and they made the nucleus
*  and then their electrons that go around the basic ingredients were there and he wrote down
*  not only just the theory a theory but a theory that lasted decades and has only been improved on
*  of beta decay that is the radiation he did this came out of nowhere and it was a fantastic theory
*  he submitted it to nature magazine which was the primary uh play best place to publish even then
*  and it got rejected as being too speculative and so he went back to his drawing board in
*  rome where he was added some to it made it even longer because it's really a classic article and
*  then published it in the local italian journal for physics and the german one at the same time
*  in 19th january of 1932 julio and curie for the first time saw artificial radioactivity
*  this was an important discovery because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier
*  you know we they had x-rays and you shouldn't be using them but they there was radioactivity
*  people knew it was useful for medicine but radioactive materials are hard to find and so
*  it wasn't prevalent but if you could make them then they had great use and julio and curie
*  were able to bombard aluminum or something with alpha particles and find that they excited
*  something that decayed and gave uh decayed and had some half-life and so forth meaning it was
*  artificial version or let's call it a not not a natural version an induced version of radioactive
*  materials and uh fermi somehow had the insight and i still can't see where he got it that the
*  right way to follow that up was not using charged particles like alphas and so forth but use use
*  these newly discovered neutrons as the bombarding particle seemed impossible they barely had been
*  seen uh it was hard to get very many of them but it had the advantage that they don't
*  they're not charged so they go right into the to the nucleus and that turned out to be the
*  experimental work that he did that won him the noble prize and it was the first step in fission
*  uh discovery of fission and that's he did this two completely different things an experiment that was
*  a great idea and a tremendous implementation because how do you get enough neutrons
*  and then he learned quickly that not only do you want neutrons but you want really slow ones
*  uh he learned that experimentally and he learned how to make slow ones and then they were able to
*  make go through the periodic table and make lots of particles he missed on fission at the moment
*  but he had the basic information and and then fission follows soon after that forgive me for
*  not knowing but what is the birth of the idea of bombarding with neutrons is that uh is that an
*  experimental idea was it born out of an experiment he just observed something or is this an einstein
*  style idea where you i think i think i think i think that took a combination because he realized
*  that neutrons had a characteristic that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus
*  when we didn't really understand what the you know what how what the structure was of all this
*  so that took uh an understanding or recognition of the physics itself of how a neutron interacts
*  compared to say an alpha particle that julio and curie had used and then he had to invent
*  a way to have enough neutrons and uh you know he had a team of associates and and he pulled it off
*  quite quickly so you know it's pretty astounding and probably maybe you can speak to it his ability
*  to put together the engineering aspects of great experiments and doing the theory they probably
*  fed each other i wonder can you speak to why we don't see more of that is that just really
*  difficult to do it's difficult to do yeah i think in both theory and experiment in physics anyway
*  was um it was conceivable if you had a the right person to do it and no one's been able to do it
*  since so i had the dream that that was what i was going to be like for me but so you love both sides
*  of it the theory yeah yeah i never liked the idea that you did experiments without really
*  understanding the theory or the theory should be related very closely to experiments and so i've
*  always done experimental work that was closely related to the theoretical ideas i think i told
*  you i'm russian so i'm going to ask some romantic questions but is is it tragic to you that he's
*  seen as the architect of the nuclear age that some of his creations led to potentially some
*  of his work has has led to potentially still the destruction of the human species some of the most
*  destructive weapons yeah uh i think even more general than him i i i gave you all the virtues
*  of curiosity a few minutes ago there's an interesting book called the ratchet of curiosity
*  you know a ratchet is something that goes in one direction and that that is written by a guy who's
*  probably a sociologist or philosopher or something and he he picks on this particular problem but
*  other ones and that is the the danger of knowledge basically you know you're curious you learn
*  something so it's a little bit like curiosity killed the cat you have to be worried about
*  whether you can handle new information that you get so in this case the new information had to
*  do with really understanding nuclear physics and that information maybe we didn't have the
*  sophistication to know how to keep it under control yeah and fermi himself was a very
*  apolitical person so he wasn't very driven by or or at least he appears in all of his writing the
*  writing of his wife the interactions that others had with him as either he avoided it all or he
*  was pretty apolitical i mean he just saw the world through kind of the lens of a scientist
*  but he asked if it's tragic uh the the bomb was tragic certainly on japan and he had a role in
*  that so i wouldn't want it as my legacy for example i mean that but brought it to the humor species
*  that it's the ratchet of curiosity that we
*  uh we do stuff just to see what happens that that curiosity that uh in sort of my area of
*  artificial intelligence that's a been a concern they're on a small scale on a silly scale perhaps
*  currently there's constantly unintended consequences the equator system and you put out there and you
*  have intuitions about how it will work you have hopes how it will work but you put it out there
*  just to see what happens yeah and uh in most cases because artificial intelligence is currently not
*  super powerful it doesn't create uh large-scale negative effects but that same curiosity as it
*  progresses might lead to something that destroys the human species and the same may be true for
*  bioengineering there's people uh that you know engineer viruses to protect us from viruses
*  to see you know how do how close is this to mutating so it can jump to humans or or going
*  you know or engineering uh defenses against those and it seems exciting and the application the
*  positive applications are really exciting at this time but we don't think about how that runs away
*  in decades to come yeah and i think it's the same idea as this little book the ratchet of uh science
*  the uh ratchet of curiosity i mean whether you pursue take curiosity and let artificial
*  intelligence or machine learning run away with having its uh solutions to whatever you want or
*  we do it it's i think a similar consequence i think uh from what i've read about uh enrico for me he
*  he became a little bit cynical about the human species until the end of his life
*  about having observed what he observed we didn't write much uh i mean he died young he died
*  soon after world the world war uh there was already you know the work by teller to develop
*  the hydrogen bomb and i think he was a little cynical of that you know pushing it even further
*  and uh the rising tensions between the soviet union and the u.s and looked like an endless thing so
*  but he didn't say very much but a little bit as you said that yeah there's a few clips to sort of
*  maybe picked on a bad mood but in a sense that almost like a sadness a melancholy sadness to
*  um a hope that waned a little bit about that uh perhaps we can do like this science this curious
*  species can find the way out well especially i think people who worked like he did at los alamos
*  and spent years of their life somehow had to convince themselves that dropping these bombs
*  would bring lasting peace and it didn't yeah
*  as a small interesting aside it'd be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this his name is
*  also attached to the family paradox which asks if there is a you know with formally it's a very
*  interesting question which is if it does seem if you sort of reason basically that there should be
*  a lot of alien civilizations out there if the human species if earth is not that unique
*  by basic no matter the values you pick it's likely that there's a lot of alien civilizations out
*  there and if that's the case why have they not at least obviously visited us or sent us
*  loud signals that everybody can hear faramie's quoted as saying sitting down at lunch i think
*  it was with teller and herb york who was kind of the one of the fathers of the atomic bomb
*  and he sat down and he said something like where are they yeah which meant where are these other
*  and um and then he did some numerology where he calculated you know how many what they knew about
*  how many uh galaxies there are and how many stars and how many planets then are like the earth and
*  blah blah blah that's been done much better by somebody named drake and so people usually refer
*  to that i don't know whether it's called the drake formula or something but it has the same conclusion
*  the conclusion is it would be a miracle if there weren't other you know uh there's the statistics
*  are so high that how can we be singular and separate uh that so probably there is
*  but there's almost certainly life somewhere maybe there was even life on mars a while back but uh
*  intelligent life probably why are we so so you know the statistics say that communicating with us
*  i think that it's harder than people think uh we might not know the right way to
*  expect the communication uh but all the communication that we know about travels
*  at the speed of light and we don't we don't think anything can go faster in the speed of light that
*  limits the problem quite quite a bit and it uh makes it difficult to have any back and forth
*  communication you could send signals like we try to or look for but to have any communication it's
*  pretty hard when you it has to be close enough that the speed of light uh would mean we could
*  communicate with each other and i i think and we didn't even understand that i mean we're an
*  advanced civilization but we didn't even understand that a little more than 100 years ago so uh are we
*  just not advanced enough maybe uh to know something about that's the speed of light maybe
*  there's some other way to communicate that isn't based on electromagnetism i don't i don't know
*  gravity seems to be also this have the same speed that was a principle that einstein had and
*  something we've measured actually so is is it possible i mean so we'll talk about gravitational
*  waves and in some sense there's a there's a brainstorming going on which is like how do
*  we detect the signal like what would a signal look like and how would we detect it and that's true
*  for gravitational waves that's true for basically any physics phenomena you have to predict that
*  that signal should exist you have to have some kind of theory and model why that signal should
*  exist i mean is it possible that aliens are communicating with us via gravity like why not
*  well it why yeah it's true why not uh for us it's very hard to detect these gravitational effects
*  they have to come from something pretty that has a lot of gravity like black holes but we're pretty
*  primitive at this stage there's a very reputable physicists that look for a fifth force one that
*  we haven't found yet maybe it's the key so you know it's what would that look like what would a
*  fifth force of physics look like exactly well usually they think it's probably a long range
*  for longer range force than we have now but they're reputable for colleagues of mine that
*  spend their life looking for a fifth force so longer range than gravity yeah super it doesn't
*  fall off like one over r squared but maybe separately gravity newton taught us goes like
*  inversely one over the square of the distance apart you are so it falls pretty fast that's okay
*  so now we have a theory of what consciousness is it's just the fifth force of physics yeah there
*  we go that's a good hypothesis uh speaking of gravity uh of gravity uh what are gravitational
*  waves let's maybe start from the basics we learned gravity from newton right you you and you were
*  young you were told that if you jumped up the earth pulls you down
*  and when the apple falls out of the tree the earth pulls it down and maybe you even asked your
*  teacher why but most of us accepted that that was newton's picture the apple falling out of the tree
*  but newton's theory never told you why the apple was attracted to the earth that was a missing in
*  newton's theory uh newton's theory also newton recognized at least one of the two problems i'll
*  tell you one of them is there's more than those but one is why does the earth what's the mechanism
*  by which the earth pulls the apple or holds the moon when it goes around whatever it is
*  uh that's not explained by newton even though he has the most successful theory of physics ever
*  went 200 and some years with nobody ever seeing a violation but he accurately describes the movement
*  of an object falling down to earth but he's not answering why that what's yeah because it's a
*  distance he gives a formula right which which it's a product of the earth's mass the apple's mass
*  inversely proportional to the square of the distance between and then the strength he called
*  capital g the strength he couldn't determine but it was determined 100 years later but no one ever
*  saw a violation of this until a possible violation which einstein fixed which was very small that
*  has to do with mercury going around the sun the orbit being slightly wrong if you calculate it by
*  newton's theory but so um like most theories then in in physics you can have a wonderful one like
*  newton's theory it isn't wrong but you have to have a an improvement on it to answer things that
*  it can't answer and in this case einstein's theory is the next step we don't know if it's
*  anything like a final theory or even the only way to formulate it either but he formulated this
*  theory which what which he released in 1915 he took 10 years to develop it even though in 1905
*  he solved three or four of the most important problems in physics in a matter of months and
*  then he spent 10 years on this problem before he uh let it out and this is called general relativity
*  it's a new theory of gravity 1915 in 1916 einstein wrote a little paper where he
*  did not do some fancy derivation instead he did
*  what i would call it used his intuition which he was very good at too and that is he noticed that
*  if he formed if he wrote the formulas for general relativity in a particular way
*  they looked a lot like the formulas for electricity and magnetism
*  being einstein he then took the leap that electricity and magnetism we discovered only
*  20 years before that in the 1880s uh have waves of course that's light and electromagnetic rays
*  radio waves everything else so he said if the formulas look similar then gravity probably has
*  waves too that's such a big leap by the way i mean maybe you can correct me but that just seems
*  so that seems like a heck of a leap yeah and so that and it was considered to be a heck of a
*  leap so first that paper was except for this intuition was uh poorly written had had a serious
*  mistake it had the fact a factor of two wrong and the strength of gravity which meant if we
*  used those formulas we would and uh two years later he wrote a second paper and in that paper
*  it turns out to be important for us because in that paper he not only fixed his factor of two
*  mistake which he never admitted he just wrote it fixed it like he always did and and then he
*  told us how you make gravitational waves what what makes gravitational waves and you might
*  recall in electromagnetism we make electromagnetic waves in a simple way you take a plus charge and
*  minus charge you oscillate like this and that makes an electromagnetic waves and a physicist
*  named hertz made a receiver that could detect the waves and put it in the next room he saw them and
*  moved forward and backward and saw that it was wave like so einstein said it won't be a dipole
*  like that it'll be a four pole thing and that's what it's called a quadrupole moment that gives
*  the gravitational wave so he saw that again by insight not by derivation that's at the table for
*  what you needed to do to do it at the same time in the same year schwarzschild not einstein said
*  there were things like called black holes so it's interesting that that came the same
*  so what year was that 1915 it was in parallel with i did i should probably know this but did
*  i say not have any intuition that there should be such things as black holes
*  that came from schwarzschild oh interesting yeah so schwarzschild who was a a german theoretical
*  physicist he got killed in the war i think in the first world war a year two years later or so
*  he's the one that proposed black holes that there were black holes it feels like a natural conclusion
*  of general relativity no or is that uh well may seem like it but i don't know about a natural
*  conclusion it is a it's a result of curved space time though right and it's but it's such a weird
*  result that you might have to yeah it's a special yeah it's a special case yeah so uh i i don't know
*  anyway einstein then an interesting part of the story is that einstein then left the problem most
*  physicists because it really wasn't uh derived he just made this didn't pick up on it or general
*  relativity much because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics and einstein
*  only picked up this problem again after he immigrated to the u.s. so he came to the u.s.
*  in 1932 and i think in 1934 or five he was working with another physicist called rosen who he did
*  several important works with and they revisited the question and they had a problem that most of
*  us as students always had that study general relativity general relativity is really hard
*  because it's four-dimensional instead of three-dimensional and if you don't set it
*  up right you get infinities which don't belong there the we call them coordinate singularities
*  as a name but but if you get these infinities you don't get the answers you want and uh he was
*  trying to derive now general relativity from general relativity gravitational waves and in doing
*  it he kept getting these infinities and so he wrote a paper with rosen that he submitted to
*  our most important journal physical review letters and uh that when it was submitted
*  to physical review letters it was entitled do gravitational waves exist a very funny title
*  to write 20 years after he proposed they exist but it's because he had found these singularities
*  these infinities and so the editor at that time and part of it that i don't know
*  is peer review we live and die by peer review as scientists send our stuff out and it's we
*  i don't know when peer review actually started or what what peer review einstein ever experienced
*  before this time but the editor of physical review sent this out for review
*  he had a choice he could take any article and just accept it he could reject it or he could
*  send it for review right i believe the editors used to have much more power yeah yeah and he
*  was a young man his name was tate and he ended up being editor for years but uh so he sent this
*  for review uh to a theoretical physicist named robertson who was also in this field of general
*  relativity who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at caltech otherwise his institution
*  was princeton where eisheim was and he saw that the way they set up the problem the infinities were
*  like i make it as a student because if you don't set it up right in general relativity you get these
*  infinities and so he reviewed the article and told gave an illustration that if they set it up in
*  what are called cylindrical coordinates these infinities went away he's the editor of uh
*  physical review was obviously intimidated by einstein he wrote this really not not a letter
*  back like i would get saying you know you're screwed up in your paper instead that it was
*  kind of uh what do you think of the comments of our
*  referee einstein wrote back it's a well documented letter wrote back a letter to
*  physical review saying i didn't send you the paper to send it to one of your so-called experts i
*  sent it to you to publish i now i withdraw the paper uh and he never published again in the
*  in that journal that was 1936 instead he rewrote it with the fixes that were made changed the title
*  and published it in what was called the franklin review which is the franklin institute in
*  philadelphia uh which is benjamin franklin institute which doesn't have a journal now but
*  did at that time so the article is published it's the last time he ever wrote about it
*  it remained controversial so it wasn't until close to 1960 1958 where there was a conference in which
*  brought that brought together the experts in general relativity to try to sort out whether there was uh
*  whether it was true that there were gravitational waves or not
*  and there was a very nice derivation by a british uh theorist from the heart of the theory
*  that gets gravitational waves uh and that was number one the second thing that happened at
*  that meeting is richard fineman was there and fineman uh said well if there's a typical fineman
*  if there's gravitational waves they need to be able to do something otherwise they don't exist
*  so they have to be able to transfer energy so he made a idea of a gadankan experiment that is just
*  a a bar with a couple rings on it and then if a gravitational wave goes through it distorts the bar
*  and that creates friction on these little rings yeah and that's heat and that's energy so that
*  that meant is that a good idea that sounds like a good idea yeah it means that he showed that with
*  the distortion of space time you could transfer energy just by this little idea and it was shown
*  theoretically so at that point it was uh believed theoretically then by people that gravitational
*  waves should exist no we should be able to detect them we should be able to detect them except
*  except that they're very very small just so what kind of uh there's a bunch of questions here but
*  what kind of events would generate gravitational waves you have to have this what i call quadruple
*  moment that comes about if i have uh for for example two objects that go around each other like
*  this like the earth around the earth around the sun or the moon around the earth or in our case
*  it turns out to be two black holes going around each other like this so how's that different than
*  basic oscillation back and forth this is just more common in nature to oscillation is a dipole
*  moment so it has to be in three-dimensional space yeah kind of oscillation so you have to have
*  something that's three-dimensional that'll give what's what i called a quadruple moment that's
*  just built into this and luckily in nature you have stuff uh and luckily things exist and it is
*  luckily because the effect is so small that you could say look i can take a barbell and and spin
*  it right and detect the gravitational waves but unfortunately no matter how much i spin it how
*  fast i spin it it's so i know how to make gravitational waves but they're so weak i can't
*  detect them so we have to take something that's stronger than i can make otherwise we would do
*  what hertz did for electromagnetic waves go in our lab take a barbell put it on something spin it
*  can ask a dumb question so a a single object that's weirdly shaped does that generate
*  gravitational waves so if it's if it's rotating sure it was just much weaker signal it's we it's
*  weaker well we didn't know what the strongest signal would be that we would see uh we targeted
*  seeing something called neutron stars actually because black holes we don't know very much about
*  it turned out we were a little bit lucky there was a stronger source which was the black holes
*  well another ridiculous question so you say waves what is what does a wave mean like um
*  the most ridiculous version of that question is what does it feel like to ride a wave as you get
*  closer to the source or experience it well if you experience a wave imagine that this is what
*  happens to you i don't know what you mean about getting close it comes to you so it's like it's
*  like a this light wave or something that comes through you so when the light hits you it maybe
*  makes your eyes detected i flashed it what does this do it's it's like going to the amusement park
*  and they have these mirrors you look in this mirror and you look short and fat and the one
*  next to you makes you tall and thin okay imagine that you went back and forth between those two
*  mirrors once a second that would be a gravitational wave with a period of once a second
*  if you did it 60 times a second go back and forth and and then that's all that happens it makes you
*  taller and shorter and fatter back and forth as it goes through you at the frequency of the
*  gravitational wave so the frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second but
*  that's the idea so but and the amount is small amount is small but when if you're closer to the
*  to the source of the wave is it the same amount yeah it's it doesn't dissipate it doesn't dissipate
*  okay so it's not that fun of an amusement ride well it does dissipate but it doesn't it doesn't
*  it's just it's proportional to the distance right it's not it's not a big power right got you so
*  but so it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer or a lot closer i mean like i wonder
*  what the okay this is ridiculous question but i have you here like the getting fatter and taller
*  i mean that experience for some reason that's mind-blowing to me because it brings the
*  distortion of space time to you i mean space time is being morphed right like this is a way
*  that how that's so weird and we're in space so yeah we're in space and now it's moving
*  i don't know what to do with it i mean does it okay um how much do you think about the philosophical
*  implications of general relativity like that we're in space time and it can be bent by gravity
*  like is that just what it is are we are we supposed to be okay with this because like newton
*  even newton is a little weird right but that at least like makes sense that's our physical world
*  you know when an apple falls it makes sense but like the fact that entirety of the space time we're
*  in can bend well that's uh that's uh i that's really mind-blowing let me make another analogy
*  this is a therapy session for me yeah right another analogy thank you so so imagine you
*  have a trampoline yes okay what happens if you put a marble on a trampoline doesn't do anything right
*  no just maybe a little bit but not much yeah i mean just if i drop it it's not going to go anywhere
*  now imagine i put a bowling ball at the center of the trampoline
*  now i come up to the trampoline i put a marble on what happens
*  yeah roll towards the bowling ball all right so what's happened is the presence of this
*  massive object distorted the space that the trampoline did this is the same thing that
*  happens to the presence of the earth the earth and the apple the presence of the earth affects
*  the space around it just like the bowling ball on the trampoline yeah this doesn't make me feel
*  better i'm referring from the perspective of an ant walking around on that trampoline then some guy
*  just dropped a ball and not only dropped the ball right it's not just dropping a bowling ball it's
*  making the the ball go up and down or doing some kind of oscillation thing where it's like waves
*  and that's so fundamentally different from the experience on being on flatland and walking
*  around and just finding delicious sweet things as aunt does and just it just feels like to me
*  from a human experience perspective completely it's humbling it's truly humbling it's humbling but
*  we see that kind of phenomenon all the time let me give you another example imagine that you walk
*  up to a a still pond yes okay now i throw you like to you throw a rock in it what happens
*  the rock goes in sinks to the bottom fine and these little ripples go out yeah and they travel
*  out that's exactly what happens i mean there's a disturbance which is these safe the bowling ball
*  are black holes and then the ripples they go out in the water they're not they don't have any
*  they don't have the rock any part pieces of the rock you see the thing is i guess
*  what's not disturbing about that is it's a i mean i guess a flat two-dimensional surface that's being
*  disturbed like for a three-dimensional surface a three-dimensional space to be disturbed feels
*  weird it's even worse it's four-dimensional because it's space and time yeah so that's why
*  you need einstein is to make it uh four-dimensional no to make it four-dimensional
*  yeah to take the same phenomenon and and look at it in all of space and time anyway luckily
*  for you and i and all of us the amount of distortion is incredibly small
*  so it turns out that if you think of space itself now this is going to blow your mind too if you
*  think of space as being like a material like this table uh it's very stiff you know we have materials
*  that are very pliable materials that are very stiff so space itself is very stiff so when
*  gravitational waves come through it luckily for us it doesn't distort it so much that it affects our
*  it affects our ordinary life very much no i mean that's great that's great i thought there was
*  something bad coming no this is great that's great news so i mean that i mean perhaps we evolved
*  as life on earth to be such that for us this particular set of uh effects of gravitational
*  waves uh is not that significant maybe maybe that's why you probably used this effect today
*  or yesterday what so it's it's pervasive well you mean gravity or the way the external
*  because i only curvature of space and curvature of space how i only care person is a human right
*  the gravity of earth but you use it every day almost oh it's curving uh-huh yeah no no it's
*  in this thing every time it tells you where you are yeah it how does it tell you where you are
*  it tells you where you are because we have 24 satellites or some number that are going around
*  in space and it asks how long it takes the beam to go to the satellite and come back the signal
*  to different ones and then it triangulates and tells you where you are and then if you go down
*  the road it tells you where you are do you know that if you did that with the satellites and you
*  didn't use einstein's equations oh no you wouldn't you won't get the right answer that's right
*  and in fact if you take a road that's say 10 meters wide i've done these numbers and you ask
*  how long you'd stay on the road if you didn't make the correction for general relativity this thing
*  you're poo-pooing because you're using every day uh you'd go off the road you go off the road
*  well actually that might so you use it so so well poo-poo it well i think i'm using an android so
*  maybe and the gps doesn't work that well so maybe i'm using mutants physics uh so i need to upgrade
*  to general relativity um so gravitational waves and einstein had uh wait feinman really does have
*  a part in the story was that one of the first kind of experimental proposed to detect gravitational
*  waves he did what we call a gadonkin experiment that's a thought experiment yes okay not a real
*  experiment but then after that then people believe gravitational waves must exist you can kind of
*  calculate how big they are there's tiny and so people started searching the first idea that
*  was used was feinman's idea and then oh a variant of it and it was to take a great big huge bar of
*  aluminum and then put around and it's a it's made like a cylinder and then put around it some very
*  very sensitive detectors so that if a gravitational wave happened to go through it it would go
*  so and you detect this extra strain that was there and that was this method that was used until we
*  came along it wasn't a very good method to use and what was the so we're talking about a pretty weak
*  signal here yeah that's why that method didn't work so what can you tell the story of figuring
*  out what kind of method would be able to detect this very weak signal of gravitational waves
*  so remembering the remembering what happens in when you go to the amusement park yeah that
*  it's going to do something like stretch this way and squash that way squash this way and stretch
*  this way we do have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing it's called an interferometer
*  and what it does is it just basically takes usually light and the two directions that we're
*  talking about you send light down one direction and the perpendicular direction and if nothing
*  changes it takes the same and the arms are the same length it just goes down bounces back and
*  if you invert one compared to the other they cancel so there's nothing happens but if it's
*  like the amusement park and one of the arms got you know it got shorter and fatter so it got took
*  longer to go horizontally than it did to go vertically then when they come back when the
*  light comes back that comes back somewhat out of time and that basically is this game the only
*  problem is that that's not a very done very accurately in general and we had to do it
*  extremely accurately so what what's the what's the difficulty of doing so accurately okay so the
*  measurement that we have to do is a distortion in time how big is it one it's a distortion
*  that's one part in 10 to the 21 that's 21 zeros and a one okay wow and this so this is like a
*  delay in the thing coming back it's a one of them coming back after the other one but the difference
*  is just one part in 10 to the 21 so for that reason we make it big let it let the arms be long
*  okay so one part in 10 to the 21 in our case it's kilometers long so we have an instruments of
*  kilometers in one direction kilometers in the other several kilometers we're talking about four
*  kilometers four kilometers in each direction if you take them one part in 10 to the 21 we're
*  talking about measuring something to 10 to the minus 18 meters
*  okay now to tell you how small that is yeah the proton yeah thing we're made of this you can't
*  go and grab so easily is 10 to the minus 15 meters so this is one one thousandth the size
*  of a proton that's the effect size of the effect einstein himself didn't think this could be
*  measured have ever seen actually he said that but that's because he didn't you know anticipate
*  modern lasers and and techniques that we developed okay so maybe can you tell me a little bit what
*  you're referring to as ligo the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory what is ligo can you
*  just elaborate kind of the big picture view here before i ask you specific questions about it
*  yeah so in the same idea that i just said we have two long vacuum pipes 10 to four kilometers long
*  okay we start with a laser beam and we divide the beam going down the two arms and we have a
*  mirror at the other end reflects it back it's more subtle but we bring it back if there's no
*  distortion in space time and the lengths are exactly the same which we calibrate them to be
*  then when it comes back if we just invert one signal compared to the other they'll just cancel
*  so we see nothing okay but if one arm got a little bit longer than the other
*  then they don't come back at exactly the same time they don't exactly cancel that's what we measure
*  so to give a number to it we have to do that to we have the change of length to be able to do this
*  10 to the minus 18 meters to one part in 10 to the 12th and that was the big experimental challenge
*  that required a lot of innovation to be able to do what you gave a lot of credit to i think caltech
*  and mit for some of the technical developments like within this project
*  is there some interesting things you can speak to like at the low level of some cool stuff that
*  to be solved like what what are we yeah i'm a software engineer so okay all of this i have so
*  much more respect for everything done here than anything i've ever done so it's just code so
*  what so so i'll give you an example of doing
*  mechanical engineering at a better at a basically mechanical engineering and geology and maybe at a
*  level so what are we what's the problem the problem is the following that i've given you
*  this picture of an instrument that by some magic i can make good enough to measure this very short
*  distance but then i put it down here it won't work and the reason it doesn't work is that the
*  earth itself is moving all over the place all the time you don't realize it it seems pretty good to
*  you i get it but it's moving all the time so somehow it's moving so much that you we can't
*  deal with it we happen to be trying to do the experiment here on earth but we can't deal with
*  it so we have to make the instrument isolated from the earth oh no at the frequencies we're at
*  we've got to float it that's a mechanical that's an engineering problem not a physics problem so
*  when you actually like uh we're doing we're having a conversation on a podcast right now there's uh
*  and people who record music work with this you know how to create an isolated room
*  and they usually build a room within a room but that's still not isolated in fact they say it's
*  impossible to truly isolate from sound from noise and stuff like that but that that that's like one
*  step of millions that you took is building a room inside a room because you basically have to isolate
*  all now this is actually an easier problem it's just have to do it really well so the making a
*  clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside a room yeah you have to
*  so this is this is really simple engineering our physics okay so what do you have to do how do you
*  isolate yourself from the from the earth yes first we work at uh we're not looking at all
*  frequencies for gravitational waves we're looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with
*  here on earth so what are frequencies would those be you were just talking about frequencies
*  I mean I don't we know by evolution our bodies know it's the audio band
*  okay the reason our ears work where they work is that's where the earth isn't going
*  making too much noise okay so the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where
*  it's quiet that's right so if you go to if you go to one hertz instead of 10 hertz it's the earth is
*  it's really moving around so so somehow we live in a what we call the audio band it's tens of hertz
*  to thousands of hertz that's where we live that's where we live okay if we're going to do an
*  experiment on the earth might as well do it it's the same frequency that's where the earth is the
*  quietest so we have to work in that frequency so we're not looking at all frequencies okay so the
*  solution for the for the shaking of the earth to get rid of it is pretty mundane if we do the same
*  thing that you do to make your car drive smoothly down the road so what happens when your car goes
*  over a bump early cars did that they bounced right okay but you don't feel that in your car
*  so what happened to that energy you can't just disappear energy so we have these things called
*  shock absorbers in the car what they do is they absorb they take the the thing that went like that
*  and they basically can't get rid of the energy but they move it to very very low frequency
*  so what you feel isn't you feel like oh smoothly okay all right so
*  we also work at this frequency so if we so we basically why why do we have to do anything other
*  than shock absorbers so we made the world's fanciest shock absorbers okay not just like in
*  your car where there's one layer of them they're just the right squishiness and so forth they're
*  better than what's in the cars and we have four layers of it so whatever shakes and gets through
*  the first layer we treat it in a second third or fourth layer so some mechanical engineering
*  problem yeah that's what i said so it's not there's no weird tricks to it like uh like a
*  chemistry type thing or no no just well the right squishiness so you're right need the right
*  material inside and ours look like little springs but they're springs there's springs so like
*  legitimately like shock absorbers yeah what okay okay and this is now experimental physics at the
*  at its limit okay so you do this and we make the world's fanciest shock absorbers just mechanical
*  engineering just mechanical geniuses hilarious but we didn't yes we weren't good enough to
*  discover gravitational waves so uh so we did another we added another feature and it's something else
*  that you're uh aware of probably have one and that is to get rid of noise you've probably
*  noise which is you don't like and that's the same principle that's in these little bows
*  earphones noise canceling noise canceling so uh so how do they work they basically you go on an
*  airplane and they uh sense the ambient noise from the engines and cancel it because it's just the
*  same over and over again they cancel it and when the stewardess comes and asks you whether you
*  want coffee or a tea or a drink or something you hear her fine because she's not ambient she's a
*  signal so are we talking about active canceling like where the active canceling so this is okay
*  so another don't tell me you have active canceling on this yeah besides the shock absorbers so we add
*  this so inside this array of shock absorbers we you asked for some interesting this is awesome
*  so inside this it's harder than the the earphone problem but it's just engineering we have to see
*  measure not just that the uh engines still made noise but the earth is shaking it's moving in
*  some direction so we have to actually tell not only that there's noise and cancel it but what
*  direction it's from so we put this array of seismometers inside this array of shock absorbers
*  and measure the residual motion and its direction and we put little actuators that push back against
*  it and cancel it this is awesome so you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing
*  the vibrations and then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in
*  perfect synchrony yeah what if it all works right and so how much do we reduce the shaking of the
*  earth i mean one part in 10 to the 12th one part in so what gets through us is one part in 10 to the 12th
*  that's pretty big reduction you don't need that in your car but that's what we do and so that's how
*  isolated we are from the earth and that was the biggest uh i i'd say technical problem outside of
*  the physics instrument the interferometer can i ask you a weird question here you you make it
*  very poetically and humorously you're saying it's just a mechanical engineering problem
*  but is this one of the biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever i mean this seems
*  exceptionally difficult it is and so it took a long time and uh i think nobody seems to challenge
*  the statement that this is the most precision precise instrument it's ever been built like i
*  wonder what like listening to led zeppelin sounds on this thing because it's so isolated i mean this
*  is like uh i don't know no background no no but no back it's wow wow wow so when you were first
*  concerned conceiving this um i would probably uh if i was knowledgeable enough kind of uh laugh
*  off the possibility this is even possible i'm sure like how many people believe that this is
*  possible did you believe this is possible i did uh i didn't know that we needed for sure that we
*  needed active when we started we did just passive but we were doing the test to develop the active
*  to add as a second stage which we ended up needing um but there was a lot of you know now
*  now there was a lot of skepticism a lot of us especially astronomers felt that money was being
*  wasted as we were also expensive doing what i told you is not cheap so it was kind of controversial
*  is funded by the national science foundation can you just linger on this just for a little longer
*  the actuator thing the act of canceling um
*  do you remember like little experiments that were done along the way to prove to the team
*  to themselves that this is even possible so from our because i work with quite a bit of robots
*  and to me the idea that you could do it this precisely is uh humbling and embarrassing frankly
*  because like this is another level of precision that i can't even
*  um because robots are a mess and this is basically one of the most precise robots ever
*  right so like uh can you is there um yeah we have any like small scale experiments that were done
*  that just this is possible yeah and larger scale we made we made a test uh
*  test uh that also has to be in vacuum too but we made test chambers that had this system
*  in it our first mock of this system that so we could test it um and optimize it
*  and make it work but it's just a mechanical engineering problem okay
*  humans are just ape descendants i got you i got you uh is there any video of this like um some
*  kind of educational purpose visualizations of this act of canceling and i don't think so
*  i mean is this does this live on well we work for parts of it for the active canceling we worked
*  with for the instruments for the sensor and instruments we worked with a small company
*  and near where you are because it was our mit people that got them that were you know interested
*  in the problem because they thought they might be able to commercialize it for making stable tables
*  to make microelectronics for example which are limited by the how stable the table is
*  i mean at this point it's a little expensive so you never know never know where this leads
*  okay so maybe on the
*  let me ask you just sticking it a little longer this silly old mechanical engineering problem
*  uh what was um to you kind of the darkest moment of what was the hardest stumbling block to get over
*  on the engineer side like was there any time where there's a doubt whereas like i'm not sure
*  we would be able to do this a kind of uh engineering challenge that was hit do you remember anything
*  like that i think the one that that uh my colleague at mit ray weiss worked on so hard and uh
*  was much more of a worry than this this is only a question if you're not
*  doing well enough you have to keep making it better somehow but this whole huge instrument has to be
*  in vacuum and the vacuum tanks are you know this big around and uh so it's the world's biggest high
*  vacuum system and the so how do you make it first of all uh how do you make this four meter long
*  sealed vacuum system it has to be made out of four kilometers four kilometers long would i say
*  something else meters four four kilometers long big difference yeah and uh so but to make it yeah
*  we started with a roll of stainless steel and then we spy roll it out like a spiral so there's a
*  spiral weld on it okay so the engineering was fine we did that we worked through a very good
*  companies and so forth to build it but uh the big worry it was what if you develop a leak
*  this is a high vacuum not just vacuum system typically in your in a laboratory if there's a
*  leak you put helium around the the thing you have and then you detect where the helium is coming in
*  but if you have something as big as this you can't surround it with helium and then you can't
*  surround it with helium so you might not actually even know that there's a leak and it will be
*  affecting well we we have we can measure the back how good the vacuum is so we can know that
*  but there are a leak can develop and and then we don't how do we fix it or how do we find it
*  and uh so that was you asked about a worry that was always a really big worry uh what's the
*  difference between a high vacuum and a vacuum what is high vacuum that's like some delta close
*  to vacuum is like some threshold well there's a unit high vacuum is uh when the vacuum and the
*  units that are used which are tors there's 10 to the minus nine uh and there's high vacuum is
*  usually used in small places the biggest vacuum system period is at cern in this big particle
*  accelerator but the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles don't scatter and
*  is smaller than ours so ours is a really large uh high vacuum system i don't know this is so cool
*  i mean this is basically by far the greatest listening device ever built by human the fact
*  that like descendants of apes could do this that evolution started with single cell organisms
*  i mean is there any more i'm a huge uh theory is like yeah yeah but like bridges when i look at
*  bridges from a civil engineering perspective is one of the most beautiful creations by human beings
*  it's physics you're using physics to construct objects that can support huge amount of mass
*  and it's like structural but it's also beautiful and that humans can collaborate to create that
*  throughout history and then you take this on another level this is this is like
*  so exciting to me beyond measure that humans can create something so precise
*  but but another concept lost in this you just said you started talking about single cell yeah okay
*  you have to realize this discovery that we made that everybody's bought off on happened 1.3 billion
*  years ago somewhere and then the signal came to us 1.3 billion years ago we were just converting
*  on the earth from single cell to multi-cell life so when this actually happened this collision of
*  two black holes yeah we weren't here we weren't even close to we're both developing there were
*  single yeah we were had we're going from single cell to multi-cell life at that point all to meet
*  up at this at this point yeah wow that's like uh that's almost romantic
*  it is okay so on the human side of things it's kind of
*  fascinating because you're talking about a over a thousand people team for ligo yeah they start out
*  with the you know around 100 and you've for parts of the time at least led this team
*  what does it take to lead a team like this of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers
*  and just a lot of different parties involved a lot of egos a lot of ideas you had this fun
*  funny example i forget where where in publishing a paper you have to all agree on like uh you know
*  the phrasing of a certain sentence or the title of the paper and so on that's a very interesting
*  simple example i'd love you to speak to that but just in general how what does it take to lead this
*  kind of team okay uh i think the the general idea is one we all know you want to you want to you
*  want to get uh where the the sum of something is more than the individual parts is what we say
*  right yeah so that's what you're trying to achieve yes okay how do you do that actually mostly if we
*  take multiple objects or people i mean you put them together the sum is less yes why because
*  they overlap so you don't have individual things that you know this person does that this person
*  does that then then you get exactly the sum but what you want is to develop where you get more
*  than what the individual contributions are we know that's very common people use that
*  expression everywhere and it's the expression that has to be kind of built into how people feel it's
*  working because if you're part of a team and you realize that somehow the team is able to do more
*  than the individuals could do themselves then they buy on kind of in terms of the process so
*  that's the that's the goal that you have to have is to to achieve that and that means that you have
*  to uh realize parts of what you're trying to do that require not that one person couldn't do it
*  it requires the combined talents to be able to do something that neither of them could do themselves
*  and we have a lot of that kind of thing and i think um i mean build into the some of the
*  examples that i gave you and so uh how do you then so so the key almost in anything you do
*  is the people themselves right so in our case the first and most important was to attract
*  to spend years of their life on this the best possible people in the world to do it so
*  the only way to convince them is that somehow it's better and more interesting for them than
*  what they could do themselves and so that's part of this uh idea yeah that's powerful but nevertheless
*  there's best people in the world there's egos is there something to be said about managing egos
*  or that's the human problem is always the hardest and so there's that's an art not a science i think
*  uh i think the fact here that combined there's a was a romantic goal that we had to you know do
*  something that people hadn't done before which was um important scientifically and and a huge challenge
*  uh enabled us to say take and get uh i mean what we just take an example we use the light
*  to go in this thing comes from lasers we need a certain kind of laser so
*  the kind of laser that we use there were three different institutions in the world that had the
*  experts that do this maybe in competition with each other so we got all three to join together
*  and work with us uh to work on this as an example so that you had uh and they had the
*  thing that they were working together on a kind of object that they wouldn't have otherwise
*  and uh were part of a bigger team where they could discover something that isn't even engineers these
*  are engineers that do lasers so and they're part of our laser physicists and so could you describe
*  the moment or the period of time when finally this incredible creation of human beings
*  led to a detection of gravitational waves it's a long story unfortunately this is a part that
*  we started failures along the way kind of thing or all failures that's all let's build into it
*  okay if you're not a if you're not mechanical engineering
*  uh you build on your failures that's expected so we're trying things that no one's done before
*  so it's technically not just gravitational waves and so it's built on failures but anyway we we did
*  before me even the the people did uh r and d on the concepts but starting in 1994 we got money
*  from the national science foundation to build this thing it took about five years to build it
*  so by 1999 we had built the basic unit it did not have active seismic isolation at that stage
*  didn't have some other things that we have now what we did at the beginning was
*  uh stick to technologies that we had at least enough knowledge that we could make work or had
*  tested in our own laboratories and so then we put together the instrument we made it work uh it
*  didn't work very well but it worked and we didn't see any gravitational waves then we figured out
*  what limited us and we went through this every year for almost 10 years never seeing gravitational
*  waves we would uh run it looking for gravitational waves for months learn what limited us fix it for
*  months then run it again eventually we knew we had to take another big step and that's when we made
*  several changes including going adding these active seismic isolation which turned out to be
*  a key and we fortunately got the national science foundation to give us another couple hundred
*  million dollars a hundred million more and we rebuilt it our fixed or improved it and then in
*  nine uh in 2015 we turned it on and uh we almost instantly saw this first collision of two black
*  holes and then then we went through a process of do we believe what we've seen yeah i think i think
*  you're one of the people that went through that process sounds like some people immediately
*  believed it yeah and then you're like so as human beings we all have different reactions to almost
*  anything and so quite a few of my colleagues had a eureka moment immediately i mean it's this the
*  amazing the the the figure that we that we put in our paper first is just data we didn't have to go
*  through you know fancy computer programs to do anything and and we show next to it uh the
*  calculations of einstein's equations it looks just like the what we detected and we did it in two
*  different detectors halfway across the u.s so it was pretty convincing but um but you don't want to
*  you don't want to fool yourself so we had a being a scientist we had a for me we had to go through
*  and try to understand that the instrument itself which was new i said we had rebuilt it couldn't
*  somehow generate things that look like this that took some tests and then uh the second you'll
*  appreciate more uh we had to somehow convince ourselves we weren't hacked in some clever way
*  cyber security question yeah even though we're not on the internet the the but yeah no it can be
*  physical access too yeah that's that's fascinating it's fascinating that you would think about that
*  i mean not not enough it i mean because it's it's uh it matches prediction so the chances of it
*  actually being manipulated is very very low but nevertheless we still could have disgruntled all
*  graduate students who had worked with us earlier that who want you to i don't know how that's
*  supposed to embarrass you i suppose yeah i suppose i see but but about uh what i think you said
*  within a month you kind of convinced yourself so within a month we convinced ourselves uh we kept
*  a thousand collaborators quiet during that time then we spent another that's funny month or so
*  uh trying to understand what we'd seen uh so that we could do the science with it instead of just
*  putting it out to the world and let somebody else understand that it was two black holes and
*  what it was the fact that a thousand collaborators were quiet is a really strong indication that this
*  is a really close-knit team yeah and they're around the world or either strong either a strong knit
*  or tight knit or had a strong dictatorship or something yeah either fear or love you can rule
*  by fear or love yeah right you can go back to mucky valley yeah all right well this i mean
*  this is is really exciting that that was that that's a success story because it didn't have
*  to be a success story right i mean eventually perhaps you could say it'll be an event but it
*  could have taken it over a century to get oh yeah yeah it's uh and um and it's only downhill now
*  kind of what do you mean it's only you mean with gravitational waves well we're yeah we've we've
*  now we now uh well now we're off because of the pandemic but when we turned off we were seeing
*  some sort of gravitational wave event each week and now we're fixing we're fixing we're adding
*  features where it'll probably be when we turn back on next year it'll probably every one every
*  couple days and they're not all the same so it's learning about what's out there in gravity instead
*  of just optics and so it's all uh great we're only limited by the fantastic thing other than
*  that this is uh a great field and you know it's all new and so forth is that experimentally the
*  great thing is that we're limited by technology and technical limitations not by science so
*  another really important discovery that was made before ours was what's called the Higgs boson made
*  on the big accelerator at CERN you know this huge accelerator they discovered a really important
*  thing it's you know we have Einstein's equation E equals mc squared so energy makes mass or mass
*  can make energy and that's the bomb but the mechanism by which that happens not fission but
*  but how do you create mass from energy was never understood until there was a a theory of it about
*  70 years ago now and so they discovered it's named after a man named Higgs it's called the Higgs boson
*  and so it was discovered but since that time and I worked on those experiments since that time they
*  haven't been able to progress very much further a little bit but not a lot further and the difference
*  is that we're really lucky we're in what we're doing in that there you see this Higgs boson
*  but there's tremendous amount of other physics that goes on and you have to pick out the needle
*  and the haystack kind of of physics you can't make the physics go away it's there in our case
*  we have a very weak signal but once we get good enough to see it it's weak compared to where we've
*  reduced the background but the background is not physics it's just technology you know it's getting
*  ourselves better isolated from the earth or getting a more powerful laser and so each time
*  each since 2015 when we saw the first one we continually can make improvements that are
*  enabling us to turn this into a real science to do astronomy a new kind of astronomy it's a little
*  like astronomy I mean Galileo started the field I mean he basically took lenses that were made for
*  classes and he didn't invent the first telescope but made a telescope looked at
*  Neptune and saw that it had four moons that was the birth of not just using your eyes to understand
*  what's out there and since that time we've made better and better telescopes obviously and
*  astronomy thrives and in a similar way we're starting to be able to
*  for you know crawl but we're starting to be able to do that with gravitational waves it's and it's
*  going to be more and more that we can do is we can make better and better instruments because
*  as I say it's not limited by picking it out of others yeah it's not limited by the physics
*  it's so you have an optimism about engineering that event you know as we as human progress marches on
*  engineering will always find a way to to build a large enough device accurate enough device
*  to detect the same as long as it's not limited by physics yeah they'll do it
*  so you two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel Prize for this yeah big effort
*  there's a million questions I can ask for but looking back
*  where does the Nobel Prize fit into all of this you know if you think hundreds of years from now
*  I venture to say that people will not remember the winners of a prize but they'll remember
*  creations like these maybe I'm romanticizing engineering but I guess I want to ask how
*  important is the Nobel Prize in all of this?
*  Well that's a it's a complicated question it's as a physicist it's something if you're if you're
*  trying to win a Nobel Prize forget it because they give you know one a year so there's like
*  there's been 200 physicists who have won the Nobel Prize since 1900 and and so that's
*  you know the aim so things just have to fall right so your goal cannot be to win a Nobel Prize
*  wasn't my dream it's a it's a tremendous for science I mean why the Nobel Prize for a guy that
*  made dynamite and stuff is you know what it is it's a long story but it's the one day a year where
*  actually the science that people have done is all over the world and so forth forget about the
*  people again you know it is really good for for science celebrating science it celebrates science
*  for you know several days different fields you know chemistry medicine and so forth and
*  everybody doesn't understand everything about these are generally fairly abstract but then
*  these are generally fairly abstract but then it's you know it's on the front page of newspapers
*  around the world so it's really good for science it's not easy to get science on the front page of
*  the New York Times it's not there should be but it's not and so the Nobel Prize is important in
*  that way it's otherwise you know I have a certain celebrity that I didn't have before and
*  and now you get to be a celebrity that advertises science it's a mechanism to
*  to remind us how incredible well how much credit science deserves and everything well it
*  has a little bit more one thing I didn't expect which is good is that you know we have a government
*  yeah I'm not picking on ours necessarily but it's true of all governments are not run by scientists
*  in our case it's run by lawyers and businessmen okay and at best they may have an aide or
*  something that knows a little science so so our country is and all countries are hardly
*  hardly take into account science in making decisions yes okay and having a Nobel Prize
*  the people in those positions actually listen so you have more influence I don't care whether
*  it's about global warming or what the issue is there's some influence which is lacking otherwise
*  and people pay attention to what I say if I talk about global warming they wouldn't have
*  before I had the Nobel Prize yeah this is very true you're like the celebrities who talk
*  uh celebrity has power uh celebrity has power and that's and that's a good thing that's a good
*  thing yeah uh singling out people I mean on the other side of it singling out people has all kinds
*  of you know whether it's for academy awards or for this have unfairness and arbitrariness and
*  so forth and so on so uh you know that's the other side of the coin yes like you said especially
*  with the huge experimental projects like this you know it's a large team and it does the nature of
*  the Nobel Prize is it singles out a few individuals to represent the team yeah
*  nevertheless it's a beautiful thing uh what are ways to improve LIGO in the future increases
*  sensitivity I've seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating is are you interested in them
*  sort of looking I'm not speaking about five years perhaps you could speak to the next five years
*  but also the next hundred years yeah so let me let me talk to both the instrument and the science
*  sure so that's they go hand in hand I mean the thing that I said is if we make it better
*  we see more kinds of weaker objects and we do astronomy okay uh we're very motivated to make
*  a new instrument which will be a big step the next step like making a new kind of telescope or something
*  and the ideas of what that instrument should be haven't converged yet there's different ideas
*  in Europe they've done more work to kind of develop the ideas but they're different from ours and we
*  have ideas so but I think over the next few years we'll develop those the idea is to make an
*  instrument that's at least 10 times better than what we have what we can do with this instrument
*  10 times better than that 10 times better means you can look 10 times further out
*  10 times further out is a thousand times more volume so you're seeing much much more of the
*  universe the big change is that if you can see far out you for you see further back in history
*  yeah you're traveling back in time yeah and so we can start to do what we call cosmology instead of
*  astronomy or astrophysics cosmology is really the study of the evolution of the oh interesting yeah
*  and uh so then you can start to hope to get to the important problems having to do with uh
*  how the universe began how it evolved and so forth which we really only study now with
*  optical instruments or um uh electromagnetic waves and early in the universe those were
*  blocked because basically it wasn't transparent so the photons couldn't get out when everything was
*  too dense what do you think sorry on this tangent what do you think an understanding of gravitational
*  waves from earlier in the universe can help us understand about the big bang and all that kind
*  of stuff yeah that's that's so but it's a non it's a it's a it's another perspective on the thing is
*  is there some insights you think could be revealed just to help a layman understand sure first we
*  don't understand we use the word big bang we don't understand the physics of what the big bang itself
*  was um so i think um my my and in the early stage there were particles and there was a huge amount
*  of gravity and mass being made and so um the big the so so i'll say two things one is how did it all
*  start how did it happen i'll give you at least one example that we don't understand what we should
*  understand we don't know why we're here yes no we do not i don't mean it philosophically
*  i mean in terms of physics okay now what do i mean by that if i go into my laboratory at
*  cern or somewhere and i collide particles together put energy together i make as much anti-matter as
*  matter right anti-matter then annihilates matter and makes energy so in the early universe there
*  you made somehow somehow a lot of matter and anti-matter but there was an asymmetry somehow
*  there was more matter and anti-matter than matter and anti-matter annihilated each other at least
*  that's what we think and there was mad only matter left over and we live in a universe that we see
*  this all matter we don't have any idea we have an ideas but we don't have any we don't have any way
*  to understand that at the present time with the physics that we know can ask a dumb question
*  does anti-matter have anything like a gravitational field to send signals so how how does this
*  asymmetry of matter anti-matter could be investigated or further understood by observing
*  gravitational fields or weirdnesses in gravitational fields i i think that in principle if there were
*  you know anti-neutron stars instead of just neutron stars we would see
*  different kind of signals but it didn't get to that it's we live in a universe that we've done
*  enough looking because we don't see anti-matter anti-protons anywhere no matter what we look at
*  that it's all made out of matter there is no anti-matter except when we go in our laboratories
*  so but when we go in our laboratories we make as much anti-matter as matter so there's something
*  about the early universe that made this asymmetry so we can't even explain why we're here that's
*  what i meant yeah physics physics-wise not you know not in terms of how we evolved and all that
*  kind of stuff so so there might be inklings of some of the physics that gravitational so
*  so gravitational waves don't get obstructed like light so i said light only goes to 300,000 years
*  so it goes back to the beginning so if you could study the early universe with gravitational waves
*  we can't do that yet then it took 400 years to be able to do that with optical but then you can
*  really understand the very maybe understand the very early universe so in terms of questions like
*  why we're here or what the big bang was we should be we can in principle study that with
*  gravitational waves so to keep moving in this direction it's a unique kind of way to understand
*  our universe so you think there's more no-but-priced level ideas to be discovered in relation to
*  i'd be shocked if there gravitational waves if there isn't not even going to that which is a very
*  long-range problem but i think that we only see with electromagnetic waves four percent of what's
*  out there there must be we looked for things that we knew should be there there should be
*  be
*  i would be shocked if there wasn't physics objects science and with gravity that doesn't show up in
*  everything we do with telescopes so i think we're just limited by not having powerful enough
*  instruments yet to do this do you have a preference i keep seeing this
*  uh e lisa idea yeah is it do you have a preference for earthbound or space fairing
*  mechanisms for they're complementary it's a little bit like signal it's a it's completely
*  analogous to what's been done in astronomy right so astronomy from the time of gallileo
*  was done with visible light yeah astro the big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are
*  because we have instruments that look at the infrared microwave ultraviolet and so forth so
*  looking at different wavelengths has been important basically going into space means that
*  we'll look at instead of the audio band which we look at as we said on the earth's surface
*  we'll look at lower frequencies it's so it's completely complementary and it starts to be
*  looking at different frequencies just like we do with astronomy isn't it a little it seems almost
*  incredible to me engineering wise just like on earth to send something that's kilometers across
*  into uh into space is that is that harder to engineer as the then it actually is a little
*  different it's three satellites separated by hundreds of thousands of kilometers
*  and they send a laser beam from one to the other and if they the distant if the triangle
*  changes shape a little bit they detect that from a graph did you say hundreds of thousands of
*  kilometers yeah sending lasers to each other
*  okay it's just engineering
*  uh it's possible though uh yes yes okay
*  that's that's just incredible because they have to maintain i mean the precision here is probably
*  there there might be some more what is it maybe noise is a smaller problem
*  i guess there's no vibration to to to worry about like seismic stuff so getting away from
*  earth maybe you get away from yeah those parts are easier they don't have to measure it as
*  accurately at low frequencies uh but they have a lot of tough engineering problems the the in order
*  to detect that the the gravitational waves affect things the sensors have to be what we call free
*  masses just like ours are isolated from the earth they have to isolate it from the satellite
*  and that's a hard problem they have to do that pretty not as well as we have to do it but
*  very well and uh they've done a test mission and the engineering seems to be at least in
*  principle in hand this will be in the 2030s when 2030s yeah this is incredible this is uh
*  this is this is incredible uh let me ask about black holes um yeah so what we're talking about
*  is observing uh orbiting black holes uh that i get i saw the terminology of like binary black hole
*  systems is that's that's when they're the one that's when they're dancing okay going around
*  each other just like the earth around the sun okay is that weird that there's black holes going
*  around each other so the finding binary systems of stars is similar to finding binary systems of
*  or black holes well they were once stars so um so we haven't said what what a black hole is
*  physically yet yeah what's a black hole so black hole is a is first it's a mathematical concept or
*  a physical concept and that is a region of space so it's simply a region of space where
*  the curvature of space time meaning the gravitational field is so strong
*  that nothing can get out yeah including light and there's light gets bent in gravitational if the
*  gravitation's if the space time is warped enough and so even light gets bent around and stays in
*  it so that's concept of a black hole so it's not a and maybe you can make maybe it's a that's a
*  concept that didn't say how they come about and there could be different ways they come about
*  the ones that we are seeing there's a we're not sure that's what we're trying to learn now is
*  what they but the general expectation is that they come the black these black holes happen
*  when a star dies so what does that mean that a star dies what happens a star like our sun
*  basically makes heat and light by fusion it's made of and as it burns it burns up the hydrogen
*  and then the helium and then and slowly works its way up to the heavier and heavier elements that
*  are in the star and when it gets up to iron the fusion process doesn't work anymore and so the
*  stars die and that happens to stars and then they do what's called a supernova what happens then is
*  that a star is a delicate balance between an outward pressure from fusion and light and burning
*  and an inward pressure of gravity trying to pull the masses together once it burns itself out it
*  goes and it collapses and that's a supernova when it collapses all the mass that was there is in a
*  very much smaller space and if a star if you do the calculations if a star is big enough
*  that can create a strong enough gravitational field to make a black hole
*  our sun won't it's too small too small and we don't know exactly what it but it's usually
*  thought that a star has to be at least three times as big as our sun to make a black hole but
*  that's the physical way there you can make black holes that's the first
*  explanation that one would give for the for what we see but it's not necessarily true we're not
*  sure yet what we see in terms of for the origins of black holes no the black holes that we see
*  in gravitational waves so the but you're also looking for the ones who are binary solar systems
*  so they're binary systems but they could have been made from binary stars so there's binary
*  stars around so that's so that's so the first explanation is that that's what they are
*  gotcha other explanation but but what we see has some puzzles this is kind of the way science works
*  I guess yeah we see heavier ones than up to we've seen one system that was 140 times the mass of our
*  own sun already that's not believed to be possible with the parent being a big star because big stars
*  can only be so big or they are unstable it's just the the fact that they live in an environment that
*  makes them unstable so the fact that we see bigger ones they maybe come from something else it's
*  possible that they were made in a different way by little ones eating each other up or maybe they
*  were made or maybe they came with a big bang the prime what we call primordial which means they're
*  really different they came from that we don't know at this point if they came with a big bang then
*  maybe they account for what we call dark matter or some of it like there was a lot of them if they
*  came with it and because there's a lot of dark matter yeah but will gravitational waves give you
*  any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating we think that if we see the distributions
*  enough of them the distributions of their masses the distributions of their how they're spinning
*  so we can actually measure when they're going around each other whether they're spinning you
*  know like this or direction of the spin or no the orientation whether the whole system has any
*  wobbles what we so this is this is now okay we're doing that and then you're constantly kind of
*  crawling back and back and and we're crawling back in time and seeing how many there are as we go back
*  and so do they point back so you're like uh what is that discipline called a cartography or
*  something you're like mapping this the early universe via the lens of gravitational waves
*  not yet the early universe but at least back earlier yeah right so um so black holes are this
*  mathematical phenomenon but they come about in different ways we have a huge black hole
*  at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies those probably were made some other way we don't
*  know when the galaxies themselves had to do with the formation of galaxies we we don't really know
*  so the fact that we use the word black hole the origin of black holes might be quite different
*  depending on how they happen they just have to in the end have a gravitational field that
*  will bend everything in how do you feel about black holes as a human being there's a there's
*  this thing that's nearly infinitely dense can doesn't let light light escape isn't that kind
*  of terrifying feels like the stuff in nightmares i think it's it's an opportunity to to do what
*  exactly so uh like the early universe is an opportunity if we can study the early universe
*  we can learn things like i told you and here again we have an embarrassing situation in physics yes
*  we have two wonderful theories of physics one based on quantum mechanics quantum field theory
*  and we can go to a big accelerator like a cern and smash particles together and almost explain
*  anything that happens beautifully using quantum field theory and quantum mechanics
*  then we have another theory of physics called general relativity which is what we've been
*  talking about most of the time which is fantastic at describing uh things at high velocities long
*  distances you know uh and so forth so that's not the way it's supposed to be we're trying to create
*  a theory of physics not two theories of physics so we have an embarrassment that we have two
*  different theories of physics people have tried to make a unified theory what they call a unified
*  theory you've heard those words for decades uh they still haven't that's been primarily
*  done theoretically or tried they people actively do that my personal belief is that the like much
*  of physics we need some clues so we need some experimental evidence so where is there a place
*  if we go to cern and do those experiments gravitational waves or general relativity don't
*  matter if we go to study you know our black holes elementary particle physics doesn't matter
*  we're studying these huge objects so where might we have a place where both phenomenon have to be
*  satisfied an example is black holes inside black holes yeah so we can't do that today
*  but when i think of black hole it's a potential treasure chest of understanding the fundamental
*  problems of physics and maybe can give us clues to how we bring to the embarrassment of having
*  two theories of physics together that's my own from romantic what's the worst that could happen
*  it's so enticing just go in and look do you think uh how far are we away from figuring out the unified
*  uh theory of physics a theory of everything i i think what's your sense who will solve it like
*  what discipline will solve it yeah uh i i think uh so little progress has been made uh
*  without more experimental clues as i said that we're not uh we're just not able to
*  to say that we're close without some clues the best the closest the most popular theory these days
*  that might lead to that is called string theory yeah the problem with string theory is it works
*  it solves a lot of beautiful mathematical problems we have in physics and and uh it's it's uh very
*  satisfying theoretically but it has almost no predictive maybe no predictive ability because
*  it is a theory that works in 11 dimensions we live in a physical world of three space and one time
*  dimension in order to make predictions in our world with string theory you have to somehow get
*  rid of these other seven dimensions that's done mathematically by saying they curl up on each other
*  on scales that are too small to affect anything here but how you do that and that's okay that's
*  an okay argument but how you do that is not unique so that means if i start with that theory and i go
*  to our world here i can't uniquely go to it which means it's not predictive it's not predictive
*  and that's that's actually and that's a killer that's a killer and string theory is it seems
*  like from my outsider's perspective has lost favor over the years perhaps because of this very yeah
*  it's a lack of predictive power i mean that science has to connect to something where you make
*  predictions as beautiful as it as it might be so i don't think we're close i think we need
*  some experimental clues it may be that information on something we don't understand presently at all
*  like dark energy or probably not dark matter but dark energy or something might give us some ideas
*  but i i don't think we're i can't envision right now in the short term meaning you know the horizon
*  that we can see how we're going to bring these two theories together a kind of
*  two-part question maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways one question is do you have
*  hope that humans will colonize the the galaxy so expand out become a multi-planetary species
*  another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion perspective do you think we'll
*  come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light or maybe faster than the speed of light
*  which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier to to expand out into the into the universe yeah
*  well i i think you know we're not that's very futuristic i think we're not that far
*  from being able to make a one-way trip to mars that's a that's then a question of
*  whether people are willing to send somebody on a one-way trip but oh i think they are i think
*  there's a lot of the explorer is burnt bright yeah yeah exactly willing to die so the opportunity
*  to explore new territory yeah so uh you know with this this recent landing on mars is pretty
*  impressive they have a little helicopter they're gonna fly around you can imagine
*  you can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have i don't think civilizations
*  colonizing i can envision but i i can envision something more like the south pole we haven't
*  colonized uh antarctica because it's all ice and cold and so forth but we have
*  stations so we have a station that's self-sustaining at the south pole that i've been there it has
*  wow really yeah what's that like uh and because that that there's parallels there
*  to go to mars it's fantastic it's what's the journey like the journey involves going
*  the south pole station is uh run in the u.s by by the national science foundation
*  i went because i was on the national science board that runs the national science foundation
*  and so you get a vip trip if you're healthy enough to the south pole to see it uh which i took
*  uh you fly from the u.s to australia to christ church in australia southern australia and
*  from there you fly to mcmurdo station which is on the coast and it's the station with about a
*  thousand people right on the coast of antarctica it's about a seven or eight hour flight and they
*  can't predict the weather so when when i flew from christ church to mcmurdo station they tell
*  you in advance you do it in a military aircraft they tell you in advance that they can't predict
*  whether they can land because they have to land on uh that's an ice yeah and so about halfway the
*  pilot got on and said uh sorry this is uh they call it a boomerang flight you know boomerang goes
*  out and goes back so we had to stay a little while in christ church but then we eventually went to
*  mcmurdo station and then uh flew to the south pole the south pole itself
*  is uh when i was there it was minus 51 degrees that was summer uh it uh zero humidity and um uh
*  and it's about 11 000 feet altitude because it's never warm enough for anything to melt so it
*  doesn't snow very much but it's about 11 000 feet of snowpack so you land in a place that's high
*  altitude um cold as could be and uh dry and incredibly dry which means you have a physical
*  adjustment uh the um place itself is uh it's fantastic they have this great
*  station there they do astronomy at the south pole nature wise is it beautiful
*  what's the is what's the experience like or is it like visiting any town
*  no it's very small there's only um less than 100 people there even when i was there
*  you know there were about 50 or 60 there and in the winter there's less half of that
*  their winter when it gets real cold it gets really cold yeah and but it's but it's it's a station i
*  i think and that's i mean we haven't gone beyond that uh on the coast of antarctica they have
*  greenhouses and they're self-sustaining in mcmurdo station but we haven't really settled
*  more than that kind of thing in antarctica which is a big uh a country or you know
*  big plot a big piece of land so i don't i can't envision kind of colonizing at people living
*  so much as much as i can see uh the equivalent of the south pole station well in in the computing
*  world there's a idea of um you know backing up your data and then you want to do off-site backup
*  you know to make sure that if the whole thing burns if your whole house burns down
*  that you can have a backup off-site of the data i think the difference between antarctica and uh
*  and mars is mars is a off-site backup that if we have nuclear war whatever the heck might happen
*  here on earth it'd be nice to have a backup elsewhere and uh be nice to have a large enough
*  colony where we sent a variety of people except like uh a few silly astronauts in suits you know
*  have an actual vibrant um get a few get a few musicians and artists up there get a few uh
*  maybe like one or two computer scientists those are essential maybe even a physicist so so i'm
*  not sure you know maybe not so that comes back to something you talked about earlier which is
*  fermi the paradox family's paradox because you talked about having to escape yeah but and so the
*  missing one one number you don't know how to use in fermi's calculation or drake who's done it
*  better is how long do civilizations last yeah before they are we you know we've barely gotten
*  to where we can communicate with electricity and magnetism and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out
*  pretty soon so are you hopeful in general like you think we've got another couple hundred years at
*  least or are you worried well i know i'm i'm i'm hopeful but i don't know if i'm hopeful in the
*  long term you know if you say you know uh are we able to to go for another couple thousand years
*  i'm not sure i you know i think we have where we where we started the fact that we can do things
*  that don't allow us to kind of keep going or there can be whether it you know ends up being a virus
*  that we create or ends up being the equivalent of nuclear war or something else uh it's not clear
*  that we can control things well enough so speaking of really cold conditions and uh not being hopeful
*  and eventual suffering and destruction of the human species let's let me ask you about russian
*  literature you mentioned uh how's that for transition i'm doing my best here you uh you
*  mentioned that you used to love literature when you were younger and you were even um or hoping to
*  be a writer yourself that was the motivation and some of the books i've seen that you listed
*  that were inspiring to you was was from russian literature like uh i think tolstoy dostoevsky
*  solzhenitsyn yeah right um maybe in general you can speak to your fascination with russian
*  literature or yeah in general what you picked up from those i i'm not surprised you picked up on
*  the russian literature i'm sorry your background but that's okay uh when i when i when i you should
*  be surprised that didn't make the entire conversation about this that's that's the real surprise when
*  when uh yeah i didn't really become a a physicist or want to go in science until i started college
*  so when i was younger i i was good at math and that kind of stuff but i didn't really i came
*  from a family i didn't know what he went to college and i didn't have any mentors so but i'd like to
*  read when i was really young and so when i was very young i i read i always carried around a
*  pocketbook and read it and uh my mother read these mystery stories and i got bored by those eventually
*  and then i discovered real literature i don't know at what age but about 12 or 13 and so then i started
*  reading uh good literature and there's nothing better than russian literature of course and
*  thank you reading reading uh good literature so i uh i uh read quite a bit of russian literature
*  at that time uh and uh so you asked me about the well i don't know i'll say a few words said
*  dostavsky so what what about dostavsky for me um dostavsky was important into i mean i've read a
*  lot of literature because it's kind of the other thing i do with my life and he made two incredible
*  in addition to his own literature he influenced literature tremendously by having uh i don't know
*  how to pronounce polyphony so he's the first real serious author that had multiple narrators
*  and that's a that he absolutely is the first and he also was the first um
*  he began existential literature so uh the most important book that i've read in the last year
*  when i've been forced to be isolated was existential literature it was i decided to reread
*  uh camus the plague oh yeah that's a great book it's a great book and it's right now to read it
*  it's fantastic i think that book is about love actually a love for humanity it is but it has all
*  the it has all the you should if you haven't read it in recent years i had read it before of course
*  but to read it during this because it's about a plague so it's really fantastic to read down but
*  that reminds me of you know he was a great existentialist but the beginning of existential
*  literature was dostavsky so in addition to his own you know great novels he had a tremendous impact
*  on on on literature and there's also for dostavsky unlike most other existentialists
*  he was at least in part religious i mean their uh religiosity permeated his idea i mean one of
*  my favorite books of his is the idiot and his which is a christ-like figure in there well there's
*  prince miskin is that his name michigan yeah michigan yeah yeah that's that's one uh thing about
*  you read in english i presume yeah yeah so that's the names that's what gets a lot of people is
*  there's so many names so hard to pronounce you have to remember all of them it's like uh you have
*  the same problem but he was a great character so that yeah i kind of uh i have a connection with
*  him because i often then the title of the book you deal with the idiot is i kind of i often call
*  myself an idiot is that how i feel i feel so naive about this world and i i'm not sure i'm not sure
*  why that is maybe it's genetic or so on but i um i have a connection the spiritual connection
*  to that character to michigan to michigan yeah that you're just in it but he was far from an idiot
*  no we in some sense in some sense but in another sense maybe not of this in another sense he was
*  yeah i mean but he was a bumbler yeah but uh you also mentioned solzhenitsyn very interesting
*  and he always confused me of course he was really um really important in uh writing about the
*  stalin and first getting in trouble and then he later he is he wrote about stalin in a way
*  i forget what it was what the book was in a way that was very critical of lennon
*  mm-hmm yeah he uh he's evolved through the years and he actually showed support for putin eventually
*  it was a very interesting uh transition he took no uh journey he took through thinking about
*  russia and the soviet union but i think what i get from him is basic um it's like uh victor
*  frankl has this man search for meaning i have a similar kind of sense of um of the cruelty of
*  human nature yeah cruelty of indifference yeah but also the ability to find happiness in the
*  small joys of life that that's something there's nothing like a prison camp that makes you realize
*  you could still be happy with a very very little well yeah he was he his description of kind of
*  how to make uh how to go through a day and actually enjoy it in a prison camp is pretty
*  amazing yeah oh and some prison camp i mean it's the worst of the worst the worst of the worst
*  and also just uh i you know you do think about the role of authoritarian states and um
*  in you know like hopeful idealistic systems somehow leading to the suffering of millions
*  and i you know this might be arguable but i think a lot of people believe that stalin
*  i think genuinely believed that he's doing good for the world and uh he wasn't it's a very valuable
*  lesson that um even evil people think they're doing good uh otherwise it's too difficult to
*  do the evil the best way to do evil is to believe uh framing in a way like you're doing good
*  and then this is this is a very clear picture of that which is the the gulags
*  nassol jenison is one of the best people to reveal that yeah
*  the most recent thing i read it isn't actually fiction uh was the the woman i can't remember
*  her name who got the noble prize about within the last five years i don't know whether she's
*  ukrainian or russian but their interviews have you read that interview of ukrainian survivors of
*  well i think she may be originally ukrainian it's so the books written in russian and translated
*  in english and many of the interviews are in moscow and places but she won the noble prize
*  within the last five years or so but what's interesting is that uh these are people of all
*  different ages all different uh occupations and so forth and they're reflecting on the
*  their reaction to basically the present soviet system the system they live with before there's
*  a lot of uh looking back by a lot of them with uh uh well uh it being much better before
*  hmm yeah i don't know what i in america we think we know the right answer what it means to be
*  to build a better world i'm not so sure i think we're all just trying to figure it out
*  yeah there's doing our best i think you're right
*  is there advice you can give to young people today besides reading russian literature at a young age
*  um about how to find their way in life how to find success in in career or just life in general
*  i i just my own belief it may not be very deep but i believe it i think you should follow your
*  dreams and you should have dreams and follow your dreams if you can to the extent that you can and
*  we spend a lot of our time doing something with ourselves in my case physics in your case i don't
*  know whatever it is machine learning and this uh uh we should yeah should have fun what was wait
*  wait wait dream follow your dreams what uh what dream did you have because the well well originally
*  i was that because you didn't follow your dream i thought that's it i changed along the way i was
*  going to be but i changed what happened that was what happened oh i read i decided to take the most
*  serious literature course in my high school which was a mistake i'd probably be a second right writer
*  now and uh could be a noble prize-winning writer and uh uh the uh the book that we read even though
*  i had read russian novels i was 15 i think uh cured me from being a novelist destroyed your
*  dream yes cured you okay what was the book moby dick okay so why moby dick yeah why so i've read
*  it since and it's a great novel maybe it's as good as the russian i've never made it through i i law
*  is too well too long okay your words are gonna mesh with what i say excellent and you may have
*  the same problem at uh older that's why i'm not a writer it may be so the problem is moby dick is
*  what i remember was is there was a chapter that was maybe 100 pages long all describing
*  us why there was ahab and the white whale and it was the battle between ahab with his
*  wooden peg leg and the white whale and there was a chapter that was 100 pages long in my memory i
*  don't know how long it really was uh that described in detail the great white whale and what he was
*  doing and what his fins were like and this and that and it was so incredibly boring the word you used
*  that i thought if this is great literature screw it okay now why did i have a problem i know now
*  in reflection because i still read a lot and i i read that novel um you know after i was 30 or 40
*  years old and the problem was simple i i diagnosed what the problem was i that novel in contrast
*  uh the russian novels which are very realistic and you know point of view is one huge metaphor
*  oh yeah at 15 years old i probably didn't know the word and i certainly didn't know the meaning
*  of a metaphor yeah like why do i care about a fish why are you telling me all about this
*  exactly it's one big metaphor so reading it later as a metaphor i could really enjoy it but the
*  teacher gave me the wrong book or maybe it was the right book because i went into physics and so
*  but it was it was truly i think i may oversimplify but it was really that i was too young to read that
*  book because not too young to read the russian novels interestingly but too young to read that
*  because i i probably didn't even know the word and i certainly didn't understand it as a metaphor
*  well in terms of fish i recommend people read old man in the sea much shorter much better still
*  metaphor though so but you can read it just as a story about a guy catching a fish and it's still
*  fun to read uh i had the same experience as you not with moby dick but later in college i took a
*  course on james joe's don't ask me why as majoring in computer science i took a course on james joe's
*  and i was kept being told that he is widely considered by many considered to be the greatest
*  literary writer of the 20th century and i kept reading like i think so his short stories the
*  dead i think it's called was very good well not very good but pretty good and then you'll see
*  very good it is very good only the dead the final story still rings with me today but then ulysses
*  was i i got through ulysses with the help of some cliff notes and so on but uh and so i did ulysses
*  and then finnegans wake the moment i started finnigan's wake i said this this is stupid
*  this is that's when i went full into like um i don't know that's why i went full kafka
*  bakowski like people who just talk about the darkness of the human condition in the fewest
*  words possible and without any of the music of language um so it was a turning point
*  as well i i wonder i wonder when is the right time to do the to appreciate the beauty of language
*  like even shakespeare i was very much off put by shakespeare in high school
*  and only later i started to appreciate its its value in the same way let me ask you a ridiculous
*  question okay um i mean because you've read ross literature let me ask this one last question
*  uh i might be lying there might be a couple more but what do you think is the meaning of this whole
*  thing you're uh you got a noble prize for uh looking out into the trying to reach back into
*  the beginning of the universe listening to the gravitational waves uh but that still doesn't
*  answer the why why are we here beyond just the yeah the matter and anti-matter the philosophical
*  question the philosophical question about the meaning of life i'm probably not really good at
*  um i think that uh the individual meaning uh i i would say rather simplistically is whether you've
*  made a difference a positive difference i'd say for anything besides yourself
*  meaning you could have been important to other people or you could have discovered
*  gravitational waves that matters to other people or something but something beyond just
*  existing on the earth as an individual so your life has meaning if you have affected
*  either knowledge or people or something beyond yourself do you that's a simplistic
*  statement but it's about as good as i can have that's that may be in all of its simplicity
*  it may be very true do you think about uh does it make you sad that this ride ends
*  do you think about your mortality yeah uh are you afraid of it i'm not exactly afraid of it but
*  saddened by it and uh uh you know i'm old enough to know that i've lived most of my life and uh
*  uh i enjoy being alive i can imagine being sick and not wanting to be alive but i'm not and so uh
*  i'm not a good ride yeah i'm not and i'm not happy to see it come to an end i'd like to see it
*  prolong but uh i i don't uh i i don't fear the dying itself or that kind of thing it's more i'd
*  like to prolong uh what is i think a good life that i'm living and still living that's kind of
*  it's sad to think that the the finiteness of it
*  is the thing that makes it special and it and also sad to um to me at least it's kind of
*  it's kind of i don't think i'm using too strong of a word but it's kind of terrifying the uncertainty
*  of it the mystery of it you know the the mystery of death the mystery of it yeah of death well
*  we're talking about the mystery of black holes that's somehow distant that's somehow out there
*  and the mystery of our own but but but even life the mystery of consciousness i find uh so hard
*  to deal with too i mean it's not as painful i mean we're conscious but the whole magic of
*  life we can understand but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth it's pretty
*  it's such it seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that we get to let go of it we'll
*  have to let go of it yeah what do you hope your legacy is as i'm sure they will uh aliens when
*  they visit and humans have destroyed all of uh human civilization aliens read about you in an
*  encyclopedia that will leave behind what do you hope it says well i would i would hope they
*  if to the extent that they evaluated me uh felt that i helped move science forward as a
*  tangible contribution and that uh i served as a good role model for how humans should live their
*  lives and were part of creating one of the most incredible things humans have ever created so yes
*  there's the science that's the firmy thing right uh there's the instrument i guess and the instrument
*  the instrument is a magical creation not just by a human by a collection of humans the collaboration
*  is um that's that's humanity at its best i do hope i do hope we last quite a bit longer but if we don't
*  this is a good thing to remember humans by at least they built that thing that's pretty
*  impressive very this is an amazing conversation thank you so much for wasting your time and
*  explaining uh so many things so well i appreciate your time today thank you
*  thanks for listening to this conversation with barry bearish to support this podcast please check
*  out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you some words from warner heisenberg
*  a theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics
*  not only is the universe stranger than we think it is stranger that we can think
*  thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
