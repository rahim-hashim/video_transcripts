# Climate Change Debate: Bj√∏rn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin | Lex Fridman Podcast #339
**Lex Fridman:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gk9gIpGvSE)
*  people all around the world, their lives have basically depended on fossil fuels.
*  And so the idea that we're going to get people off by making it so expensive that it becomes
*  impossible for them to live good lives is almost morally reprehensible.
*  People who have the most basic science literacy, like who know the most about greenhouse effect,
*  they're at both ends of the spectrum of views on climate, dismissives and alarmed.
*  What is likely the worst effect of climate change?
*  The following is a conversation with Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Refkin on the topic of climate change.
*  It is framed as a debate, but with the goal of having a nuanced conversation,
*  talking with each other, not at each other.
*  I hope to continue having debates like these, including on controversial topics.
*  I believe in the power of conversation to bring people together, not to convince one side or the
*  other, but to enlighten both with the insights and wisdom that each hold.
*  Bjorn Lomborg is the president of Copenhagen Consensus Think Tank and author of False Alarm,
*  Cool It, and Skeptical Environmentalist.
*  Please check out his work at lomborg.com that includes his books, articles, and other writing.
*  Andrew Refkin is one of the most respected journalists in the world on the topic of climate.
*  He's been writing about global environmental change and risk for more than 30 years,
*  20 of it at the New York Times.
*  Please check out his work in the link tree that includes his books, articles, and other writing.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast to support it.
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Refkin.
*  There's a spectrum of belief on the topic of climate change.
*  And the landscape of that spectrum has probably changed over several decades.
*  On one extreme, there's a belief that climate change is a hoax.
*  It's not human caused.
*  To pile on top of that, there's a belief that institutions, scientific, political, the media,
*  are corrupt and are kind of constructing this fabrication.
*  That's one extreme.
*  And then the other extreme, there's a level of alarmism about the catastrophic impacts
*  of climate change that lead to the extinction of human civilization.
*  So not just economic costs, hardship, suffering, but literally the destruction of the human species
*  in the short term.
*  Okay, so that's the spectrum.
*  And I would love to find the center.
*  And my sense is, and the reason I wanted to talk to the two of you, aside from the humility
*  with which you approach this topic, is I feel like you're close to the center and are on
*  different sides of that center, if it's possible to define the center.
*  Like there is a political center for center left and center right.
*  Of course, it's very difficult to define.
*  But can you help me define what the extremes are again, as they have changed over the years,
*  what they are today, and where's the center?
*  Oh, boy.
*  Well, in a way, on this issue, I think there is no center except in this.
*  If you're looking on social media or if you're looking on TV, there are people who are trying
*  to fabricate the idea of this as a single question.
*  And that's the first mistake.
*  We are developing a new relationship with the climate system.
*  And we're rethinking our energy systems.
*  And those are very disconnected in so many ways that connect around climate change.
*  But the first way to me to overcome this idea of there is this polarized universe around this
*  issue is to step back and say, well, what is this actually?
*  And when you do, you realize it's kind of an uncomfortable collision between old energy norms
*  and a growing awareness of how the planet works.
*  That if you keep adding gases that are invisible, it's the bubbles in beer.
*  If you keep adding that to the atmosphere, because it accumulates, that will change everything.
*  It is changing everything for thousands of years.
*  It's already happening.
*  What do you mean by bubbles in beer?
*  CO2, carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.
*  Why beer?
*  Look, because I like beer.
*  It's also in Coca-Cola.
*  We were talking about Cola before.
*  And so it's innocuous.
*  We grew up with this idea is CO2, unless you're trapped in a room suffocating,
*  is an innocuous gas.
*  It's plant food.
*  It's beer bubbles.
*  And the idea we can swiftly transition to a world where that gas is a pollutant,
*  regulated, tamped down from the top is fantastical.
*  Having looked at this for 35 years, I brought along one of my tokens.
*  This is my 1988 cover story on global warming.
*  The greenhouse effect discovered in 1988.
*  Jim Hansen, the famous American climate scientist.
*  Really, he stimulated this article by doing this dramatic testimony in a Senate committee
*  that summer in May, actually spring, late spring.
*  It was a hot day and he got headlines and this was the result.
*  But it's complicated.
*  Look what we were selling on the back cover.
*  What you see is tobacco.
*  Cigarettes.
*  Looking back at my own career on the climate question, it's no longer a belief fight over
*  is global warming real or not.
*  You say, well, what kind of energy future do you want?
*  That's a very different question than stop global warming.
*  And when you look at climate, actually, I had this learning journey on my reporting
*  where I started out with this as the definition of the problem.
*  The 70s and 80s, pollution was changing things that were making things bad.
*  So really focusing on the greenhouse effect and the pollution.
*  But what I missed, the big thing that I missed of the first 15 years of my reporting from 1988
*  through about 2007, when I was at the New York Times in the middle there,
*  was that we're building vulnerability to climate hazards at the same time.
*  So climate is changing, but we're changing too.
*  And where we are here in Austin, Texas is a great example.
*  Flash flood alley named in the 1920s west of here.
*  Everyone forgot about flash floods, built these huge developments along these river basins.
*  Then one side starts saying global warming, global warming.
*  And the other side is not recognizing that we built willfully, greedily,
*  vulnerability in places of utter hazard.
*  Same things played out in Pakistan and in Fort Myers, Florida.
*  And you start to understand that we're creating a landscape of risk
*  as climate is changing.
*  Then it feels, oh my God, that's more complex, right?
*  But it also gives you more action points.
*  It's like, okay, well, we know how to design better.
*  We know that today's coasts won't be tomorrow's coasts.
*  Work with that.
*  And then let's chart an energy future at the same time.
*  So the story became so different, it didn't become like a story you could package into a magazine
*  article or the like.
*  And it just led me to a whole different way of even my journalism changing.
*  My journalism changed over time.
*  So I don't fight the belief, disbelief fight anymore.
*  I think it's actually kind of a waste.
*  It's a good way to start the discussion because that's where we're at.
*  But this isn't about, to me, going forward from where we're at,
*  isn't about tipping that balance back toward the center so much as finding opportunities
*  to just do something about this stuff.
*  What do you think, Bjorn?
*  Do you agree that it's multiple questions in one big question?
*  Do you think it's possible?
*  Define the center.
*  Where is the center?
*  I think it's wonderful to hear Andy sort of unconstruct the whole conversation and say
*  we should be worried about different things.
*  And I think that's exactly, or we should be worried about things in a different way
*  that makes it much more useful.
*  And I think that's exactly the right way to think about it.
*  On the other hand, that was also where you kind of ended.
*  We are stuck in a place where this very much is the conversation right now.
*  And so I think in one sense, certainly the people who used to say,
*  oh, this is not happening, they're very, very small and diminishing crowd,
*  and certainly not right.
*  But on the other hand, I think to an increasing extent,
*  we've gotten into a world where a lot of people really think this is the end of the times.
*  So the OECD did a new survey of all OECD countries, and it's shocking.
*  So it shows that 60% of all people in the OECD, so the rich world,
*  believes that global warming will likely or very likely lead to the extinction of mankind.
*  And that's scary in a very, very clear way, because look, if this really is true,
*  if global warming is this meteor hurtling towards Earth,
*  and we're going to be destroyed in 12 years or whatever the number is today,
*  then clearly we should care about nothing else.
*  We should just be focusing on making sure that that asteroid,
*  we should send up Bruce Willis and get this done with.
*  But that's not the way it is.
*  This is not actually what the UN climate panel tells us or anything else.
*  So I think it's not so much about arcing against the people who are saying it's a hoax.
*  That's not really where I am.
*  I don't think that's where Andy or really where the conversation is.
*  But it is a question of sort of pulling people back from this end of the world conversation,
*  because it really skews our way that we think about problems.
*  Also, if you really think this is the end of time and you only have 12 years,
*  nothing that can only work in 13 years can be considered.
*  And the reality of most of what we're talking about in climate and certainly our vulnerability,
*  certainly our energy system is going to be half to a full century.
*  And so when you talk to people and say, well, but we're really going to go a lot more renewable
*  in the next half century, they look at you and like, but that's what 38 years too late.
*  And I get that.
*  But so I think in your question, what I'm trying to do, and I would imagine that's true for you
*  as well, is to try to pull people away from this precipice and this end of the world,
*  and then open it up.
*  And I think Andy did that really well by saying, look, there are so many different sub conversations
*  and we need to have all of them and we need to be respectful of some of these are right in the
*  sort of standard media kind of way, but some of them are very, very wrong and actually means that
*  we end up doing much less good both on climate, but also on all the other problems the world faces.
*  Oh yeah. And it just empowers people too. Those who believe this then just sit back.
*  Even in Adam McKay's movie, the Don't Look Up movie, there was that sort of nihilist crowd
*  for those who've seen it, who just say, you know, fuck this. And a lot of people have that
*  when something is too big and it just paralyzes you as opposed to giving you these action points.
*  And the other thing is I hate it when economists are right about stuff like that.
*  It doesn't happen all that often though.
*  No, no. There are these phrases like I never knew the words path dependency
*  until probably 10 years ago in my reporting. And it basically says you're in a system,
*  the things around you, how we pass laws, the brokenness of the Senate.
*  We don't have a climate crisis in America. We have a decision crisis
*  as it comes to how the government works or doesn't work. But those big features of our
*  landscape are, it's path dependency. When you screw in a light bulb, even if it's an LED light bulb,
*  it's going into a 113, 120 year old fixture. And actually that fixture is almost designed,
*  if you look at like 19th century gas fixtures, they had the screw in thing.
*  So we're like on this long path dependencies when it comes to energy and stuff like that,
*  you don't just magically transition a car fleet. A car built today will last 40 years. It'll end
*  up in Mexico, sold on a used car, et cetera, et cetera. And so there is no quick fix even if
*  we're true that where things are coming to an end in 13 years or 12 years or eight years.
*  So most people don't believe that climate change is a hoax. So they believe that there is an
*  increase, there's a global warming of a few degrees in the next century. And then maybe
*  debate about what the number of the degrees is. And do most people believe that it's human caused
*  at this time in this history of discussion of climate change? So is that the center still?
*  Is there still debate on this?
*  Yale University, the climate communication group there for like 13 years has done this
*  six Americas study where they've charted pretty carefully and ways that I really find useful
*  what people believe. And we can talk about the word belief in the context of science too, but
*  and they've identified kind of six kinds of us. There's from dismissive to alarmed and with lots
*  of bubbles in between. I think some of those bubbles in between are mostly disengaged people
*  who don't really deal with the issue. And they've shown a drift for sure. There's much more majority
*  now at the alarmed or engaged bubbles than the dismissive bubble. There's a durable,
*  like with vaccination and lots of other issues, there's a durable never anything belief group.
*  But on the reality that humans are contributing to climate change, most Americans when you're
*  asked, ask them. And it also depends on how you write your survey. Think there's a component.
*  And this is also true globally. I mean, when you ask around, I mean, and this is, you know,
*  if you hear the story from the media of 20 years, of course that's what you will believe. And it
*  also happens to be true. I mean, that is what the science, I think, you know, it's perhaps worth
*  saying and it's a little depressing that you always have to say, but I think it's worth saying that
*  I think we both really do accept, you know, the climate panel science and, you know,
*  there's absolutely global warming. It is an issue and it's probably just worthwhile to get it out of
*  the way. It's an issue and it's caused by humans. It's caused by humans. Yeah. Okay. But vulnerability,
*  the losses that are driven by climate related events still predominantly are caused by humans,
*  but on the ground. It's where we build stuff, where we settle. Pakistan,
*  in 1960, I just looked these data up, there were 40 million people in Pakistan. Today there are
*  225 million and a big chunk of them are still rural. They live in the floodplain of the amazing
*  Indus river, which comes down from the Himalayas. Extraordinary 5,000 year history of agriculture
*  there. But when you put 200 million people in harm's way, and this doesn't say anything about
*  the bigger questions about, oh, shame on Pakistan for having more people. It just says the reality
*  is the losses that we see in the news are, and the science finds this. There's a new weather
*  attribution group. It's a WX risk on Twitter. This does pretty good work on how much of what
*  just happened was some tweak in the storm from global warming, from CO2 changing weather.
*  And the media glom onto that as I did in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. But the reports also have a section
*  on, by the way, the vulnerability that was built in this region was a big driver of loss.
*  So discriminating between loss, change in what's happening on the ground, and change in the climate
*  system is never solely about CO2. In fact, Lawrence Bauer, B-O-U-W-E-R, I first wrote on
*  his work in 2010 in the New York Times. And basically in 2010, there was no sign in the data
*  of climate change driving disasters. Climate change is up here. Disasters are on the ground.
*  They depend on how many people are in the way, how much stuff you built in the way.
*  And so far, we've done so much of that so fast in the 20th century particularly,
*  that it completely dominates. It makes it hard, impossible to discriminate how much of that
*  disaster was from the change in weather from global warming.
*  So a function of greenhouse gases to human suffering is unclear.
*  And that's very much in our control, theoretically.
*  I mean, the point I think is exactly right that if you look at the hurricane Iyan that went through
*  Florida, you have a situation where Florida went from what, 600,000 houses in 1940 to 17 million
*  houses. Sorry, 10 million houses, so 17 times more over a period of 80 years. Of course,
*  you're going to have one. Yeah, yeah.
*  You're going to have lots more damage. And many of these houses now have been built on
*  places where you probably shouldn't be building. And so I think a lot of scientists are very
*  focused on saying, can we measure whether global warming had an impact? Which is an interesting
*  science question. I think it's very implausible that eventually we won't be able to say it has
*  an impact. But the real question, it seems to me, is if we actually want to make sure that people
*  are less harmed in the future, what are the levers that we can control? And it turns out that the CO2
*  lever doing something about climate is an incredibly difficult and slightly inefficient way
*  of trying to help these people in the future. Whereas of course, zoning, making sure that you
*  have better housing rules, what is it? Regulations that you maybe don't have people building in the
*  flash flood, what was it called? Flash flood alley.
*  Flash flood alley. Yeah.
*  It's just simple stuff. And because we're so focused on this one issue, it almost feels
*  sacrilegious to talk about these other things that are much more in our power and that we can do
*  something about much quicker and that would help a lot more people. So I think this is going to be
*  a large part of the whole conversation. Yes, climate is a problem, but it's not the only
*  problem. And there are many other things where we can actually have a much, much bigger impact at
*  much lower cost. Maybe we should also remember those.
*  Can you still man the case of Greta, who's a representative of alarmism, that we need that
*  kind of level of alarmism for people to pay attention and to think about climate change?
*  So you said the singular view is not the correct way to look at climate change, just the emissions.
*  But for us to have a discussion, shouldn't there be somebody who's
*  really raising the concern? Can you still man the case for alarmism essentially? Or
*  is there a better term than alarmism? Communication of like, holy shit, we should be thinking about
*  this. So I think I totally understand why Greta Thunberg is doing what she's doing. I have great
*  respect for her because I look at a lot of kids growing up and they're basically being told,
*  you're not going to reach adulthood, or at least you're not going to get very far into adulthood.
*  Of course, this is the meteor hurtling towards Earth and then this is the only thing we should
*  be focusing on. I understand why she's making that argument. I think at the end of the day,
*  it's incorrect and I'm sure we'll get around to talking about that. And one of the things is,
*  of course, her whole generation, I can understand why they're saying, if we're going to be dead in
*  12 years, why would I want to study? Why would I really care about anything? So I totally want to
*  pull Greta and many others out of this end of the world fear, but I totally get why she's doing it.
*  I think she's done a service in the sense that she's gotten more people to talk about climate
*  and that's good because we need to have this discussion. I think it's unfortunate and this
*  is just what happens in almost all policy discussions that they end up being discussions
*  from the extreme groups because it's just more fun on media to have the total deniers and the
*  people who say, we're going to die tomorrow. And it becomes that discussion. It's more a mud
*  wrestling fight. So what do you think? The mud wrestling fight is not useful or is useful for
*  effective science communication on one of the platforms that you're a fan of, which is Twitter?
*  Yeah. I wrote a piece recently on my sustain what column saying, if you go on there for the
*  entertainment value of seeing those knocked down fights, I guess that's useful if that's what
*  you're looking for. The thing I found Twitter invaluable for, but it's a practice. It's just
*  like the workouts you do or it's how do I put this tool to use today? Thinking about energy
*  energy action in poor communities. How do I put this tool today? Learning about what really
*  happened with Ian the hurricane, who was most at risk and how would you build forward better?
*  I hate build back or you can go there and just watch it as an entertainment value. That's not
*  going to get the world anywhere. You don't think entertainment, I wouldn't call it entertainment,
*  but giving voice to the extremes isn't a productive way forward. It seems to push
*  back against the main narrative. It seems to work pretty well in the American system. We think
*  politics is totally broken, but maybe that works that like oscillation back and forth.
*  You need a Greta and you need somebody that pushes back against a Greta to get everybody's
*  attention. The fun of battle over time creates progress.
*  Well, and this gets to the people who focus on communication science. I'm not a scientist. I'm
*  right about this stuff. If you're going to try to prod someone with a warning, like this is three
*  years apart. Nuclear winter. Nuclear winter. We'll talk about that. Global warming. Well,
*  yeah, we'll talk about it. Look at that. This is three years apart in the covers of magazine.
*  But then you have to say to what end if you're not directing people to a basket of things to do.
*  If you want political change, then it would be to support a politician. If you want energy access,
*  it would be to look at this $370 billion the American government just put into play on climate
*  and say, well, how can my community benefit from that? I've been told over and over again by people
*  in government, Jigar Shah, who heads this giant loan program at the energy department. He says,
*  what I need now is like 19,500 people who are worried about climate change. Maybe because Greta
*  got them worried. But here's the thing you could do. You can connect your local government right
*  now with these multimillion dollar loans so you can have electric buses instead of diesel buses.
*  And that's an action pathway. So alarm for the sake of getting attention or clicks
*  to me is not any more valuable than watching an action movie.
*  Dave Korsunsky And again, I think also it very easily ends up skewing our conversation about
*  what are the actual solutions. Because yes, it's great to get rid of the diesel bus, but probably
*  not for the reason people think. It's because diesel buses are really polluting in the air
*  pollution sense. And that is why you should get rid of them. And again, if you really wanted to
*  help people, for instance, with hurricanes, you should have better rules and zoning in Florida,
*  which is a very different outcome. So the mud wrestling fight also gets our attention diverted
*  towards solutions that seem easy, fun. The electric car is a great example of this. The
*  electric car has somehow become almost the sign that I care and I'm really going to do something
*  about climate. Of course, electric cars are great and they're probably part of the solution. And
*  they will actually cut carbon emissions somewhat, but they're an incredibly ineffective way of cutting
*  carbon emissions right now. They're fairly expensive. You have to subsidize them a lot.
*  And they still emit quite a bit of CO2, both because the batteries get produced
*  and because they usually run off of power that's not totally clean.
*  Strong words from Yoran Lawwick. Okay, let's go there. Let's go electric cars. Educate us
*  on the pros and cons of electric cars in this complex picture of climate change. What do you
*  think of the efforts of Tesla and Elon Musk on pushing forward the electric car revolution?
*  Look, electric cars are great. I don't own a car, but I've been driving Tesla.
*  There you go, socially signaling.
*  Yeah. But yeah, I've-
*  We're in Texas, it's okay.
*  ... flew in here, so it's not like I'm in any way a virtuous guy on that path. But look,
*  they're great cars and eventually electric cars will take over a significant part of our driving
*  and that's good because they're more effective. They're probably also going to be cheaper.
*  There's a lot of good opportunities with them, but it's because they've become reified as this
*  thing that you do to fix climate. And right now, they're not really all that great for climate.
*  You need a lot of extra material into the batteries, which is very polluting and it's also,
*  it emits a lot of CO2. A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US.
*  We used to think that they were driven almost as much as a regular car. It turns out that they're
*  more likely driven less than half as much as regular cars. So, 89% of all Americans who have
*  an electric car also have a real car that they use for the long trips and then they use the electric
*  car for short trips.
*  That's true, 89%.
*  89%, yeah. So, the point here is that it's one of these things that become more sort of a virtue
*  signal thing. And again, look, once electric cars are sufficiently cheap that people will want to
*  buy them, that's great and they will do some good for the environment. But in reality,
*  what we should be focusing on is instead of getting people electric cars in rich countries,
*  because we're subsidizing typically in many countries, you actually get a sort of sliding
*  scale. You get more subsidy the more expensive it is. We sort of subsidize this to very rich people
*  to buy very large Teslas to drive around in. Whereas what we should be focusing on is perhaps
*  getting electric motorcycles in third world developing cities where they would do a lot
*  more good. They can actually go as far as you need. There's no worry about running out of
*  and they would obviously, they're much, much more polluting just air pollution wise and they're
*  much cheaper and they use very little battery. So, it's about getting our senses right. But the
*  electric car is not a conversation about is it technically a really good or is it a somewhat good
*  insight. It's more like it's a virtue signal. So, just I work with economists. I'm actually not an
*  economist, but I like to say I claim I kind of am. But the fundamental point is we would
*  say, well, how much does it cost to cut a ton of CO2? And the answer is for most electric cars,
*  we're paying in the order of a thousand, two thousand. Norway they pay up to what $5,000
*  at thereabouts. Huge amount for one ton of CO2. You can right now cut a ton of CO2 for about,
*  what is it? $14 on the Reggie or something. That's the regional greenhouse gas initiative.
*  So, you can basically cut it really, really cheaply. Why would we not want to cut dozens and
*  dozens of tons of CO2 for the same price instead of just cutting one ton? And the simple answer is
*  we only do that because we're so focused on electric.
*  I may interrupt. Typically, European come here in Texas, tell them I can't have my Ford F-150.
*  Now you can have your F-150 Lightning.
*  That's true. I'm just joking. But what do you think about electric cars? If you just link
*  on that moment and this particular element of helping reduce emissions.
*  Well, you talked about the middle in the beginning and I loved moving through the
*  hybrid. Prius was fantastic. It did everything our other sedan did, but it was 60 miles per gallon
*  performance and you don't have range anxiety because it has a regular engine too.
*  We still have a Prius. We also inherited my dad, dear dad's year 2000 Toyota Sienna,
*  which is an old 100,000 mile minivan. And we use it all the time to do the stuff we can't do in the
*  Prius.
*  Like what?
*  Taking stuff to the dump.
*  Oh, you mean in terms of the size of the vehicle?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Size and just convenience factor for a bigger vehicle. I would love a fully electrified
*  transportation world. It's kind of exciting. I think what Elon did with Tesla, I remember way,
*  way back in the day when the first models were coming out, they were very slick Ferrari style
*  cars. And I thought, this is cool. And there's a history of privileged markets testing new
*  technologies and I'm all for that. And I think it's done a huge service prodding so much more R&D.
*  And once GM and Ford started to realize, oh my God, this is a real phenomenon, getting them in
*  the game. There was that documentary who killed the electric car, which seemed to imply that
*  there were fights to keep this tamp down. And it's fundamentally cleaner, fundamentally better.
*  But then you have to manage these bigger questions. If we're going to do a build out here,
*  how do you make it fair? As you were saying, who actually uses transport cars? And Jagir Shah,
*  that guy at the energy department I mentioned, who has all this money to give out,
*  he wants to give loans to... If you had an Uber fleet, those Uber drivers, they're the ones who
*  need electric cars. His work, and there was a recent story in Grist also, said that most of the
*  sales of Teslas are the high end of the market. They're $60,000, $80,000 vehicles.
*  The electric Hummer, there was a data point on that, astonishing data point. The battery in that
*  Hummer weighs more than... I'd have to look it up. It weighs more than a car. Yeah, I think it
*  might have been a Prius. And think of the material cost there. Think of where that battery, the Cobalt
*  and the Lithium, where does this stuff come from? To build this stuff out. I'm all for it, but we
*  have to be honest and clear about that's a new resource rush, like the oil rush back in the
*  early 20th century. And those impacts have to be figured out too. And if they're all big Hummers
*  for rich people, there's so many contrary arguments to that, that I think we have to figure out a way
*  we... I don't like the word we. I use it too much. We all do. We all do.
*  You usually refer when you say we, we humans. We society, we government. Yeah. There has to be some
*  thought and attention put to where you put these incentives so that you get the best use of this
*  technology for the carbon benefit, for the conventional sooty pollution benefit,
*  for the transportation benefit. Can I step back and ask a big question? We mentioned economics,
*  journalism. How does an economist and a climate scientist and a journalist that writes about
*  climate see the world differently? What are the strengths and potential blind spots of each
*  discipline? I mean, that's just sort of just so people may be aware. I think you've fallen
*  to the economics camp a bit. There's climate scientists and there's climate scientists,
*  adjacent people like who hang some of my best friends are climate scientists, which is, I think,
*  where you fall in because you're a journalist, you've been writing it. So you're not completely
*  in the trenches of doing the work. You're just stepping into the trenches every once in a while.
*  So can you speak to that? Maybe Bjorn, what does the world look like to an economist?
*  Let's try to empathize with these beings that... Unfortunately, it's fallen into the
*  disreputable economics. Yeah. So I think the main point that I've been trying for a long time,
*  and I think that's also a little bit what Andy has been talking about. For a very long time,
*  the whole conversation was about what does the science tell us? Is global warming real?
*  And to me, it's much more what can we actually do? What are the policies that we can take
*  and how effective are they going to be? So the conversation we just had about electric cars
*  is a good example of how an economist think about, look, this is not a question about whether you
*  feel morally virtuous or whether you can display how much you care about the environment. This is
*  about how much you actually ended up affecting the world. And the honest answer is that electric
*  cars right now in the next decade or so will have a fairly small impact. And unfortunately, right now,
*  at a very high cost because we're basically subsidizing these things at five or $10,000
*  around the world per car. That's just not really sustainable, but it's certainly not a very great
*  way to cut carbon emissions. So I would be the kind of guy and economists would be the types of
*  people who would say, is there a smarter way where you, for less money, can, for instance,
*  cut more CO2? And the obvious answer is yes. That's what we've seen, for instance, with fracking.
*  The fact that the US went from a lot of coal to a lot of gas because gas became incredibly cheap,
*  because gas emits about half as much as coal does when you use it for power, that basically cut more
*  carbon emissions than pretty much any other single thing. And we should get the rest of the world,
*  in some sense, to frack because it's really cheap. There are some problems, and absolutely,
*  we can also have that conversation. No technology is problem-free, but fundamentally,
*  it's an incredibly cheap way to get people to cut a lot of CO2. It's not the final solution
*  because it's still a fossil fuel, but it's a much better fossil fuel, if you will. And it's much
*  more realistic to do that. So that's one part of the thing. The other one is when we talked about,
*  for instance, how do we help people in Florida who gets hit by a hurricane, or how do we help people
*  that get damaged in flash floods, the people who are in heat waves? And the simple answers is,
*  there's a lot of very, very cheap and effective things that we could do first. So most climate
*  people will tend to say, we've got to get rid of all carbon emissions. We've got to change the
*  engine that powers the world and has powered us for the last 200 years. And that's all good and
*  well, but it's really, really hard to do, and it's probably not going to do very much.
*  And even if you succeed it, it would only help future victims of future hurricanes in Florida
*  a tiny, tiny bit at best. So instead, let's try to focus on not getting people to build right on the
*  waterfront where you're incredibly vulnerable and where you're very likely to get hit, where we
*  subsidize people with federal insurance again, which is actually losing money. So we're much
*  more about saying it's not a science question. I just take the science for granted. Yes, there
*  is a problem with climate change, but it's much more about saying, how can we make smart decisions?
*  Can I ask you about blind spots? When you reduce stuff to numbers, the cost and benefits,
*  is there stuff you might miss about that are important to the flourishing of the human species?
*  So everyone will have to say, of course there must be blind spots.
*  But I don't know what they are.
*  Yeah, I'm sure Andy would probably be better at telling me what they are. So we try to incorporate
*  all of it, but obviously we're not successful. You can't incorporate everything, for instance,
*  in the cost benefit analysis. But the point is in some way, I would worry a lot about this if we were
*  close to perfection human race, we're doing almost everything right, but we're not quite right, then
*  we need to get the last digits right. But I think it's much more the point that I tried to make
*  before, that we're all focused on going to an electric car or something else rather than
*  fracking. We're all focused on cutting carbon emissions instead of reducing vulnerability.
*  So we're seemingly getting orders of magnitude wrong. And while I'm sure I have blind spots,
*  I think they're probably not big enough to overturn that point.
*  Andy, why is Bjorn and economists are all wrong about everything?
*  Well, models, we could spend a whole day on models. There are economic models. There's
*  this thing called optimization models. There were two big ones used to assess the
*  US plan, this new big IRA inflation reduction package. And they're fine. They're a starting
*  point for understanding what's possible. But as this gets to the journalism part or the public
*  part, you have to look at the caveats. You have to look at what economists expressly exclude things
*  that are not modelable. And if you look in the fine print on the repeat project, the Princeton
*  version of the assessment of the recent giant legislation, the fine print is the front page.
*  For me, as a deep diving journalist, because it says we didn't include any sources of friction,
*  meaning resistance to putting new transmission lines through your community or people who don't
*  want mining in America because we've exported all of our mining. We've mined our Cobalt in Congo.
*  And trying to get a new mine in Nevada was a fraught fight that took more than 10 years
*  for lithium. So if you're excluding those elements from your model, which on the surface
*  makes this $370 billion package have an emissions reduction trajectory, that's really pretty good.
*  And you're not saying in your first line, by the way, these are the things we're not considering.
*  You can probably summarize all of human history with that one word, friction.
*  Yeah. Well, inertia, friction implies there's a force that's already being resisted,
*  but there's also inertia, which is a huge part of our, you know, we have a status quo bias.
*  The scientists that I, in grappling with the climate problem, as a journalist, I paid too
*  much attention to climate scientists. That's why all my articles focused on climate change.
*  And it was 2006. I remember now pretty clearly, I was asked by the Weekend Review section of
*  the New York Times to write a sort of a weekend thumb sucker, we call them.
*  Thumb sucker?
*  You know, you sit and suck your thumb and think about something.
*  Why is everybody so pissed off about climate change? It was after Al Gore's movie,
*  the Al Gore movie came out in Convened to Truth, Hurricane Katrina, it was big.
*  Senator Inhofe in the Senate from Oklahoma wasn't yet throwing snowballs, but it was close to that.
*  And so I looked into what was going on. Why is this so heated? In 2006, the story is called
*  Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet. And that was the first time, this is after 18 years of writing
*  about global warming. That was the first time I interviewed a social scientist, not a climate
*  scientist. Her name was Helen Ingram. She's the UC Irvine. And she laid out for me the factors
*  that determine why people vote, what they vote for, what they think about politically.
*  And they were the antithesis of the climate problem. She used the words, she said, people
*  go into the voting booth thinking about things that are soon salient and certain. And climate
*  change is complex, has long time scales. And that really jogged me. And then between 2006, 2010,
*  and 2010, I started interviewing other social scientists. And this was by far the scariest
*  science of all. It's the climate in our heads, our inconvenient minds. And in how that translates
*  into political norms and stuff really became the monster, not the climate system.
*  LW is there social dynamics to the scientists themselves? Because I've gotten to witness a kind
*  of flocking behavior with scientists. So it's almost like a flock of birds within the flock.
*  There's a lot of disagreement and fun debates, and everybody trying to prove each other wrong.
*  But they're all kind of headed in the same direction. And you don't want to be the bird
*  that kind of leaves that flock. So like, there's an idea that science is a mechanism will get us
*  towards the truth. But it'll definitely get us somewhere. But it could be not the truth in the
*  short term. In the long term, a bigger flock will come along and it will get us to the truth. But
*  there's a sense that I don't know if there's a mechanism within science to like, snap out of it
*  if you're done the wrong track. Usually you get it right. But sometimes you don't. When you don't,
*  it's very costly. And there's so many factors that line up to perpetuate that flocking behavior.
*  One is media attention comes in. The other is funding comes in. National Science Foundation
*  or whatever, European foundations pour a huge amount of money into things related to climate.
*  And then your narrative in your head is shaped by that aspect of the climate problem that's in the
*  spotlight. I started using this hashtag a few years back, narrative capture. Be wary of narrative
*  capture where you're on a train and everyone's getting on the train. And this is in the media
*  too, not just science. And it becomes self-sustaining. And contrary indications are ignored or downplayed.
*  No one does replication science because your career doesn't advance through replicating
*  someone else's work. So those contrary indications are not necessarily really dug in on. And this is
*  way beyond climate. This is many fields. As you said, you might've seen this in AI.
*  And it's really hard to find... It's another form of path dependency, the term I used before.
*  The breaking narrative capture to me, for me, has come mostly from stepping back
*  and reminding myself of the basic principles of journalism.
*  Journalism's basic principles are useful for anybody confronting a big, enormous, dynamic,
*  complex thing is who, what, where, when, why. Just be really rigorous about not assuming
*  because there's a fire in Boulder County or a flood in Fort Myers that climate, which is in
*  your head because you're part of the climate team at the New York Times or whatever, is the foreground
*  part of this problem. What's the psychological challenge of that if you incorporate the fact that
*  if you try to step back and have nuance, you might get attacked by the others in the flock?
*  Oh, I was. Well, you've certainly been. So both of you get attacked continuously
*  from different sides. So let me just ask about that. How does that feel? And how do you continue
*  thinking clearly and continuously try to have humility and step back and not get defensive
*  as a communicator? There are other things happening at the same time. I'm now 35 years into
*  almost 40 years into my journalism career. So I have some independence. I'm free from the obligations
*  of... I don't really need my next paycheck. I live in Maine now in a house I love. I own it
*  outright. It's a great privilege and honor as a result of a lot of hard work. And so I'm freer to
*  think freely. And I know my colleagues in newsrooms when I was at the New York Times. In the newsroom,
*  you become captive to a narrative just as you do out in the world. The New York Times had a
*  narrative about Saddam Hussein, drove us into that war. The Times sucked right into that and
*  helped perpetuate it. I think we're in a bit of a narrative. We, the media, my friends at the Times
*  and others are on a train ride on climate change, depicting it in a certain way that really... I saw
*  problems with how they handled the Joe Manchin issue in America, the West Virginia Senator.
*  They really piled on and zoomed in on his investments, which is really important to do,
*  but they never pulled back and said, by the way, he's a rare species. He's a Democrat in West
*  Virginia, which seems to be otherwise occupied by Republican. There'd be no talk of a climate
*  deal or any of that stuff without him. But once you're starting to frame a story in a certain way,
*  you carry it along. As you said, sometimes it breaks and a new norm arrives, but
*  the climate train is still rushing forward and missing the opportunity to cut it into its pieces
*  and say, well, what's really wrong with Florida? It's for me, when you ask you about how I handle
*  the slings and arrows and stuff, it's partially because I'm past worrying about it too much.
*  I mean, it was pretty intense. 2009 Rush Limbaugh suggested I kill myself on his radio show. It's a
*  really great time. What was that about? Actually, this was a meeting in Washington in 2009
*  on population at the Wilson Center. I couldn't be there. So actually, this is pre-COVID,
*  but I was zooming in or something, like Skyping in, and I was talking about in a playful way,
*  I said, well, if you really want to worry about carbon, this was during the debate over
*  carbon tax model for a bill in America, we should probably have a carbon tax for kids
*  because a bigger family in America is a big source of more emissions. It was kind of a playful
*  thought bubble. Some right-wing blogger blogged about it. It got into Rush's pile of things to
*  talk about, and the clip is really fun. Also meetings. So if humans are bad for the environment,
*  I can imagine Rush... That's how you know you made it. He said, Mr. Revkin of the New York Times,
*  if you really think that people are the worst thing that ever happened to this planet, why don't you
*  just kill yourself and save the planet by dying? That was tough for you. It was tough for my family.
*  It did generate some interesting calls and stuff in my voicemail. But on the left, I was also
*  undercut. Roger Pilkey Jr., a prominent researcher of climate risk and climate policy, UC Boulder,
*  his career track was derailed purposefully by people who just thought his message was too off
*  the path. You've been dealing with this for a very long time.
*  I just want to get back to the science. I don't think the science get it so much wrong as it just
*  becomes accepted to make certain assumptions. As you just said, we assume no friction. There's a
*  way that you kind of model the world that ends up being also a convenient message in many ways.
*  I think the main convenient message in climate, and it's not surprising if you think about it,
*  the main convenient message is that the best way to do something about all the things that
*  we call climate is to cut CO2. That turns out to only sometimes be true and with a lot of caveats.
*  And it takes a long time.
*  It's really, really difficult to do in any meaningful sort of timeframe. If you challenge
*  that, yes, you're outside the flock and you get attacked. Somebody told me once,
*  I think it's true, they say at the Harvard Law School, if you have a good case, pound the case.
*  If you have a bad case, pound the table. I've always felt that when people go after me,
*  they're kind of pounding the table. They're literally screaming, I don't have a good case.
*  I'm really annoyed with what you're saying. To me, that actually means it's much more important
*  to make this argument. Sure, I would love everyone just saying, oh, that's a really good point.
*  I'm going to use that. But we're stuck in a situation, certainly in a conversation,
*  where a lot of people invest a lot of time and energy on saying we should cut carbon emissions.
*  This is the way to help humankind. And just be clear, I think we should cut carbon emissions
*  as well. But we should also just be realistic about what we can achieve with that and what are all the
*  other things that we could also do. And it turns out that a lot of these other things are much
*  cheaper, much more effective, will help much more, much quicker. And so getting that point out is
*  just incredibly important for us to get it right. So in some sense, to make sure that we don't do
*  another Iraq and we don't do another, lots of stupid decisions. This is one of the things
*  mankind is very good at. And I guess I see my role, and I think that's probably also how you
*  see yourself, is trying to get everyone to do it slightly less wrong. So let me ask you about a
*  deep psychological effect for you. There's also a drug of martyrdom. So whenever you stand against
*  the flock, you wrote a couple of really good books on the topic, the most recent false alarm.
*  I stand as the holder of truth that everybody who is alarmist is wrong. And here's just simple,
*  calm way to express the facts of the matter. And that's very compelling to a very large
*  number of people. They want to make a martyr out of you. Are you worried about your own mind
*  being corrupted by that, by enjoying standing against the crowd?
*  No, no, no. I guess I can see what you're saying in a literary way or something.
*  Yeah, still being poetic here.
*  There's very little comfort or usefulness in annoying a lot of people. Whenever I go to a
*  party, for instance, I know that there's a good chance people are going to be annoyed with me.
*  And I would love that not to be the case. But what I try to do is, I try to be very polite and
*  push people's buttons unless they actively say, so you're saying all stupid stuff on the climate
*  and then try to engage with them and say, well, what is it you're thinking about? And hopefully,
*  during that party, and then it ends up being a really bad party for me. But anyway, so I'll end
*  up possibly convincing one person that I'm not totally stupid. But no, I'm not playing the martyr
*  and I'm not enjoying that. That's so interesting. The martyr complex is all around the climate
*  question. Michael Mann, at the far end of the spectrum of activism from where Bjorn is,
*  was a climate scientist, is a climate scientist who was actively attacked by
*  Inhofe and Virginia politicians and really abused in many ways. He had come up with a very prominent
*  model of looking at long-term records of climate change and got this hockey stick for temperature.
*  And he definitely sits there in a certain kind of spotlight because of that. So it's not unique at
*  any particular vantage point in the spectrum of prominent people on the debate.
*  Andrew, you co-wrote the book, The Human Planet Earth at the Dawn of the Anthropocene,
*  which is the new age when humans are actually having an impact on the environment. Let me ask
*  the question of what do you find most beautiful and fascinating about our planet Earth?
*  It'd be cheap to say everything, but just walking here this morning under the bridge
*  over the Colorado River, seeing the birds, knowing there's bat colonies, massive bat colonies around
*  here that I got to visit a few years ago, I experienced one of those bat explosions.
*  It's mind blowing. I've been really lucky as a journalist to have gone to the North Pole,
*  the camp on the sea ice with Russian help, a camp that was set up for tourists coming from Europe
*  every year. There were scientists on the sea ice floating on the 14,000 foot deep Arctic Ocean,
*  and I was with them for several days. I wrote a book about that too along with my reporting.
*  I've been in the depths of the Amazon rainforest. When I was very young,
*  I was a crew on a sailboat that sailed two-thirds of the way around the world. I was halfway across
*  the Indian Ocean, again in 14,000 foot deep water. There was no wind. This was way before
*  I was a journalist, 22, 23 years old. We went swimming in 14,000 foot deep water,
*  500 miles from land, the Western Indian Ocean halfway between Somalia and the Maldives.
*  Is it like so mind boggling, chillingly fantastical thing with a mask on looking at your shadow
*  going to the vanishing point below you, looking over at the boat, which is a 60 foot boat, but
*  it just looks like a toy, and then getting back on and being beholden to the elements, the sailboat
*  heading toward Djibouti. It's the immensity and the power of the elements.
*  Oh my God. Then the human qualities are unbelievable. The Anthropocene,
*  I played a bit of a role as a journalist in waking people up to the idea that this era called the
*  Holocene in the last 11,000 years since the last ice age had ended. I wrote my 1992 book on global
*  warming thinking about all that we're just talking about, thinking about the wonders of the planet,
*  thinking about the impact of humans so far in our explosive growth in the 20th century.
*  I wrote that perhaps earth scientists of the future will name this post-Holocene
*  era for its formative element for us, because we're kind of in charge in certain ways,
*  which is hubristic at the same time. The variability of the climate system is still
*  profound with or without global warming. So this immense, powerful, beautiful organism
*  that is earth, all the different sub-organisms that are on it, do you see humans as a kind of
*  parasite on this earth? Or do you see it as something that helps the flourishing of the
*  entire organism? That can.
*  Can. Intelligence. That hasn't yet.
*  Hasn't yet? I mean, aren't we on the ability of the collective intelligence of the human species
*  to develop all these kinds of technologies and to be able to have Twitter to introspect onto itself?
*  Of course.
*  We should get Twitter to be involved.
*  Oh, I think we're doing a...
*  In a way, we are.
*  It's catch up. We're always in catch up mode. I was at the Vatican for a big meeting in 2014
*  on sustainable humanity, sustainable nature, our responsibility. It was a week of
*  presentations by Martin Rees, who's this famed British scientist, a physicist who...
*  Been on this podcast.
*  Yeah, great. Well, he's fixated on existential risk, right?
*  Yes, he is.
*  So it was a week of this stuff. And the meeting was kicked off by... I wrote about it, and Cardinal
*  Maradiaga, who is I think from El Salvador, he's one of the Pope's kind of posse, he gave one of
*  the initial speeches and he said, nowadays, mankind looks like a technical giant and an
*  ethical child. Meaning our technological wizardry is unbelievable, but it's way out in front of our
*  ability to step back and kind of consider in the full dimensions we need to, is it helping everybody?
*  What are the consequences of CRISPR, genetics, technology? And there's no single answer to that.
*  If I'm in the African Union, I'm just using this as an example. CRISPR has emerged so fast,
*  it can do so much by changing the nature of nature in a kind of a programming way,
*  not building genes, not just transferring them from one organism to another.
*  We've only just begun to taste the fruits of that, literally.
*  And it can wipe out a mosquito species. We know how to do that now. You can literally
*  take out the dengue-causing mosquito. The scientists have done the work,
*  and you think, okay, cool. Well, that's great. Now there's this big fight over whether that
*  should happen. African Union, and I'm with their view, says, hey, if we can take out a mosquito
*  species that's causing horrific chronic loss through dengue, which I had once in Indonesia,
*  it's not fun, and we should do it. What's the other side of the argument?
*  European Union, they're using their capital P precautionary principle. It says, no, we can't
*  meddle with nature. And this is just like we were talking with climate. There's the real-time
*  question and the long-term question. And there's the people who are just facing the need to get
*  through the day and be healthy and survive and have enough food, which is not integrated
*  sufficiently at all into the stop climate change debate. And those who are trying to cut CO2,
*  which will have a benefit in the future by limiting the fat tail outcomes of this
*  journey we're on. So when I think about the Anthropocene, I think about this planet,
*  I love that we're here right now. I love that our species has these capacities. I would love
*  for there to be a little bit more reflection in where things come from and where they might go,
*  whether you're a student, a kid, what's your role? The wonderful thing about the complexity of it is
*  everyone can play a role. If you're an artist or a designer or an architect or an economist
*  or a podcaster, whatever you do, just tweak a little bit toward examining these questions,
*  stepping back from the simplistic label throwing toward what actually is the problem in front of
*  me, whether it's in Pakistan or in Boston or wherever, Florida. What do you find beautiful
*  about this collective intelligence machine we have from an economics perspective? It's kind of
*  fascinating that we're able to, there is a machine to it that we've built up that's able to represent
*  interests and desires and value and hopes and dreams in sort of monetary ways that we can trade
*  with each other, we can make agreements with each other, we can represent our goals and
*  build companies that actually help and so on. Do you just step back every once in a while,
*  Marvel, at the fact that a few billion of us are able to somehow not create complete chaos
*  and actually collaborate and have collaborative disagreements that ultimately or so far have
*  left led to progress? Yeah, I think fundamentally the point, apart from the fact that we should just
*  be joyful of the fact that humans live here, I think it's incredibly important to remember
*  how much progress we've had. Most people just don't stop to think about those stats.
*  I get that in the normal bustle of day, but just in 1900, the average person on the planet lived to
*  be 32 years. 32 years, that was our average life expectancy. Today, it's about 74. So we've literally
*  got two lifetimes on this planet, each one of us. And every year you live in the rich world,
*  you get to live three months longer and the poor world is about four months longer. Because of
*  medical advances, because we get better at dealing both with cancer and especially right now with
*  heart disease. These are amazing achievements. Of course, it's a very, very small part of it.
*  We're much better fed, we're much better educated. We've gone from a world where virtually everyone
*  or 90% were illiterate to a world where more than 90% illiterate. This is an astounding opportunity
*  and 200 years ago, 95%, 94% of the world were extremely poor. That is less than a dollar a day.
*  Today, for the first time in 2015, it was down below 10%. And again, these are kind of boring
*  statistics, but they're also astounding testaments of how well humanity has done. So just on the
*  point of we've kind of just been focused on making our own world better. And in many ways,
*  so we've hunted a lot of big animals either to extinction or down to much, much smaller
*  populations, it's much smaller populations, fish in the ocean. So there's a lot of things that
*  sort of bear the brunt of our success. It's not because we're evil in that sense, it's just because
*  we didn't care all that much about them. I think it is important as one funnel of that,
*  I'm not going to make a big deal out of it. But the fact that we're putting out more CO2 in the
*  atmosphere, because CO2, as you also mentioned before, it's actually plant food. If you're a
*  greenhouse grower, you know if you put in CO2 in your greenhouse, you actually get bigger and
*  plumper tomatoes. And that's essentially what we're doing in the world. This has overall bad
*  consequences and that's why we should be doing something about it. But one of the good side
*  effects is actually that the world is getting greener. So we get much more green stuff.
*  Now, I don't know, and this is where I sort of show my economist roots, because if you just
*  measure all living stuff in tons, so in weight, there's actually more living stuff than there
*  were 100 years ago. Because elephants and all these other big fish and stuff are actually really,
*  really small fraction of the world. So we have an enormous amount of life stuff, but that doesn't
*  even measure it. It's mostly just wood and green stuff that has dramatically increased in the world.
*  Now, we're still not there from what it was in 1500. So we've still cut down the world a lot,
*  but we're actually making a much greener world. Again, not because we really cared or thought
*  about it, but just sort of a side effect of what we're doing. I think the crucial bit to remember
*  is when you're poor and you worry about what's going to happen the next day, this is just not
*  your main issue. Am I killing too many large animals in the world? But when you're rich and
*  you can actually sit in a podcast in a convenient place in Austin, you can also start thinking about
*  this. So one of the crucial bits, I think, if we want to get the rest of the world to care about
*  the environment, care about climate, care about all these other issues, we really need to get them
*  out of poverty first. And it's a simple point that we often forget. And get them connected to all
*  these gifts. I have these memories of, I was reporting on the next big earthquake that's
*  going to devastate Istanbul in 2009. I was in a slum, an immigrant, poor neighborhood,
*  and walking around with an engineer pointing out to the buildings that were going to fall down.
*  This is all known. There was an earthquake in 1999 and the next one's coming.
*  One of my advantages in covering climate is I've covered all the kinds of disasters too,
*  so it keeps my context, me in touch with other things we can do. So I'm walking around and
*  interviewing everybody. I went to the school that's being retrofit. They actually were getting
*  ahead of it there. The World Bank provided some funding to put in iron bars in the brick building.
*  And I met these kids and they came, when you're a journalist with a camera and stuff and a pad,
*  you get swarmed by kids, mostly in developing countries. And so these kids are running up to
*  me and they weren't going like, are you American? Or just, they were saying Facebook, Facebook.
*  And I went, that's interesting. And they led me to their little town, a little community center
*  that had a bank of eight or 10 pretty flimsy computers. And they were all there playing a
*  farm. There was a game that was hot at that time on Facebook. Farm. Farmville? Farmville. Yeah.
*  And my son back in the Hudson Valley, I remember him playing it and I thought, wow, that is so
*  freaking cool. These kids. And actually I became Facebook friends with a couple of them afterwards.
*  We traded our... And I thought back to my youth when we had pen pals, I would write a letter to
*  a kid in West Cameroon and he would write back. And it took weeks and it was a crinkly letter
*  and I never met him. And now you can kind of connect with people. And that all through my
*  blogging, at the New York Times, I was doing my regular reporting, but I still launched a blog
*  in 2007 called Dot Earth, which was all about what you were just describing, the newosphere,
*  the connected world. That's a term from these two earliest 20, a Russian guy, an early
*  Vernadsky and a French theologian and scientist, which is so interesting,
*  Teilhard de Chardin. They had this idea in the early 20th century that we're creating a planet
*  of the mind, that human intelligence can foster a better earth. And I just became smitten with that,
*  especially meeting kids in Istanbul, slums who are on Facebook looking at connectedness,
*  what can you do with these tools, which is what drives me with my work now.
*  And but then there are these counterweights, counter currents that if the connectedness can cut
*  back, it allowed Al-Qaeda to recruit, use decapitation videos to recruit distributed,
*  disaffected young people into extremism. And there's lots of these systems are not,
*  they're just like every other tool, right? They're just for good or ill. And the efficiency thing,
*  the economics of the world, which I also wrote about a little bit,
*  late 20th century, it was so cool that everything became so efficient, that our supply chains,
*  just in time manufacturing, getting the stuff from where the sources of the material are to
*  the car factory and to get the car to the floor just in time for someone to buy it.
*  And everyone got totally sucked in by that, including me. It's great, super efficient,
*  cheaper. And then COVID hit and the whole supply chain concept crumbled. And one of the big lessons
*  there, hopefully, and this is relevant to sustainability generally, is efficiency matters,
*  but resilience matters too. And resilience is inefficient. You need redundancy or a variety of
*  options, right? Which is not what corporate companies think about, which is not what,
*  if you're only focused on a bottom line, short term timeline, those disruptions are not what
*  you're thinking about. You're still thinking about, can we get that widget here just in time for this
*  thing to happen? And then on we go. So it's kind of, I love the Noosphere, this Nuosphere idea,
*  the connectedness is fantastic. Oh, another thing, like in the early 90s, when I wrote my first book
*  on global warming, it was for an exhibition at the Museum of Natural History. The Environmental
*  Defense Fund was involved. They were like a partner, one of these longstanding environmental
*  groups. And they're very old fashioned, it's mostly lawyers really, just using the Clean Air Act,
*  Clean Water Act to litigate against pollution. And now EDF is vastly bigger. And they're actually,
*  this coming year, they're launching a satellite. An environmental group is launching Methane Sat,
*  and it's providing a view, an independent view of where there's this gas.
*  It's the same thing, natural gas is basically methane. So if you have a leak, whether it's in
*  Siberia or in Oklahoma, you can cross reference, you can identify the hotspot, you can know where
*  the problem is to fix in so many ways. And that's just one example. If someone had told me in 1993
*  that EDF was going to launch a methane satellite, I would have laughed out loud. So technology plays
*  a huge role if it's employed with the bigger vision and leadership.
*  So Bjorn, you wrote one of the books you wrote, the most recent one called False Alarm,
*  How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.
*  Good title by the way, very intense, makes me want to read it. What is likely the worst effect
*  of climate change? First, let me just, my editor actually hated the subtitle because it gives away
*  the whole book. Basically, it tells you what the book tries to make. I think that's exactly
*  what it should be. It's about getting this conversation out in the public sphere. So
*  the worst thing that climate change can do is like the worst thing that anything can do is that it
*  wipes out everything and we all die. So it's not like, if you're just looking for worst case
*  outcomes, anything can get to the worst case outcome. Imagine if we suggest what's the worst
*  thing that could happen from HIV. It breaks down one or more African states because we don't fix it.
*  And then you get sort of biological warfare and terrorism, throw that in the mix. And then you
*  get someone who makes a virus and kills the whole world. You can make worst case scenarios
*  for everything. I get the point. Sorry for any interruption. And I appreciate worst case analysis
*  because I am fundamentally a computer scientist and that was the thing that defined the discipline
*  of the measure of the quality of the algorithm. You measure what is its worst case performance.
*  That's the big O notation. That's how you discuss algorithms. What is the worst possible thing in
*  terms of performance this thing can do? But for climate change, let's even go crazy. What is exactly
*  the worst case scenario for climate change? Because I have to be honest and say I haven't
*  really paid deep attention. I just have a lot of colleagues who think about climate and so on.
*  And there's a kind of in the alarmism, there was a sense why this is a very serious problem.
*  And then the sentence would never finish. What exactly is the problem? Well, the extinction of
*  the human species. Okay. With a virus, I understand how that can possibly happen.
*  What is the mechanism by which the human species becomes extinct because of climate change?
*  I'm not sure I would want to be able to argue that because it really requires you to have sort of very,
*  very extreme parameter choices all down the line. So it's more, yeah, it's this kind of idea that
*  we hit some of these unexpected outcomes. So for instance, the West Ind Arctic ice sheet melts
*  really, really quickly. It doesn't look like that can happen really, really quickly, but let's just
*  say that this could happen within a hundred years or something. So we basically get what?
*  Seven meters, what is that? 20 feet of sea level rise. That will be a real challenge to a lot of
*  places around the world. This would have significant costs. It's likely, and there's
*  actually been a study that's tried to estimate, could we deal with that? And the short answer is,
*  yes, if you're fairly well off, if you're a Holland, you can definitely deal with it.
*  It's also likely that most developing countries are going to be much closer to Holland
*  towards the end of the century because they'll be much richer. So they can probably handle it,
*  but it will be a real challenge. May I ask a dumb question?
*  Yeah. What happens when the sea
*  level rises exactly? What is the painful aspect of that?
*  It is that all of your current infrastructure in a lot of coastal cities around the world that are
*  literally built on, you know, Jakarta is a good example, that are literally built on the just,
*  you know, inches above the sea level. If you then get a sea level rise, they'll rise say,
*  what would 20 feet of that be like a third or a fourth of a foot every year?
*  I see no evidence that that's even.
*  But hold on a second. We're not talking about evidence. We're talking about worst
*  case analysis and algorithm. And so basically you would see your infrastructure, all your stuff,
*  very quickly being very, very challenged. And you basically have to put up huge seawalls
*  or migrate out of that area. Very quickly.
*  Well, very quickly as in 50 years or something.
*  Right. So like, is that as a human species, we're not able to respond to that kind of thing?
*  Of course we are. And look, again, the point here is then there's a lot of other arguments.
*  And I should just put the disclaimer, this is not what I think is correct. But you're asking me,
*  what's the worst case outcome that you have? So most of global warming is really about that we
*  used to one way of doing things. So we live in Jakarta because it's right next to the sea.
*  We're used to the sea being at this level. We grow our crops because we're used to,
*  you grow corn here, you grow wheat here, because we're used to that's where the precipitation and
*  the temperature is the right for this kind of crop. If this changes, and this is the same thing with
*  houses, if it gets colder, if it gets warmer, it's suddenly uncomfortable because you've
*  built your house wrong. So our infrastructure will be wrong if the world changes and that's
*  what climate change is. At a large scale.
*  Yes. And so this is a problem in most of these senses. But if you then sort of take it to the
*  extreme and say, well, imagine that you're going to get a huge sea level rise. Imagine that you're
*  going to get a very different sort of precipitation. For instance, the, what is it, the rain season,
*  monsoon in the Indian subcontinent changes dramatically. That could affect a lot of
*  agriculture and make it really hard to imagine that you could feed India well.
*  There are these kinds of things where you can imagine and then that this would be very difficult
*  to deal with. And then if you add all of it up, you could possibly get sort of a system collapse
*  because you just have too many problems. It's impossible to model those kinds of things. So
*  what I understand is the sea level rise itself isn't the destructive thing. It's the fact that
*  it creates migration patterns and human tension, battle over resources. And so you start to get
*  these human things, human conflict. So the big negative impact won't be necessary from the fact
*  they have to move your house. It's the fact that once you move your house, that means something
*  else down the line. And this is secondary tertiary effects that can have potentially to wars,
*  military conflict, can have destabilized entire economies, all that kind of stuff
*  because of the migration pattern. Is it possible to model those kinds of things?
*  So there are people who looked at this and surprisingly again, most people will move
*  within their country for a lot of different reasons, but mainly language and political
*  structure. You have your money, you have your relationships there. So it's not like we're going
*  to see these big moves from southern Mexico and central America up to the US or from Africa up to
*  the EU. That's not predominantly because of climate. That's because there's a lot of welfare
*  opportunity. You can make your life much, much better. You can become much more productive if
*  you move into a richer country. So yes, there are these issues. Again, you're asking me for
*  what is it that could really break down the world. I think the fundamental point is to recognize
*  that it's not like we haven't dealt with huge challenges in the past and we've dealt with them
*  really well. So just one fun thing, I encourage everyone to just look that up on Wikipedia,
*  the rising of Chicago. So in the 1850s, Chicago was a terribly dirty place and they didn't have
*  good sewers. And so they decided, and we can't really make up all my, they decided to raise
*  Chicago one to two feet. And so they simply took one block at a time, they put like 50,000
*  jacks underneath a building and they would just raise the building and then they'd go on to the
*  next building. They raised all of Chicago one or two feet. This is almost 200 years ago. Of course,
*  we will be able to deal with these things. I'm not saying it'll be fun or that it'll be cheap. Of
*  course, we would rather not have to deal with this, but we're a very inventive species. And so it's
*  very unlikely that we'll not be able to deal with these issues.
*  What about COVID pandemic just said, hold my beer. The response of human civilization to the
*  COVID pandemic seems to have not, they didn't find the car jacks. It seems to have not been
*  as effective as I would have hoped for as a human that believes in the basic competence of
*  leadership and all that kind of stuff. It seems that given the COVID pandemic,
*  luckily did not turn out to be a pandemic that would eradicate most of the human species,
*  which is something you always have to consider and worry about that I would have hoped we would
*  have less economic impact and we would respond more effectively in terms of policy, in terms of
*  socially, medically, all that kind of stuff. So if the COVID pandemic brought the world to its knees,
*  then what does a sea level rise? I think there's a different kind of thing that happened
*  in the COVID. So politicians and a lot of politicians, I think made certainly suboptimal
*  decisions, but I also find the fact that we actually managed to get a vaccine in a year.
*  We should not be sort of unaware of the fact that yes, we did a lot of stupid stuff and a lot of
*  people were really, really annoyed, but fundamentally we fixed this. We could have done it better and
*  pretty. I mean, I rode through the COVID pandemic in southern Sweden.
*  Yes, we can have that whole conversation. It was certainly much easier to live there than many other
*  places, but the fundamental point was we actually fixed it. So yes, we'll do that with climate.
*  We'll make a lot of bad decisions and we'll waste a lot of money like we do with all other problems,
*  but are we going to fix this? Yeah. Can you add onto that uncomfortable discussion of what's the
*  worst thing that could possibly happen? I'm not worried about the sea level rise component.
*  Certainly not nearly as much as the heat and disruption of agriculture patterns and water
*  supplies. And a lot of it relates to, again, path dependency and history. Farmers are the heroes of
*  humanity all through history because they're incredibly adaptable if you give them access
*  to resources. In some cases, it's just crop insurance, which is really basically still
*  impossible to get in big chunks of Africa to get you through those hard spots. But the heat issue
*  is the one that's most basic element related to global warming from CO2 buildup is hotter
*  heat waves. There's still some lack of evidence of the intensification, but the duration and
*  that's what really matters for heat is how many days seems to be very powerfully linked to global
*  warming. And so how many people die as a result of that is important. So we're talking about,
*  maybe you can also educate me, what's the average projection for the next
*  hundred years of the temperature rise? Is it two degrees Celsius?
*  Well, yeah. Although this gets us into the modeling realm. You have to assume different
*  emissions possibilities. You have to assume we still don't know the basic physics, like how many
*  clouds form in a warming climate and how that relates to limiting warming. There are aspects
*  of the fundamental warming question that are still deeply uncertain.
*  But the debate is like two, three or four Celsius.
*  It's in that range.
*  But the thing is, all of those are bad for, this is an educational question.
*  It doesn't seem like that much from a weather perspective, if you just turn up the AC and so on
*  in your own personal home. But it is from a global perspective, a huge impact on agriculture.
*  Well, yeah. And getting back to sea level and glaciers, the melting point of ice is a
*  number. And so if you pass that number, things start to change. What became known about Antarctica
*  and Greenland more is that it's ocean temperature. The seawater in and around and under these ice
*  sheets, because it kind of gets under parts of Antarctica, is what's driving the dynamics that
*  could lead to more abrupt change, more than air temperature. Glaciers, these big ice sheets,
*  live or die based on how much snow falls and how much ice leaves every year.
*  And I was up on the Greenland ice sheet in 2004 and written about it forever since then.
*  It's the same amount of water that's in the Gulf of Mexico, as if God or some great force
*  came down and fell ash flows the Gulf of Mexico and plunked it up on land. That's the ice sheet.
*  It's a lot of water. That's 23 feet of sea level rise, but we're not going to melt it all.
*  And the pace at which that erosion begins and becomes sort of a runaway train is still
*  not well understood. That changed from a manageable level of sea level rise from these
*  ice sheets to something that becomes truly unstoppable or that has these discontinuities
*  where you get a lot more all of a sudden. To me, it's in the realm of what I've taken
*  to calling known unknowables. Don't count on another IPCC report magically including science
*  that says, aha, now we know it's going to be five feet by 2100. Because there's a lot of negative
*  learning in science. This may be true in your body of science too. There's a guy named Jeremy
*  Bassas, B-A-S-S-I-S, who wrote a paper about the idea that you could get this sudden cliff
*  breakdown of these ice shelves around Antarctica leading to rapid sea level rise.
*  He did more modeling and physics and it turns out that you end up with,
*  it's a much more progressive and self-limiting phenomenon.
*  But those papers don't get any attention in the media because-
*  They're not scary.
*  They're not scary and they're after the fact. Just this past year, there's been this cycle around
*  the word collapse and Antarctic ice. It started actually several years ago with the idea that
*  this West Antarctic ice sheet is particularly vulnerable and some papers, everyone, the science
*  community, like the birds we were talking about flocks to it and some high profile papers are
*  written. Then a deeper inquiry reveals, it's more complicated than that. We, the journalists, the
*  media, pundits don't pay attention to that stuff. Actually, which is why I started to develop a
*  dictionary. I call it watch words, like words. If you're out there, you're just a public person,
*  you want to know what's really going on. You hear these words like collapse
*  in the context of ice. What do you do with that? I've created conversations around these words.
*  Geologists and ice scientists use the word collapse. They're talking about a centuries-long
*  process. They're not talking about the World Trade Center. Scientists would do well to be
*  more careful with words like that. Unless your focus is what we were saying earlier,
*  your idea that alarming people will spur them to act, then you use that word carelessly.
*  Can I just follow up on the other point that you said, two, three, four degrees? That doesn't
*  sound like much. I can just crank up the air conditioning. I think that touches on a really,
*  really important point that for most rich people, much of climate change is not really going to be
*  all that impactful. It still will have an impact. But fundamentally, if you're well off,
*  you can mitigate a lot of these impacts. There's a young scientist at Carnegie Mellon,
*  Destiny Nock. She just was the lead author on a study, what poor and prosperous households do in
*  a heat wave when they have access to air conditioning. In a poor household, you wait,
*  they found through science. They delay turning on the air conditioner four to seven degrees
*  more of heating before they start to use the air conditioner. That create adverse outcomes.
*  If you have an asthmatic in the house, an old person, you're endangering their lives. That's
*  just a little tiny microscopic fractal example of this powerful real phenomenon that there's a
*  divide in vulnerability. It's not just based on where you live. This is families in Pittsburgh.
*  We're not talking about Botswana. That divide in capacity to deal with environmental stress
*  is something you can really work on. It gets hidden in all this talk of climate crisis.
*  And that's one of the important parts is both to say, look, if seven billion people, sorry,
*  eight billion people will now have all experienced this, even though for each one of them it's
*  manageable, it's still a big problem because it's eight billion people living through this.
*  And the second- And the air conditioning eight billion people.
*  Yes. And then it's the point of getting to realize it's very, very much about how do you help
*  the world's poor? And that's very much about making it more affordable. Basically getting
*  them out of poverty. And remember, getting out of poverty doesn't just mean that they can now afford
*  to air condition themselves, but they get better education, they get better opportunities, they get
*  better lives in so many other ways. And then at the end of it, it's not just about making sure
*  that we focus on this one problem, but it's recognizing that these families have lots of
*  different issues that they would like us to focus on climate and heat waves, just being one of them.
*  So it's sort of taking progressive steps back and realizing, all right, okay, this is a problem,
*  not the end of the world. And one tiny little last example,
*  you mentioned Jakarta at the beginning. It's really valuable to look around the world at places that
*  are sort of leading indicator places, whether it's sea level rise or heat. And you could do that.
*  Jakarta is sinking like a foot a year, literally a foot a year. It's some insane number
*  from withdrawing groundwater, from gas withdrawal, it's a Delta, it's built on sediment.
*  I wrote a piece ages ago at the New York Times calling it Delta Blues, all the musicians.
*  And in Jakarta, so what are they doing? They're moving, they're moving the capital to another
*  area. And so that says to me, there's a lot of plasticity too. It's a city that's going through
*  that rate of sea level, of their relationship with the sea level through sinking is way faster than
*  what's happening with global warming. So look to those kinds of places and you can start to build.
*  Tokyo had the same thing in the 1930s. They were also withdrawing a lot of water way too fast.
*  And so one of the obvious things is maybe you should stop withdrawing water so fast.
*  And again, we seem to almost be intent on finding the most politically correct way to fix a problem
*  or the thing that sort of gets the most clicks instead of the thing that actually works the best.
*  So a lot of these things are really not rocket science solutions.
*  We'll get there. Let me add one more on top of the pile of the worst case analysis.
*  So what people talk about, which is hurricanes and earthquakes, is there a connection that's
*  well understood between climate change and the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes
*  and earthquakes? I've dug in on both a lot. The earthquake connection to climate change I've not
*  worried about compared to just the earthquake risk that we live with in many parts of the world
*  already. The Himalayas, even with that earthquake in 2015 in Kathmandu, that whole range is overdue
*  for major earthquakes. And what has happened in the last 50 years since they last had big
*  earthquakes, huge development, big cities, a lot of informal construction, like the stuff I wrote
*  about in Istanbul where the family builds another layer and another, they put a floor on every time
*  someone gets married and has kids, you put another floor in the house. And unfortunately,
*  what was the term, this Turkish engineer, rubble in waiting.
*  Rumble in waiting.
*  It's rubble in waiting. And we're looking at it, videotaping it, and there are people playing there.
*  So I don't worry about the earthquake connection to climate change. The hurricanes I've written
*  about for decades. And the most illuminating body of science that I've dug in on, literally,
*  related to hurricanes is this field that's emerged, gets a tiny bit of money compared to
*  climate modeling. It's called paleotempestology. It's like paleontology. They look for evidence
*  of past hurricanes along coasts that we care about. And they dig down into the lagoons
*  behind the barrier beaches along Florida or the Carolinas or in Puerto Rico.
*  And what you have is a history book of past hurricanes. So there's mud, mud, mud, mud,
*  mud, mud, mud, mud, accumulating over centuries. And then there's a layer of sand and seashells.
*  And what that indicates is that there was a great storm that came across the beach,
*  pushed a lot of sediment into the mud. And then there's mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud.
*  And when you look at that work, I first wrote about this in 2001 in The Times, a long story.
*  And then I've kept track of these intrepid scientists putting these core tubes down.
*  It shows you that we're in a landscape where big bad hurricanes are the norm. But
*  something that's rare and big is something that's extreme. When you think about the word extreme,
*  it means it's at the end of the spectrum of what's possible. They're rare, rare in human
*  timescales. Hurricane Michael four years ago devastated category five, came ashore in the
*  panhandle of Florida, leveled that much photographed town, Mexico Beach. And people, actually the
*  Tallahassee National Weather Service said unprecedented hurricane. And the damage was
*  unprecedented because there hadn't been a community there before. But the hurricane was
*  not unprecedented at all. If you look at the history, and this is published research,
*  it's just that no one bothers to... We have this blind spot for the longer timescale you need to
*  examine if you're thinking about big bad things that are rare and hurricanes are still rare.
*  I was recently covering Fort Myers, the awful devastation. There's a young climate scientist
*  at Florida Gulf Coast University, Joe Muller, who's done that paleotempestology work there,
*  right in Fort Myers. She lives there and she was away in London at a meeting of
*  reinsurance companies that reinsure all the world's big bad risks when this was happening.
*  But she has done the work that shows it's a thousand year record of past hurricanes and
*  it's super sobering. When you consider how fast people have moved into Florida and built
*  vulnerably in an area that hurricanes will hammer, that part of the fundamental dynamics
*  of the Gulf of Mexico and the storms come off of Africa, it's a place where they would come.
*  Now, the question of global warming impact is subtle. There are aspects of hurricanes
*  that haven't changed. There's aspects like rainfall that seem pretty powerfully linked
*  to global warming. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, so when you have a big disturbance,
*  the heat engine of a hurricane comes through, you get more rain. There's rapid intensification.
*  How quickly these storms jump from category one to five or four before they hit is a new area of
*  science. I think it's still early days in knowing because no one was looking for that. There were
*  no data back 300 years ago when these big bad previous hurricanes came to know whether they
*  were rapidly intensified or not. As a journalist, I try to keep track of what we don't know, not be
*  too constrained and think about new science as being robust unless it's considering and actually
*  actively stating we don't really know what's going on with earlier hurricanes. All of that is swamped
*  ultimately, literally, by the vulnerability, building vulnerability in these areas.
*  If there's a marginal change in a storm and you've quadrupled or sextupled how much stuff
*  and how many people are in the way, and if some of those people are poor and vulnerable
*  or elderly and can't swim, you're creating a landscape of destruction.
*  A lot of the human suffering that has to do with storms is about where and how you build
*  versus the frequency and intensity of storms. Still, you didn't quite answer the question.
*  When I'm having a beer with people at a bar and they say, hey, why are you having a beer? We're
*  all going to die because of climate change. Usually what they bring up, and I'm just trying
*  to add some levity. No, this is good. Usually what they bring up is the hurricanes and the
*  most recent hurricanes saying they're getting crazy hurricanes all the time. They're getting
*  more intense, more frequent and so on. I'm sure there's incredible science going on trying to
*  look at this. Is there evidence and is it possible to have evidence that there's a connection
*  between what we can call global warming and the increased frequency and intensity of storms?
*  No.
*  And is, okay, no, thank you.
*  You added intensity. Let me just get into this a tiny bit more. I mean, hurricanes,
*  I grew up with them in Rhode Island in my youth and there was a very active period of hurricanes
*  in New England in the 50s and 60s, 70s. And then in the North Atlantic generally was very,
*  very active in the 50s when I was a kid. And the dynamics of them forming off of Africa and coming
*  here, circling up the coast was just prime time. Then there was like what Kerry Emanuel, who's the
*  most experienced hurricane climate scientists around at MIT. He was in this story. He's in
*  my 1988 article. He and colleagues have found and others that there's what they call the hurricane
*  drought from the 70s through about 1994 in the Atlantic, specifically the Atlantic basin.
*  And there's been a lot of questions about that. People thought it was ocean circulation,
*  something about the currents. There are these multi-decadal
*  variabilities in the oceans. And then now it looks robustly, I can't find a climate scientist who
*  disagrees, that the thing that caused the drought was pollution, smog. And significantly in Europe,
*  and you're saying, well, how does smog in Europe relate to hurricanes crossing the Atlantic and
*  getting to the United States? It's because of the smog was changing the behavior of the Sahara
*  desert, which is just south of Europe. And the Sahara desert kills hurricanes, sand and dust
*  coming off the Sahara. You could see this every year. And when that's active, it stifles these
*  big storms at the point right in their nursery. They all form, there's this area for hurricanes
*  off of West Africa. That's like the nursery zone. And so if you're stifling those hurricanes,
*  because of pollution in Europe before the Clean Air Act's cleanups, and then that goes away.
*  None of that has anything to do with global warming. It's another kind of forcing in the
*  climate system, a local one that created a regional dynamic that created a quiet period
*  when all these friends in the bar, maybe they were born in the 90s or whatever. They grew up in an
*  area of hurricanes weren't a big deal. And now we have an end to that drought because we cleaned
*  up the air pollution, the sooty kind of air pollution, sulfury. And anyone who says global
*  warming, global warming without saying, well, that's in there too, is missing that. And when
*  you look globally, there's still, I think it was at 90 or so hurricanes a year, cyclones,
*  hurricanes, typhoons globally. That hasn't changed. The number of these tropical storms that reach
*  that ferocity has not changed. It's just a fundamental dynamic of, and by the way,
*  on the long time scale, the models still indicate as you warm the planet, and remember the Arctic
*  warms quicker. This is something people probably understand. You're actually evening out the
*  imbalance between the heat at the equator and the cold in the northern part of the hemisphere.
*  And that calms the whole system down. So there could be fewer hurricanes later in the century
*  because of global warming. And for me, that's a lot of information, but if I'm in a bar,
*  I start with what do you care about? You care about safety. You care about security. You care about
*  having everybody safe, not just you. You get in your car and you can evacuate. What about the
*  old person or the poor family who can't do that? They're not going to leave their house.
*  What are we doing to limit vulnerability now? I circle back to that over and over again. I
*  have a pocket card. I have this graphic card I created about risk. What we really care about
*  is climate risk. Who's at risk? What's driving the risk? How do you reduce that? You can almost
*  pull it out in a bar. I should print them. You should do that. It's like a risk is the hazard.
*  Risk is the hazard. The hazard is a storm times exposure, how many people, how much stuff,
*  factoring in vulnerability or resilience. And climate change is changing the hazard
*  for some things, not for tornadoes, not for everything. Exposure is this expanding bullseye.
*  This is another hashtag, expanding bullseye. Get out there and look for that and you'll see
*  pushing these two geographers who do this for every hazard, wildfire, earthquake, flood,
*  coastal storm, and we're building and expanding bullseye in an area and nature is throwing darts.
*  Some of the darts are getting bigger because of global warming. Some of the darts we don't know.
*  What do you do? What do you do? Well, you get out of the way. You don't want to be on the dartboard.
*  And that, it just simplifies the whole formula. To me, it's kind of a transformational potential
*  to go into a bar. Maybe I should print these things. 100%.
*  They should be coasters in bars. Because that was fascinating about smog. I mean,
*  it's just, it's nice to be reminded about how complicated and fascinating the weather system is.
*  Let me try to answer the questions slightly quicker before your friends have drunk too much.
*  Never enough.
*  Or not enough. So, if you look at the amount of the number of hurricanes, as Andy rightly pointed
*  out, it doesn't look like it's changing. So, we see more because we have now much better
*  detection systems with satellites. But if you look since 1980, when we have good satellite coverage,
*  for instance, last year was the year that had the lowest number of hurricanes in the world.
*  And you're sort of like, that's odd because it's probably the year where I heard the most
*  about hurricanes. And what that tells you is that just because you hear a lot about hurricanes
*  doesn't actually mean that there is a lot of hurricanes. You can't just go that way.
*  If you remember in the 1990s and 2000s, there was an enormous amount of talk about how violence,
*  how crime was getting worse in the US, while all the objective indicators showed that it was going
*  down. But there's sufficient amount of violence that you can fill every radio and TV show with
*  a new crime. And so, if you get more and more TV shows that talk about crime, actually most people
*  end up thinking that there's more crime while the real number is going down. So, the reality here is,
*  yes, climate change will probably affect hurricanes in the sense that they'll be the
*  same number or slightly fewer as Andy was mentioning, but they will likely be somewhat
*  stronger. This seems to be the best outcome. We're not sure, but this seems to be the outcome.
*  And it's important to remember, stronger is worse than fewer is better. So, overall,
*  climate will make the world a little bit worse. So, that's the bottom line. But,
*  and that's the real issue here, all the other things, the fact that people are much more
*  vulnerable is just vastly outweigh this, which is why if you look at the impact of hurricanes
*  and impact of pretty much everything, it is typically going down. If you look, for instance,
*  in percent of GDP, you have to look at percent of GDP because if you have twice as many houses,
*  obviously, the same kind of impact will have twice the impact or if they're worth twice as much.
*  If you do that in percent of GDP, and even the UN says that's how you should measure it,
*  it's going down. Why is that? It's because we're becoming more resilient. Just simply,
*  if you look at what happens when hurricanes come in, we have much better prediction in the long run.
*  That means you now know two or three days out that there's a big hurricane that's likely to come here.
*  What does that mean? All the things that can be moved, so typically all buses, all trucks,
*  everything that's not bolted down will leave this area. And so, you'll get less damage from that.
*  You will have more people knowing, oh, this is going to be a big one. They move to their relative
*  somewhere else. So, you'll have fewer people being vulnerable. If people are responsive and aware.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of way you can do this. So, the outcome, and this is important for the whole
*  conversation, the outcome is that we're actually becoming less vulnerable and that damages are
*  becoming smaller, not bigger. But had there not been global warming, it would probably have gone
*  down even faster. So, we would have become even better off quicker had there been no global warming.
*  But this is a crucial difference and this is what I find really hard to communicate.
*  Climate change is not this, oh my God, everything is going off the charts and we're all going to be
*  doomed kind of thing. Climate change is a thing that means we're going to get better, slightly
*  slower. And that's a very, very different kind of attitude. It's one of the many problems rather
*  than this is the end of all of us. And by the way, if you look at what's happening in the world,
*  the data also show that in rich places and poor places, we still are moving into zones of hazard
*  faster than climate is changing. Beth Tellman was at Columbia and she moved to Arizona. She and
*  colleagues at this outfit called Cloud to Street did an amazing study showing, this is a year or
*  so ago I wrote about, showing again, we're moving into zones of hazard, which it applies to me,
*  it applies to me, just what Bjorn was saying that people wouldn't be doing that if they thought
*  that was going to lead to devastation. And this is today, we're doing this now and it's flood
*  zones, wildfire zones. So that means there's these things to do. There's so much plasticity
*  in human behavior and how we build and where we build. You can make a big, big change in the
*  outcomes. One of the things to remember is people move to where hurricanes hit because when they're
*  not there, it's a really beautiful place to be. So in many ways, we make the trade-offs and say,
*  look, I'm happy to have an ocean view and then maybe a hurricane is going to hit. And of course,
*  it becomes a lot easier than when the federal government is actually subsidizing your risk
*  by saying, we'll ensure you're really cheaply. And that's one of the things that we should stop
*  doing. We should actually tell people, look, if you want to live where hurricanes hit,
*  maybe you should be more careful. By the way, what I was saying about
*  past storms, the paleotempestology, past fires, it's the same thing. We've suppressed fire
*  in the United States for a hundred years through much of the West, through wanting to save the
*  forests, the whole smokey, the bear thing. When these were landscapes that evolved to burn.
*  And what happened in the last hundred years? A lot of people love the West. We love these
*  environments. We love to live with the trees. The Boulder County area, the explosive development
*  in zones of implicit hazard leads to big bad outcomes when conditions align and climate
*  change is worsening some of those conditions. And sometimes it's really counterintuitive.
*  A wet season builds more grass. A dry season comes along, parches the grass. Then comes a human
*  ignition. It's almost always human ignitions. And then you have this disaster where a thousand homes
*  burn in Boulder County. And it's like, there's so many elements there that can be worked on
*  that give me confidence that we can change these outcomes. Disasters are not natural. Disasters are
*  designed really, some people say. Can I take a quick aside and ask about terminology of climate
*  change and global warming? Because you use it interchangeably. It isn't a side, but it's one
*  that's worthy of taking. Do those carry different meanings? And has that meaning changed over the
*  years? Between those two terms, are they really equivalent? Well, some people say there was this
*  industry or propagandistic shift from, let's see, what was it? Which came first? Oh no, they're
*  going to climate change now, like it's a new thing, which is ridiculous. The intergovernmental
*  panel on climate change in 1988 wasn't the intergovernmental panel on global warming.
*  It was on climate change. So these terms have been there. They've been sort of evolving. When
*  I wrote this cover story, it was the greenhouse effect. And that's fallen on a favor. Greenhouse
*  effect is not often talked about. Well, it's really, that's the physical effect that's holding
*  in the heat. It's not a good thing. There's terms that mean stuff and there's terms that
*  actually used in public discourse to designate what your whole umbrella of opinions you have.
*  And I guess as somebody, me, who doesn't pay attention to this carefully, you have to use
*  terms carefully because people will, you know, a noob that rolls into a topic will often use terms
*  to mean exactly what they mean, like literally, but they actually have political implications,
*  all that kind of stuff. So I guess I'm asking, is there like, is there, are you signaling
*  something by using global warming versus climate change? Or people have calmed down in terms of
*  the use of these? No, no, but the Guardian newspapers made it worse. Now they have their
*  style book. You know, every newspaper has a, they prescribe, they don't want their reporters to use
*  any of those terms anymore. They call it climate crisis, climate emergency. Oh yeah.
*  Global heating. It's literally in their rule book. Global heating. That sounds more intense.
*  That was the point. Well, I wrote about the global heating thing more than a decade ago.
*  That's been around, but you know, so they're doing the, what was the movie where the
*  comedy, the rock and roll comedy where he sets his amplifier goes to 11. You know,
*  the idea that you turned up the rhetorical volume and that's going to change people is ridiculous.
*  So for me, I mean, I use global warming and climate change interchangeably. And I think
*  it's fair. There's, you know, there's some technical ways that you can differentiate them.
*  But the reality is global warming is probably a better way to describe a lot of it because
*  this is really what is the main driver of what we worry about. Climate change seems a little
*  diffuse, but you know, it's convenient to when you talk about climate all the time that you can
*  call both of them. But I think the climate crisis and the climate catastrophe is really sort of,
*  this is the amping up of a catastrophe. And again, as we've talked about before,
*  if it really were true, we should tell people, but if it's not true, and I think there's a lot
*  of reasons why this is not a climate catastrophe, this is a problem. We're actually doing everyone
*  a disservice because we end up making people so worried that they say, we got to fix this in 12
*  years or whatever the number is. And also that it makes it almost impossible to have a conversation
*  of, you know, well, you know, maybe we should be focusing on vulnerability first. And a lot of
*  people, and I think a lot of well-meaning and well-intentioned people feel that it's almost
*  sacrilegious to do, you know, to say it's about vulnerability because you're taking away the guilt
*  of climate change. You're taking away our focus on dealing with climate change. Whereas I think
*  we would say, no, it's about stuff that actually works and, you know, doing that first.
*  Well, and by making it about carbon dioxide, you're implicitly making it about fossil fuels,
*  which implicitly gives you another great narrative, good guy, bad guy. It's these big companies.
*  Where's the source of alarmism? So is it the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?
*  Like what, there's a chain here. Is there somebody to blame along the chain or is this some kind of
*  weird complex system where everybody encourages each other? Can you point to one place? Is it
*  the media? Is it the scientists? I think the UN climate panel is fundamentally a really good
*  climate research group. You can have some quibbles with the way that they sort of summarize it in
*  politically coordinated documents and stuff. But fundamentally, I think they do a good job
*  of putting together all the research. This also means it's incredibly boring to read,
*  which is why virtually nobody does. I'm sure you have, but I'm pretty sure a lot of climate
*  journalists have never sort of looked past at least the summary for policymakers.
*  You're on a climate panel, they do predictions as well?
*  Well, they pull together all the stuff that people have published in the period literature
*  and then try to summarize it and basically tell you, so what's up and down with climate change.
*  They do that in four large volumes every four to five to six, seven years or something.
*  And yes, I think it's the gold plated version of what we know. There tends to be a lot of
*  people who say, well, this is what they say. Actually, they say so many different places
*  with so many different people that it's not quite clear exactly what they're saying often.
*  You can sort of find contradictions between one volume with one set of authors and another.
*  But yeah, I think this is fundamentally the right way that we know about climate.
*  But then it gets translated into how do you know about this? When most people don't read
*  4,000 pages, you read a new story in a newspaper and that new story will be very heavily slanted
*  towards if you say, so sea levels could rise somewhere between one and three foot. What do
*  you hear? Yeah, you obviously hear the three foot. Three foot is just more fun, more scary,
*  more interesting than one foot. And it's that way with all of these. So what's the prediction for
*  temperature rises that's somewhere from not very scary to pretty damn scary? And again,
*  you hear the pretty damn scary all the time. And then there's obviously always researchers who
*  are saying, well, but actually it could be a little more scary than that. And then there are
*  likewise researchers who say, well, it's probably not going to be as scary as that. And most of the
*  journalists will interview. Do you really put the blame fundamentally on the journalist?
*  I put it on the media setup. Look, media is simply trying to get clicks or sell newspapers.
*  And if you were just going to say, this is not a big issue, it just doesn't sell anything. But I
*  think you're probably much better able to address this. Folks can Google for my name Revkin and
*  the words front page thought in the newsroom every afternoon. Now we have a 24 seven news
*  cycle, so it's different. But back in the day, the New York Times, when it was a flourishing
*  print institution, every afternoon there was a front page meeting and the big poobah editors
*  would go in there and the desk editors come in with their pitches for the day. And my friend,
*  Corey Dean, who was the science editor for a chunk of my time, I remember having a conversation with
*  her about some new study of, I think it was Greenland, the ice sheet. And I laid it out for
*  her and she said, where's the front page thought in that? So we're all set up to look for that.
*  And the news environment has gotten so much worse than 10 or 20 years ago. At least you had filters
*  and limited number of outlets and there was some sense you could track with good or bad. There's
*  lots of problems with that system too. But now you have an information buffet. So if you want
*  to be alarmed or you want to stay in the tribe of those who think this is utter bull, you can find
*  your flow. And that has led, but getting back to this specific question, the 2018 IPCC report,
*  which was a special report commissioned to learn about the difference between 1.5 degrees of warming
*  and two, which sounds so weird and technocratic and complicated. That's the one that generated
*  the whole meme about eight years left. 12 years. Until doomsday. And that's the one.
*  This was the idea that there's a point we're going to, if we don't cut emissions in half by whatever
*  it was, 2050, we're doomed. That emerged from that specific report. And it wasn't something that was
*  in the report. It was in the spin around the report. And that's what captivated Greta appropriately
*  as a young person going home and with her unique vantage point and stuff. And that report,
*  I still need to dig in and write something deeper about what happened with that particular dynamics,
*  created this recent burst of we're doomed rhetoric that I think you're focusing on.
*  And it's all in the external interpretations, which journalism laps up because we're looking
*  for the front page thought. But it's not just the journalists. It's the whole system,
*  NGOs, environmental groups. And developing country, well-meaning leaders in developing countries,
*  because of the structure of this treaty that goes back to 1992, the Paris Agreement is part of,
*  they are now really looking for a way to portray this as a CO2 problem,
*  not a vulnerability. Well, there's a vulnerability aspect, but like in Pakistan, their
*  climate minister, which they didn't even have a climate minister five years ago,
*  is blaming everything that happened in Pakistan on carbon dioxide warming the climate, creating this,
*  when a lot of what was going on was also on the ground. And you can blame colonialism, Pakistan's
*  history, all kinds of things. But under the treaty, you want it to be about CO2, because that puts
*  the onus on rich countries. You're not paying us. Where's our money? And they're right. In the
*  context of what everyone agreed to, there was supposed to be $100 billion a year from rich
*  countries to poor countries starting in 2020. It didn't happen. It's like basically some money is
*  flowing, but it's not really made up money. Yeah. And so that whole dynamic, they latch onto the
*  climate science and they're very handy, quotable people. And you have a justice angle. You have
*  bad guys and good guys, which fits all of these narrative threads that come together into this
*  information storm we're still living with. And then of course, it's not Pakistan's fault either.
*  Right? I mean, it also actually, almost all leaders now say it's because of climate,
*  because then it's not, you know, we didn't do anything wrong. In Germany, for instance,
*  when we had that flood last year, it's not impossible that climate had a part in that,
*  but it's very, very clear that the main reason why so many people died in Germany and Belgium
*  was because the alarm systems didn't work. And this was plainly the local leaders in Germany.
*  Now, if I'm stuck here and basically have caused the death of 200 people, would I rather say,
*  yeah, that's on me or would I climb it? It's just such an easy scapegoat.
*  I don't want to place it all on the journalists, I think, because there's a lot of,
*  if I were to think about, what did you call it, front page thought, there's a lot of really
*  narratives that result in destruction of the human species. So nuclear war, pandemics,
*  all that kind of stuff. It seems that climate is a sticky one. So the fact that it's sticky means
*  there's other interests at play, like you guys are talking about in terms of politics, all that kind
*  of stuff. So it's not just the journalists. I feel like journalists will try anything for the
*  front page, but it won't stick unless there is bigger interests at play for which these narratives
*  are useful. So journalists will just throw stuff out there and see if it gets clicks.
*  It's like a first spark, maybe. It's maybe a tiny catalyst of the initial steps, but it has to be
*  picked up by the politicians, by interest groups and all that kind of stuff. Let me ask you,
*  Vjorn, about the first part of the subtitle, how climate change panic costs us trillions.
*  How does climate change panic cost us trillions?
*  So we're basically deciding to make policies that'll have fairly little impact, even in 50 or 100
*  years, that literally cost trillions of dollars. So I'll give you two examples. So the European
*  Union is trying to go to net zero. So our attempt to go halfway there by 2030 will cost about a
*  trillion dollars a year, and yet the net impact will be almost unmeasurable by the end of the
*  century. Why is that? That's because the EU and the rich countries, there's a fairly small part
*  of the emissions that are going to come out in the 21st century. Now, we used to be a big part of it,
*  that's mainly because nobody else, it was just the US and Europe and a few others that put out CO2
*  in the 20th century. So we used to be big, but in the 21st century, we'll be a small bit player.
*  And so we're basically spending a lot of money, and remember, a trillion dollars is a lot of money
*  that could have been spent on a lot of things that could have made humanity better, on something
*  that will only make us a tiny bit better. Now, it will do some good, but the reasonable estimates
*  is if you do a cost benefit analysis, and again, technically, it's really, really complicated,
*  but the basic idea is very, very simple. You just simply say, what are all the costs on one side,
*  and what are all the benefits? So the costs are mainly that we have to live with more expensive
*  energy, you have to forgo some opportunities, you have to have more complicated services,
*  that kind of thing. The benefit is that you cut carbon emissions, and that eventually means that
*  you'll have less climate damage, you'll have lower temperature rises and so on.
*  If you try to weigh up all of those, it's reasonable to assume that the EU policies will deliver,
*  for every dollar you spend, it'll deliver less than a dollar, probably about 30 cents back on the
*  dollar, which is a really bad way to spend dollars, because there's lots of other things out in the
*  world where you could do multiple. So for instance, if you think about tuberculosis or
*  education of small kids or nutrition for small kids and those kinds of things,
*  every dollar you spend will do like 30 to a hundred dollars worth of good. So they're much,
*  much better places where you could spend this money. Likewise, the US is thinking of going
*  net zero by 2050. It's not actually going to happen, but it's sort of a thing that everybody
*  talks about. Biden is talking a lot about it. If you look at the models that indicate how much will
*  that cost, it's not impossible that this will cost somewhere between two and four trillion dollars
*  per year by mid-century. And remember, if the US went carbon neutral today, by the end of the
*  century, that would reduce temperatures by about 0.3 degree Fahrenheit. So you would just be able
*  to measure it. It probably wouldn't in real life, but you'd just be able to measure it. Again,
*  this is not saying that there's not some good coming out of it, but you're basically spending
*  an enormous amount of money on fairly small benefits. So that's my main point.
*  S0 Yeah, this reminds me of what we were saying earlier about the things that models don't
*  integrate and the things that cost benefit leave out because you really can't go there.
*  One of the issues facing the world right now is the reality that we're reminded of,
*  that energy availability is a geopolitical destabilizer. If you have uneven access to energy
*  and you have Vladimir Putin coming into office or something else happening
*  that disrupts that system, you're vastly increasing poverty. This is playing out across
*  the world, fertilizer prices, fertilizer comes from gas, natural gas. If you can envision a world
*  later in the century where we no longer be holding on this material in the ground,
*  at least fossil fuels, cobalt and lithium for batteries, that's pretty cool.
*  Because you're taking away geopolitical instability, but that's not factored in,
*  right? That's way outside of what you would factor in. But it does feel like to me,
*  if I was going to make the case for you can choose your trillions, whatever that investing big
*  isn't for these marginal things, it's for looking at the big picture, a world of abundant energy
*  that doesn't come from a black rock or a gooey liquid that when you burn it creates-
*  But isn't that what the proposals are, is investing in different kinds of energy,
*  renewable energy? So what- But I don't think most people are making that case.
*  What's in the trillion in the T costs? What's incorporated, what are the big costs there?
*  So the big cost is that you have slightly lower productivity gains. So basically again,
*  this is sort of the opposite of what we just talked about about climate change.
*  We're going to get richer and richer in the world. This is all models also, the UN, this is really
*  the only way that you can get big climate change is because everybody gets a lot richer. So also
*  the developing world gets a lot richer. So we're likely to get richer. But one of the things that
*  drive wealth production is the fact that we have ample and cheap and available energy. If you make
*  that slightly harder, which is what you do with climate legislation, because you're basically
*  telling people you have to use a source of energy that you'd rather not have used because
*  if people wanted to do it, we'd already have solved the problem. So you're basically telling
*  me you've got to use this wind turbine instead of this natural gas plant or that kind of thing.
*  It's not that you suddenly become poor or anything. It simply makes production slightly harder. What
*  do you do when the wind is not blowing kind of thing? And of course we have lots of ways to
*  somewhat mitigate that, but it's a little more costly, a little more complicated, a little less
*  convenient. And that means you grow a little less. That's the main problem with these policies,
*  that it simply makes you somewhat less well off. So energy becomes more inefficient.
*  Yes. So let me challenge you here. Try to steal man some critics. So you have critics.
*  Yes. I would love you to take it seriously and consider this criticism and try to steal me on
*  their case. There's a bunch. I could mention this list of criticisms from Bob Ward in London School
*  of Economics. I don't know if you're familiar with him, but just on this point in terms of one of the
*  big costs being an energy, he criticizes your recent book in saying you consider the 143 billion
*  in annual support for renewable energy, but ignore the 300 billion in fossil fuel subsidies.
*  A lot of the criticism has to do with, well, you're cherry picking the models,
*  which the models are always cherry picking anyway. But you want to take those seriously.
*  So he claims that you ignore, you're not fully modeling the costs, the trade off here. How
*  expensive is the renewable energy and how expensive is the fossil fuel? Can you steal man's case?
*  Sure. So two things. The first, the quote, it's absolutely true that the world spends a large
*  chunk of money on fossil fuels and that's just stupid and we should stop doing it.
*  We should also recognize that this is not rich countries. This is not the countries where we're
*  talking about climate change. This is poor countries. This is Saudi Arabia. No, that's
*  actually not a terribly poor country. It's China. It's Indonesia. It's Russia. It's places where
*  you're basically paying off your population, just like your subsidized bread. You make sure
*  that they don't rebel by making cheap fuels available. That's dumb, but it's not like they
*  don't know what they're doing. They're mostly doing this for things that have nothing to do
*  with climate. So I totally agree we should get rid of it. It's hard to do. Indonesia's actually
*  somewhat managed to get rid of it because remember, if you spend a lot of money on fossil
*  fuel subsidies, you're basically subsidizing the rich because poor people don't have a car.
*  It's the rich people who can now buy very cheap gasoline. That's unjust as well. So it's dumb in
*  so many different ways. I would never argue that you shouldn't do it. I've plenty of time said we
*  should stop that, but we should also recognize these are mostly regimes that are not going to
*  be taken over either by my argument or Bob Ward's or anyone else's. They're doing this for totally
*  different reasons. Now, on the model side, there is virtually no economic model that don't show
*  this has a cost. The fundamental point is that this is a basic point from economics. The system
*  is already working most effectively because if it wasn't, you could actually make money changing
*  over. So if you want to have a change outside of what the system is already doing, it's because
*  you're saying you have to do something that you'd rather not want to do, namely use an energy
*  source that is less convenient or less cost effective and so on, and that will incur a cost.
*  Now, there's huge discussion about just exactly how much cost is that. So there's definitely cost.
*  Is the cost going to be one or five trillion? That's absolutely a discussion about where do
*  you take your models from? I try to do, and again, this is not possible everywhere. I try to actually
*  take the average of all of the economic models. So there's a group called the Stanford Energy
*  Modeling Forum, which tries to pull together all these different groups that do the modeling.
*  So some models, a lot of this cost actually comes down to the fact that we don't quite know how much
*  more fossil fuels you're going to need in the future. And so if your projections are you're
*  not going to use that much, the cost of reducing it is going to be very small. If you think you're
*  going to use a ton of extra fossil fuels and you have to reduce that, the cost is going to be bigger.
*  So I think- That's just one of the variables.
*  That's, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's many, many, many more.
*  I think the point here is to say that if you take the average of all the best models,
*  this is sort of aggregated. For instance, the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,
*  you're pretty secure ground. And so again, I would argue that Bob Ward,
*  yes, I've had a lot of run-ins with Bob Ward and he has a very different set of views on things.
*  But I just don't think he's right in saying that I'm cherry picking.
*  Well, yes. And I mean, he also has similar criticism about the estimate of the EU cost
*  of climate action based on the NOP 2013 model. But ultimately, these criticisms have to do is
*  what are the sources for the different models? And just very briefly, I mean,
*  I'm laying it out very transparently where I get these estimates from in the book. I've really
*  tried to document this. And yes, I mean, look, there's nobody who sort of has all the information
*  and gets everything right in all of these areas. I think most of Bob Ward's argument is not a good
*  faith effort to sort of improve on these estimates. He's right in saying some of these estimates,
*  we only have a few estimates. And yeah, I'd like to have more of them. One thing I should mention
*  is that there is very little interest in general and there's very little funding in finding out
*  how much do our climate policies cost? Because that's just inconvenient to everyone in the whole
*  game. Who wants to know that, for instance, would you want to fund something that says that the
*  Inflation Reduction Act is not going to be very effective? Of course you don't want to do that.
*  Again, it's a little bit the flock of birds will look at something else. And what I think is that
*  given that we're paying for it at the end, this is public money, we're deciding we're going to spend
*  money here rather than there. Let's at least look at what are the best estimates out there. I would
*  love to have more estimates. More estimates is always better.
*  Just a quick comment on the good faith part. Me as a consumer looking for truth, it's hard to find
*  who's good faith and not. So it's not only are you looking for sort of accurate information,
*  you're also trying to infer about the communicator of that information. It's very difficult.
*  You put me on the podcast, of course I'm going to say I'm a trustworthy guy.
*  I mean, but we believe we're trustworthy too. But I've been reading for various reasons,
*  but mostly because I've been traveling to Ukraine and thinking just about the people
*  suffering through war. I've been reading a lot about World War II and Stalin and Hitler.
*  And from the perspective of Hitler, he really believed he's doing good
*  for the world. And he was communicating from his perspective in good faith. He started to believe,
*  I think early on, his own propaganda. So even your understanding and perception of the world
*  completely shifted. So it's very, very, very difficult to understand who to trust.
*  And just because it's a consensus in a particular community doesn't necessarily mean it's a source
*  of trust. So basically, I don't know how to operate in this world, except to have a humility
*  and constantly questioning your assumptions. But not so much that you're completely out in the
*  ocean not knowing what is true and not. So it's this weird world because I ultimately, bigger than
*  climate, my hope is to have institutions that can be trusted. And that's been very much under attack
*  as part of the climate debate, as part of the COVID debate, as part of all these discussions.
*  And science, to me, is one of the sources of truth. And the fact that that's under question now
*  is something that hurts me on many levels, deeply.
*  You said something earlier that I took a note down here and I can't find it about cooperation.
*  It was like collaborative cooperation or something like that. To me, there was a point like in 2013,
*  after just dealing with everything you've been grappling with, if you know you don't know how
*  this is going to work out, what do you work on? And one morning I made a list of words that kind
*  of summarized basically system properties that give you confidence in a system, trust.
*  There are transparency as one, just as you were saying earlier.
*  Connectivity is another, so everyone's connected. So on the subsidy issue, for example,
*  there are young entrepreneurs in Nairobi who are selling ingeniously using Nairobi's digital
*  currency, propane, the fuel that's in our backyard barbecue grills, which comes out of gas wells,
*  but it's a separate fuel, in little increments that poor people can use instead of charcoal.
*  And LPG subsidies are helping them get people off of charcoal, which is a horrific
*  trade from the source through the warlords in Somalia and elsewhere who are getting the money
*  to the pollution in houses. So being sure when we're having these big debates about who the
*  World Bank is going to give loans to and drawing a simple line, no more fossil fuel subsidies,
*  hurts a really good, valuable, small scale but scalable way to have people not die from
*  cooking smoke in their houses and take down forests. But that only is considered if they're
*  in the conversation. So connectivity, full connectivity, digital access. So those
*  entrepreneurs are in the mix of people. When you're thinking about subsidies, you're not just thinking
*  about Big Bad Exxon, you're thinking about this little company in Nairobi, Pago LPG, I think is
*  the name, and India, the same thing. So you can list those properties of systems. And the IPCC
*  wasn't originally transparent when I started writing about it in 1988, 1990. And now it's
*  way more transparent. They have more public review. So it's even better than it was. It's
*  like a really good example of a science process of assessing the science, providing periodic
*  output to the world, and iteratively improving the model going forward because of critique,
*  because of scrutiny, and finding better ways for that to interface with people so they have
*  information they can use from that big thing. And the media are not doing a good job
*  because of this front page thoughtism. But we can all, I work partially in academia, Columbia,
*  on an initiative, partially in communication innovation. How can we have an open landscape
*  of access to information that matters? What can you do to foster better conversations so that words
*  like collapse aren't just thrown around like emblems? And so system properties give you
*  confidence, I think. And then you don't have to be flailing around for Bjorn or Tom Friedman or
*  Katherine Hayhoe. You can always, right now, find your character to follow. But I think what
*  would be better is if you actually develop some skills to just have a basic ability
*  to know how to cut to the chase.
*  Can I just follow up on that? Because one of the things that I try to do, and so my day job is
*  actually something else I work with, I think, called the Copenhagen Consensus, where we work
*  with more than 300 of the world's top economists and we work with seven Nobel laureates in economics.
*  And the point there is really to talk about where can you spend a dollar and do the most good for
*  the world? That's basically the thing that we try to do. And as you rightly point out, look,
*  there are lots of different estimates of what can you do, for instance, on climate. What can you do
*  on tuberculosis? What can you do for vulnerability in all kinds of different ways?
*  And if these were all sort of, well, you can spend a dollar here and do 2.36, but you can spend a
*  dollar here and do 2.34 over here, I would worry a lot. But that's not how the world works because
*  we're terribly inefficient. So there are literally lots and lots of amazing things you can do out
*  there. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit.
*  And there's a lot of not terribly great things that you can do. And unfortunately, one of the
*  things that I try to sort of battle is that we get a lot of things, right? That's why the world is
*  a lot better than what it used to be. But the things that are sort of left over are often
*  the boring things that happen to be incredibly effective and the exciting things that are often
*  not that terribly effective. And so I think one way to look at this is basically to have people
*  do cost-benefit across a wide range of areas. And we try to get a lot of different economists
*  to do this, and they come up with different numbers and different models and different results.
*  But if you sort of consistently get that some things give you in tens or maybe even hundreds
*  of dollars back per dollar, remember, this is not actually you getting rich. It's the world getting
*  rich. It's the world gets better worth $100 for every dollar you spend. And over here,
*  you can spend a dollar and do somewhere between 30 cents and maybe a couple of dollars.
*  You should probably be focused on the other opportunity first. And that's really the point
*  that I try to make with climate. There are some smart things we can do, and I hope we get to talk
*  about them in climate. But there's also a lot of sort of the standard approaches to fixing climate
*  turns out to be very likely below $1 back in the dollar and certainly not terribly high.
*  Even if you're very optimistic, it'll be like two or three, whereas many other things are just
*  fantastically better investment. Like the thing I've been advocating,
*  a modest proposal to eat the children of the poor in England. Was that the Jonathan Swift modest
*  proposal from a few centuries ago? So it's not just cost benefit. It's also in the context of
*  what is moral and all that, the full complexity. You just hit on something really important.
*  Having been on this beat for so long, and again, on the disaster beat as well,
*  earthquakes, I can't tell you how many disaster science experts keep telling me,
*  like everyone says, preparedness, invest for preparedness. A strict cost benefit analysis
*  will always tell you a dollar invested in resilience before a community gets hit by whatever
*  is worth 10. You'll always have to spend 10 after. And so it's fine to do the cost benefit stuff,
*  but it's just the baseline. Then you have to look at the social science, or history,
*  which shows you how few times we do it. It's like we just don't do it. Therefore,
*  you can bang that drum. Your work is valuable, but it's really constrained because show me in the
*  world where that does happen and then how you turn that success, which is basically something not
*  happening into the story. Just very briefly, we do this for a lot of countries. We did it for
*  Haiti, for instance, funded by the Canadian Development Ministry because they're basically
*  saying, we spent a billion dollars in Haiti since the earthquake and we really can't tell the
*  difference. They actually say that. They said, we want to find out what are the really smart things
*  you can do in Haiti. And so we together with lots of people in Haiti and all the business community
*  and the political community and the religious community and labor community and everybody else,
*  what are the smart things to do? And then we had economists evaluate it and there are a lot of
*  these things that everybody wanted that were not all that smart. There's actually a lot of smart
*  things. And yes, the politicians didn't pick most of them. So our sense is we try to give people,
*  you're thinking about these 70 things, you should actually just think about these 20 things.
*  And then we consider ourselves incredibly lucky if they actually do one of them.
*  So you wrote the book, How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.
*  Can we just list some of the things, if you got $75 billion, how do you spend them?
*  All right. So there's some incredibly good and very, very well-documented things that you could
*  spend money on. So we have two big infectious diseases that almost nobody think about,
*  because we only think about COVID. But tuberculosis used to be the world's biggest infectious disease
*  killer. It still kills about one and a half million people every year. The reason why we don't
*  really worry about it is because we fixed it 100 years ago. We know how to fix it. It's just
*  basically getting medication to people. It's also about getting them to take it when they've
*  been cured, because you need to take it for four to six months, and that's actually hard to do.
*  So you also need to incentivize that in some kind of way. It turns out it's incredibly cheap
*  to basically save almost all of the 1.5 million people. These are people that die in the
*  prime of their lives. They're typically parents, so it would also have a lot of knock-on effects.
*  And basically we find for a couple billion dollars, you could save the vast number of
*  these. Not all of them, but you could save the vast number of them. It would also improve
*  outcomes in all kinds of other ways. Likewise with malaria, another, it has some somewhat better PR.
*  It's funny to think of malaria as PR and tuberculosis, they need to improve their PR department.
*  Those mosquitoes are the good PR.
*  By far the biggest infectious disease that got good PR, if you will, was HIV.
*  Yes.
*  And I'm not trying to compare it and say, oh, it's worse or better to have HIV than
*  tuberculosis or anything, but I'm simply saying we are underfunding because it doesn't really
*  get the public attention. We don't really care.
*  But spending money on that has, in terms of benefit, a much bigger impact.
*  So every dollar you spend on TB will probably do about $43 worth of good.
*  So it'll do an amazing amount of good, basically because it'll save lives, it'll make sure parents
*  stay with their kids and be more productive in their communities, and it'll have a lot of
*  knock-on effects. And it's incredibly cheap to do. Same thing with malaria, it's mostly mosquito nets
*  that we need to get out.
*  And you're saying just to contrast with climate change, the dollar you spend on,
*  no, not climate change, but decreasing emissions does not come close to the $43 benefit?
*  No, nobody would ever argue that. So very, very enthusiastic climate advocates would probably say
*  it'll do $2 or $3 worth of good for every dollar. So it's still worthwhile to do.
*  That's what they would say. I would argue, and I think a lot of the evidence seems to side that way,
*  that a lot of the things that we're doing deliver actually less than a dollar back.
*  But it's certainly not nearly the same kind of place. But there's many, many other things.
*  And just if you'll allow me.
*  I love this.
*  There are lots of other things, for instance, e-procurement. So it's incredibly boring. So
*  most developing countries, well, actually most governments, spend most of their money on
*  procurement, is typically incredibly corrupt. So we did this project for Bangladesh.
*  Can you explain procurement?
*  Yes. So that's governments buying stuff. So a large part of the government revenue is spent
*  on buying anything from post-it notes to roads. And obviously, roads are much, much more expensive.
*  It's mostly infrastructure stuff. Hugely corrupt. For instance, in Bangladesh,
*  it would already have been decided among the ruling elite in that local area who's going to
*  get this. So they'll have this bidding competition where you have to hand in a sealed envelope with
*  your bid on it. But you put a goon outside the office. So you literally physically can't get in
*  with your bid. Now what we found, and I'm not claiming any sort of ownership to this.
*  A lot of smart people have done this way before. We're just simply proving that it's a good idea.
*  It turns out that if you put this on eBay, essentially, so if you do an e-procurement
*  system where bidders can come in, suddenly it becomes harder to put up the goon. You can
*  still do it, but it's harder to do it. It also means you get bids from all over Bangladesh.
*  In general, you'll get bids from all over. Actually, it turns out you get better quality.
*  But most important is you get it much cheaper. So basically, you can simply save money. So we
*  did a scaled experiment in Bangladesh where we had about 4% go to be e-procurement. And you could
*  compare what it would have cost and then what it did cost. And the average reduction was,
*  as I remember, it's 7%. And the finance minister loved it because that basically gives him a lot
*  more money or you can buy more stuff at the same cost. It reduces corruption.
*  So it's basically you get rid of some corruption. There'll still be corruption, but less corruption.
*  Ukraine has actually been big on this. Yeah, I've talked to them. I've talked to the digital
*  transformation minister. It's kind of incredible. I mean, this is before the war, but still
*  working. It's like the entirety of the government is in an app. And that one of the big effects
*  is the reduction of corruption. And not like from this was a politician say to say, we've reduced,
*  we've taken these actions. No, literally is just much more difficult to be corrupt.
*  The incentives aren't quite there and there's friction for corruption.
*  So basically you can spend a little bit of money and you can make a huge benefit. There's still
*  about 70 countries that haven't gone e-procurement. So obviously they should do that. Food for small
*  kids, another thing. So basically it's morally wrong that people are starving, but it also turns
*  out that it's a really, really dumb thing not to get kids good food. Because if you get them good
*  food, their brains develop more so that when they get into school, they learn more. And so when they
*  come out in adult lives, they're much more productive. So we can actually make every kid
*  especially in developing countries much more productive by making sure they get good food.
*  So getting good food is not cost free. So it probably costs about a hundred dollars,
*  both in you need some directed advertisement, you need to make sure that you actually get some of
*  the food out there, that you help the families and you also make sure you don't just give it
*  to everyone because then it becomes a lot more expensive. If you do that right, it costs about
*  a hundred dollars per kid, but per kid or for two years. So it's for their first two years of life.
*  And if you do that, you then get a benefit in that they become smarter and go longer to school and
*  they actually learn more and become more productive of $4,500. Remember this is far out into the
*  future. So this is discounted. The benefit is actually much higher. And this is one of the
*  things that we also have a conversation about in climate change, because when you talk about
*  climate change, cost and benefits, all the costs are now and all the benefits are in the future.
*  But it's just like that in education. All the costs are now, all the benefits are far into the
*  future. And if you try to do that right, and that's a whole other conversation that we could have,
*  then it turns out that for every dollar spent, you do $45 worth of good. Again, remember about a
*  third of all kids that go to school right now just don't learn pretty much anything.
*  And if we could make them more productive in the school system, we have another proposal on how to
*  do that in the school system. But by just simply making sure that they're smarter when they get
*  into school. We've been focusing so much on making the education system better, which is really hard,
*  but it's actually really easy to make the kids smarter.
*  Then when you say the education system is not working well, we're talking about not
*  the American education system, we're talking about globally.
*  Yes, we're talking about globally. So about a third of the teachers in developing countries
*  have a hard time passing the tests of the things they have to teach their students.
*  And all these students have lots of other issues. They need to do farm work. They're
*  constantly considering, should I just go out and start working instead?
*  There's constant disruption. There's a lot of teachers that don't show up in India.
*  You have this absurd situation where all the teachers are basically paid and hired for
*  eternity for the rest of their lives. And so not surprisingly, a lot of them decide not to show up.
*  Now they've hired assistant teachers that basically have taken over. So they're paying
*  for, I think it's 7 million teachers that I'm not saying they're all not working, but a lot of them
*  are not working as much as they should. And we now hired another 7 million teachers that will
*  eventually stop working as well. They're working much better right now because they're not on
*  permanent contracts, but eventually they'll get on permanent contracts and then you have the same
*  problem again. There's lots of these issues and it's just simply about saying we can't fix all
*  problems, but there are some problems that are incredibly easy to solve and there are some that
*  are incredibly hard to solve. Why don't we start with solving the easy and effective ones? And this,
*  of course, bears on that whole conversation on climate change because in some ways, that's also
*  Andy's point of saying, look, if you want to save people from the impacts of hurricanes, let's fix
*  this simple, easy things about vulnerability first. Whereas we have somehow latched onto this,
*  let's fix the hardest thing to do, which is to get everyone to stop using fossil fuels,
*  which is basically what's driven the last 200 years of development. That's a tall order,
*  no matter how you look at it. There's some really cool elements that you guys just brought up.
*  You mentioned that word moral before. I latched on to it because it relates to
*  these timescales that really are immeasurable. If you know it's going to take decades to
*  confirm the benefit of some investment now, that implies you're doing the investment
*  with some moral imperative, not because you can do a spreadsheet and come up with a number.
*  And that process, letting go of the need for a mechanistic cost benefit approach,
*  thinking about kids' education in poor countries or several things we talk about, seems to be
*  really important and it's very hard for all of us to do. Philanthropists suck at it. I worked at
*  National Geographic Society for a year, building some new programs when they got a big infusion
*  of money. They have a whole department that's called M&E. It's measurement and evaluation,
*  which is if you don't prove it, it goes away. I mentioned Spotify earlier, Spotify killing a
*  climate podcast because that podcast didn't measure out for their impact, what they want to do.
*  If we're always making the judgments based on strict cost benefit, we're going to miss
*  larger realities. Another thing is, a really exciting example of what you're talking about
*  in terms of Ukraine with the trust and lack of less corruption and stuff was in India.
*  For all of his issues, Modi recognized that middle-class people in India cook on LPG,
*  propane, or on piped gas, natural gas if they're in cities, much cleaner, much healthier in so
*  many ways. And actually, compared to chopping down trees and cooking on wood, it's actually
*  better for the climate, even though it's a fossil fuel. So he and others, there was an American
*  scientist, Kirk Smith, who worked this all out. They were getting a subsidy. They had that energy
*  subsidy. You were talking about the many poor countries subsidize energy just to stay in office
*  to make something cheap that everyone wants. But they wanted to shift the subsidy away from the
*  middle-class to the poor people who are cooking on firewood and dying young from pneumonia.
*  And the critical factor was India's digital currency. India went through a digital economy.
*  Very poor families there now. If you have a phone, basically that's your bank.
*  And you could make the case to the public that we're going to be starting to shift your
*  LPG, your propane subsidy to poor people. But we know they're poor. We know they're not just
*  going to be using it behind their restaurant, which was when it was a general subsidy,
*  people were hoarding the LPG. And the system has worked. They've shifted a lot of
*  capacity to cook on a clean blue flame that turns off and on in homes that previously,
*  where the woman would spend hours collecting firewood, smoky fire, cooking, clean the pots
*  and start all over again. But it's all built on trust, built on the digital economy and the same
*  thing in Nairobi. So that excites me every day with all the doomism. I just hope people can
*  literally take a breath, look for these examples that show the potential when you have a trustworthy
*  system, when you have a clear path to making lives better. And then knowing that kid having
*  electric light as opposed to a kerosene lamp, we don't know how much that's going to improve
*  his homework and lead to a better outcome. But we know from history that sometimes it does.
*  Ban Ki-moon, former secretary general. So the most powerful story I ever heard from a UN
*  secretary general was like 2012 when they were rolling out this sustainable energy for all
*  initiative, which is not just climate. It was just like getting people energy they need to
*  survive and thrive. He was growing up in post-war Korea. Everyone was poor. Everything was broken,
*  destroyed. Sadly, like so much of many parts of Ukraine. And he would do his homework by
*  kerosene lamp. He said when he was studying for his finals, his mom would give him a candle
*  because it was a brighter flame, better grades maybe. And he became secretary general.
*  What the hell of a story. So for climate change, which policies work which don't?
*  Which are when we look at this formula of $1 in, $45 out. For climate change,
*  what policies for $1 in and $1 out are good and which are not?
*  So we actually did a whole project back in 2009 when the whole world circus was coming to Copenhagen
*  and we were going to save the world there. We brought together about 50 climate economists
*  and three Nobel laureates to look at where can you spend a dollar and do the most good for climate?
*  And what they found was a lot of these things as we've been talking about before that basically
*  investing in the current sort of technology that we're trying very hard is at best a pretty dicey
*  outcome. Much of it is probably less than a dollar back in the dollar. There's some investments on
*  adaptation, for instance, that's pretty good, but it's sort of two, three dollars back in the dollar.
*  Oh, what is adaptation?
*  The obvious thing is that you build a dike for a sea level rise or that you get some apps that
*  people know that there's a hurricane coming or that, you know, so you can adapt to-
*  The data infrastructure, right? The physical and the digital infrastructure.
*  The point is that people are really good at doing this already because they have a strong
*  incentive to do it. So the extra thing that governments can do outside is somewhat good,
*  but it's not amazing or anything. What we found by far the best investment in the long run was on
*  investment in energy innovation. And I think this also sort of corresponds with what we would
*  think in general. If we could innovate, so, you know, for instance, Bill Gates is arguing
*  we should have fourth generation nuclear, so the next more advanced than what we currently have in
*  third generation nuclear, which would be industrial scale process. You'd just be building these, you
*  know, modular nuclear power plants. They would be, instead of being this artwork that we design
*  once for every different plant, which is one of the reasons why they're so expensive, they would
*  just be mass produced and you'd have one, you know, they all be recognized in one go. So be
*  much cheaper. They would also be passively safe. So if all the power goes, they'll shut down rather
*  than go boom. So that's another very good thing. And then they'll also be very hard to transform
*  into nuclear weapons. So you can actually imagine them being out in a lot of different places where
*  we'd perhaps be a little worried about having, you know, plutonium lying around. Now this is all
*  still being worked out, but imagine if that actually comes out. And again, remember the other
*  three generations, they were, we were also told that it'll be incredibly safe and it will be
*  incredibly cheap. And it didn't turn out that way. So let's wait, but it could be. And so the argument
*  is invest in these ideas, for instance, fourth generation nuclear. And if fourth generation
*  nuclear becomes cheaper than fossil fuels, we're done. Everyone will just switch, not just rich,
*  well-meaning Americans or Europeans, but also the Chinese, the Indians, everybody in Africa,
*  the rest is Indian subcontinent. That's how you fix these issues. Right? So the idea here is to say,
*  instead of thinking that we can sort of push people to do stuff they really don't want to do,
*  which is basically saying, let's use more of the, you know, the solar and wind that you would
*  otherwise have invested in, force people to buy an electric car by giving huge subsidies,
*  because otherwise they're clearly not all that interested in buying it and so on.
*  Then get the innovations such that they become cheaper than fossil fuels and everyone will
*  switch. This is how we've solved problems in the past, if you think. And in Los Angeles in the 1950s
*  was hugely polluted place, mostly because of cars. The sort of standard climate approach today
*  would be to tell everyone in Los Angeles, I'm sorry, could you just walk instead? And of course,
*  that just doesn't work. That doesn't pay off. You never get, you know, politicians voted in office,
*  or at least staying in office, if you make that kind of policy. What did solve the problem
*  was the innovation of the catalytic converter. You basically get those little gizmo and it cost
*  a couple hundred dollars and you put it on your tailpipe and then you can drive around,
*  basically almost not pollute. And that's how you fix the air pollution in Los Angeles.
*  Basically, we've solved all problems in humanity, all big, difficult problems with innovation. We
*  haven't solved it by telling everyone, I'm sorry, could you be a little less comfortable and a
*  little more cold and a little poorer and believing that that can go on for decades? And while it
*  possibly works in some pockets of the US, and I think actually in large parts of Europe, at least,
*  it used to, the war in Ukraine is definitely sort of changing that whole perspective. But,
*  you know, there's a willingness to say, we're going to suffer a little bit, then we'll fix this
*  problem. But the point is, we're going to be willing to suffer a little and so fix a tiny bit
*  of the climate problem instead of actually focusing on innovation. So what we found was,
*  if you spend a dollar on innovation, you will probably avoid about $11 of climate
*  damage in the long run, which is a great investment. And the terrible thing is,
*  we have not been doing this. So because everybody is focused on saying, we need this solution within
*  the next 12 years, it means you're not thinking about the innovation. We're actually spending
*  less money, not more money on innovation globally. So everyone is focusing on reducing carbon emission
*  versus innovating on alternate energy. You're basically focusing on putting the existing solar
*  panels or wind turbines, which are either just about inefficient or inefficient, instead of
*  making the next generation, or it's more likely the 10th generation after that, that comes with
*  lots of battery backup power or fourth generation nuclear, or Craig Benter has this great idea.
*  Craig Benter, the guy who cracked the human genome back in 2000, he has this idea of growing
*  algae out on the ocean surface. These algae, they'd be genetically modified and they would
*  basically soak up sunlight and CO2 and produce oil. Then we could basically just grow our own
*  Saudi Arabia out on the ocean surface and we'd harvest it. We'd keep our entire fossil fuel
*  economy, but it'd now be net zero because we just soaked up the CO2 out there.
*  One dollar invested in the portfolio of different ideas.
*  Gives $11 back.
*  I first wrote about that in the New York Times. It was one of my actual page one stories.
*  In 2006, it was declining R&D in energy at a time of global warming. The baseline is so low
*  for this that it's a super bargain. There was during the energy crisis, the first energy crisis,
*  in the 70s before the current one. Our annual spending in the United States and constant dollars
*  on R&D, research and development for energy, was about $5 billion. It's just dribbled away
*  since then. Recently now, there's a big burst of new money coming through these new bills
*  that got passed. What I was told over and over again by people in that arena is you
*  can't just have these little bubbles of investment. You don't get young people
*  away from thinking about Wall Street for jobs towards thinking about energy innovation
*  if there isn't a future there. In the United States and Europe, the presumption was the
*  wage of that future was taxing carbon. You make that so punitive that you're basically
*  even in the landscape for cleaner stuff that's more expensive. That has failed completely.
*  There are little examples in Europe where it's working. What's happened now is,
*  well, the United States, this big chunk of money is designed to take us over a finish line
*  that was started with not just innovation but with the production efficiency too.
*  This is one thing I got wrong, I think, a little bit in my reporting. I was so fixated on the
*  innovation part just because I love science too. I saw this untapped possibility that others were
*  saying, no, no, production efficiency, the more people are producing batteries, the cheaper they'll
*  get. This is Elon Musk's path and many others. It really is both. When you were talking about
*  purchasing power for governments, for example, that can stimulate production capacity for batteries
*  or whatever the good thing is and take you down faster. It's all about getting that margin
*  of the new thing out competing the old. It's not just innovation. It has so many parts of the
*  pipeline that need to be nurtured. The other thing is relative cost. The United States,
*  when I was writing about this in 2006, our budget for DARPA, the Advanced Research Project Agency
*  for the Defense Department, just for science, was $80 billion a year. For health, for medical
*  frontier research on cancer and stuff, $40 billion. Energy was two or three.
*  We weren't taking this remotely seriously. To me, there's this level,
*  you know we're taking something seriously when it's in the tens of billions for R&D.
*  It's not that R&D will solve the problem, but it's a proxy for what we really care about.
*  We care a shitload about defense. What's the defense budget in the United States now? Like
*  $800 billion? It's some insane number. Who's counting when you're having fun?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Innovation is not just for the better camera, the better solar panel,
*  the better battery. Social innovation actually matters hugely. Like the guy in Nairobi I mentioned
*  with a company doing micropayment gas to get people off charcoal. We need that as much as this.
*  I actually interviewed Bill Gates. We had spent an hour with him in Seattle in 2016
*  when he was rolling out his breakthrough energy thing. I got to spend, it was 45 minutes,
*  me and Bill Gates, which was pretty fun. I brought this up. I said, you know, because he's all about
*  the new nuclear thing that will solve the world's problems. Yes, yes, yes, but we also-
*  He brought up nuclear? Sorry to interrupt.
*  Oh, he did. Oh, sure. Yeah.
*  So he's interested in one of the-
*  Oh, he's investing heavily in nuclear, but he invests in everything. He's got a big
*  portfolio. But I brought up a guy I met in India who runs a little outfit called Selco
*  that they do really interesting, cool village to village. They're like an energy analyst who
*  come to your house here in the States and tell you how to weatherize your house, but they do it at
*  the village scale. And in a village that has where they're milling wheat, he'll put in a solar powered
*  wheat mill. And that's not going to solve the world's problems, but it gives them a way to
*  control their energy. They don't have to buy something to grind their wheat. And that needs
*  just as much attention as the things I really like too, the cool technologies. And I thought
*  I cornered Bill Gates. I was like, because he really does focus on these big wins, the big
*  nuclear that will make net zero completely doable. And I said, well, what about New York City,
*  where I was still living at the time, near? And I said, it's got a million buildings.
*  New York City has 1 million buildings. And in 2013, the Bloomberg government
*  analyzed, they said, looking ahead to 2050, 75% of the buildings in New York City that will exist
*  in 2050 already exist. You think about these brave new futures, right? We're just going to come in,
*  have these shiny, cool passive house cities. And so I put this to Bill and I said, so
*  how do you do that? How do you retrofit all those boilers, many of which were coal fired like 20
*  years ago, to get a zero energy New York City? And I kind of thought I had him. And then he
*  sat back and went, well, but if you have unlimited clean power coming into that city,
*  that doesn't really matter. It's a pretty good Bill Gates impression.
*  It was a good answer. I mean, it was a good answer. He said, oh yeah, it's a leaky bucket,
*  but pour in zero carbon energy, then it doesn't matter. But I still think we have to figure out
*  the other part too, that end, how do you innovate at the household level, at the village level?
*  It's much more of a distributed problem, we used to think. The one big change I've had
*  in my own thinking too is from top down to distributed. Everything about the climate problem
*  through the first three decades of my reporting was that the IPCC will come out a new report,
*  the framework convention, the treaty will get us on board, we'll all behave better. It has this
*  top down parent to child architecture. And everything I've learned has gone the other way.
*  It's distributed capacity for improved lives, kids getting through school, women not having to
*  spend three hours collecting firewood. And if it means propane for that household in that context,
*  that's a good thing. So stop with all your yammering about any oil, fossil fuel subsidies.
*  And what's an America look like that has some climate safe energy future? Find your part in
*  that. Don't get disempowered by the scale of it. There's like a thousand things to do. When you
*  start to cut it into pieces. So it's very different, it's not a top down thing. No one's
*  going to magically come in and- And that's where I think, so I agree that everyone should try to
*  play their part and do whatever they can. But I also think just the sheer incentives, what we saw
*  happening with shale gas is a great example. When shale gas becomes so cheap that you just stop using
*  coal, then you don't really have to convince lots and lots of people coal is really bad.
*  It just happened. And it wasn't labeled a climate thing. It wasn't an energy thing.
*  It was totally. And the point is just the power of an innovation is that you almost
*  don't see it anymore. It just happens. And I think that's really the only way we're going to fix
*  these big problems. If you think about the nutrition problem back in the 60s, 70s,
*  we worried a lot about India and other places. A solution is not worrying or the solution was not
*  us eating a little bit less and sending it down to India or wherever. The solution was the green
*  revolution. It was the fact that some scientists made ways to make every seed produce three times
*  as much so you could grow three times as much food on an acre. And that's what basically made it
*  possible for India to go from a basket case to the world's leading rice exporter. And that's how you
*  do these things. You solve these big problems through innovation. And again, I'm not saying
*  we're actually arguing a carbon tax is a smart thing to do. That's what any economist would
*  tell you to do. But it also turns out that it's partly, it's not going to solve most of the problem
*  and it's incredibly politically hard to do. So it may also just be the wrong tree to bark up.
*  Again, if you can do it, please do. But this is not the main thing that's going to solve climate.
*  The main thing is that we get these innovations that basically make green energy so cheap,
*  everyone will just want. We mentioned nuclear quite a few times. There was for a long time,
*  it seems to have shifted recently. Maybe you can clarify and educate me on this. But
*  for the longest time, people thought that nuclear is almost unclean energy or dangerous energy or
*  all that kind of stuff. When did that shift? What was the source of that alarmism? And maybe is that
*  a case study of how alarmism can turn into a productive, constructive policy?
*  Productive from whose standpoint?
*  Is it not? Is it not like nuclear?
*  You mean productive in terms of yay, we banned it or productive for those?
*  Oh, I see. I see what you mean. Yes. I meant productive for human civilization.
*  No, the alarmism over nuclear power dominated any alarmism over global warming. Absolutely.
*  Oh yeah. This is in the United States, Three Mile Island, then you had Chernobyl there.
*  And the traditional environmental movement still won't go there. The big groups, NRDC, EDF,
*  that whole alphabet soup of the big greens are reluctant to put forward the nuclear option
*  because they know a lot of their aging donors basically grew up in the thinking about nuclear
*  as the problem, not the solution. I lived for the last 30 years. I moved to Maine recently,
*  but I lived in the Hudson Valley, 10 miles from the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant,
*  which was built in the 60s, 70s and had some problems. None of them were to the point of
*  a meltdown or the threat of it, even the theoretical possibility of one.
*  I've been in, I was in it twice as a reporter, you know, looking down in the cooling pool.
*  I can send you a fun video of bubbles in the cooling pool with the rods. And
*  progressively they demonstrated how to handle waste. In the United States now, the waste is,
*  because we haven't figured out how to move it across state lines, it's glassified. It's put
*  into kind of containers that sit there at the plant. We just simply don't have a long-term solution.
*  And the Nevada politicians were successful in saying, not here, not Yucca Mountain.
*  But my wife, who I've been married to, well, I met 30 years ago and she lives with me. She's
*  an environmental educator. She was very happy when Cuomo shut it down, said we're going to shut it
*  down three or four years ago, which just happened a year. It actually has shut down now. It's being
*  muffballed. And I was like, that sucks. We need-
*  But she's happy.
*  Yeah. And we still love each other.
*  And she's an environmentalist. So that just speaks to a lot of environmentalists still see nuclear as
*  bad.
*  Oh, totally. Oh yeah. You know, and you bring in the weapons proliferation issues. But it's a
*  safety thing. It's a generational thing. I think young people are different, I hope. These small
*  modular reactor designs, several of which there's a couple of PhDs from MIT who did transatomic
*  power. They're both like in their early 30s. We need so much more of them.
*  And just briefly, the one thing I say about nuclear is, like with so many of these things,
*  like subsidies, don't talk to me about yes, no nuclear. Talk to me about what do you want to do
*  with existing nuclear power plants? And what do you want to do about the possibility of new ones?
*  Let's parse this out in chunks that we can have constructive conversations about. The idea of no
*  nuclear drives me crazy. Just like no fossil fuel subsidies is silly in the world we inhabit that
*  has these pockets of no energy. So that's just my sustain what mantras start with some dividing it
*  divide and conquer. To conquer the dispute over by saying, let's at least get real.
*  This power plant has been in the Hudson Valley for 30 years. It was the baseload. It was baseload.
*  Baseload is a real thing. And guess what has filled the gap since that power plant has turned off?
*  Natural gas, natural gas. And you don't hear that from the environmental community that was so eager
*  to turn off the Indian point. I think both the point of saying that people are saying it's the
*  end of the world, but no, I don't want a nuclear power plant. It just doesn't make sense. And Andy
*  is absolutely right to talk about so existing nuclear power plants. We already pay for them.
*  We already have them. We already committed to decommissioning them eventually. While they're
*  running, they're pretty much the cheapest power you can possibly have on the planet because it
*  costs almost nothing to run them day to day. So it's basically cheap or almost free CO2 baseload
*  power. There's just nothing there that you should embrace. Now, new nuclear power plants
*  turn out to be very expensive currently. So the one they built in Finland, some in the UK and
*  France and several other places turn out to be incredibly expensive. So they're much more
*  expensive than the costliest renewables you can imagine. So they're actually not a solution right
*  now. And that's why we need the innovation. That's why we need the potentially fourth generation
*  nuclear power. It's just simply, it's a bad deal. And that's why nuclear is never going to
*  win on its third generation. Now, it may never get there. Who knows? But it's certainly a
*  a possibility and we should be looking into it.
*  Yeah. And there are wonky realities that need to be dealt with. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
*  in the United States, their approval process is still locked and designed on this 50-year-old
*  model of big giant power plants. There's an intense discussion right now about evolving
*  a new regulatory scheme for small modular ones because of all these implicit advantages they
*  offer. And that, so along with the innovation, you need to have this get out of the way or you're
*  never going to have the investment. So it really is an all of the above thing. Looking at these
*  as systems problems, systems solutions is really important.
*  Let me ask you about Alex Epstein. So he wrote, I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is,
*  but he wrote a couple of books. It's just interesting to ask a question about fossil
*  fuels because we're talking about reality and he's somebody that doesn't just talk about the
*  reality of fossil fuels, but he wrote a book, a moral case for fossil fuels and fossil future,
*  where he makes the case that as his subtitle says, global human flourishing requires oil,
*  coal and natural gas or more oil, coal and natural gas, not less.
*  What do you think about the argument he makes? So he pushes, we've had this kind of speaking of
*  the center of this balanced discussion of the reality of fossil fuels, but also investing a lot
*  into renewable energy and that having the $1 to $11 return. So he says like, I'm not sure exactly
*  how to frame it, but the investing and maintaining investment to fossil fuels also has a positive
*  return because of how efficient the energy is. I've read the first book. I've got his second one.
*  I've been planning to have him on my webcast, my tiny webcast. What's the name of the webcast?
*  Sustain what? Everything I do is sustain what? Because it's like, don't talk to me about
*  sustainability. Sustain what? For whom? How? Then we're talking, interrogatory approach to things.
*  So I think the valuable part of what he has done is to remind people, particularly in the West or
*  North of what everyone, the developed world, that everything we take for granted, from low fertilizer
*  prices to air conditioning to everything else exists because we had this bounty that we dug out
*  of the ground or pumped out of the ground. It's a boon. It's been an amazing boon to society.
*  Period. So start there. Which means going forward, what we're talking about is a substitution
*  or having your fossil fuels and eating it too, meaning getting rid of the carbon dioxide. If
*  you focus on the carbon dioxide, which is the thing warming the planet, not the burning of the fuels,
*  then that's another way forward that could sustain fossil fuels. As far as I can tell from at least
*  the first book, he makes the moral case that fossil fuels are essentially a good overall.
*  I don't think he adequately accounts for the need to stop global warming. I think that
*  slowing global warming is a fundamental need in this coming, in this century we're in.
*  And that's just not factored into his math. Well, I think that's where,
*  I've had a few sort of offline conversations with him. I think he said, because I mentioned
*  I'm talking to the two of you, he said that that's probably where he disagrees about sort of the
*  level of threat that global warming causes. Well, Steve Kuhnen is another one. He's a
*  brilliant guy. He lived right close to me in the Hudson Valley. He was in the Obama administration
*  energy department. It's K-O-O-N-I-N. He wrote a bestseller that came out recently on skepticism
*  about climate. And there are other smart people who somehow feel we can literally adapt our way
*  forward without any constraint on the gases changing the climate. And I've spent enough time
*  on this. I think I'm a pretty level-headed reporter when it comes to this issue. And I think having
*  some sense that we can adapt our way into the world we're building through relentless climate
*  change with no new normal, remember, more gas accumulating in the air every year.
*  These are not static moments. That's a good thing to do. It doesn't strike me as smart.
*  I'd probably say that I think it's more sort of a, at least the thing that I take away from Alex
*  is the fact, as you point out, that we need to recognize that fossil fuels is basically the
*  backbone of our society today. We get 80% of our energy from fossil fuels today.
*  Still, as we did 50 years ago, 40 years ago.
*  Yeah. And people have no sense of this, right? So they have the idea, because you see so many
*  wind turbines and solar panels and everybody's talking about it, that this is huge big things.
*  But the reality is, remember, only about a fifth of all energy use is electricity. The rest is
*  processes and heating, industrial processes and so on. So actually, solar and wind right now
*  produces 1% of energy from wind and 0.8% from solar. This is not a huge thing. It's a fairly
*  tiny bit. And growing explosively.
*  Yes, it's absolutely growing. But actually, it's growing slower than what nuclear was growing in
*  the 70s and 80s, which I thought was a fun point, not by a little amount, by like two or three times.
*  So we're still talking about something which is somewhat boutique, at least. And when you
*  then look out into the future, and I think this is the interesting part of it, when you look out into
*  the future, if you look at the Biden administration's own estimate of what will happen by 2050,
*  we will be at, if all countries do all the stuff that they promised and everything,
*  we will be at 70% fossil fuels by 2050, globally. Yes, it's a better world. I think it's good that
*  we're now down to 70 instead of 80. But it is still a world that's fundamentally dependent on
*  fossil fuels for almost everything that we really like about the world. And forgetting that, and I
*  think we are doing that in the sense, as you also mentioned, that people say no fossil fuels. And
*  in all development organizations, we're now telling the poor countries, you can't get any funding
*  for anything that has to do with fossil fuels. We have literally reduced our investment in
*  oil and gas by more than half since 2014. And much of this is because of climate concerns.
*  This has real world consequences. This is why energy prices have gone up. It's not the only
*  reason, COVID also, certainly the war in Ukraine, but this is an underlying systemic reason why
*  fossil fuel costs will go up dramatically. Now, a lot of Greens will sort of tend to say,
*  well, that's great. We want fossil fuels to be expensive. We want people to be forced over to
*  renewables. But that's very easy to say if you're rich. It's the kind of thing that New Yorkers will
*  say when you go to rich, well-meaning, green New Yorkers and say, yes, gasoline should cost $20 a
*  gallon. Well, you don't have a car. You just ride the Metro. It's very easy for you to say that.
*  But lots of people, both in the rich world and in poor parts of the US, but all around the world,
*  their lives have basically depended on fossil fuels. And so the idea that we're going to get
*  people off by making it so expensive that it becomes impossible for them to live good lives
*  is almost morally reprehensible. And I think Alex has the right point there. We need to get people
*  to realize we're not going to get off fossil fuels anytime soon. So we need reasonably affordable
*  fossil fuels for most of the world. And that's of course why we need to focus so much more on
*  the innovation so that we can get to the point where we no longer need fossil fuels as soon as
*  possible. But to say to everyone, look, we're going to make fossil fuels expensive way before
*  we have the solution is just terrible. And so much is on the rich countries of the world.
*  I did a conversation recently with Johann Rockstr√∂m, who's a famed sustainability
*  scientist in Stockholm. Actually, Potsdam now. And he's come up with the idea of planetary
*  boundaries. There are lots of things he has said that as a journalist, I'm still looking into about
*  that. Yeah, that there are limits to what earth can absorb in human, our use of water, phosphorus,
*  our carbon dioxide loading in the atmosphere. There are these tipping, there are these boundaries
*  if we cross them, we're in a hot zone, a danger zone. He's an interesting thinker. But on this
*  point, last year at the Glasgow climate talks, he gave a very important talk about the equity
*  thing here. He basically laid out a landscape saying the rich nations of the world need to
*  greatly ramp up their reduction of emissions or what they're going to pay poor countries to do.
*  To allow poor countries, some of which have fossil resources like in Africa,
*  to have the carbon space to own whatever space or time is left to be able to develop their
*  their fossil fuels as a fundamental right. Because also they're starting from this little
*  baseline. Ghana hasn't contributed squat to the global warming problem in terms of emissions.
*  Ghana has natural gas. And right now, this month, environmental groups are outside the World Bank
*  today, actually tonight, saying this was on their list of dirty projects. World Bank should stop
*  financing Ghana's right to get gas out of the ground, to develop its economy, get its people
*  less poor, make them more productive, innovative parts of humanity. To me, that's really
*  reprehensible. One of the other projects on their list as a World Bank kind of gotcha, like how dare
*  they give money, was for a fertilizer factory in Bangladesh that is designed to get three times
*  as much fertilizer from the same amount of natural gas as the old plants that are now dormant.
*  That's this is in a time when we're facing high energy prices, high gas prices, high food prices,
*  when food insecurity is spreading rapidly, when a country like Bangladesh has millions of rice
*  farmers who need urea tablets to put in their rice fields. And to say that shouldn't that that how
*  dare they finance that because there's a fossil fuel involved is immoral. So yes, on that point
*  from Alex. So this is 2022 poll. Polls. Just this is a bunch of different ways to look at the same
*  basic effect in the United States. Democrats, younger Americans identify dealing with climate
*  change as a top priority. US adults, 42% say that dealing with climate change should be a top priority.
*  11% of Republicans, 65% of Democrats. And we could see this effect throughout.
*  46% of Americans say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change. By the way,
*  this is a little bit different than what we're discussing. I was just looking through different
*  polls. In the public, there seems to still be uncertainty about how much humans contribute to
*  climate change. More than the scientific. It would only be 24% that disagree with the UN climate
*  panel. Three quarters would agree. Are you uncomfortable about the 29? 29 is exactly right.
*  The UN doesn't say it's all. Well, they say that could be the border case. But anyway, this is
*  interesting. But to me, across all these polls, if you look Republican versus Democrat, Republican,
*  say that 17% say it's a great deal. Democrats say 71% say it's a great deal. And you just see this
*  complete division. I think you probably, the COVID pandemic, you can ask a lot of questions like this.
*  Do masks work? Are they an effective method to slow transmission of a pandemic? You'll probably
*  have the same kind of polls about Republicans and Democrats. And while the effectiveness of masks,
*  to me, is a scientific question. So there's different truths here, apparently. One is a
*  scientific truth. One is a truth held by the scientific community, which seems to be also
*  different than the scientific truth sometimes. And the other is the public perception that's
*  polluted or affected by political affiliation. And then there's whatever is the narrative that's
*  communicated by the media. They will also have a question, the answer to the question of whether
*  masks work or not. And they will also have an answer to the question about all these climate
*  related things. So that's a long way of asking the question of how is politics mixed into all of this
*  on the communication front, on the figuring out what the right policy is front, on the friction
*  of humanity in the face of the right policies. Well, I've written a ton on this. After I had
*  that conversion about the social science in 2006, I began digging in a lot more on how people hold
*  beliefs and what they do as opposed to what they think and questions about polling. And there's two
*  things that come to me that make me not worry about the basic literacy. Is climate change
*  X percent of whatever? I don't really care about that. And I'll explain why. For one thing,
*  more science literacy, more basic literacy, like what is a greenhouse gas, all that stuff,
*  Dan Kahane, K-A-H-A-N at Yale, he's actually at Yale Law School. The last decade, he did all
*  this work in what he calls cultural cognition, which is, and he did studies that showed how what
*  you believe emerges based on culture, based on your background, your red, blue, where you are in
*  the country. And one of the really disturbing findings was that the people who have the most
*  basic science literacy, like who know the most about greenhouse effect or whatever,
*  they're at both ends of the spectrum of views on climate, dismissives and alarmed. Steve Kuhnen,
*  as I mentioned, is a good example. He's a brilliant physicist and he knows all the science and he's
*  completely at the end of skepticism. Will Happer, who was close to being Trump's science advisor,
*  was even more out there and he's on, they're both on the Jason committee that advises the
*  government on big strategic things. And people who are really alarmed about it also have the
*  same belief. So as a journalist, I was thinking, do I just spend my time writing more explanatory
*  stories that explain the science better? No. Do I dig in on this work to understand
*  what brings people together? And then these same surveys, the same science shows you,
*  if you don't make it about climate, among other things, this becomes, you don't have to worry
*  about this anymore. If you Google for, Google for no red, blue divide climate revkin, you'll find
*  a piece I did with some really good graphs. Essentially it shows that in America, this is
*  the Yale group again, their climate communication group. There's no red, blue divide on energy
*  innovation. None. We need more climate energy, clean energy innovation. There wasn't even a divide
*  country by state, by state on whether CO2 should be regulated as a pollutant.
*  But it's all like, what are the questions you ask if you ask about innovation, if you ask about
*  more incentives for renewable power? Oklahoma, Iowa, I did a piece when I was at ProPublica
*  showing that the 17 states that were fighting Obama in court over his clean power plan,
*  were actually, the majority of them were actually meeting the targets that the clean power plan had
*  because they're expanding wind power already, not because of the climate, because it makes money
*  sense and energy sense. So you don't think there's a political divide in this? There is on climate,
*  if you call it climate. If you say it's a climate, do you believe in the climate crisis? You're not
*  asking what kind of energy future do you want in your town? And so if you ask that question,
*  the polarization goes away. I guess I'm asking, is there polarization on policy?
*  No, well, there, again, the bipartisan infrastructure law that was passed last
*  November, that was bipartisan. All of Congress said yes, and that's a trillion dollars,
*  several hundred billion of which are for cleaner energy and resilience.
*  Yeah, but that's- But it's not a climate bill,
*  and it wasn't a tax. It's incentives. So the word climate and similar words are just used as part
*  of the signaling, like masks. Absolutely. It's not-
*  Dan Kehan's work, the guy at Yale, he really demonstrated powerfully abortion, gun rights,
*  climate, and a more parsed level of nuclear power, has enduring camps that for and against-
*  Why do the camps form? Some of it's cultural cognition. It's how you grew up. It's what you
*  fear. There's no common human frame for- Because of folks, certain individuals like Al Gore.
*  He would make a film. He cares about this thing. He's a Democrat.
*  Therefore, I hate this thing. Therefore, I don't like this thing, yeah.
*  Oh, sure. Yeah. When people get attached to an issue, if that's what pops into your head
*  when you hear climate, then- And it got politicized. It became emblematic,
*  and the whole vaccine thing. I'm not American, so I should stay a little
*  bit out of this, but I think it seems to me that a lot of the thing that people believe and talk
*  about is really about what they worry that that will lead to in terms of policy down the line.
*  So a little bit like, do masks work? I'm imagining. I don't know whether this is true,
*  but I think part of it is if I say masks work, they're going to force me to wear it for the
*  next year. So it doesn't work because then I don't have to wear it kind of thing.
*  You're looking much further down the line, and certainly on climate, it seems to me that a lot
*  of the people who say it's not real, it's not because they don't know it's- Of course, it's
*  real, but it's that they don't want you to then come and regulate it heavily.
*  Totally. Yeah. Because they don't like top-down government.
*  Yeah, and also because they don't want another tax. So it's not a straight science question.
*  It really is a question of what do you want to do? And that's where I think, Andy, you're much,
*  much more right in saying we should have that discussion. So what do you want to do? Because
*  that will be a much easier conversation to say, do you want to do really smart, cheap stuff,
*  or do you want to do pretty dumb, expensive stuff? When you put it that way, you can get
*  most people on board. Of course, it's not as simple as that, I know.
*  And it gets back to what you said earlier, that again, you talked about collaborative
*  cooperation or whatever. There's a guy at Columbia, Peter Coleman, who runs this thing called the
*  Difficult Conversations Laboratory. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome.
*  And when I first heard about it, I was like, oh man, we need that. And his background is psychology
*  and conflict resolution, mostly at the global scale related to atrocities that countries are
*  trying to get over. And there's a science to how to hold a better conversation, either through
*  experience or whatever. No. If you hold a debate, I wouldn't want to be in a debate with Bjorn. We
*  could find lots of things we disagree on, but that takes it back to the win-lose model, right?
*  That's not how you make progress. And what I learned, absorbed from him, Peter Coleman,
*  because I was thinking we need room for agreement. I need to build a room for agreement. My blog
*  and at the Times and then the stuff I do now, it's like, how can we talk and come to agreement?
*  He says, no, no, you don't want agreement. You want cooperation. That allows you to hold on to
*  your beliefs. But we can disagree on all these things, but let's cooperate on that one thing.
*  And that's a really valuable distinction that's needed so much in this arena because,
*  as I said earlier, you can parse it right down to the whole menu of things Joe Manchin wanted,
*  transmission lines. Now we're going to have big fights over transmission lines. We've got billions
*  of dollars to spend expanding America's grid. And every community in America is going to say,
*  not here. So how do you foster a federal local dialogue that allows that to happen if you want
*  to have any hope of a better grid? So those insights come from behavioral sciences that I
*  think are completely undervalued in this area. Pielke loves to quote, I think it's Lippert.
*  Oh, Walter Lippman.
*  Lippman, yes. That democracy is not about everybody agreeing, but it's about different
*  people disagreeing but doing the same thing. Doing one thing together.
*  Yes. I mean, agreeing that we're going to do this thing. So you can disagree but still do a thing,
*  possibly for very different reasons. And that's fine.
*  There's an amazing video clip that shows this so powerfully. 2015 was the buildup to the Paris
*  talks that led to the Paris agreement. And a really talented journalist at CNN at the time,
*  John Sutter, who's from Oklahoma originally, he saw another Yale study that was a county by county
*  study of American attitudes on global warming, right down to the county level. And there's this
*  little glowing data point in Woodward County, Oklahoma. Woodward County, Oklahoma was ground
*  zero for climate skepticism, climate denial, whatever you want to call it. And he thought,
*  oh, I'm going to go there. And he went there just to meet people on the street, talk to them about
*  energy and weather. And he did these little interviews. And there's this one with this guy
*  who's like a middle-aged oil company employee, like an administrator, Thai kind of guy.
*  And he starts out the interview and the guy is saying, well, God controls the environment.
*  And if you're watching this, you're just going, okay, this is going to be interesting.
*  And the backstory, by the way, is the guy, he paid for the local playground to have dinosaurs
*  and people, like toy dinosaurs and people on the playground because he believes in creation,
*  6,000 year creation. So that's the guy, right? And then he gets to energy and the guy says,
*  the same guy who believes God controls the environment says, we have half of our roof
*  covered with solar panels and we want to get off the grid entirely. And when I show this to
*  audiences, I say, just pause and think about that for a second. If you went, why do you think that's
*  happening? And it's because he's independent. He wants to have his own source of power. He's
*  libertarian. He doesn't want the government telling him what to do. He would never vote for
*  Hillary, I guarantee you. This is 2015. But he wanted to get off the grid entirely to be his own,
*  to be himself. And so then I say, okay, so if you were going around the country with your climate
*  crisis placard and you go to Woodward County, do you think that would be a productive way
*  to go to that place and make your case? And the answer is pretty obvious. No. If you go in there
*  and you listen, like listening is such an important property that we all forget, including journalists,
*  you're much more apt to find a path to cooperation. You could talk to him about it. I guarantee if I
*  went there today, maybe I should go to talk about this new bill, $370 billion. How do we make that
*  work at the local level? How do we answer that guy at the energy department, Jigar Shah? So how do
*  we put this to work to get our buses off electricity, to get electrified or transition our street lamps
*  and stuff? You could have a good chat with him. If you go in there and say,
*  I'm here to debate you to death on global warming, forget about it.
*  LW. Actually, let me ask you a question, given your roots as a journalist.
*  So yeah, talking to a guy you disagree with, that's one thing. What about talking to people
*  that might be, society might consider bad, unethical, even evil. What's the role of a
*  journalist in that context? So climate change is a large number of people that believe one thing,
*  a large number of people that believe another thing. It turns out even with people that society
*  deems as evil, there's a large number of people that support them. What's your role as a journalist?
*  To talk to them.
*  JG. Well, I have talked to really bad people. When I wrote about the murder of Chico Mendes,
*  a Brazilian Amazon rainforest activist in 1989, I interviewed the killers. One was in jail,
*  several of them were just ranchers who, they had their point of view. They were there in the Amazon
*  rainforest to, the word in Brazil, in Portuguese is limpar, to clean the land. They're the
*  bandarantes, the pioneers of Brazil. They go into these frontiers and tame them like we had in our
*  West. And they would bring that up too. They would say to me, well, you did this. They didn't say you
*  murdered your Native Americans and stuff, but they could easily have said that too, and you deforested
*  all your landscapes. So who are you to come down here to? But if I didn't talk to them, that would
*  be not a way to do journalism.
*  But when you talked to them, did you empathize with them or did you push back? That's the ultimate
*  question. If you want to understand, if you talked to Hitler in 1941, do you empathize with him
*  or do you push back? Because most journalists would push because they're trying to signal to
*  fellow journalists and to people back home that this, me, the journalist is on the right side.
*  But if you actually want to understand the person, you should empathize. If you want to be the kind of
*  person that actually understands in the full arc of history, you need to empathize. I find that
*  journalists, a lot of times, perhaps they're protecting their job, their reputation, their
*  sanity, are not willing to empathize.
*  Yeah, well, I think this happened with Joe Manchin. I'm not doing any kind of equation here related
*  to Hitler and Joe Manchin. Or Trump. I mean, Trump. I interviewed the guy, Will Hepper, I mentioned,
*  who was a physicist at Princeton who thinks carbon dioxide is the greatest thing in the world and we
*  should have more of it in the atmosphere. I profoundly disagree on that point. But I interviewed
*  him for an hour and it was so interesting because he was trying to kind of rope-a-dope me into
*  making it about CO2 and climate because he's a super smart physicist. And I kind of said,
*  let's talk about some other things. And we started talking about education and science education. He
*  went on for like 20 minutes about the vital importance of better science education for
*  Americans. He drew on people he knew from Europe, Hungary. A bunch of Nobel Prize winners came from
*  some town in Hungary, at least a couple. And he said that he learned their teachers. At any
*  rate, he went into a long exposition on that. He then defended climate science. He said,
*  we need more climate science. He says, I love this stuff. I love the ocean buoys. There are now
*  thousands of them in the oceans charting clearer pictures of ocean circulation and satellites.
*  And he said something really important that many people discount, which is we need sustained
*  investment in monitoring this planet. We neglect our systems that just tell us what's happening in
*  the world. And that's happened over and over again. So if I had left it, if I had gone into
*  the terrain of the fight over CO2, some journalist friends might say, oh, that was good.
*  Mash up, you know, match up. But I found these really profound and important things that I
*  wanted the world to know about in the context of whether Trump was going to have him as a science
*  advisor. And so if I hadn't gone there, and a lot of people, if you look back, I got hammered
*  for doing that from even from friends. And then later, John Holdren, who had been Obama's science
*  advisor for eight years, he said, I would rather have Will Happer as Trump's science advisor than
*  no science advisor. In other words, there's a landscape of things that are important. He
*  recognized that Happer is really smart about defense and all kinds of things too. So it's like,
*  you do have to sort of screw up your, ideally screw up your courage, but then not necessarily
*  get into the, it's like with the guy in Oklahoma, you know, if you go in looking for the differences,
*  you'll find them, you can amplify them, you can leave with this paralyzed sense of
*  nothing having happened that was useful, or you can find these nuggets, or everyone is a human
*  being. I can't play the mind game of what I would have said, asked to Hitler, but-
*  I play that mind game all the time, but that's for another conversation.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That many in my family that have suffered under him. Nevertheless, he is a human being.
*  Yeah.
*  And I, you know, people sometimes caricature Hitler saying like that, that's when you mentioned
*  Hitler, the conversation develops, but I don't agree. I think sort of these extremes are useful
*  thought experiments to understand, because if you're not willing to take your ideals to that
*  extreme, then maybe your ideals need some rethinking from a journalistic perspective,
*  all that kind of stuff.
*  A number of years ago, my wife and I were with our veterinarian who was German born, Dr. Bach,
*  B-A-C-H. We were talking about the dog and stuff, and then we were talking about Trump, and
*  he just mentioned in passing, he said, my mother voted for Hitler.
*  Wow, that hit me like a brick.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it was so-
*  Yeah.
*  These, at the very least, understanding how pathways that lead to
*  people doing things like he did and ordered is essential, and the only way to understand that is
*  to dig in and ask questions and get uncomfortable. That still makes my hair
*  prickle when I think back to him saying, yeah, my mom voted for Hitler.
*  That somehow makes it super real. Like, oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, there's elections, there's real people living their lives.
*  Exactly. Struggling with a broken economy and all kinds of things.
*  Having your own little personal resentments and all that kind of stuff.
*  Let me ask you about presidents, American presidents.
*  Who had a positive or negative impact on climate change efforts in your view? Clinton, Bush,
*  Obama, Trump, Biden, or maybe you could say that they don't have much of an impact. So,
*  in public discourse, presidents have a kind of maybe disproportional,
*  like we imagine they have a huge amount of impact. How much impact do they actually have
*  on climate policy?
*  I don't know if you have comments on this.
*  Well, there is a background decarbonization rate that's happened for 150 years. We moved from wood
*  to charcoal to coal to oil and gas is cleaner, it's more hydrogen, less carbon. And recently,
*  I asked some really smart scientists who study these long trajectories of energy.
*  When you look at those curves, is there anything in that curve that says, oh, climate treaty, 1992?
*  Oh, Paris. And it's really hard. Or China, I mean, when China came in with this huge growth in
*  emissions, that created a bit of a recarbonization blip, but that was this huge growth in their
*  economy that pulled a bunch of people out of poverty. So, yeah, no, presidents don't really
*  change anything on time scales that we would measure, where you could parse it out. I think
*  that's not to say that Obama's and the current focus on the stimulus that's happening,
*  which includes a lot more money for research, et cetera, and innovation.
*  I do think that will be beneficial in a very, very long run. But I have to say,
*  when Obama stood up and took credit for reductions from moving from coal to gas
*  because of fracking, that was actually Cheney who set that in motion.
*  I was thinking, I would say Bush, not because I like him or anything, but he's the guy who
*  inadvertently started fracking. It goes further back than that. It was a federal investment in
*  fracking in the 60s and 70s. And then this one guy in Texas, right here in Texas, George Mitchell,
*  who cobbled together technology. And that led to this real dramatic change from gas to coal,
*  that mostly played out in the Obama years, but that really was stimulated by Cheney's early
*  energy task force in 2001 when they were getting in office. And also Bush did something interesting
*  in the whole wonky climate treaty process. It was under Bush that they started to focus on sectors.
*  Oh, and also on big emitters. This isn't about 200 countries. It's about basically eight or ten
*  countries. Let's get them into a room and let's have these little subrooms on electrification,
*  on mining, on whatever. And by parsing it out, and Obama picked up the same model. They had
*  different names for it because presidents always name something different than the last president.
*  One was the major economies forum and then it was the major emitters, something or other.
*  And that getting away from the treaty dots and dashes toward just sectoral,
*  big sectors that matter, gas, electrification, makes a difference. But again, you couldn't ever
*  measure it. It's always the lag time. And also I think one very under reported fact,
*  so the UNEP, the environment program, they come out with what they call a gap report every year
*  where they estimate how much is the world doing compared to what should it or has it promised to
*  do. Emissions gap. Yeah. And in 2019, so just before COVID hit, they actually did a survey
*  of the 2010s. So the last big report on how well are we doing? And their takeaway quote,
*  and I'm not going to get this right, but it's pretty much what they said was,
*  is if you take the world as if we hadn't cared about climate change since 2005,
*  we can't tell the difference between that world and the world that we're actually living in.
*  So despite the fact that we've had 10 years of immense focus on climate and everybody talks
*  about it and the Paris agreement, which is perhaps the biggest global sort of agreement
*  and what we're going to be doing, you can't actually tell. And that I think is incredibly
*  important because what it tells you is all that we're doing is not even on the margin,
*  it's sort of smaller than that. And I'm not sure what that is, but we're basically dealing in,
*  so for instance, the UK loves to point out that they have dramatically reduced their carbon
*  emissions and they have, they've really dramatically lowered their emissions,
*  but mostly because they've deindustrialized. They've basically said, look, we're just going
*  to be bankers for all of you guys and then everybody else is going to produce our stuff,
*  which of course is great for Britain. I don't know if it's great for Britain, but
*  we can't all do that. And so most of what we're trying to do right now is sort of this virtue
*  signaling. It makes us feel good. It's sort of, yeah, on the margin or in the very tiny margin.
*  But what we basically, and that was Andy, your point with China, the reason why we can't tell
*  the difference of course is because China basically became the workshop for everyone.
*  And so not only did they lift more than half a billion people out of poverty, sorry, half a
*  billion. Yes. Half a billion people out of poverty, but they also basically took over most production
*  in the world. And so of course, many rich countries could decarbonize or at least reduce
*  their carbon emissions and feel very virtuous about it, but fundamentally we haven't solved
*  how does the world do this. And that's why I think we're also left with this sense of not only
*  are we being told this is an unmitigated catastrophe and that's why this is the only
*  thing we should be focusing on, but also somehow, and we can all fix it. And I don't think we have
*  any sense of how hard this is actually going to be. And that's of course why I would go back and
*  say, look, the only way you're going to fix this is through innovation, because if you have something
*  that's cheaper than fossil fuels, you fixed it. If you have something that's harder and
*  costlier and more inconvenient, no, you're just not going to make it.
*  And getting more time by cutting vulnerability. The pockets of vulnerability on the planet
*  are huge and they're identifiable and you know what to do.
*  What are the biggest pockets of vulnerability? Infrastructure of cities?
*  No, it's where people are living and what their capacities are.
*  So moving people, how do you decrease the vulnerability in the world? What are the big-
*  Affordable housing. One reason so many people moved out of San Francisco and adjacent cities
*  into the countryside and then had their houses burned down is because they can't afford to live
*  in the city anymore. So affordable housing in cities can limit exposure to, in that case,
*  wildfire. Durban, South Africa, that terrible devastating flood they had this year, last year.
*  Who was washed away? Poor people who don't have any place to live. So they settle on in a flood
*  plain along a stream bed that's livable when it's not raining buckets. Those are vulnerabilities
*  that are there because of dislocation housing. Tacloban, this typhoon that hit the Philippines
*  terribly ahead of the Paris talks or was it the previous one?
*  No, it was in 2013, I believe.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thousands died. Most of the stories that were written were
*  framed around climate change because the pope made a deal about it. It was just before the
*  climate talks of that year. What happened, partially why there were so many losses was
*  Tacloban city had quadrupled in population in the last 30 years. Most of the people coming into the
*  city were poor, looking for work and settling in marginal places where a surge, storm surge,
*  killed them. So those are things we, whatever the we is in the different places, really can work on.
*  That gives more flex for sure and thinking about how this long trajectory that seems so
*  immovable and so hard, the decarbonization part, there's no excuse. I wrote a piece,
*  I guess a year ago. I said there's a vulnerability emergency hiding behind this climate emergency
*  label. That's really what needs work.
*  Also on the Tacloban, the hurricane that hit in 2013, there was almost a similar hurricane
*  in the early part of 1900s that hit pretty much the same strength and it eradicated half the city.
*  It killed half the city. What's happened since then is people just got much, much richer.
*  From early 1900 to 2013, we've just moved a lot of people out of poverty. Now it's a lot bigger.
*  Bangladesh. Bangladesh is even a bigger example of that. In the 1970s, they had horrible cyclones,
*  one of which was the Beatles, George Harrison's concert for Bangladesh. Great album that I still
*  have somewhere. Hundreds of thousands, he did a concert, a fundraising concert, the concert for
*  Bangladesh after this terrible cyclone tragedy hit Bangladesh. I think there were several hundred
*  thousand who were killed and a couple like that around that time. Bangladesh has been hit by
*  comparable storms recently and it's terrible. Every death is terrible, but it's like 123 deaths.
*  And it's not just because of wealth, it's because people know what to do. It's because there's
*  cell phones. It's because they have elevated platforms in many communities in the flood
*  plains there that you know to get to. So they went from hundreds of thousands of deaths
*  in a cyclone to 123. When we were working with Bangladesh, it's no longer the problem of people
*  dying, it's the fact that their cattle dies. So they want it cattle places where you could herd
*  this. This is their capital and it's not to make fun of it, but it's an amazing progress that you've
*  stopped worrying about your parents dying and you worry about your cows dying.
*  And when I was talking about social innovation, the other hour, there's a model emerging in
*  Bangladesh for farmers to move from raising chickens, poultry, to ducks. And it's working.
*  And ducks actually fetch a higher price at the market. And guess what? When you get flooded,
*  they survive. You can still have your income and your future.
*  Let me ask you to give advice. Put on your sage, wise hat and give advice to young people
*  that are looking into this world and see how they can do the most good. We talked about
*  what is the $1 that can do the most positive improvement to lead to $40, $45 and so on.
*  What advice would you give to young people in high school, in college, how to have a positive
*  impact on the world, how to have a career they can be proud of? Maybe ask Bjorn first and how
*  to have a life they can be proud of. So I think, and this really pretty well reflects the whole
*  conversation we've had, we've got to take the catastrophism out of the climate conversation.
*  And this really matters because a lot of kids literally think that the world is going to end
*  pretty soon. And that obviously makes any other kind of plan meaningless. So first of all, look,
*  you're not going to die. That poster that people, a lot of kids have, you're going to die from old
*  age, but I'm going to die from climate. No, you're not. You're going to die from old age and you're
*  going to die much older, very likely. So the reality is the world has improved dramatically
*  and it's very likely to improve even more. So the baseline is good. This is just the facts.
*  Then there's still lots and lots of problems. And what you should do as a young person is stop being
*  paralyzed by fear and then realize what you can do is basically help humanity become even smarter.
*  There's a lot of different places you can do. I mean, the obvious thing when you're talking about
*  climate is what if you could become the guy that develops fourth generation nuclear? It's very
*  likely something that neither of us know anything about right now, but develop the energy source
*  that will basically power the rest of humanity. How cool would that be? That's one of the many
*  things you could do. But again, also remember there are lots and lots of other things that need
*  solutions. So what about you become the girl that makes the social innovation in Tanzania or in
*  Kenya? Or what about if you become the person who finds a way that is a much cheaper, more effective
*  way to tackle tuberculosis? Right now, it needs four to six months of medication. One of the big
*  problems is once you pop the pills and you're fresh, it's really hard to get people to do it
*  for the other five and a half months. And you need that, otherwise you actually have a big risk of
*  getting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, which is a real scourge on the earth. So what if you
*  develop that? So the truth is not only can your life be much better when you sort of ditch that
*  doomarism, but it also becomes much more possible for you to be a positive part of making sure that
*  you do that progress. Why has the world improved so much? Because our parents and great grandparents,
*  they made all this work. This was all their innovations and a lot of hard work. And I'm
*  incredibly grateful that they've done it. But now it's kind of time to pay back. So you got to do
*  this for our grandkids. You got to make those innovations, make those policy opportunities.
*  They'll make the world an even better place.
*  Totally. And to me, there's never been a better time to be effective as a young person because
*  the internet connectedness. You can brainstorm with someone in another country just as easily
*  as you can brainstorm with someone down the block when we were kids. As I said earlier with my
*  pen pal, with letters taking weeks to come. And so the key properties, ideally, that young people
*  would do well to cultivate are, well, certainly adaptability because change is changing.
*  Not just, you know, the rate of change is changing. These layers of change are all piling
*  up on each other. Having an ability to understand the information environment
*  is a fundamental need now that wasn't a need when we were growing up.
*  We read a few newspapers. My dad would turn on the nightly news and Walter Cronkite would say,
*  that's the way it is. And he said, that's the way it is. And that's not the way the media
*  environment is now. So courses in media literacy should be kind of fundamental parts of curricula
*  from kindergarten on, or parents can do the same thing. There's a woman at URI, University of
*  Rhode Island, Renee Hobbs, who teaches a course in propaganda literacy. And she said, you know,
*  the history of the word is not bad. Propaganda could be good. It's pro. It's for the church.
*  She did a wonderful chat with me. She laid this out. But understanding when it is propaganda,
*  like the tobacco, you know, there is hopefully a difference between that and that, right? Cigarette
*  ads and journalistically acquired information. So a key to everything Bjorn was talking about too,
*  is just understanding how to not be sucked into this information environment and spit out as a
*  paralyzed, doomist entity. Because once you have the ability to step back, then you can use Twitter
*  or whatever you're on to find people who might have a skill set you don't have that is something
*  you need to do to incorporate, to harness, to do the thing you want to do in the world.
*  Finding your way to make the world better. And it can have nothing to do with climate.
*  But if it makes a few more people's lives better, then overall you're leading toward better capacity
*  for all this stuff. So that and then the climate problem, the prismatic giant nature of it,
*  it is what makes it so daunting, but it's also what gives everybody an opportunity.
*  Like there's something for artists, scientists, poets, everybody needs to get into the game.
*  I just spent some time with Kim Stanley Robinson, who wrote that book Ministry of the Future,
*  which is this sprawling novel about a worst case outcome where everyone in India is dying.
*  And so fiction can help experiment, different kinds of fiction, different kinds of arts can
*  help us sort of experiment with what the future might look like in different ways and just get
*  started. And the other thing, unfortunately, that's needed, I think I first said this in 2008,
*  when someone asked me something about climate, I said, weirdly, you have to sort of have a sense
*  of urgency, but a sense of patience at the same time. Just roll those words around in your mind,
*  what does that mean, urgent and patient? How could that possibly be? But actually,
*  it really is the reality. There is an urgency with this building gas that's cumulative,
*  that doesn't go away like smoke when it rains. And every year that happens, it's adding to risk.
*  And you can kind of wake up completely freaked out urgent, but when you realize energy transitions
*  take time, then you have to sort of find patience or whatever your word is for that.
*  Yeah, I think you have to oscillate back and forth throughout the day, having a sense of urgency when
*  you're trying to actually be productive and have patience, so you can have a calm head about you
*  in terms of putting everything into perspective. And like you said, with information,
*  that is interesting, especially in the scientific community. I think you've spoken about this before,
*  that there is some responsibility or at least an opportunity for scientists to not just do science,
*  but to understand the dynamics of the different mediums in which information is exchanged. So it
*  could be Twitter for a few years, then it could be TikTok, then it could be... I'm a huge believer
*  in the power of YouTube over the next several years, perhaps decades. I mean, it's a very
*  interesting medium for education and communication and for debate, and that's grassroots, that's from
*  like the bottom up, that every scientist is able to communicate their work. And I personally believe
*  I have the responsibility to communicate their work. If anything, the internet made me realize
*  that science is not just about doing the science, it's about communicating it.
*  Like this is not some kind of virtue signaling on my part. No, no, no. No, like I feel like
*  if the tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it, it really didn't fall.
*  Like that's not... There should be a culture of... At MIT, there's a place called the media lab.
*  Yes, sir. Where they really emphasize, like you always be able to demo something, to show off
*  your work. They really emphasize showing off their work. And I think that was in some part criticized
*  in the big MIT culture that that's like focusing too much on the PR versus doing the science.
*  But I really disagree with that. Of course, there's a balance to strike. You don't want to be all
*  smoke and mirrors, but there really is a lot of value to communication and not just some broad...
*  You almost don't want to teach a course on communication because by the time you teach
*  the course, it's already too late. It's always being on top of what is the language, what is
*  the culture and the etiquette, what is the technology of communication that is effective.
*  I actually had a big conversation about that in my university because I think,
*  and this is perhaps especially true for social sciences, but I think it's probably true for
*  everyone. Just simply communicating what it is that you've done in research makes it possible
*  for you to get an outsider's perspective and see, did I just go into an incredibly deep hole that
*  just three other people really care about in the world? Or is this actually something that
*  matters to the world? And being able to explain what it is that you've done to everyone else
*  my sort of sense is, if you can't say it in a couple of minutes, it's probably, it's not
*  necessarily true, but it's probably because it wasn't all that important.
*  There was a hashtag generated maybe seven years ago by a Caltech PhD candidate woman,
*  and it was fantastic. The hashtag was, I am a scientist because, and she posted it with a
*  picture of herself with her answer. And that, when I talked to scientists or basically anybody about
*  communicating, I said, don't start with, I am a phytologist and I use a spectrophotometer to do X.
*  Start with, I'm a scientist because the world is endlessly interesting and I just found these
*  salamanders, which are going to vanish if we don't stop this fungus from coming to the United States.
*  Utterly interesting. And then you're, then you've got people hooked, but it's the motivation part,
*  because everyone grew up as a kid and a kid is basically like a scientist. Wow, what the hell is
*  this? How does this work? So you can connect with people that way. But this other issue you broached
*  is really important. And what I love about MIT particularly, I spent a lot of time there over
*  the decades, not just talking to the hurricane guy, Amy Smith, who's the development lab in the
*  basement there somewhere. Most of MIT looks like it's the basement, but yeah, it's part of the charm.
*  But it's the usability function is part of a lot of that goes on there. It's engineering and science.
*  And it reminds me of 1997, these two very different scientists, Dan Kamen at Berkeley and
*  Michael Dove at Yale wrote a manifesto. It was the virtues of mundane science. That's what they
*  called it. It was a prod to the scientific community to actually, it's about useful utility
*  because the whole arena is set up to advance your career through
*  revealing new knowledge that will get you tenure someday. And actually doing useful
*  science is disincentivized, having a conversation, especially if it involves more than one discipline.
*  Because as a young scientist, there were some postdocs at Columbia who wrote this other
*  manifesto paper saying, here are the things universities need to do to foster the collaborative
*  capacity we need to have sustainable development. And it was like four or five things that
*  universities don't do. Give you time to become fluent and for a physicist to talk to an
*  anthropologist and understand how anthropology works with sociology takes time. And then building
*  a relationship with a community that has a problem that you want to fix takes time.
*  And so you do these quick turnaround papers that get you toward your little micro career goal,
*  but they're not actually getting you what you want in the world. Those are really hard problems going
*  forward. But starting with that idea of usability, what can I do with my skill sets? A lot of great
*  physicists I know are dug in on string theory and stuff. And someone has to dig in on that too,
*  but I'd like to have them pull a little bit of their brain power away to think about some of the
*  practical things beyond things about too.
*  The two of you have been thinking about some of the biggest questions, which is life here on Earth,
*  the history of life here, the future of life here on Earth, of Earth itself, and how to
*  allocate our resources to alleviate suffering in the world. So let me ask the big question.
*  What do you think is the why of it all? What's the meaning of it? What's the meaning of our life
*  here on Earth? You waited till the last moment to ask us that question.
*  Yeah, in case I can trick you into finding an answer.
*  Well, so I mean, again, I'm just going to take a stab in this because I think in some ways,
*  it's the same thing that you were talking about before. It's not about getting everybody in the
*  same track and all agree on something, but it's about getting a lot of people with very different
*  goals and targets and ways of thinking about the world to go in the same direction. So for me,
*  the goal of life, certainly my goal, but I think for most people, is to make the world a better
*  place. It sounds incredibly pedestrian because it's become so overused, but that really and
*  literally is the point. Your point of your life is to, when one of your friends is sad,
*  to make sure that they sort of get out of that and find out why they're sad and maybe move them a
*  little bit in the right direction and all the things that we've talked about, stop people from
*  dying from tuberculosis and live longer lives and fix climate change, but fix it in such a way,
*  that we actually use resources smartest because there are lots of problems. So let's make sure
*  we deal with them adequately. This is very unsexy in some sense, but I think it's also very basic
*  and really what matters. Well, biologically, evolution has demanded that life is about
*  finding sources of energy and perpetuating yourself. So that's the baseline.
*  AC And that's led us into a bit of a bollocks because we have this easy energy that's come
*  from the ground so far, but our brilliance has given this larger awareness of everything about
*  the planet is transitory. And so how do you work with that productively is really an important
*  question. I could just sort of try to be as rich as possible and use as much energy as possible
*  and have other people. I mean, Alex Epstein, I think again, this is one of the constraints
*  and my support for what he says is he's just talking about growth and progress in that sense,
*  but there are consequences and there are long-term trajectories here that have to be taken into
*  account too. So what do you wake up to do? To me, it's finding your part of this. And as Bjorn said,
*  finding a way to pursue and expand betterment. When I taught, I was at Pace University for six
*  years and one of the courses I launched there was called Blogging a Better Planet. And it was for
*  grad students mostly in communication. It wasn't an environment, it wasn't like better planet,
*  save the climate. But my task for the students was to blog about something they're passionate
*  about, first of all, because you can't do this just like you can't do your conversations if you
*  don't wake up in the morning wanting to do what you're doing. You're doing this. I used to call
*  myself a selfish blogger because I was learning every day. I still am. I love this. My wife laughs,
*  she thinks I work too much, but I'm always asking those questions like, sustain what?
*  So my charge to the students was harness a passion, build a blog either alone or with others
*  that notches the world a little bit towards some better outcome. And so there was a musician who
*  did a thing on musicians who use their art for their work for making the world better.
*  Some of it was like music therapy, bands contributing money, whatever. Another one did
*  her blog was on comfort food all around the world. And I thought it was my favorite. It was a video
*  I think it should be viral actually. It was like looking at the world, every different cultures.
*  She was in Queens. So every culture, every cuisine is there in Queens, 200 countries.
*  But she would go and talk to people's moms and have them cook the food of that country that's
*  their comfort food. I mean, I just love this because we all need to eat and you're getting
*  this expanded sense of what comfort is by thinking about what other cultures choose. And that felt
*  like a great course because it was not directive. It was just, it gave them this potential to go
*  forward. I'd love to think they've all gone on to become superstar, whatever is, I don't know.
*  That's the giving. That's the letting go part. Even if one did something special,
*  then that makes me feel job done. And after I'd been writing about climate for 30 years, 2016ish,
*  I did a lot of writing about what did I learn, unlearn and stuff. And I had had a stroke in 2011,
*  which was interesting. It was the first time I really thought about my brain.
*  You don't think about your brain on a day to day basis, but this is my brain telling me,
*  ding, ding, ding, ding, some weird shit's happening. And when I was thinking about
*  climate or confronting climate change, it felt like some of the things I learned about my own
*  existence, I'm going to die, but you don't really absorb that.
*  So is that the first time you kind of faced your mortality?
*  Yeah, this is really the shit, or at least deep disability, if not death. And that ability is
*  transitory. And I thought about the climate problem. We're not going to solve the global
*  warming problem, at least not in our lifetimes. But you work on making those trajectories
*  sustainable, the end of life particularly. You work on making sure other people don't get strokes,
*  if they can avoid it. In my case, I wrote about it. I was blogging about my stroke while I was
*  having it. I was tweeting about it. There's a funny tweet that's kind of mistyped because
*  Co-Piki?
*  Yeah, right. So that's like share your knowledge, share your learning. And everyone can do this now,
*  on whatever platform. And then there's also this like giving up part, but not in a depressing,
*  well, maybe you can call it depressing. I started to zoom in years ago on the idea of the
*  serenity prayer, the sobriety thing. It's like, know what you can change, know what you can't.
*  Grant me the serenity to accept the things that cannot change, the courage to change the things
*  that can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
*  Yeah. See, those three properties are really important right now. Some aspects of this,
*  we know absolutely what we can work on, cutting vulnerability, energy transitions take time.
*  Science can help us discriminate the difference. And that's an iterative changing landscape
*  going forward. But at the same time, science, like I personally on climate modeling or
*  narrowing how hot it's going to get, or more clarity on when an ice sheet is going to collapse.
*  I think those are what I call known unknowables. So being able to, I've seen enough evidence
*  that those are deeply complex problems that we're not going to get there quickly.
*  So then that gives you a landscape to act on. And that, whether you bring God into the mix
*  is irrelevant. It's really know what you can change, know what you can't, and know what
*  that gives you the quality to work on them. And serenity is comfort with that this is
*  transitory, that the human journey, like anyone's individual journey, will have some end. That
*  doesn't mean it has to be near. This Anthropocene that I've been writing about for decades can
*  still be a good Anthropocene, or at least a less bad one in terms of how we get through it.
*  And you're also a musician. So in context, one of my favorite songs of yours, an album,
*  A Very Fine Line. I should mention that with the stroke coming close to death,
*  the lyrics here are quite brilliant, I have to say. Oh, yeah. It's a very fine line between
*  winning and losing. A very fine line between living and dying. A very fine line. By the way,
*  people should listen to this. I can't play this because YouTube will give me trouble.
*  A very fine line between loving and leaving. Most of your life you spend walking a very fine line,
*  and the rest of the lyrics are just quite brilliant. It is a fine line.
*  I'm glad you walked it with me today, gentlemen. You're brilliant, kind, beautiful human beings.
*  Thank you so much for having this quote unquote debate that was much more about just exploring
*  ideas together. Bjorn, thank you so much. And Andy, thank you so much for talking today.
*  These kinds of extended conversations, the more of it, the better. And finding ways to
*  spread that capacity just to get people out of this win-lose thing is really important.
*  So thanks for what you're doing. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bjorn
*  Lomborg and Andrew Refkin. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the
*  description. And now let me leave you with some words from Henry David Thoreau. Heaven is under
*  our feet, as well as over our heads. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
