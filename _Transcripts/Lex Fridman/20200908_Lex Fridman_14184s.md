# David Fravor: UFOs, Aliens, Fighter Jets, and Aerospace Engineering | Lex Fridman Podcast #122
**Lex Fridman:** [September 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB8zcAttP1E)
*  The following is a conversation with Commander David Fravor, who was a Navy pilot for 18 years
*  and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as the Black Aces, a squadron of 12
*  airplanes consisting of several hundred people. He's also famously one of the people who with his
*  own eyes saw and chased a UFO, an identified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the Tic-Tac
*  and the incident more formally referred to as the USS Nimitz UFO incident. His story,
*  corroborated by several other pilots, from my perspective as a curious scientist and an open
*  minded human being, is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at least that I'm aware of.
*  He's a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to. I put out a call for questions on
*  Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many of the questions that people posted as I
*  could. Overall, I really enjoyed this conversation and I'm sure if the world wants us to and if
*  there's more questions to be had, we'll talk on this podcast again. Quick summary of the sponsors,

*  UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena, and aliens in general is foreign to me because of the high
*  ratio of outlandish conspiracy theorists to actual hard evidence. I'm a scientist first and foremost,
*  but an open minded one, often looking and thinking outside the box. I'm often disheartened by the
*  close mindedness of the scientific community and in equal part, I'm disheartened by the lack of
*  rigor and basic scientific inquiry and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists. I believe
*  there's a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds should walk. I think
*  we humans know very little about our world, what's up there among the stars and the nature of reality
*  and the nature of our very own minds. The path to understanding can only be walked humbly.
*  The very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a piece of technology,
*  whether human made or alien made, that moved in the way it did should be inspiring to every
*  scientist and engineer on this earth. There may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered
*  that once understood and mastered will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings.
*  Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think,
*  if we open our eyes and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles and remove the
*  constraints and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and assumptions of
*  prior generations. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review the Five Stars on

*  Now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting. I fast often. Sometimes intermittent
*  fasting of 16 hours and then an 8 hour eating period of 2 meals. Sometimes 24 hours. That's
*  one dinner to the next. I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I
*  look up to have done. People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and
*  different health benefits, it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life. Not eating
*  somehow is a reminder that we're immortal, that every day is precious. I certainly experienced
*  this with the 24 hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the 48, 72 and even week long fast.

*  Desert Islands. Whatever you think of it, I love the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks and the idea
*  of spending time on an island alone with potentially no hope. The natural question is,
*  if I could, what would I bring to this island? The answer is complicated, but let me pick one
*  thing, the first thing that popped into my crazy mind, which is the Introduction to Algorithms book,
*  also called CLRS for the first letters of the last name of its four authors. I find algorithms
*  beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world and side computers when the real world outside
*  is an impossible chaotic mess. I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months,
*  far away from human civilization. Anyway, check out BetterHelp at BetterHelp.com slash Lex to get a

*  You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapon School.
*  Yeah, I am.
*  Better known as Top Gun. Let me ask the most ridiculous question. How realistic is the movie
*  Top Gun? So it's funny, we used to joke and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor
*  said this. There's two things in the original Top Gun that are true,
*  that are very realistic. One, there is a place called Top Gun. And number two is they do fly
*  airplanes there. Other than that, I went through in 97, Class 497. There's actually a log of every
*  single person that's went through, kind of like seal training. There's a list. So people, because
*  there's a lot of posers out there, oh, it was a Navy seal. No, you weren't. Well, I went to Top Gun.
*  You can actually go to Top Gun. And matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch, the real patch,
*  you have to have gone there. So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real.
*  The real ones are controlled. The people that make them honor that. And when you go in, they look up
*  your name. If you want to get one, they look up your name. You just tell them, they go, okay,
*  here, and they'll sell them to you. If you are not on the list, you ain't get no patch. Because it is.
*  It's a pretty big deal to go through. But for me, probably one of the best experiences of flying,
*  because everyone there is extremely competent. It's very, very challenging.
*  But it's what we all signed up to do. So it's just the entire group that is when you want to be that
*  level where you go, everyone really cares, and everyone really wants to be good.
*  Is it competitive? Like in the movie?
*  No, when you go through, if anything, it's more of the students, and then there's the instructor
*  side. And the instructor sides are really, they're guys that you know. They just chose to stay up in
*  Fallon. And it's extremely difficult job because they have a very small tolerance for not being
*  good. So they're briefs, the guys, when they give a lecture. So let's just say there's a fighter
*  employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones. It takes about two days to give the fighter
*  employment lecture. The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, they call them murder boards
*  where he's scrutinized by his peers and he practices. By the time they actually stand in front of a class,
*  they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized, and they don't even turn around. They
*  just click and they know them in order. And they repeat the same thing over. And it's standardized.
*  So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the school. And there's a reason
*  for that because what they're doing is they're training. So when you come out of Top Gun, you're
*  called a Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics instructor. So you're SFTI. When you come out
*  of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapon schools on the East or West Coast and train
*  the fleet squadrons. And then you visit the squadrons and train and do upgrade rides and all that.
*  So there's a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the course.
*  It is literally one of the best things. And it's not a rank-based thing because think Navy.
*  You can come in as an 04 Lieutenant Commander. The lieutenants, the hierarchy, well, it used to be,
*  I don't know how it is exactly today, but I imagine it's the same. The hierarchy is actually
*  based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank. So when the tactical decisions are made,
*  which are based on fact and trying things out in the Fallon ranges, they set the top X number of
*  folks that have been there seniority-wise, and I mean time-wise, are the ones that actually make
*  the decision. And when the door, you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out
*  from the staff, they all speak the same language. And it has to be that way, which is why the school
*  has been so effective since it was founded. So it's just an incredible group of individuals.
*  So there's a bar of excellence that the instructors demand?
*  Oh, very much so. And they're held to it. So it's not a, hey, I'm now an instructor, so I can do
*  what I want. There is a standard, and they have to live up to that standard. They have to, and I mean
*  every moment of every day. So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon and they come down and do
*  their called site visits where they come down and they'll come to Lamour, California, which is
*  where the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy, and they go around and start flying sorties
*  with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on some of that knowledge, that same high level of standard.
*  They can't just drop your guard because you wear the top gun patch, and people know that. And they
*  wear light blue shirts, so it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there. And then
*  everyone else who's been through the school, including them, have the patch on their sleeve.
*  So there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there.
*  So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years. Yes. Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?
*  Yeah. So, you know, first I was enlisted, I was a Marine. And then the Marines actually sent me,
*  recommended me to go to the Naval Academy. So it's always better to be lucky than good. But I got to
*  go to the Naval Academy, and I finished. And I've had that dream to fly. So when I got selected...
*  They've always dreamed of flying.
*  Yeah. Since 1969, when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. At that point, I asked my mom,
*  I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five. And I said,
*  so cool, mom. And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots. And then at that point,
*  it was like, I'm going to be a pilot. And if you knew me growing up, because I was a little bit of
*  a delinquent, people are just like, yeah, right. I used to joke, I'm going to fly jets, I'm going
*  to drop bombs. And if people that knew me as a kid, they'd be like, yeah, and they'd be like,
*  not a chance. And then when I did, I actually had a, it's a funny story. And I'll get to it.
*  And I'll finish my career. But I was at my cousin's wedding. And we all grew up in the same neighborhood.
*  We kind of, they had Italian side of the family. That's how we grew up. So it was my house right
*  down the street was my cousin Chad. And right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts
*  and uncles and stuff. The guy two doors down from my house, a paperboy in the neighborhood,
*  so they all knew me. And I went to my cousin's wedding and he and Mr. Race looks at me and he
*  says, David Fravor. I go, Mr. Race, how you doing? He goes, you fly jets, top gun and all that. I go,
*  yes, sir. He goes, I figured you'd be in jail by now. It was kind of a, to me, it was a little bit
*  of a badge of honor going on. And I kind of overcame that, but, uh,
*  what do you attribute that to? So you, I've heard you before and just now say that, uh, it's better
*  to be, it's better to be lucky than good. And you, you talk modestly about, uh, about just being
*  lucky. But if you were to describe your trajectory, maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively,
*  uh, how'd you pull it off to be like, to be truly a special person?
*  The easiest way is one, never, never take no. Don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it or
*  those. I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside, you know? And if I really believe if
*  you want something and you want to do something, then you, you can achieve it. Not in all cases,
*  like if I loved basketball and I really wanted to be in the NBA, there's a realism that says
*  I'm five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap, but I'm really not that good at
*  basketball. It's probably not ever going to happen no matter how hard I try and practice.
*  It's just the way it is. Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast, you know, I'm not that big.
*  It's just physically I'm incapable of doing that. Um, but there's things that don't really tie to,
*  a true physical ability as far as size and strength, but it's, it's mental.
*  And I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart to be a fighter pilot. Matter of fact,
*  you don't, it really comes down to the ability to think very quickly. 80% solution is typically
*  good enough because if you overthink it, you're, you're behind. And then in an air to air fight,
*  that's what happens. People try and overthink it. And before you know it, because it's happening so
*  fast, you don't have, you can't get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places,
*  80% solution is good enough. It builds up a really strong gut for the 80% solution.
*  Just, yeah, I'm a big believer in the 80% solution. I love that. If you get 80% you can go
*  and then you can always adjust, which is exactly what, like if you're fighting in BFM,
*  the 80% solution is it's like a chess game, but it's a really, really fast chess game where you go,
*  I'm doing this. And then I know that if I do a maneuver, if he's going to counter it correctly,
*  he should do A. If he doesn't do A, he does some degree less, like B, C, D. And then I know how
*  bad his, his error is. And then I capitalize. So my, I don't have to be perfect. You know,
*  I don't have to go, I need to go to 47 degrees, nose high. If I just kind of get above 40,
*  then I'm good and I can watch how it reacts. And then I can adjust for that. And you,
*  and you continually work that problem and you chip away. Because if you start neutral,
*  you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage till eventually,
*  you know, and if you're really fighting, you know, just guns only rear quarter, where you got to get
*  behind the guy kind of world war two dogfighting type stuff, then it's, it's literally, it's a,
*  it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at, you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends.
*  So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the dream
*  and didn't take no for an answer.
*  Well, you know, you know, part of it is family, you know, uh, my dad was, uh, I used to call him a
*  fire ready aim guy, you know, he'd smack me and then asked me what I did wrong. Um, back then,
*  you know, I, I joke and people look, cause you know, at times it was kind of tough, you know,
*  cause he can be pretty demanding, but on the other side, you know, I probably needed to be
*  reined in a little bit at times. Uh, but then everyone else in my family, you know,
*  my mom was really awesome when I was a kid. Uh, my, uh, my grandfather, who is a big,
*  big part of it, my mom's dad, uh, who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we'll
*  talk about, uh, about him, but, uh, huge, huge influence, very, very positive.
*  And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught me.
*  Um, and, uh, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went to
*  and it was, uh, it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people were out. He was
*  a beer delivery guy, dead serious. And you go, someone asked who died, the Pope. Um, uh, so,
*  so a lot of people loved them. So back to, back to my career question, cause I'm getting down
*  at rabbit hole. Uh, no, I, when I was at the, I was going to, I was going to stay in the Marines.
*  I really wanted to go, man, I love the core. I think it's, uh, of all services, it's that one,
*  everything is in a ball and they're very, very professional. And it was a great,
*  great organization to join. Uh, but I went out to the Nimitz on my, uh, freshman cruise.
*  After your freshman year at the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you, you're an enlisted
*  person. You get to experience that half when I already was enlisted. So it was fine with me.
*  Because it comes up a lot. You might saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is.
*  Yeah. So Nimitz is, uh, an aircraft carrier. So it's, uh, four and a half acres of sovereign
*  U S territory. It floats around the U S oceans. So it's a giant thing. Does it have weapons on it?
*  Uh, the air wing is really the weapons. It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part,
*  it's a giant moving airport is what it is. So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take
*  off. Um, and I'm like, Ooh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was a VF 41
*  and F 14 squadron, VF 84, uh, an F 14 squadron, and then a couple of a six squadrons. And we
*  actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some of the a six pilots and BNs. So it was
*  really a neat experience. And I said, I want to do that. And the way to do it was to not to, to go
*  in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them
*  are land-based, you know, to support the Marines. Cause there are that, that unit, that whole unit,
*  you know, the Marine Corps is that one service has it all. And, uh, so when I graduated and I got to,
*  you know, I worked hard through primary and that's where, you know, I knew Missy,
*  we were in, it actually went through together, Missy Cummings. Uh, we went through primary
*  together and then, uh, I went to Kingsville. We all selected the same time. I went to Kingsville.
*  There was another guy, Scott Wiedemeyer, uh, the three of us. So I went to Kingsville,
*  Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian. So the three of us that we had all went through,
*  we selected out of primary together. We all ended up going jets. And that's, that's how,
*  besides from school, I knew her at school too. The long story, I got done, uh, got winged. It
*  took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got my wings.
*  And, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s on the West coast, which is a side-by-side
*  bomber. So it's a pilot on the left seat and the bombardier navigators on the right seat. It was
*  built in the sixties. It is all weather, uh, and it flies low at night and it's got a terrain
*  mapping radar. How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for,
*  for the public? Yeah, that's fine. How many fighter jets are side-by-side like that?
*  That was, uh, in the Navy, that was the only one. Uh, the air force, the F-111 was a side-by-side,
*  but the Navy, it was the A6. And then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of that. And now that
*  those are all gone. The EA6B is just one way a few years ago. And now the, uh, E18G Growler,
*  um, is the replacement for the EA6B. There was never a replacement for the A6, uh, that I flew.
*  It really became the F-18, which, uh, the A6 could go quite a bit further distance-wise by fuel,
*  uh, than the Hornet and, uh, the Hornet is the F-18. Is there usually two people in the plane,
*  but they're usually like in front and behind? In a, the modern two-seaters, yes. Uh, but
*  most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single-seat. Single-seat is just one person.
*  One person. With the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the
*  exception of the F-15E Strike Eagle and the F-18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two-seater,
*  and the G is also a two-seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by, say, full-up fighter-bomber.
*  So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18-year career is, was it two-seater?
*  That was about half and half. So I started off in A6, was a two-seater. Then I went to single-seat
*  F-18s, and I flew those, uh, all the way up until 2000 and, let me think, 2001, to the end of 2001.
*  And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets, and I've flown both of those,
*  the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two-seat. They,
*  they were F Squadron. So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41.
*  I love the, the name, the Black Aces. What, uh, is there some parts of that
*  journey that are amazing, parts of it that are tough that kind of stand out?
*  To me, it was, one, it was a huge honor, uh, and I got to serve with, uh, you know,
*  I got pulled up because the, the guy, the, the people that are EXOs, because we fleet up,
*  you go from the number two guy to the number one guy. So the EXO becomes the CO, so the executive
*  officer becomes the commanding officer. So I had worked with, uh, now soon-to-be Vice Admiral
*  Weitzel, uh, was the, he was Commander Weitzel at the time, was the EXO, and he really wanted,
*  because he knew there was a little bit of a, a problem when the Super Hornets came into Lamor.
*  Lamor had been a single-seat, uh, fighter community, uh, since the, forever. And now all
*  of a sudden you've got the F-18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators in the back
*  that are not pilots, they're weapon systems operators, and there's a difference.
*  And Kenny is a weapon systems operator. And, uh, Kenny knew because of my A6 background that
*  I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat, because when you fly two seat,
*  there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take the advantage of the weapon
*  systems operator. And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment, because it really,
*  there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single-seat has and the autonomy that
*  comes for the ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies.
*  But it does, it does equal more than one. And I would say that one plus one with two people is
*  a minimum of 1.5, because you've got an extra head, you've got extra eyes, you've got someone
*  that can monitor systems, the airplanes can do two things at once. I mean, there's an incredible
*  amount of capability that we add when we do that. Can we just pause on that? Just for me,
*  from like a human factors perspective and also an AI perspective, what's, how difficult, uh, so
*  there's like, when there's two people, there's also a third person that's the AI part, the
*  some level of automation, like autopilot, maybe even that's correct. Maybe you can kind of
*  talk about the psychology of like, you said making decisions really quick, 80%. How do you deal with
*  another brain working with you? And then also the automation, is there an interesting interplay that
*  you get to learn? And also as that changed throughout your career, I imagine it got,
*  it gotten better in terms of the automation or perhaps not. Well, I can tell you so that
*  there's a bunch of questions. No, this is, this is good. This is good. And this is, I'm enjoying
*  this because now we actually get to talk about something other than a tic tac. So, um, so let's
*  start with the A6. The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties.
*  All right. And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between
*  the pilot and the bombardier navigator. So we would fly low at night in the mountains. So I was
*  stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington. So you've got the cascades and incredible amount
*  of time. And we would get in the simulators because unlike, normally people think terrain
*  following and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can
*  see and it'll fly. It basically flies a straight line. So it goes up and over mountains and back
*  down and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual. So you do this low level routes
*  where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains at night. You're going to be at, you know,
*  500 to a thousand feet above the ground ripping through like fog layers. Cause you don't need to
*  see outside. You're, you're literally flying a little TV screen and radar. What are you looking
*  at most of the time? So you just as a screen, it's this really primitive. If you look at it now,
*  what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun. So is it similar to like the
*  flare stuff? Is that, is no, this thing is totally radar based. Now the airplane had a flare balls,
*  target recognition and multi-sensor was called a tram. So you're looking at like basically like
*  dots of hard objects. No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar
*  and he was getting raw feed off of a pulse radar in front. Okay. So it's just basically mapping the
*  mountain. So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is
*  going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return. And then the backside, it's just
*  going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side. So the bomb of your navigators
*  would do that and we, they would have charts and they could shade their charts knowing that,
*  Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in this valley. We can sneak up this valley
*  and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what the airplane would do. And it's,
*  and sorry to interrupt. I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions. I apologize, but the pilot,
*  can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the bomb, the bombardier?
*  So you're, you're actually just control. I'm flying the jet. I have the throttles, the stick,
*  and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe
*  four inches, five inches high. It looks like it's literally a CRT. That's how old it is,
*  a CRT screen. And what it would do at the radar would do is the, the, the bombardier navigator
*  is looking at his radar. He's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the airplane.
*  So he has the range really scoped down because the radar can see a lot further. He's looking at
*  about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode, where we're dodging mountains and stuff.
*  What the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them. So the very
*  far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing.
*  It'll be like between like a half a mile and here a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile. The
*  next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles. And then it just keeps going out like that.
*  So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the
*  distance at 15 miles and we were just driving right at it. So when we get to the point where
*  it hits 12 and a half miles, where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range
*  bin for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain. And then as I got
*  closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it. And I could see that that bump was moving
*  towards me. And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go
*  over to the right hand side and I could do that. But it wasn't like a video game. It's literally
*  like, if you think of the original Atari's. Yeah. But you build up, I imagine that you start to get
*  a really deep sense of like the actual three, three D environment based on that little Atari's.
*  It's you're exactly right. And you have to, you have to train. So there's been studies.
*  A matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me, but it's true.
*  There were studies done watching ASICs crews in our simulators. We call it the WIST,
*  the Weapon Systems Trainer. And it was not even a motion. It just kind of sat there and you just,
*  you could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system.
*  But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator who,
*  I'll name him, his name's Chris Sato. He works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad.
*  I think computer engineering, he's scary smart. So Chris could really work. A matter of fact,
*  all the guys that flew us, so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP.
*  We did our first night traps together. The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that
*  you just, you're never going to forget. But Chris and I, when we started flying together,
*  and we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron, we'd spent a lot of time training.
*  And Chris was amazing at how he could work the system, one, because he was extremely brilliant
*  and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can do all these different things and there's all these
*  degradation modes. But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get.
*  You almost talk in partials. So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say,
*  I've got rising terrain. That's just what they'd say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles. And I'd
*  see the little bump and I'd say, got it. This is going to go to your question on the autonomy
*  and how you work with two heads. So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like
*  you have to rehearse it, you have to know, and you talk in full sentences. The more and more
*  we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing, and he'd get like rising out. And before he finished,
*  I'd say, I've got it. So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him.
*  I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally looking at this little
*  scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving. Remember,
*  the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here
*  because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up. Remember, it's an analog system
*  to where he is telling me, I can't see all the way to the left and he's got a wider scope on the
*  radar, but my screen doesn't show that. So he's telling me, start a left turn.
*  How do I avoid the mountain? Or start a hard turn. And we would do that. So my trust-
*  And this is all happening quick? Very quick. Well, we would typically fly between
*  420 and 480 knots of ground speed. Which is how many miles an hour?
*  Well, 420 is seven miles a minute. Okay.
*  Between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying.
*  That's fast. At night. I mean, I broke out of clouds. I remember him and I flying.
*  We were on the IR. It's called an IR route, an instrument route that's low. They're all around
*  the country. There's IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, fly from the
*  land. You go out over the ocean, turn around, and then you could practice actually coming in on a
*  coastline. And we were flying and we ended up in the clouds. Keep in mind, we're between 500 and
*  1000 feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds. You can't see anything. And I had to turn off our
*  red lights that flash. They're called the anti-collision lights because it was reflecting
*  off the clouds and it starts to bother you. It just gets annoying. So I turned it off and we
*  were flying, we're flying, we're flying. We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break
*  out. And it's a decent night. And this is right by Mount St. Helens. This is kind of where we're
*  coming in. So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the
*  route goes. And you look up, because you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right
*  next to you, but you're flying along. You're just like, you got to trust. And you can see houses.
*  You can see the lights. They're above you. We're literally below people's houses flying down these
*  valleys and stuff. So just incredible experience. So when you take that and then you move into
*  an F-18F. So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century.
*  And you're flying. So now the WISO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels,
*  but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're
*  sharing the load. So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WISO does all
*  the talking. He's got actually, he uses his feet. That's the weapon systems operator in the back of
*  an F-18F. So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational
*  awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes. Just a curiosity, what's the situational
*  awareness display? Because that term comes up a lot. Think of it as a God's eye view. So if you
*  have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block 2 has about an 8 by 10 display for the WISO
*  that they can look at. The pilot's as small, it's down between us. It's a 6 by 6 between his legs
*  and they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is. But when you looked, it'd be like if you put
*  your airplane and you're looking down. So all the stuff, like if your radar's seeing bad guys out
*  in front of you, it'd be like looking down and going, oh, I'm right here. And now there's bad
*  guys out here and my wingman is over here and it shows everything. It's just like, it gives you,
*  you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where everything's at. I can see if one guy's
*  trying to target another guy, it shows you all this. It's an incredible amount of knowledge that
*  comes up for the crews to maintain the overall picture of what's going on. Because it's happening
*  so fast. And this is where that autonomy piece, this is the third brain. So we're all looking at
*  it and the third brain is doing fusion. It's pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all
*  this guy, this is this guy, this is this guy. It's sending it out through the link so all the
*  airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don't even see. It just
*  says, that airplane says, hey, I'm over here. And it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there.
*  And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy. And it
*  shows us, oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy. I mean, it's an incredible amount of
*  visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot, but when you look down at stuff,
*  you can still have the picture really quick. The third brain is doing the sensor fusion,
*  the integration of the different sensors and gives you a big picture view. What about the control?
*  I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but people use the high level term of autopilot.
*  How much is there, let's use the loose term of AI, how much automation is there, how much AI is
*  there in helping you control there? The AI piece would be more of a control loop because the digital
*  flight controls. So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly. And when I
*  say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it on flight sim. Real life is
*  a lot different. In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death. You'll do things in a simulator
*  that you would never do in real life. But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage,
*  I mean, because you think about it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data. You've got a
*  targeting pod that's feeding you data. All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got
*  a joint helmet mounted queuing system on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit
*  so it can tell where your head's at looking. So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will
*  actually look to the right. The targeting flier will look to the right. And oh, by the way,
*  the backseater has a helmet on too so he can look to the left and he can do things. So depending on
*  what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left,
*  the targeting pod looks left. But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that
*  I don't see that maybe the radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar,
*  you know, get the, because it's a phase array radar now, it doesn't really scan.
*  There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings. Because if you just,
*  if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're gonna have this
*  helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head. And I don't mean a mechanical setup,
*  but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic resonance and go, oh, look, and then I can,
*  I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a button and transfer, you know,
*  high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you know, JDAM, which is a Joint Direct
*  Attack Munition that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time and then let that thing fly.
*  And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes or, hey, I got it. We're gonna have to
*  menstruate coordinates and you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting
*  for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that. Now it's that fast.
*  LW So there's a, okay, I mean, we're probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful
*  fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane. But at a high level,
*  this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking about. Like
*  me, which is what is the difference between a human being and an AI system? Like what can,
*  what is the ceiling of current AI technology for controlling the plane? Like how much
*  does the human contribute? Is it possible to have automated flight, for example? Like what is
*  the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot
*  in warfare situations in flying a fighter jet plane?
*  JL So I would say AI systems are usually black and white. When you write the algorithm for an AI
*  system, it's really, basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math problem
*  is really what you're doing. Right? So you've got this logical math problem. Math problems are,
*  there's a line that says I can or I can't. And it's a very finite line, you know, but you can
*  go up to the line where a human, we all have gray areas where we go, maybe, I'll try it.
*  LW So humans can operate within that gray.
*  JL So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while,
*  a Super Hornet, doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance model
*  of the airplane. So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy. So it basically says
*  the airplane can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs,
*  force of gravity, you know, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then based on the
*  airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, you know,
*  because it's really physics based. Well, if you depending on how you write the AI, but typically
*  AI, you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight, right? You want to maintain it so that it
*  is flying in a controlled envelope, where there are times, and you can go back to World War I,
*  where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight, in order to obtain an
*  advantage, which is that's where the human goes, can I do this? I know it's outside of where I would
*  normally go, but I can do that. So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight
*  control logic in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving.
*  So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally even as a pilot inside
*  the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that. Like it'll flop ends,
*  which defies most logic. And I guess, you know, in a way you could probably program it,
*  but I still think that when you get to the edges, that may or may not give you an advantage,
*  there are things that a human can, will do that AI won't. And I don't think we've got to the point,
*  because how do you map illogical solutions? You know, most AI is logical. It's based on some type
*  of premise. When you write the algorithm to control it, there's bounds. Yeah, there's this
*  giant mess. Like you said, the difference between the simulator and real life also gets at that
*  somehow. That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play.
*  Like, is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing
*  that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?
*  Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6. So
*  one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization. So you got to remember when
*  Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co-pilot showed up, you know, first time they met.
*  And this happens all the time in the commercial world. You know, there's six, seven thousand
*  pilots at United Airlines, you know, your chance of flying with the same guy all the time is slim
*  and none. Where in the Navy, we were crewed. So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with
*  me. For how, for months? Oh, yeah, for like all of the deployment. So because you want to get to know,
*  you have to. Trust, all of those things. It increases the capability of airplane. It's not
*  to say we can't swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex
*  missions like a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets
*  and supporting ground troops. If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be
*  melded when you do that. You have to have trained to do that job. Otherwise, you're going to be
*  ineffective. So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly
*  commercial, there is a standardization. Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this
*  switch, you're going to do that. And everyone, they know their roles. Captain's going to do this.
*  First officer is going to do this. And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's
*  case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the
*  cockpit recordings of him, the two of them talking, you know, you got to remember they're talking to
*  each other when you hear the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in
*  the New York area. And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows,
*  hey, silence the alarm. They silence the alarm. The first officer is pulling out the book. He's
*  going through the procedures while Sully's actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost
*  their motors. And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go
*  into an airport in New Jersey. And he realizes not happening, we're going to put this thing.
*  And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he
*  was going to put this thing in the Hudson River. And he did it flawlessly. I mean, every single
*  person walked away from that wreck. The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane,
*  you know, and it got fished out of the Hudson. But what is it about those human decisions you
*  had to make? Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct that you
*  develop as a pilot over time? It's when we, when you train, you know, an aviation is a self-cleaning
*  oven. So if you make bad decisions, you're, you're, and the list is long and distinguished
*  of those who have died by making bad decisions. So when you look at what he did or the way we
*  train, because the commercial industry and the Navy and the Air Force for all that, we have what's
*  called, we have emergency procedures that we have to know. Like the engine's on fire, the first three
*  steps, you just have to know what they are. Right? So they know. The airline, same type, you know,
*  they go, Hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed, they're
*  built to have some time. But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't
*  second guess it. So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson river, he couldn't all of a
*  sudden halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport. He, he looked, he made
*  a quick assessment. This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, you know, it's kind of,
*  it's like a multiple choice test when you go, Oh my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know
*  A and D are wrong. Gone. So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone. So what's my next
*  option? Well, the Hudson river's there and that's probably looking pretty good. Or what is my other
*  one? Can I get a restart on the motors? And then if I can get a restart, now can I take it someplace
*  else? He had to make really, really fast decisions. And then once they, as they go that 80% solution,
*  you realize, all right, I'm going into the Hudson. There's the 80% get the book out. Let's see if we
*  can get an air start. Cause if you listen to the tapes, we're trying to get it air started. The
*  closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane. So the original
*  decision to, this is my best option right now. This is where I'm going. And you start eliminating
*  anything that could possibly change the events, which they tried to do. And then he gets to that
*  last minute says, we're going in the water. They changed the plan. They secure the airplane. They
*  do exactly what they're doing. And he does that basically flawless landing on the, on the Hudson.
*  But you got to remember every it's every six months for commercial, they go back and they do
*  research in the airplane, in the simulator where they train to the airplane being broken. You just
*  lost a motor. You just lost another motor. So they go through this extensive training, you know,
*  and all these, and it's, you know, you know, we used to refer to it in the Navy as the pain
*  cave where you're going to get in. Cause you know that when you get in for your check ride
*  in a simulator that the airplane is going to break, you're going to lose hydro. And it's,
*  sometimes they're a problem like, Oh, I just lost this hydraulic system, but I'm having an issue on
*  the other motor. Well, if I shut down this motor and I've got a hydraulics, you know, cause there's
*  two hydraulic systems, one on each motor. Well, if I've got an issue with the left motor hydraulic
*  system and my right motor is starting to give me indications, do I want to shut the right motor
*  down? Cause that's going to kill my hydraulic system. That's good. And now I'm flying on a
*  good motor with a bad hydraulic system and without hydraulics, the airplane won't fly. So they,
*  it's a really, they're challenging problems that you have to think through in real time.
*  And of course the weather's never good. It's always dark. It's always crappy. You're going
*  to break out at, I mean, it's just all this stuff gets compiled on top of you and it's intended to
*  increase the level of stress because when things happen, like in Sully's case, we like to joke,
*  it's going to stem power, you know, where the functional part of your brain shuts down and you
*  are literally on instinct like an animal. Well, if you've trained so much that that is the instinctive
*  reaction that you're going to have when the main part of your, your, your cognitive abilities start
*  to shut down, you're, you're running that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly
*  what to do. And that's literally how it happens. So there's no, how do I put it? Fear of death.
*  Like in Sully's case, do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his decision is
*  wrong, a lot of people are going to die. You know, I can't speak for him, but I would say
*  there was so much going on at the cockpit in that time. His, his mindset was probably,
*  I can do this. I'm trained. I'm going to do the procedures. I've practiced this before.
*  I've done these things. And I, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, cause I never
*  thought about when things were really bad, you know, if you're having problems with the airplane,
*  that, you know, that I was going to mort, you know, and, and plant it into the ground. It was always,
*  you know, maybe it's an ego thing where you think I can do this. I mean,
*  so you never have you experienced fear during flight? Like, um, I mean, one, one way,
*  we just offline mentioned Mike Tyson. I mean, he talked about like, uh, as he's, uh, walking up
*  to the ring, he's like, he starts out basically in fear and, uh, yeah, worried about how things
*  are going to go. I mean, it's purely to put in towards his fear, but as he gets closer and
*  closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over to where
*  you think there's no way anybody could, uh, defeat me. So like that's, that's his experience of
*  overcoming fear, but do you, uh, did you experience any kind of thing like that? Or is that, or do you
*  just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training and then you just go to the instinctual
*  solution? I wouldn't say I was never afraid. I think that would be, I can't, I couldn't tell
*  you that anyone I know that wasn't afraid at one time. And for most of us, especially Navy carrier
*  pilots, it's just, it's, it's usually, especially when you're new and you got to go out and it's
*  nighttime and there's no moon and the weather sucks and the deck's moving, you know, the ship's
*  going up and down because it will scare love or living shit out of you. Can I say that?
*  You can definitely say that. So it's about landing and takeoff that that is if you, even
*  as they used to wire people up, they did it during Vietnam, you know, guys would go flying
*  missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going on and people were getting
*  shot down a lot. Uh, the highest, the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land
*  on board an aircraft carrier. How hard is it to land on that? It seems impossible. Like for,
*  for a civilian, I guess, like me, it just seems crazy that a human can do that. The problem with
*  night is, and there's different degrees of night, just like day. I mean, there's the clear full moon
*  night, you know, where it's like, woo, you know, this is not that bad, but you got to remember at
*  night, I think everyone can associate with you're driving in your car and it's just a, it's, it's an
*  overcast dark night and you're on a country road with no side lights. Most people have a tendency
*  to slow down just by nature of, Oh my God. Cause you, what you'll do is you'll out-drive your
*  headlights because it is so dark, you know, and you can get outside, you get outside of city and
*  get up into New Hampshire, uh, especially when the roads are curving, you know, and the lines
*  probably aren't that good. It's, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million
*  because you have no depth perception. Uh, what you think is fixed, the runway is actually moving
*  up and down and left to right. Yeah. Oh, and when it's really bad, you can actually see it move.
*  And, uh, we have two systems, uh, you know, there was a, there's an automatic system that's actually,
*  it stabilizes with the inertials on the ship. And then there's the ILS now, civilian pilots will
*  tell you that ILS is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth and glide slope. You know,
*  you come down, you, it's like a plus, um, on the carrier, it's not, it's really just a beam that
*  goes out and it's considered a non-precision approach. It's, it's not stabilized at all that.
*  And I've been where you can actually watch the needle and the, and the tack and needle will move.
*  There's all kinds of stuff moving because the base that it's all sitting on is doing this and ships
*  don't just go up and down. They, they, they do this. So the bow goes up and down in the tail,
*  like you normally see a ship. And then there's, so that's pitch and then it has roll. So it's
*  doing this and then it has heave. So the whole boat is going up and down while it's pitching
*  and rolling and you're gonna land on that. Um, so, and it's, I mean, I remember landing,
*  I was with Chris Sato and Chris and I, we were off the USS Ranger, which is now decommissioned.
*  It's sitting, getting turned into razor blades. Um, we're flying the old a six and we come in and
*  it was off of San Diego and it was just the ugly night. Cause San Diego always has a Marine layer
*  that is about 1200 feet was lower than that that night. And it was pouring down rain. It was an
*  El Nino year and there's thunderstorms all around. It was just craziest night I've ever seen out of
*  San Diego. And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking. I mean,
*  you literally can't stop. And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked,
*  we caught the six pack. So it's right in front of the Island. So if you see an aircraft carrier
*  of the Island and the number of the ship on it, we're sitting right in front of that and we're
*  looking at the landing area. So it's like, you get front row seats to the concert and, and this,
*  this EA six B comes in, you know, ugly pass. He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first
*  one. You never want to catch the first one. It means you were not really high above the back
*  of the ship when you landed. And it comes in and the exhaust on any A six or an A six actually
*  points kind of down and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft. That's how
*  hard it's raining. And you literally could not see across. I mean, I could see the front of my
*  airplane, his airplane, and then it was just white because of the water being blown off the deck.
*  And I'm shaking and I, I'll never forget. I looked over at Chris and I said, oh my God,
*  I go, Hey dude, man, 10,000 foot runway looks really good right now. And I go, and I'm shaking
*  my hands like this. And I said, I'm not even, this is, I'm not faking this dude. I go, that's
*  literal. I cannot stop shaking. I said, that scared the avalanche out of me. But you, but it
*  scares you afterwards. You don't, during it, you're not, I'm not, you don't have time to think about
*  that. You're doing it. You got to do is we, you know, kind of the quote from Tom Hanks and,
*  what's that? The girls baseball movie where he goes, there's no crying in baseball. Well,
*  that's our joke. There's no crying in Naval aviation. I said, you can fly around and cry
*  all you want at night. But you know, there's only one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land
*  it. So you cry all you want, wipe the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it's,
*  it's time to, it's time to, you know, man up and land, land the jet. Sorry for the romantic
*  question, but going back to the, the kid that dreamed to fly, what's it like to fly an airplane?
*  What it looks incredible to me as a human, like a descendant of vape, I sit here on land
*  and look up at you guys. It seems incredible that human being can do that. You know, people ask,
*  you know, I'll be sitting around with my friends and they're like, how was I said it,
*  the greatest job on the planet. I said, you know, you, it's, it's an office with a view
*  cause you're sitting in a glass, you can do, you know, it's like roller coasters. You go,
*  oh, it does all these cool stuff. So we take people flying every once in a while and it's like,
*  yeah, I like rollercoasters. I go, no, take any rollercoaster, the coolest rollercoaster you've
*  ever been on and multiply it by a thousand. I said, it's an experience, you know, to put your body
*  under, you know, you know, the jets rated at seven and a half, but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it
*  overstresses depends on fuel weight. So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight G's
*  to be able to do that to your body. I mean, it takes a toll. Like I can't really turn my
*  head real good anymore and stuff like that, but would I trade it? I mean, it was a childhood dream
*  and how many people get to do that? You know, professional, I want to be an NFL, you know,
*  and you end up to the NFL, which is a very small percentage with, well, I want to fly jets and,
*  and to fly, you know, at the time when I was flying the super Hornets that we had on our squadron
*  were brand new at like literally right out of the factory. I had come off our first super Hornet
*  cruise. We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were building my new jets that
*  I was going to get. And I actually signed the inside of one of the wings, why they were putting
*  it together. So I'm meeting the people that are putting the jet together. That's going to get
*  delivered to me in a couple of months that I'm going to fly. So, just, I mean, the whole of it is
*  I'll tell you what, when I left, when I decided to walk away, yeah, do you miss it? I told myself,
*  I wouldn't, I promised myself that, you know, once you get through your Oh five command,
*  your flying really starts to tag, to come down. You know, even if you, when you're an air wing
*  commander, which is we call them CAG, carrier group commander, you're not flying as much as
*  like the normal pilots, nor should you be. I mean, there's young people that are coming up
*  and it's training your relief because that's the next generation. So like currently I have
*  friends of mine that we serve together. Their kids are flying super Hornets, right? So to me,
*  that's really neat because I watched them when they were little. And now, you know, one of them
*  who was good friends, I won't get his last name, but Joey, who lived down the street from us,
*  is a top, was a top gun instructor. And I'm like, Hey, Joey's, Joey's a top gun,
*  you know? And I'm like, that's cool because, you know, I had went there and I knew him,
*  he would come down to my house. And now to see these kids that are,
*  because typically military breeds military, you know, because the kids grew up in it. I mean,
*  the only reason that my son is not doing it is he's colorblind. So it disqualifies you for being a
*  pilot, being a seal, because he had talked about doing that because he's an incredible swimmer and
*  he likes doing that stuff and the water polo player. But he's, you know, both of my kids are,
*  well, my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his third year. So,
*  but there's a, I suppose, I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover of this
*  incredible experience of flying to the younger generation. So you don't, you told yourself,
*  you're not going to miss it. You miss it? There are days I do when I hear jets, like if I'm around
*  a base or a jet flies over, but I have all the memory so I can look at it and go,
*  it can't go on forever. You know, Tom Brady can't play football. There's going to come a time where
*  he has to stop. He seems to have done it for a long time. But, you know, typically when you look
*  at it, you go, I had the opportunity. And I think as automation moves on, especially with AI,
*  that, you know, when will the last man fighter be built? You know, and that's that big question.
*  You know, we just did F-35. It's over budget. It's seven years late. There's all kinds of issues
*  when we try and do it. And then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the Air
*  Force is working on with smaller, cheaper, attritable platforms that you can go, oh,
*  we can because if you don't put a man in the box or a person, because there's a lot of incredibly
*  talented women that do this too. So I'll just say that as person. Yeah. So we say man and he,
*  we mean both men and women because offline, you've told me about a lot of incredible women
*  that flown. So I had, I had three, three female, actually four, one of them didn't fly anymore.
*  She actually lives right around here. She's, she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she
*  couldn't fly anymore. One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly, she's one of the
*  most gifted people I've ever met in my life. She is the vice president of Amazon Air. You can see
*  her on TV. Her name's Sarah, incredible. And then I had a Paige who ended up taking command. She got
*  out of fighters and went into other platforms and she was a commanding officer. And then the other
*  one is a, teaches leadership and she is all three of them, actually all four of the women that were
*  direct. I'm home, not forgetting. I don't think I'm forgetting someone incredibly, incredibly
*  talented and a great addition to the ready room. So anyone who gets into the, oh, you know, women
*  can't do it. That's all total horse crap. Hey, you know, we can talk about the original integration
*  and stuff, which was not done well by the military nor the Navy. So women can fly as good as the guys.
*  Yeah. You can't tell if you pass another airplane, you can't tell if there's a man or a woman in it.
*  It really comes down to stick and throttle, the ability to extrapolate where the vehicle is going
*  to be, where the airplane would be. If you're fighting another one, you have to be able to
*  think fast. Anyone who has those characteristics can do it. And then I think most important besides
*  that, there has to be a desire. And I'm not saying that everyone, if you took, because we used to
*  track. So when I ran, we call it the rag, it's the replacement air group. It's where, so the
*  Super Hornet Training Squadron, there's two of them. There's one on the East Coast, 106, and there's
*  one on the West Coast, which is VFA 122. 122 is the first one. So I ended up going there and I ended
*  up being the operations officer and training officer. Okay. So we track the last hundred students.
*  Right. So everyone goes, ah, it's funny to hear students talk because, oh, he's awesome.
*  He's a real. If you took the hundred, there's three at the top of the list that are just
*  naturally gifted aviators. They're well, well, well above average. It's like the person in a
*  math class that sits down in complex math and they just get it. At the bottom, there's the three at
*  the bottom that are going to struggle and there's a good chance they won't get out. And if they do
*  get out, they're going to have to work really hard to just maintain kind of average. Sometimes it's
*  just the way your mind works. Not everyone is good at everything. If you took the 94 of them in the
*  middle, they're within one mean deviation of, you know, it's there. They're all, you know, it's a,
*  the bell curve doesn't look real good. It's just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone's
*  right there within one mean deviation. And then you have the outliers, usually not on the high side
*  because they're going to get through, but the outliers on the low side that don't make it through.
*  So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job as does the air force of screening. So now
*  what they do, when I went, you just showed up and you started. Now what you do is you actually go
*  fly a Piper warriors low wing to see, can you, are you adaptable to this? And there's an evaluation
*  that goes through. And then if you hit a certain mark, then you're good to go. And then they put
*  you into primary. It's kind of like a, it's like a pre-check, you know, like the preset, the pre-SAT
*  to go, Hey, how am I going to do on the SAT? It's, it's, it's very similar to that, but it's more of a
*  hand skill. Can you adapt? Because although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not,
*  you know, we, this is, you know, this is all has depth with all that. We're, it's really relative
*  to aviation. We are two dimensional, very two dimensional. Can you explain that? So our perception
*  is actually more limited than the, than that of an aviator. Very much. And here's why. So we look at,
*  let's look at a tall building. Let's look at one world trade center in New York, because that's
*  everyone knows what it looks like. Big tall building. It's what maybe 1800 feet tall,
*  even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like what 20, some hundred feet tall. It's not that big.
*  So a super Hornet to do what a split S is, which is I'm flying, I'm just going to roll the airplane
*  upside down and then I'm going to do basically a C, the letter C, I'm going to go in the top and
*  out the bottom. So, and I'm just going to basically a vertical displacement of the airplane. So I'm
*  going from high to low. It's very, very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet,
*  give or take a little. So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn.
*  Yeah. For example, the A6 in order to do that was about 9,000 feet. And we look at a building
*  that's 2,000 feet high and think that is tall. Right. All right. So in aviation sense, when
*  you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers, going from 35,000 feet down to 20,000
*  feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane, because the human brain thinks we really
*  are, we like to be flat. I see what you mean. We think 2D. So if I'm fighting, how you really
*  get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work in the vertical, because
*  most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start to flatten out because
*  that's where we're comfortable. Yeah. So the profound, do you still think in like stacks of
*  2D layers or no? Or do you, do you truly start to think in that third dimension, like the rich
*  3D world of fighting? Do you start to actually be able to really experience the 3D nature?
*  You do, because you have to project where you're going to be. So you have to know the performance
*  of the airplane, knowing that, hey, if I do this maneuver that I am going to go, it's kind of like
*  when I talk about when we were chasing the Tic Tac. So the Tic Tac's coming up and I'm at about,
*  and I've been doing this for at the time, 16 years. So I'm looking and I'm going, hey, I'm here.
*  He's there on the other side of the circle. I'm going to do a vertical displacement. I'm going
*  to go like this. I'm going to cut across the circle and I'm not going to him. I'm going out
*  in front of him. I'm going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver,
*  that's where he's going to be. And I'm trying to basically join up on them.
*  But I also had to look at it to go, do I have enough altitude to do this? Because what I did
*  with, we're here and I do this, I'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me. And
*  then I have to get that energy back to get up to him. And when you're doing a max performance,
*  it's a trade. So you have, this is really important when you're fighting airplanes
*  and you're really max performing. So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo,
*  he's literally playing with it. He's got a finite amount of energy, right? He can add some with the
*  motors and stuff, but what you're really doing is it's a trade off and you can trade off
*  kinetic energy, speed for altitude, which gives you potential energy.
*  The other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance.
*  Because I know if I do a nice easy turn, the airplane will make it and what doesn't bleed
*  energy. But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S that it's going to cost me
*  energy. So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the
*  bottom at probably 200 knots. Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to
*  kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high
*  performance turn. And you have to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your overall
*  energy package. So you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you.
*  But if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's just going to pull away,
*  drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds. Right? It's overall energy package and that's that
*  you got to be constantly evaluating where you're at. And this is that 80% solution. Can I afford
*  to do this or not? Yes, no. And you have literally a split second to make the decision.
*  The most incredible dance of human decision making is just incredible. I know a million people want
*  me to talk about Tic Tac and I definitely will, but let me ask the one last ridiculous
*  subjective question. What's the greatest plane ever made in history?
*  You don't get to like- From pure speed, I would say SR-71. I think it's an engineering marvel that
*  was actually developed in the 50s by Kelly Johnson, Skunk Works, for what that was able to do. And
*  when you get into history of it, how they actually built the CIA actually made like six companies in
*  order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring it back and build an airplane out of titanium that
*  we would fly over Russia. To me, that's an incredible- Engineering marvel. I think that like the X-15-
*  By the way, this SR-71 still holds the speed record.
*  Of any plane, as far as I can understand. Yeah. What's funny when you get into it is it's
*  remember fast is relative. When I say that, I mean, so if you're going 3000 miles an hour,
*  a hundred feet above the ground, you're going 3000 miles an hour through, you know, that's how fast
*  you're going. When you get up to altitude, there's an indicated airspeed and there's a, you know,
*  your ground speed. So your indicated airspeed is really how fast the air is going past your
*  airplane. Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing like 300 knots, but at 300
*  knots, you're really doing 2,500 miles an hour over the ground. So, you know, like we would take
*  the airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full maintenance check flights on them. So when
*  you're doing 200, you know, in some odd knots, it's actually slow for the airplane. It's, you
*  know, you're getting, you know, it's kind of like, it's not, you know, there's maneuvering speeds.
*  You know that if I hit a certain speed in a superornet, that I have the full capability of
*  the airfoil. If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G.
*  Okay. So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really going fast? And when you
*  look at an SR-71 that's flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand feet, the air is so thin,
*  you know, just like the X-15, you can get to a much higher speed, but the relative speed of the
*  air going over you is actually relatively low. So the stresses on the airframe are not like they
*  would be if you were down low, but because you're going fast to get enough air over your
*  pitot-static system to show that you're going 300 knots, you're screaming. I mean, the fastest I
*  ever got was I was with the, well, soon to be vice admiral White, so we had taken a check flight and
*  I got it up to 1.78. I got a super hornet up to Mach 1.78 and it was, and we were
*  struck by Pebble Beach too. And then it- What's that feel like? Or is it just like-
*  When you get that fast, it started, to me it got a little bit weird because you realize
*  in your brain, and I did, that there's no out. If something happens, I can't eject.
*  The ejection would kill me. Isn't that kind of liberating in a way?
*  You always want to push the limit, you know, it's like how fast, I could have got it going faster,
*  it was literally still accelerating when I stopped, but I had, it was fuel limited
*  and space limited because I, you know, I'm off the coast of California,
*  Big Sur and I'm going and I can see Pebble Beach out in the distance, you know, the whole
*  Monterey Peninsula. You're just going fast. And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute. I mean,
*  you're screaming. Yeah. I mean, that's, and then you have to turn, well, the airplane didn't have
*  anything on it. It was a slicked off super hornet. So it was basically just the airplane, no pylons,
*  no pods, no nothing. And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit
*  point for the area and I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic. And there's a bunch of things
*  that are disabled, like the speed brakes that normally we pop out when you're going that fast,
*  they don't, because the super hornet really doesn't have speed brakes, it deforms the flight
*  controls. They don't function. So you really, you're trying to maneuver and when you're going that
*  fast, you can't turn because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach is a pretty big turn. So it's just, it's crazy.
*  It's incredible that a human can do this and a human can engineer that, the system, which allows
*  another human to control that system. To me, it's, I think it's just, it's a great experience.
*  Was it sad to see the SR-71 go? I think it was during your career. I mean,
*  do you guys romanticize the different planes? We would see it flying when I was flying hornets
*  because we, West Coast flies in, it's called R2508, which covers the Navy China Lake area and Edwards.
*  It's a huge area. It's actually, I think the, we had a guy from Switzerland come out because they
*  had hornets and he's like, this is bigger than our whole country because it's a pretty big area
*  in California that you fly. But you would see the SR-71s, they had a loop because NASA was flying them
*  out of Palmdale and they would take off and they'd go up towards Washington state and Montana and
*  they do a loop. And so you'd see them coming back down. They descend out of above 60,000. You'd see
*  them, they get contrails, the white lines behind airplanes. They'd come down and hit the tanker
*  and then they'd go back up. So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying. But I think
*  with money, age, the advent of satellites, because they're everywhere now. I mean, you've got
*  commercial companies putting satellites up. How much of that need was really there? Because you
*  got to remember when those things started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't flying around. It was the U2
*  and the SR-71 that were out there doing that work. So at the time it was needed. It was at the,
*  if you think about it really, it was an incredible feat of aviation for that time.
*  I mean, literally we have yet to pass that. And then you also ask, well, is there a need to pass
*  that? I go, I don't know. We got stuff in space. So do we need to make an airplane that goes that
*  fast? I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to put a person
*  in. It does all kinds of crazy stuff. You know, the work with automation, all that kind of stuff. Yeah.
*  So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of, at least in my view,
*  one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's witnessed a UFO literally,
*  an identified flying object. And not only witnessed, but got to, how do you put it? Chase it,
*  essentially? Chase it. Chase it. So let me just lay out, I think it's easier than you telling the
*  story. Maybe me and my dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories that I understand it. And
*  then maybe you can correct me. So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton, which is one of the
*  carriers. That's a cruiser. It's a cruiser. So you can't land on a... No, helicopter has a helicopter
*  pad on the back. Gotcha. And it has weapons on it. Okay, gotcha. It shoots the missiles up. But it
*  has a nice radar. Just got an incredible spy one system, phased array, four panels. So it looks in
*  quadrants. Perfect. So they started noticing on November 10th that there's a few objects flying
*  around at 28,000 feet with speed of, what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an hour.
*  Don't know what that's in knots, but on the coast of California. And they kept detecting these
*  objects for just about a week. Then comes in like your part of the story, which is on November 14th
*  from the, I guess it's from the USS Nimitz. You flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white tic tac
*  shaped object with no wings flying in ways you've never thought possible. And in some interviews
*  somewhere you said, I think it was not from this world. So there's a mysterious aspect to this
*  object, to this entire situation. There's videos involved, the video of a flare forward looking
*  infrared receiver. Receiver. There's also the visible lights you can switch. Yeah, it has a TV mode.
*  It has a TV mode. So that gives you visible light and then it has an IR mode. And Chad Underwood
*  recorded that video. And those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later. One of the
*  three videos, the two other videos, Go Fast and Gimbal were recorded in 2000 something 14 or 15
*  on the East coast of the United States. They had different kinds of objects, but they're weird in
*  the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences that people have
*  described were similar in the degree of weirdness. But the differences is actually on the East coast
*  of 2014 case, very few people have spoken about it. And even in your situation, very few people
*  have spoken about it. So there's a mystery to it. But it's in some sense, it's a quite simple story
*  without much resolution to the mystery. And it's fascinating. And there's a lot of opinions. There's
*  division of opinions because it's a mysterious, I mean, it's truly as a UFO in the sense that
*  UAP, what is it? Unidentified Aerophenomena. So can you maybe correct me on any of the things
*  that gotten wrong, elaborate on some key things and describe that experience in general?
*  So here's what I know. So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train and they canceled the mission.
*  And they sent us and there's all kinds of rumors out here. There's all kinds of after this has come
*  out. So originally it was the four of us. There's two jets, two people at each jet, their F-18s.
*  Okay. There is no video from our event. It was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing. And
*  then when we came back and told it, when Chad and his pilot took off, that's when Chad got the video
*  of it. And we're like, that's it. That's exactly, that's it. So when you say eyeballs, you mean
*  literally your eyes are seeing a thing. Yeah. So as we're flying out, we get vectored. They come up
*  and tell us, hey, we're going to cancel training. This is a USS Princeton. So this is a Seige's
*  cruiser. So we're talking to one controller who is like, Hey sir, first you ask what ordinance we
*  have on board. And I laugh because we don't carry live ordinance and training typically,
*  because bad stuff happens. Usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off
*  and hits a good airplane and it's not good. So we had what's called a catam 9, which is really just
*  a blue tube with the aim nine seeker on the front of it, which is an IR missile. So there's only two
*  ways to get it off. You can beat it off of the sledgehammer. You can take this thing and you put
*  a wrench in it and unlocks the lugs and pulls the lugs back in that hold it on when it really fires
*  the impulse from the engine actually throws the lugs forward and breaks that release and it comes
*  off down the rail. That's how it works. So they said, Hey, well we have real world tasking. So
*  as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot, she maneuvers the airplane to the left-hand side
*  of me. So she's kind of stepped up like this and I'll use your mic box to start. So as we're going
*  out, they're calling ranges are called Brock calls, bearing range and altitude. And they're telling us,
*  Hey, it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles. So they're saying, Hey, 270, 30,
*  20,000. So I say, so we got our radars and we had, we had a mechanically scanned rainers at the time.
*  APG 73 good piece of gear, APG 79 new ones way better. But anyway,
*  and I apologize if I interrupt the story. Hopefully it's useful, but they're telling you a location
*  of a thing that you should look at. Yep. They're telling us they have a contact on their radar.
*  They don't know what it is. They just have a blip. They have a little blip. Well, they've been
*  watching these things. And what he told me is they had been looking at these things as we're
*  driving. I said, sir, we've been tracking these things for about two weeks. That's we had been
*  at sea for two weeks because this is the first time we've had planes airborne. We want you to go see
*  what these are. Gotcha. So they kind of interrupt the mission to say, check it out. That's exactly it.
*  So we start driving out there and as we get down to, he's going, you know, 20 miles, 15 miles,
*  10 miles, and then you get to a point where they call merge plot, which means we are inside of the
*  resolution cell of the radar because radars don't see everything. They're so they have a range and
*  they have an azimuth resolution. Right. So, and it's basically think of a little cube so they can
*  and the whole sky is made of all these little cubes and they're looking. So if you're inside a
*  cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube, then the radar can only see one
*  thing. Does that make sense? Yeah. So they call merge plot. Well, when we say merge plot to us,
*  it means he's right around, something's around you, get your head out. So we're not looking at radar
*  scopes anymore and the wizows, the wizows can look, but everyone, it's heads out. When they say merge
*  plot, you're done looking at your displays inside, you're doing this and you're trying to find it.
*  So as we look out to the right and you look high and low, because he could be anywhere
*  from the surface all the way up. Now, keep in mind the ship is like probably 60 miles away,
*  so it can't see the surface and you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go, hey,
*  it's the thing is 40 feet off the water, the panel. Can he really see, you know, there are radars that
*  can see around the curve, but let's just say that it can't at this time. So you go, is it, you know,
*  where is it at? So as we're looking around, we see, no, this is a, it's a clear day. There's no clouds
*  and there's no white caps. It's just a calm, it's actually a perfect day. If you own a sailboat,
*  it was that five to 10 knots of wind and you just want to kind of go out there and you're not going
*  to get beat up and have white water coming. It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.
*  How many miles out do you see like seven, like you see just, it's a clear day.
*  That's 50, it's unrestricted visibility. You can see literally all the way to the horizon. It's just
*  clear. It's nothing. And we're basically off the coast. If you look at a map and you go San Diego
*  and then Ensao de Mexico, we're kind of in between that. And we're probably about,
*  by the time this all hits, we're probably, I don't know, 80, 100, I don't know, but somewhere out,
*  it's pretty far off the coast. Perfect visibility. But from 20,000 feet, you'd be amazed. You can do
*  the calculation. You can see stuff, you know, you'll see land 50 miles away. You know, you can see,
*  you know, and when you're looking at a continent, it's really easy to see. You're not looking at an
*  island. I mean, you're looking at Mexico. And you can see on the white caps in the water,
*  if there is any. Oh yeah, they're easy. Yeah. For us, we look at it because we know if it's
*  natural wind or so if it's a really white cap windy day, then the ship's just kind of barely
*  be moving when we land on it. It makes it actually easier. If the ship has to move where it's got a
*  big weight, because it has to make its own wind when we land, which is the day that it was this
*  day, you go, oh, okay. And it creates what's called, we call the burble, but when the air
*  flows across the flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know? And then it kicks back up.
*  So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're
*  going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope. So we're pretty conscious of
*  what's going on out there with the waves and the wind. So there's no waves, there's no wind,
*  there's no white caps. And we look down and we see white water. So if you put a piece of land,
*  a seamount below the surface, like even 20 feet below the surface, it's big enough. As the waves
*  come in, waves have height and length. When they come in, that's what happens on the shore. When a
*  wave comes in, it hits and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because
*  it can't go anymore and then it breaks over the top. And that's where you get the white.
*  So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave will
*  crash and you'll get white water. You can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts,
*  you can go out here off of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks. And at high tide,
*  I can't see the rocks are covered, but there'll be white water around those rocks. You'll be able
*  to tell there's something underneath the surface. Does that make sense? So that's what it was. We
*  don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below the wave. We
*  didn't see anything below the water. We just saw white water. But the white water, and I like to
*  shape it, you can say it was a cross. I say it's about the size of a 737. So it looks like if you
*  took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water, so the waves breaking over the top and
*  you're going to get white water where the plane is at, you'd see this kind of shape. So it looks
*  like a cross. So as we're looking down off the right side, the back seat or in the other plane,
*  Jim says, this is that talking in parcels again. He says, hey, Skipper, do you? And that's about
*  what he gets out of his mouth. And I go, what the hell is that? Do you see that essentially?
*  So we see the white water and that's what draws our eyes down there. Otherwise, we'd have never
*  seen it. So we see this white water. I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see
*  that. And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it. And
*  it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt. It's very abrupt. So
*  it's not like a helicopter. If a helicopter's going sideways and it goes once, it's going sideways,
*  left and it goes right. What it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows down because there's
*  inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way. This thing's not. It's like left, right,
*  left, right with no... So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things
*  you've seen in the past. So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right? So
*  you go, oh, what is it? Because when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter.
*  So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because
*  usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the
*  movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up the sides because the
*  downdraft, like a thunderstorm will do that. It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the
*  sides. So you see it and you go, well, there's no rotor wash. What is that thing? So by this time,
*  we're driving around. So if we were at the six o'clock, we're driving around towards that nine
*  o'clock position and we're just watching this thing. And it's still pointed north-south and
*  it's going left, right. And it's kind of moving around the object. And if I had to say it biased
*  itself, it was biased towards the bottom half. So if you've got the east-west and then the north-south
*  kind of across, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out. It's just kind of moving
*  around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it. It's going up. So now we're like, what the hell is
*  that? So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out. And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay
*  up here. And I said, yeah, stay up high because now we get a different perspective. So she's up
*  here and I'm down here as I'm descending. She can watch, because right now all I'm watching is the
*  Tic Tac. She can watch me and the Tic Tac. So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going
*  on, which is really important. You'll hear people say it's high cover, whatever. She's watching me,
*  which is perfect as the story goes on because it gives us two perspectives, a perspective that's
*  about 8,000 feet above us when that thing disappears. Because if it's just like, oh,
*  I lost it. And they go, no, it's over to the right. We can still see it. We all lost it at the same
*  time. So as we come down, we get to about 12 o'clock and I'm descending. It's an easy descent. I'm
*  doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering because
*  I have everything available to me at that speed. So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 o'clock,
*  as the Tic Tac's doing this, literally it's like it's aware of us and it just goes bloop and it
*  points out towards the west and starts coming up. So now it obviously knows that we're there,
*  whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there. So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm just
*  coming down. I'm just watching it. Now you gotta remember, this whole thing is like, this is like
*  five minutes. This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they
*  were gone. We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers watch this
*  thing fly around. So we're like, okay. So I get over to the eight o'clock position and I'm a
*  little, I'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15K, I think
*  it is. I think that's my story is about 15. It's just estimating. So you can see it's just a really
*  easy descent because- So what's 15K? 15,000 feet. I thought it was 8,000. No, the other airplane ends
*  up about, so you can all get to that. So they're still at about 20,000 feet. So they're driving
*  around the box. And I'm descending, they're staying up there. So I'm kind of doing this
*  as they drive around. So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two o'clock position,
*  we're about the eight o'clock position and I'm like, oh, I've got enough altitudes. I'm going to
*  cut across the circle. I tell the guy in my back seat, dude, I'm going to do this. He's like, go
*  for it, skip, because I was a skipper. So I cut across the bottom. So I'm kind of almost coming out
*  co-altitude as this thing's coming out, I'm going to meet it. And I'm driving and I get to probably,
*  I'm probably about a half mile away, which you think, well, a half mile is pretty far. Half mile
*  in aviation, it's nothing. I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane. You can see all
*  kinds of stuff at a half mile. You can see pretty good detail. So I'm like right there and it's
*  coming across my nose. So now I'm basically pointing back towards the east. So I'm cutting across
*  because I'm going to the three o'clock position. It's at two o'clock and I'm going to meet it at
*  three o'clock. So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears. So this happens at
*  around, estimate in about 12,000 feet. So they're at 20. So they've got about 8,000 foot of altitude
*  above us when this happens. And it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and
*  literally in less than, you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes and it's gone.
*  And so we're like, and I had the first thing is, dude, did you guys see it? The other airplanes,
*  like it's gone. We don't, we have no idea where it's at. So we kind of spin around real quick.
*  I go, well, let's see what's down here. And I turn around, we're looking for the white water
*  and we can't, the white water is gone. There's nothing. It's literally all blue. So now you go.
*  And I remember telling the guy in my back seat, I go, dude, I'm, I don't know about you, but I'm
*  pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time, like 30 some hundred
*  hours of flying. I'd been doing it for 18 years. It's nothing like anything you've seen. No, no.
*  So as we turn, we go, well, let's just go back, you know, because now I got to put on my real hat,
*  which we have to train because we're getting ready to deploy to, you know, overseas. So we've got to
*  get our training done. So that's my mindset, especially as a CEO, because I got to get,
*  I get it training out of the flight time because I'm responsible to do that. So, hey, let's go back.
*  And the, the, the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron.
*  And so Cheeks is at the, he's listening to all this happen, you know, cause he's just like,
*  cause he, they, when he first went out, they were going to do him, but the little hornets,
*  the legacy hornets, the F-18Cs don't have as much gas as the super hornets. So he had launched
*  first and they were going to do him. And then when they knew we were off the deck, they just told
*  him, hey, go to your cap point down south and we're going to send, we'll pass this off to the,
*  the super hornets. What's the cap point? That's where we hold. So it's called a combat air patrol
*  point. So we're just going to hold at one end. He's going to hold at the other end.
*  It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's thinking about if it's a football field,
*  we're going to sit on one goal line. He's going to sit on the other goal line. And when they say,
*  go, we're going to run at each other and try and do something in the middle of the field,
*  then go back to our reset points. Okay. So you're talking to him. He's, he's, he's listening to the,
*  he's just listening. We don't talk to him at all. He's just listening. He just dials up because they
*  know that we all know the frequencies. So he's listening to what's going on. Cause he's like,
*  cause they canceled training. So what else is he going to do? He's just going to hang out there
*  and do circles while he's waiting him and his wingman. So they just, they're listening to all
*  this go on. And then at this point you move on. Yeah. We come back up to train. We go back as
*  we're flying back the controller, cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the,
*  they're called OS's or operation specialists. They are the ones that run the radars.
*  And we're talking to him and he's like, Hey sir, you're not going to believe this,
*  but that thing is at your cap. It showed back up. It just popped up. This is like 60 miles away.
*  It just reappears. We're like, Oh, okay. So we got the radars out. We're looking for it.
*  We get out there. We never see it. We never see it again. We do what we need to do. We come back to
*  the ship. Of course, now we're like, Oh, this is going to be, we're, you know, I told, I told him,
*  I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch, we're going to catch for this. When we get back to the
*  ship, we're going to get out and we're just going to catch maximum shit. And we did. And it's, it's
*  kind of that joking, you know, so the shit plays movies. We have movies on the boat and they do
*  12 hours of movies. So they repeat cause there's a day check and a night check. So the same movies
*  in the morning and night plays. So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat,
*  which drives my wife crazy. Cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too. I'll be like, Oh,
*  hey, I've seen this. And it all jump into a movie in the middle and then I'll pick it up later.
*  And I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together. Cause that's how we have to do it.
*  Cause we're so busy while the movies became, and I was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day.
*  Definitely going to catch some shit. Oh, we, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions.
*  So just taking it. Cause it's whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened,
*  it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent histories. So
*  whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about a different kinds of angles. There's no good answers,
*  but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here. Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see,
*  you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe
*  the sir. It's at your cap point. That's a different place. How the heck did it know what your cap point
*  is? That's a good question. And that's the one of you to know. And you know, you don't, we don't tell
*  it. We don't broadcast it. We have a way point in the system, but I don't know. Maybe it knew where
*  we were going. Cause we use the same one day after day after day. But it, it obviously knew, but you
*  never saw it there. Never saw it there. Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed,
*  we told them, Hey, look, we just, we just chased this thing. They're like, what'd I go? They're
*  like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video. And he goes, so, and that's
*  how he is. He's like, I'm going to go. And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to
*  find this thing. So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out that they
*  don't see, because not all the, all you see is the Fleer tape. That's the targeting pod, the forward
*  looking infrared receiver. Um, I'll probably overlay the video. When he goes out, it's, uh,
*  you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically two radar displays up.
*  He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one. So
*  this is called the azel display. And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the,
*  you're at the bottom of it. You're at the bottom of the square. It's, it's really taken this,
*  it's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares it out.
*  So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this, they score it off. So,
*  so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when he's not trying
*  to lock it, so the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar.
*  So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing. It's going, hello, I can see you. I can see it.
*  It's looking for return. So he gets a return. So he wants to see what it is because all you get is
*  a little green square, unless it builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just
*  sitting there. It's not moving because it's, it's sitting in one spot in space. He locks it up.
*  When he goes to lock it up, now he's putting a bunch of energy on it. He's telling the radar,
*  stare down that line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track
*  file on it, which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going.
*  Okay. The radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with,
*  it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed. So that's all it is,
*  is you send the signal out something, it manipulates the signal either in range and
*  velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart enough to go, that is not
*  a return that I'm expecting. Something's messing with me. I'm being jammed and it shows you and
*  it puts strobes up. It gives these lines on the radar and it does some stuff. So you can mean,
*  well, it does, it goes full into it. It's being jammed at about every mode you can possibly see
*  because everything comes up and the, the, this aspect gets long. It's all kinds of, I don't want
*  to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed. So, and as you said on Rogan, by the way,
*  that jamming is an act of war. When you actively jam another platform, yes, it's technically an
*  act of war. It feels like you should be freaking out at this point. I mean, so well, he does it.
*  And then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle. They have what their side
*  stick controller, so they can control all the sensors and they can just toggle around and do
*  stuff. So he can, he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that
*  azimuth elevation on the radar to the targeting pod. Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to
*  look at that target, the targeting pod goes, oh, what's over there? And it'll stare cause it goes
*  down the line of sight. Cause all the systems are hooked together. You can decouple them,
*  but they're going to automatically couple up. So when he castles over, he, it's a switch,
*  it looks like a castle switch, let's say castle. So when he moves that thing to the left and he
*  swaps the displays out and he says, instead of looking at the radar, I want to look at the
*  targeting pod. He sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pods already looking there.
*  And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out. He's just
*  receiving IR energy from the Tic Tac. And then the system itself will track the pixels and the
*  contrast differences. It depends on what mode you're in. So it says, oh, and that's where those little
*  bars you see in the video where the bars come up left and right. Some vision based tracking.
*  That's exactly what it is. So, and that's the video he goes through,
*  zooms changes the mode. He goes through all the modes. So there's a narrow, medium and wide. So
*  wide is far away, medium and then narrow. And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to
*  the TV mode. The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow. IR mode is only medium TV mode. So you can
*  actually get closer with narrow TV mode. It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode.
*  So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background to
*  a white background. He's trying to figure out what the heck is this? Well, yeah. And he wants to get
*  as much data as he can on it based on the different modes instead of just staring at it going, what is
*  that thing? Granted, the video has been out. It actually was on YouTube for years before the
*  government released it. It was leaked in 2007? No, I got a, the guy that was in my back seat
*  sent me an email and I had retired. So this is about, nope, because I was working down in San Diego.
*  So this is about 2008, early 2009. He sends me a link to strangeland.com, which is not suitable for
*  work. Oh yeah, it's top notch. And he says, hey, I can remember the email. Hey, Skip, does this look
*  familiar? And I look at it, I'm like, how the hell did that get on strangeland.com? So next thing you
*  know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube link to someone.
*  You don't send strangeland.com to someone because you don't know what you're going to get. It's like
*  Googling kittens. So it ends up there somehow. So it gets on YouTube, which was cool because
*  I would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they go, dude, what's the coolest thing you
*  ever saw flying? It's kind of like you were asking what it's like. And I go, oh dude, I chased a UFO
*  and they're like, get out. And I'm like, no, serious. So this is literally how it happened.
*  So I was sitting with my friend, Matt. So Matt and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the
*  A6 when I did my very first night trap. And we were friends to this day. Because when you do stuff
*  like people like that, I had to have faith in him, he had to have faith in me. They become like your
*  brother. And these are guys that literally, I don't talk to them on a regular basis like Chris,
*  who works at Apple. If Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help, I need this,
*  I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out and let's do it. Because they're like family. You do it
*  and most Navy guys, we don't send letters to each other weekly. I have friends that I haven't talked
*  to in 10 years that they showed up on my door, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit,
*  take about first 10 minutes to catch up. And then it's like old times and it's amazing how fast
*  it's happened. So I'm out to dinner with Matt and I'm telling him this story and he's like,
*  get out of here. So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco. Paco has fightersweep.com,
*  it's a blog site. So Paco's obsessed, he is way into UFOs. So Paco calls me up, he says, dude,
*  I was talking to Matty, that's what we call him. He goes, I was talking to Matty. He goes, dude,
*  you got to tell me this story. So I'm like, all right. So I spend a chunk of time. And so he calls
*  me one day and I'm like, I got to get a voicemail. Hey, give me a call. So I call him up and he
*  answers the phone, but I can hear people in the background and I go, hey dude, what's going on?
*  He goes, hang on, hang on, I got to put you on speakerphone. I go, what are you putting me on
*  speakerphone? He goes, you got to tell the story. I'm having a dinner party. You got to tell the
*  story. So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table
*  as I tell the Tic Tac story. So he calls me up again. He says, hey, I got this blog and he just
*  writes about fighter stuff. Like he wrote about that we call them the shit hot break. That's a guy
*  that when you're laying on a carrier comes and turns and gets ready to land really fast, like
*  breaks it off right at the back of the ship. And one of the guys, when we were junior officers on
*  the USS Ranger, one of the department heads of the other squadron is the guy, Nasty. And Nasty was
*  notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break. So he literally wrote a
*  thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there's another guy, our MAV was one of our landing
*  signals officers for the air wing. It's a good article on how this was and how it forms you in
*  naval aviation, it's kind of being part of the club. So he's like, I got to write about this thing.
*  I'm like, what are you guys, I got to write about it. I go, all right. I go, cause at first I would
*  say no. I'm like, dude, I don't want this out there. Just. You haven't really before then talked about
*  it much. My wife didn't even really know the whole story. Why? Just as a comment, is it just because
*  you caught some, uh, it was just, I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two
*  days. They played the goofy movies. There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that
*  they would put. It was like, first one was a far side. And the second one was me and the guy in my
*  back seat. And it was men in black, but it had our names, you know, protecting the protecting the
*  Nimitz battle group type stuff. It's just funny shit like that. Um, so to me, it wasn't that big
*  of a deal. It was like, okay, that's weird. We're never going to know what it was. I want to get out
*  cause this is important because there's all kinds of rumors. There's a group of folks there.
*  No one ever came out in suits to talk to us. Nobody looking like me came out on a, uh,
*  no, no one came out on a helicopter. No one came out on an airplane. You know, you get, oh, I,
*  I was told to turn over this classified. What's funny is all the CEOs and several of them are
*  still in the Navy. Uh, there's one that is a, he, I think he just finished up. He was a captain of
*  an aircraft carrier, you know, so he'll end up making Admiral and all that stuff. I don't, those
*  guys are all my friends. I talk to them daily. Just, just to clarify. So just for people who
*  don't know, there's a story that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton, uh, folks in a helicopter
*  landed. They showed up, they took the data quote unquote. So all the sort of recordings associated
*  with this incident and they took it and presumably deleted it. There's a kind of story to that. And
*  then, uh, from what I've seen, you said that you believe just like we're talking about offline,
*  the joke spread faster than, uh, or just rumors spread faster than anything on, on, on these ships,
*  uh, that it w it might've been a joke that started and, uh, well they did. So here's,
*  here's the joke. So they had come down, right? We had the tapes, um, and they were Chad's tapes.
*  So we use those tapes over and over again, you know, they're, they're consumable, but remember
*  I have a budget as a squadron, so I have a budget. So I have to buy those tapes. I have to,
*  all that stuff that we use, I'm accountable for. And the tapes are actually classified secret
*  because of the data that's on them. Okay. So we had the tapes. So the, the secure, the intelligence
*  guys, the Intel officers came down from what's called Civic, C-V-I-C, which is carrier Intel
*  center, came down and said, Hey, we need the tapes. These guys are going to come, they're going to
*  come and get them. So we're like, I'm like, oh, whatever. You know, so we hand them the tapes
*  and then someone, cause I have, you know, you know, people shortly after they came and got the
*  tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're, they're messing with you. They're playing a
*  joke. So I said, Oh, let's see how well that goes. Cause you know, I'm, I'm a CEO and they're not.
*  And so I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a lieutenant or a lieutenant JG. So he's
*  way junior to me. And I said, Hey, uh, I want my tapes back. And he looks at me and I go, I know
*  you guys are pulling my leg. I know you, there's no one came out and I go, and you have about 30
*  seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this place apart. That's literally what I told
*  him. And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not going to go
*  well. I said, cause it's bullshit and I need those tapes. Then he literally walked right over to a
*  filing cabinet and opened it up. They weren't in a safe. He opened up a filing cabinet and pulled
*  them out and handed them to me. I said, and I basically said a few things to him, like, don't
*  ever fuck with me again. And I left, I had the tapes. So this, no one came out. There's no flying
*  going on when all this is happening. And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes. So I
*  took two brand new eight mil tapes and I copied the sections that I want. So there's a rumor too,
*  that, Oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long. And there's some, one of these petty
*  officers is saying, Oh, I saw it. That's total crap. The original video is about a minute,
*  30 seconds long. What you see on the release video is the entire video.
*  So you have mentioned, uh, I apologize if I say stupid things, please correct me. But you,
*  you have mentioned that, uh, like on Rogan, I think that you watched it on, you know,
*  on a bigger screen and it felt like it was higher definition. So let me ask the question,
*  is there a higher definition version? Do you think of the FLIR video that would give us more pixels
*  and more information presumably because of the high number of-
*  I would doubt it. Cause I don't know where the stuff that the government released,
*  I don't know where they got it. Okay. So the stuff that was on Strangeland and YouTube,
*  you know, someone pulled off of a secret, it's, it looks like a rack, you know,
*  there's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard drive.
*  And they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube. Um, no, it's, it's just like,
*  you know, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's some quality.
*  It degrades.
*  So this, you don't know how many times this has been copied. So we were looking,
*  the videos I've seen are right off the original. They're high eight tapes. It's basically pulled
*  off the back of the display. So it's not filmed with cameras. It's literally a digital feed.
*  It's pulled off the back and put onto a high eight tape. That's how the recorders work.
*  Now it's actually digital to digital. It's not even on tapes anymore. They,
*  it's a digital recording system, but we were still in that process of slowly up because
*  originally we had little cameras here that shine. So if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.
*  So this is, it's a pretty good feed. Um, when you put it on somewhere,
*  instead of looking at it on your tiny little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at
*  it on a like a 19 inch cause it was still normal TVs back there. We had just put flat
*  screens in the ready room that I had bought so we could watch movies. So cause a nice huge
*  19 inch screen is maybe 20. It was a nice, wow. That's huge. It was gigantic. Um,
*  I can get for like 50 bucks and get like 60. This is 2005. Um, so,
*  so you look at it as big thing and, and you could see, so when you get to the TV mode,
*  when I say there's little things coming out of the bottom of it, you could see those.
*  It was very clear. But in terms of the actual visual on the tick tack, was it,
*  did you get much more information from the hired, from the clear little things out of the bottom
*  we didn't see the bottom of the mission. So when you see it, cause he's coming almost co-altitude
*  with it, you can see the bottom of it. It looks like little, you know, like if you look at a
*  session, there's a little antennas hanging out of the bottom, kind of like that. There was two
*  little things out of the bottom. There's nothing on the top. There was no plume, no IR, no, no
*  visible propulsions, even heat signature, you know, it's all that stuff. And then the other thing that
*  people didn't see is they didn't see the radar display, uh, which that, that really raises a
*  classification level, especially to see what the radar does when it's being jammed. Um, you know,
*  when I, matter of fact, when they did the unofficial official investigation and about 2000 and let me
*  think about 2009, um, I had gotten a call on my cell phone from a guy who government employee
*  and said, Hey, he told me who he was. He's still in the government. Um, I'm friends with him. And
*  he said, Hey, we're going to investigate your tick tack thing. This is literally five years later.
*  Yeah. Five years later. And I said, okay, whatever. And he did a pretty good job. I call it
*  the unofficial official report because, um, it was really never official. It wasn't, but I'll give
*  you the history of why I say that and why it never came out in FOIA requests. So he does the report.
*  He sent me the report and all he said is, Hey, I'm going to send you this report. Please don't
*  distribute this report. I said, okay, the report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George
*  Knapp and they were good enough to redact it, but there's a few versions of it unredacted. And I'm
*  very protective of the other people that were involved in this. So Jim has talked, but he's off
*  the grid. He doesn't talk to anyone now. The pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified,
*  but they don't release her name. Although people are starting to do it and she's had weird shit
*  happen around her house. She's got kids, you know, so I'm very protective of her. Um, and I've told
*  people like Jeremy and George, if I know that names ever came from you, I will never talk to you again
*  about this. And Jeremy's been really good about it. And so is George. And then, but George,
*  George knew the names were cause he had, he got the report from Senator Reid. Um, and then the
*  other crew. So the pilot of the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to
*  that individual, they really don't have the recollection. They were just out flying that
*  day and it wasn't a big deal. Um, so it's, it's you, you need to protect cause not everyone wants
*  people knocking. I don't want people knocking on my door and you know, and there's rumors. Oh,
*  you talk to everyone. I think you're about the 23rd person that I've talked to total. And that
*  includes, uh, you know, the, the newspapers and stuff. And I've been selective because there's so
*  much, I mean, if I turned down, like I turned down Russian TV, uh, I can give you her name when we're
*  done here. She called, she not only called me, she called my wife, she called my daughter, she called
*  my son and she called my son in law, um, because they're persistent. So I'm, I'm pretty protected.
*  I'm very particular. I mean, the reason I'm talking to you is cause I knew we would have
*  a conversation that wasn't based just on the Tic Tac and the incident, but we can actually talk
*  about some of the science and some of the theoretical to get into, to get more people
*  involved to go. Cause I think there's, you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or
*  Chris Mellon, you know, the group at TTSA, you know, that that whole thing was that's to the
*  stars, uh, Academy, that's the Tom DeLong group that got started. So, and you go, well, uh, you
*  know, cause I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he's actually, when you talk to him,
*  he's, he's, he's very smart. And I asked him, how'd you get into this? And he goes, oh, when I was
*  traveling around with blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of books when you're laying in a van as
*  you're driving to your next gig before you make it big. And he goes, and he read, he was reading
*  books and he read one of them on UFOs. I'm trying to think the title. It's one of the big ones.
*  It's out there real popular. And so he started just, he started asking more and through his
*  fame with blink 182 in the band, he got more and more connected. You know, if you talk to Chris Mellon,
*  who is an undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and he's part of the Mellon,
*  you know, dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, uh, very, very smart. He knows he, he,
*  he definitely knows how the government works because he worked there. Um, and so when I went
*  down to DC to talk to people, he's one of the first people I'll go to when I did, uh, Tucker Carlson,
*  about a month ago, month and a half ago. Um, I asked, I, I, he texted me, I, I texted him,
*  Tom Lou to go, Hey, cause they were like, you gotta do it. Cause I turned to, I had turned
*  Tucker down a couple of times before and his, uh, his producer had called me and I'm like, all right,
*  I'll do it. Cause those guys like, you gotta, you gotta do this for us. So from my perspective,
*  just to give you some context. So, um, to me, there seems to be some stigma. So I come from
*  the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today. And I think the people
*  who listen to this include, um, you know, uh, fact, fellow faculty at MIT and major universities,
*  and it feels like there's some stigma to the subject from, from the scientific community.
*  A lot of people, especially when they hear your story are like, wow, this is really interesting,
*  but you, you don't even know you one, you're afraid to talk about it.
*  And two, you don't know what the next steps are. Like how can we seriously try to think about
*  what you saw, how to think about how we further look for things like it, how we develop
*  systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data and try to
*  react, uh, properly, you know, try to communicate, try to, uh, interpret this
*  in the best way possible from the scientific perspective. And I, I just would love to remove
*  stigma from this subject. Uh, well, I think that's the first step we have done in this country,
*  an absolutely terrible job with these things. So you go, and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell.
*  So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer. That's
*  literally what came out. And then magically the next day it's a weather balloon and they're
*  showing your pieces of mylar. And you go, well, that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday.
*  Then you get into project blue book, you know, so there's that whole series about project blue book,
*  but the bottom line of project blue book is it really did two things. It investigated sightings
*  and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point where it actually went to
*  discredit, you know, to make you look. So there's always been this, uh, this, I don't know if you'd
*  call it an aura around it or a mystique about UFOs that if you're talking about them, they're nuts
*  with ours because I'm not a, I'm not a, you, I'm not a UFO guy. I'm not a junkie. If you ask me,
*  do I believe that there's life outside of earth? I would say you probably have a better chance of
*  winning the mega ball lottery than we're the only planet that has life on it in the universe. It's
*  just, the odds are against it. If you're, if you do just do the math, you have to accept
*  cause it, if there only has to be one other planet that has life on it and then I win and you lose.
*  And the more and more science is showing that there's habitable planets out there
*  that yeah, everything we've learned so far, we know very little, but everything we've learned so far
*  about the planets out there, exoplanets, uh, earth like planets, it seems that it's very likely that
*  there's life out there. Intelligent life is another topic, but, uh, life. Well, we, we as humans,
*  you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about us that says, ha ha,
*  we are it. And you go, not so much. Maybe we're not so intelligent. Um, because we are, it's just how
*  we learned. So, you know, our main mode of transportation and what people figured out,
*  you know, years ago was the internal combustion engine, which led us to jet engines and solid
*  rocket fuel. What if you're in another planet where you didn't, you figured out, uh, the ability
*  to create a gravity field or you used, you know, cause electromagnetics are becoming bigger and
*  bigger and bigger, you know, catapults on ships were steam powered and the new Gerald Ford is
*  electromagnetic rollercoaster used to use a chain to get you to the top of the hill. Now they shoot
*  you with electromagnetics and you're going. So there's a whole new realm of propulsion that,
*  you know, sometimes it's our ability to develop the technology to support theory.
*  You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently theories that Einstein had where people
*  actually joked about them. And now we actually have the technology to prove that gravity can
*  bend light. You know, we've proven that. So you look at that way and you go, well, does that mean
*  that, you know, 70 years ago, Einstein was wrong or eight years ago, Einstein was wrong? Or do you
*  go, we just didn't have the ability to look that deep into space to actually find something that
*  we could to actually measure. And, you know, and I've seen, and that's just a hundred years and
*  the kind of things that can happen in a few centuries. Look what we've done in the last 20
*  years. Yes. Crazy. Let me direct, cause it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective,
*  from a science perspective. You're, I mean, you've spoke, you've been brave in, you know,
*  telling your story, not some dramatic thing, but just telling the things you've seen.
*  Did it encounter that? Did it impact your career? Is that why more people haven't come out? Like
*  you've mentioned Roswell, like how, what advice do you give to people, to the community, to me as a
*  scientist for ways to go forward about this topic and still have a, you know, not being put in a bin
*  in society that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person. Mine is to get away from the little green
*  men. Just divorce the two little green men. And, you know, and I've talked to Lou Elizondo about
*  this, you know, and the group that they're working with, which is incredible. I mean, they've got
*  Steve justice who used to run skunk works where they built, you know, projects. Now, Louis,
*  as you mentioned, was a program director. He ran the program at the Pentagon and a tip was a program
*  that was tasked with investigating any kind of, uh, you'll follow as you APS. So what's funny is
*  the unofficial official report that I just joke about the guy who wrote the unofficial official
*  report was actually an original member of a tip and the original stuff that a tip did was for you
*  exempt. And people go, how do you know that? I go, cause I stood there with the memo in my hand that
*  said these are literally, I watched the DOD memo that said it and it was signed. So he was one.
*  So that's why the, that's why I call it the unofficial official report. It was never,
*  it was never releasable because people go, well, I put in a FOIA request and I didn't get that.
*  I go, well, just cause you put in a FOIA request and get it. I go, because how much,
*  how much time do you think that guy's going to spend to get you the information that you
*  requested if he can't find it? I actually got called by the Navy. I had a, uh, commander in
*  a Navy call me about, uh, right before the article came out in the New York times, it was, this was
*  starting to come back and she had called me cause there's been, there was a FOIA request for stuff
*  about the Nimitz incident. And I said, do you know of anything? She called me, she goes,
*  do you know of anything else besides the, the situation reports that come off the ship
*  in, you know, and you gotta remember when the situation report comes off the ship,
*  that's like third hand. So we tell someone, they tell someone that person has to write it up.
*  So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it. But then there's the unofficial official report.
*  That's actually pretty well written. There's some errors in it, but it was, you know, I didn't help
*  write it. I just did it. And he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who's who
*  in the zoo and the players. Um, so she called me and said, is there anything out there? And I said,
*  officially out there, she said, yes. I said, I don't know of anything. I knew of the unofficial
*  official report, which is that one, but I'm not, you know, if you don't know about it, I'm not
*  going to tell you cause that's not my job. And nor did I care. I mean, did in that whole situation,
*  you mentioned Lou, did you think about your impact to your career? Like just to get back
*  to the question, did you think others, other pilots, other thing, other people like in the
*  Roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing. Why aren't they talking about this? Why are people
*  afraid to talk about this? Well, honestly, the military and the press, there's a distrust. I'll
*  just tell you that right now. We typically don't like talking to the press because if I talk to
*  you, you know, especially when I do even the TV shows, you know, cause I've been on a couple of
*  shows, when you look at it, you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours. Yeah.
*  And then what you see on the screen is five minutes. Well, and the, and the other thing with
*  the press, let me give you my perspective from autonomous vehicles is the clipping happens. Yes.
*  But also the incompetence. Let me just call out journalists.
*  They're not thinking. I mean, so, so here's the thing I've, I have a PhD and I've taken
*  painfully too many classes from like physics and math. And I've also have a deep curiosity
*  about the world. I read a lot that seems to be missing with journalism. So you're talking to a
*  person who is not going to push the story forward in an interesting way, not the story, but the
*  actual investigation of, uh, perhaps one of the most amazing things that humans have witnessed in
*  history. Like you, it might've been nothing in what, who knows what you witnessed might've been
*  from a sort of debunking perspective might've been some kind of trick of mind. If you and others have
*  hallucinated something, it could be some simple explanation, but possibly it was a something
*  not of this world and to not do justice to this story from a scientific perspective,
*  it seems at best negligence. And so that's true for journalists. That's true for other scientists.
*  It's just a human nature. If we, if we can't, if we see something that we can't explain,
*  then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it's just me and you let it go away and you don't think
*  about it, you know, maybe it'll just, you know, it's, it's, you ignore it. Um, the other side is
*  the inquisitive mind that says, well, what was that? And I want to, I want to dig more into it,
*  you know, and if you, you, you look at it or you're going against the norm, um, you can get
*  ostracized, you know, and if you look at, you know, and Einstein's the perfect example. I mean,
*  when he started coming up with some of his theories, some of the top physicists in the world were like,
*  dude, you're, you're a nut job. And he's, he's literally proving them, but he didn't have,
*  you know, he proved them in theory, but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment to
*  prove his theory. There's a great book that I recommend people read called Proving Einstein
*  Right by Jim Gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do years after,
*  to try to experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with, uh, with his theories.
*  It's fascinating. But yes, at the time it's kind of crazy. What are you saying?
*  Yeah. If you look at it back at the time, don't we, we look at it now and go, well,
*  the guy was a walking genius and he was, but if you go back in time, when he was doing it,
*  it was like, what are you talking about? You know, and, but one of the challenges is
*  your eyewitness. One of the challenges is you're essentially an eyewitness account. Like we don't
*  have good data. We have very limited data of, um, of the incident that you've experienced.
*  So let me kind of dig in. Let me just ask some questions of, um, maybe just see if there's,
*  um, just to paint more and more of the picture. One, you kind of mentioned the tic tac shape.
*  Let's break apart two situations. One is the video. Let's look at the actual eye account,
*  the, the eyewitness account that you saw with your own eyes. What's the, what can you say about the
*  shape of the thing? Is there interesting aspects outside of the tic tac? Like, is there any
*  appendages? Is there, um, some texture to it that? No, smooth white tic tac. You know, we don't,
*  you don't see, there's no, no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows, no probes that we could
*  see. We don't notice, like I said, we don't see the little things on the bottom of it until we
*  see the video in the TV mode when it's zoomed in right before it's shortly, you kind of see
*  zoom in. You don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff that's out there. Um, but remember we're
*  looking at the original tape, so there's not, there's basically no degradation. But when you
*  saw your eyes, there's no kind of appendages. No, none. What about like somebody asked a lot of
*  people asked you questions. So, uh, I appreciate you spending your time here. Let me ask some of
*  them. Uh, did you, I mean, you chased it. So we flew close to it relatively speaking. Was there,
*  did you feel any wake like any, did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction,
*  like aerodynamically? No, nothing, nothing. So, uh, another aspect of it, there's an interesting
*  thing. You've developed a feel for, for objects in the air. Did you feel like it was surprised
*  by your arrival or did it, let me ask a few questions around it. So did you,
*  did it feel like the thing was surprised? Did it feel like it wanted to be seen
*  almost to show off its capability? Did, uh, and did it, what did it feel like relative to if you
*  were doing a, um, uh, an air fight against, uh, sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet?
*  So one, I think it, I think it knew we were there when we showed up. It's just, it's me. Uh, it's
*  kind of like an animal. If you've ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will look up
*  and if it sees you and you're on the other side of the field, it'll actually go no threat and it'll
*  start eating, you know, they don't put their tail up as you move closer to the deer. Then it goes,
*  oh, it's there and I'm going to react or I'm going to move. So as we were up high and it's
*  down doing whatever it was doing, um, you know, which I don't know, someone asked, what do you
*  think? I go, maybe it was communicating with something. I joked on good morning America.
*  Maybe it's like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek, you know, and I actually
*  use that clip. It was kind of funny, but yeah, we're a little human centric. We think like it
*  would, it'd show up to talk to us, but maybe he's talking to the dolphins. Yeah, it was to whatever,
*  you know, cause it was hanging around that white water and I don't know if it was there something
*  there. Was there a seamount? We just didn't find it again. I don't know. But once we started to
*  descend and it actually reorient its longitudinal axis and it started mirroring us coming up, then
*  it was obviously where we were there and it was really coming up just, you know, you figure out
*  I'm at 20 and it's coming up and it ends up getting up to 12, uh, where I cut across the circle.
*  I think it was very aware that we were there because it interacted. We call it a two circle
*  fight when you're fighting another airplane. Um, but, uh, you know, was it, was, were we afraid?
*  I don't think so. I mean, and to me, it was more curious. Curiosity overcomes any fear that you
*  would have. And I always felt to be honest, if I was inside the airplane, uh, especially as long,
*  as much time as I'd spent inside the airplane, flying and doing stuff, I felt totally, it was
*  like a safe zone. I mean, I felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most, you can't,
*  if you're in the airplane and you feel scared, it's not the job for you. You have to feel that
*  because the airplane is part of you now. You know, I am inside, I have the stick,
*  I have the throttles, I've got my wizard in the back seat. He's running all the displays.
*  We are a team. We're in the state of the art airplane, you know, brand new. You feel pretty
*  good. And then you get something that, you know, can climb from the surface up and then accelerate
*  like it did, like it was like no big deal. You know, for an airplane, if you just put me from a
*  Stancil, let's just say slow flight, just get me at a hundred knots above the water. And for me,
*  you can't just start a climb. I'd have to lower the nose. I'd have to accelerate and then I'd have
*  to start coming up. And this thing just like, just did it like it was like no big deal.
*  Yeah. You mentioned that like kind of your reaction to it was like, it's something that you would love
*  to fly almost. So this object, just the curiosity you experience is like, like what it almost like,
*  what the heck is that piece of technology? And I want to fly it. Like what made you
*  feel like it's something that you could fly? Do you think it's something that a human could fly?
*  Like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology,
*  there's another perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing.
*  And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like,
*  I don't think it was a projection. I think it was a real object.
*  It was a physical hard object that could be fly.
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. I think all four of us will take the same thing. It wasn't, this was not
*  because you go, okay, let's just go on a, it's a light projection.
*  Well, if we were both sitting next to each other, we were looking at it from the exact same angle
*  and all that. And I go, okay, there's a, in theory you could have that, but with an 8,000 foot altitude
*  difference flying, you know, and they're, you know, she's probably not directly above me. She's kind
*  of hanging out watching this whole thing happen. You know, you're getting two different perspectives
*  from two different altitudes over a clear blue, you know, if you've ever been at sea, and I don't
*  mean like coastal, I mean like when you get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest. It's incredible.
*  You know, you got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean. You got pretty high contrast.
*  And for this thing just to disappear, it's, it's wasn't, I'm telling you, I would, I mean, I know
*  we all have the same recollection of what happened. You know, there's some details because
*  it's so long ago, but for the most part, we know what we saw and we all came back and looked at
*  each other like, what the hell was that? What if, I mean, do you think about the thing under the
*  water that's not often talked about if there's something under the water, couldn't have been
*  something gigantic? It could be. What, like do you ever see this big ship? I mean, that's why as a
*  person, so I love like swimming out into the ocean, my mom's an Olympic swimmer. So like,
*  I love that feeling, but I'm also terrified when I swim because the abyss, it could, anything could
*  be under there. Like there's not enough focus on that perhaps because there's no visibility,
*  but is it, is there anything interesting to say about the possibility that was anything
*  underneath there? Could be. I mean, think about it. If you're going to hide on this planet,
*  what's the least explored spot on the planet? Two thirds of it's the ocean.
*  You, there's, there's, there's literally, I mean, come on the Malaysia airplane, the triple seven,
*  it was a triple seven that crashed, you know, they turned, they didn't go where they're supposed to
*  and they just disappeared and they've been searching for it and they found pieces of it.
*  But you would think there's large objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water,
*  depending on how it broke up, there's big pieces that would be, you'd find something,
*  they haven't found anything except what floated. So to hide something under water, I think would be
*  easy. So, okay, let's go a little bit in speculation land, but it's the best,
*  it's the best we can do, which is the basic question of what do you think was it?
*  So if you had to put money on it, is it, uh, like advanced human created technology? Is it alien
*  technology? Is it an unknown physical phenomena? You know, like a ball lightning, for example,
*  there's a lot of fascinating things we probably humans don't really understand. Is it, uh,
*  like I said, some perception cognition that led you, uh, some kind of hallucination that
*  made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing. Let me put those things on the table.
*  Or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like, uh, like an ice cloud or something
*  like that? What do you think it was? Oh, it's definitely, I don't think it's an ice cloud
*  because ice clouds don't fly around and react to you. Uh, do I think it was a light? I'd say no,
*  because of the aspects and what we looked and watched it do. I'd say no. What do you mean?
*  Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception, you know, there's, uh, their
*  experience like plasma. You can do plasma and you can go, oh, I can see it, but it's really not,
*  you know, it's plasma. Uh, I don't think so. Um, so you would see distortions, I think, is it move?
*  Maybe not. I mean, I'm not the theoretical physicist and some, you know, you know, I'm not
*  an MIT, uh, I would say no, I mean, it looked for, from all my experience and, and I quite a bit of
*  it when this happened. No, I think it was a, it was a hard object. It be, it was aware that we
*  were there. It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do
*  something exactly what I would do, you know, it mirrored me. It wasn't aggressive, you know,
*  there's taco, it flopped behind us and never, it was never offensive on us. It never did that. It
*  just mirrored us. So as we're coming down, it's just like, you know, you're, you're kind of,
*  you know, you said you do martial arts, you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out on the
*  when they get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, because my roommate in
*  college was a collegiate wrestler. So I de facto became a wrestler because he beat me up every
*  night. We joke, I talked to him literally probably three, four times a week. Um, but you know, you
*  see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of, you're kind of feeling each other as you walk,
*  and boxers do the same thing. It was doing that same thing. It's like, what's going on as it comes
*  around, as it comes around. And then it was like, Hey, we're going to get here. And then when I got
*  too close to it, you know, it decided I'm out of here. And then it, it did something that we
*  have never seen. The other question is, what if I didn't cut across the circle? What if I just
*  kept going around a circle? We'll just keep going. I could have just watched it. I mean, my one regret
*  out of the whole thing is, uh, we have a camera in our helmet and the joint helmet, there's a little
*  camera, but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch. Cause you've ever put a GoPro on someone's
*  head where they're looking around like this all the time, it'll, it'll nauseate you. So we never
*  turn that on and all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do is reach down and hit the switch,
*  you know, and then we didn't go back and cause our tapes didn't have anything. Cause we didn't get
*  it on radar. Um, because I tried to lock it up because I can move the radar with my head,
*  but I couldn't, it wouldn't lock the radar, wouldn't lock. And so,
*  so then the question is, and this is unanswerable, but let's try to get some hints at it.
*  Do you think it's human, like advanced human created technology that's simply top secret that
*  was just not aware of, or is it not something not of this world?
*  So you, if you'd asked me in 2004, I just said, I don't know. If you ask me now,
*  so we're coming up on 16 years ago for a technology like that, you know, and let's assume that it
*  didn't have a conventional propulsion system in it. Cause I don't think it did. Uh,
*  I would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds from
*  what we normally do, then it would start coming out. But to hide something like that for 16 years,
*  you know, and I understand, uh, you know, and I don't speak for the United States government,
*  I never will speak for the United States government, but I understand how some of that
*  stuff works for classification levels and why we classify stuff, you know, is it,
*  is it detrimental to national defense? But there's a point where you have to look and go,
*  if we had a technology like this that could literally change the way
*  change the way mankind travels, uh, how we get things into space, our ability to do things,
*  you know, you talk about, you know, are we going to go to Mars? Well, if you have something that
*  has the ability to go, cause remember these things were coming down when the cruiser tractor from
*  above 80,000 feet, which is space and they would come down and they would come straight down,
*  they'd hang out at like 20,000 feet. And then three or four hours later, they'd go back up.
*  We don't have anything that can come down, hang out in once, you know, and I'm talking
*  hold out in a spot. Well, we all know there's winds. They're not drifting like a balloon.
*  They're just sitting there and then they would go back up and they tracked up to the, when I talked
*  to the controller, he's like, we've seen up to 10 of these things. There's other guys and it was
*  raining and all this other, let's just say they tracked a groups of these things coming down,
*  hanging out and going up. So it's not just propulsion and the way it moves. It's also fuel.
*  Everything. So the whole of it indicates a kind of technology that's highly advanced,
*  but you don't think in your sense that you actually don't know, but you know more than
*  a lot of people in your sense, the top secret military technology, if you think about skunk
*  works, if you think about like that, it cannot be more than 15 years ahead.
*  I would say for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117.
*  Because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out, like it was developed at this time.
*  It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government.
*  What's the 117?
*  That's the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter, not the B-2, but the stealth fighter. So
*  if you look at that, you know, yeah, you can, I think you can hide things for a while,
*  but I think a technology, a leap, I mean, this is not, this is not a, hey, we developed this and
*  we're kind of pushing the edge of technology. This is a giant leap in technology. You know,
*  and the other one is do we have the basis to do that? You know, because usually when you have a
*  technology like that, universities, especially the one you're working at, MIT, a lot of the leading
*  edge stuff is coming out of the top tier universities. You know, so you've got MIT,
*  you've got Caltech, you've got Stanford, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon,
*  I'm just naming schools. Naval postgraduate school is another one. There's usually indicators,
*  there's papers of, hey, this is where we're going. I don't think there's a whole bunch of
*  papers on developing a gravity-based propulsion system that literally, I've got an object,
*  because how do you, how much power would it cost to create a gravity field of your own that could
*  actually be strong enough to counter the giant orb that we live on? So by the way, you mentioned
*  gravity-based, that's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of, like what kind of
*  propulsion would have to, would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement. To
*  me, all the gravity discussions just seems insane from a physics perspective, but of course,
*  it would seem insane until it's not. But- Because remember, we only know what we know.
*  Yeah. And which is very little. And someone has to think out of the box to go,
*  is this possible at all? Yeah. Well, okay. So this, so you're saying that if you had to bet money,
*  all your money, it would be something that's alien technology. So it's not human created technology.
*  Well, I don't like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don't, I don't think we've
*  developed it. I don't think we've developed it. I just, you know, because the other one, someone
*  had asked me, they said, what if there wasn't, maybe it was just a drone, maybe it was a UAV
*  that got sent here from someplace else. I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around.
*  So I don't, I don't know. I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains
*  that think this stuff up. I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them. But-
*  Which topic? Which you mean the, for drones? For-
*  Just space travel technology. Because if you look at where we're going, you know,
*  cause everyone talks about Mars. You're okay. And you know, we're, hey, we're going to be able
*  to colonize, you know, and I know Elon is big into that. You know, he says-
*  Yeah. What do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA? We put humans back up, back up there.
*  My theory, so it's funny because I know one of the guys that was, he was, he was one of the
*  original employees at SpaceX. He's a friend of mine and I won't say his name, but he knows Elon.
*  He knows Elon and he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project. He's one of the lead
*  guys on that. So he's got some great, as a matter of fact, he's, there's a movie, there's a book
*  coming out that comes out in about a year on this, the original, the first years of space,
*  first six years of SpaceX, you know, and he's named in the book, you know, and they're supposed
*  to make a movie on it. So I'm like, Hey, who's going to play it? But what he's done to me,
*  it changed the game. And here's why, because I said, you know, in, I think it was 62 and Eisenhower
*  warned of the industrial defense complex, you know, which it has become everything he warned us of,
*  you know, it has become, and it's really driven by, there's the big three in defense, which is
*  really, you know, Northrop, Lockheed and Boeing. Those are the big, those are your big, you see,
*  Raytheon's kind of right, like a subset of that, but they're Raytheon's pretty big too. But in US
*  defense, those are the big guys, right? That's actually where a lot of military guys go when
*  they retire, they go do stuff like that. So when you look at that and you go in the way
*  government contracting is working and how we charge and, you know, why things cost so much,
*  and then you go, you got Elon, who's got an ego, you know, and he doesn't like to do things certain
*  way. And I've talked to the guy that worked there on, you know, because the government likes to have
*  oversight of contracts where he was like, no, just tell me what you want, I'll build it and I'll
*  give you a bill when it's done. And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money
*  because he's money driven guy, which I like capitalism at its best. So now you look at the
*  two things. So you got the SpaceX, which is the dragon capsule, right? And then you've got Boeing.
*  So Elon did what Boeing has contracted to do in less time for half the money. And oh, by the way,
*  because he can reuse the boosters because they come back and land and you don't have to like
*  Morton Tycol, we've reused them on the space shuttle, but they had to take them all apart
*  and do a bunch of stuff because they landed in saltwater and then you had to put them all back
*  together where Elon gets them down. Cause I was joking with this guy. What do they do? Do they like
*  re haul over home? He goes, no, actually they clean them up and they can use them again.
*  They're reusable systems, incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here's
*  a private company. So being able to put people on and the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean,
*  it's literally like sci-fi when you watch when they went up. So I'm a huge fan of what he and
*  his company has been able to do because you know, the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money
*  to the Russian government, you know, and oh, by the way, if you didn't know, cause I have some
*  friends that are astronauts, uh, they all have to learn Russian, right? They have to, and they have
*  to do it's what level five where the test is a phone call where they call you up and they,
*  you know, cause they would go. So I went to the pinning and two, two friends of mine,
*  the one actually had a mission date. The one got one later. So it's cool when you're watching your
*  friends doing a spacewalk, you know, cause I would pull up because if I knew what was going on,
*  I pull up the NASA thing. I was in a meeting one day and I've got NASA on and, and makers out
*  there floating around, you know, doing his stuff. And I saw one, he's in the space station while
*  they're doing a spacewalk. So it's kind of cool when you go, oh yeah, I know that dude. He's up
*  there in space floating around. Um, so when you, when you look at what those they're capable of
*  doing and then you go, what Elon is bringing to the fact that now it's back in America.
*  It's actually, to me it's, it's cost effective for us to be able to do more stuff. I think it
*  opens the door to do we go back to the moon? Is there a reason to go back to the moon?
*  Personally, I think if we're going to, if they're really going to go, you know, in years from now,
*  go to Mars, I think that the moon is the stepping stone to go back to start proving some of the
*  technology to go, Hey, we can build this. We can get on the moon and now we can get back off the
*  moon. Uh, because we did this on a less than a compact computer in the sixties, which is the
*  whole reason that I flew. Cause I'm obsessed. Matter of fact, I have the giant Lego Apollo at home
*  and the lander. And I have one that my dad built me in 1969 right after that.
*  And Neil Armstrong's an Ohio boy. And so am I. Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a car
*  in Wapakoneta, Ohio at the parade after he walked on the moon. Cause his parents didn't live far
*  from my aunt and uncle in Wapakoneta and they were out at the parade. So I've been obsessed with this
*  since I was a child. Do you hope to, uh, do you think, do you hope that you'll go out the,
*  the space one day? Me, if they, if I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second, you know,
*  I am not, I mean, that's one of the hopes of the commercial space flight is that,
*  you know, uh, like people like, I mean, it would be to us tourism, but you certainly wouldn't want
*  to in terms of, you're not kind of a civilian, right? I mean, in a sense that you're just a
*  normal person. You're not a fighter pilot currently, but it seems like if we send a civilian
*  up, there would be somebody like you in the next like 20 years. I'd be, you know, if Elon wants to
*  throw me on one of those things, I'd be all over it. I don't know what my wife would say, but you
*  know, sometimes you gotta, you gotta get your kicks while you're alive. I'd love to hear that
*  discussion with your wife. Listen, there's the pros and cons. Uh, she's, she's, I mean,
*  I've known her since high school, so she, yeah, she knows how I am. You know, most people that
*  know me are like, yeah, you're pretty much the same person you were in high school. You know,
*  I was a class clown and I still am that way. Um, so let me ask you this question about, so I'm
*  talking to you on again soon. I'm curious to get your perspective on it. If I wanted to talk to
*  him about tic tac, about these weird out there propulsion ideas, which are obviously just like
*  you said, if there's something to it, if it can be investigated somehow, it would be extremely useful
*  for us to understand in the effort of developing propulsion systems that can get us cheaply to
*  out the space. What, what should Elon think about the stuff? What should he do? What should people
*  like him? I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of, uh, take the next
*  step and go, you know, we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid or whatever we do,
*  but it's, it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust.
*  Just really in layman's terms, you know, we can get into what, but that's what it does. Um,
*  if you have something that you can contain that is a, is a fuel source that would last a significant
*  amount of time, you know, those rocket boosters go and when they're done, they're done. There's
*  enough to get them back down. That's it. There's not a huge, you know, not coming back and go,
*  well, I still got three quarters of a tank. Let's bolt them on and do it again. His system's not
*  doing that. Um, but you know, the way, the way contracting, especially in the government,
*  the government has tons of money, but you got to remember the government has to justify how
*  they spend our tax dollars for the most part. There's times where they can hide money in the
*  budget to get stuff done. But then when you look at, and I'm just going to throw a few out there,
*  but if you look at, uh, what Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you've got Elon, um, there's
*  some, there's some big money out there. I mean, you're talking, you know, Bezos alone could buy
*  companies like big companies, Apple's another one. These companies that huge, huge amounts of money
*  and then just go over to the Gates foundation and they've got gazillions and gazillions of dollars.
*  We've got universities. There's so much money out there. If we really wanted to do it,
*  aside from what the government wants to do, because we do live in a free society,
*  I think there's enough to go, how do we do this? And because when you work outside of what the
*  government would want to do, let's, so let's not, we're not working on this necessarily for the
*  United States. Although I am a huge giant. I will be American. I would never, yeah, I am an American.
*  You're talking to somebody born in the Soviet. I can't believe you agreed to this. Um, but,
*  but when I, you know, haven't killed me yet.
*  Yeah, well you're here. And you've been here for a while. No, no, no, I'm joking. I mean,
*  American citizen. I'm actually pretty much American. But see, when you do that, so you look at,
*  let's just look at American universities. Yeah. So there's some brilliant minds and we'll just use
*  MIT because you work down there. There's some brilliant minds, but there's a huge chunk of those
*  brilliant minds that are not American citizens. So if you want to get into government stuff and
*  you are not an American citizen, it gets really, really, really hard. But if I take money like
*  Bezos money, Elon money, and they, let's just say they want to work together. They can split it up
*  50 50, the two of them when the technology gets developed, but now I'm not constrained by who has
*  to do the work. I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because
*  technology is technology. And if it gets developed and gets over to where, you know,
*  a country gets ahold of it and then just basically uses it for their own, because you save them all
*  the research time. You don't want to do that. But if we can get to the point where we can do,
*  we do it on the international space station. We realized that space was too expensive for one
*  country to do alone. So we made the international space station and we have a conglomerate. It's
*  the one thing that the Russians and the US actually work together on. Think about it. That's it. We
*  work together on space because we realize it's way too expensive for us to do alone and effective.
*  So we've got this thing that's been out there floating around for God. Now, what is it? Like
*  20 years that things been up there floating around. So it's getting old. We're going to have to
*  replace parts and do stuff. But if we can pull the money together and come up with a something that
*  would literally change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing
*  of exploring. Because if you develop that technology, I'm not, you don't even have to send a man person.
*  If you can develop a technology that's so and with our automation and we're progressing in our
*  competing power to send something out that's not just floating around when you know that
*  can react a lot quicker, something that could actually go down to the surface and come back
*  up. So right now everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and it just sends data back.
*  You get an analyzer. But if I've got a technology that can go up there really quick, I'm not worried
*  about man. I don't have life support systems and all that, but it can go down. It can go. It can
*  cruise around. It can hover above. It can take samples and it can actually take Martian soil
*  and then bring it back. So we can analyze it here. That's a game changer. It's a complete game changer
*  because it opens up all the planets. Exactly. So in the sense that the Tic Tac is a symbol.
*  So whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective, there's a non-zero probability
*  that it's alien technology. And in that sense, it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason to,
*  like you said, widen the aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking outside the box.
*  Like it's almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion. We can overcome physics in an order
*  of magnitude better way. And it's worthwhile to try. I think, and I don't think the money,
*  if you look at a big picture with the amount of money, some of that's out there floating around
*  these private companies, I think if you said, hey, I've got, let's just say a hundred million
*  dollars, which really a hundred million dollars relative to Bezos has got what? A hundred and
*  some billion dollars in that work. So if he said, a hundred million dollars, you drop a hundred
*  million dollars and I go, and I'm going to put a, like the government will send a broad area
*  announcement out that says, hey, we're looking for this technology or a DARPA program. But what
*  if I just said, hey, who's to stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own to say, hey,
*  I want to go pool universities because they have fewer restrictions because it's not tax dollars.
*  They don't have the checks and bounds. They can do whatever they want. So their money, oh, sorry
*  about that, to go, hey, I'm going to put this out and I'm going to get the best physicists that are
*  working at CERN, that are at MIT, that are at Caltech at the schools I mentioned. And, oh,
*  by the way, a few of these guys are propulsion experts and I'm going to basically, I'm going to
*  fund you guys for 10 years. So you get $10 million a year and I'm going to give you your salaries and
*  we're going to do that or whatever the amount works. So let's cut it down to five so we can pay you
*  well, right? To do the research. But, oh, by the way, the research is, it's not classified,
*  but it's controlled. So we're not going to publicly just put this out in journals. But if we make a
*  leap that we think would advance, because although those, let's say there's 10 of them, those 10
*  scientists come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be another, a number 11
*  at another university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea and now you can
*  get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the mindset. Because we have a tendency to,
*  we evolve the stuff that we create, but it's like I was joking because I know a ton of guys with PhDs
*  and girls. And I said, but you know, how much, when a person gets a PhD in like engineering,
*  how much new math is really being done? I said, there's a handful of people in the world that are
*  really doing, I'm talking, I'm talking Stephen Hawkins type brilliance that is going, I'm really
*  doing something that's totally different. That's a big dramatic thing now going on in physics that
*  everybody's converse towards this local minima or local maximum, whatever you think about it. And
*  it's, it's again, same as with the Tic Tac, thinking outside the box is not,
*  is not accepted and it probably should be. But it's hard because if you go back,
*  go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was the, he was out of the box. He did not think the
*  norm. That's true genius. Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories,
*  where would we be? Okay, we're jumping around a little bit. So we talked a little bit about
*  Elon and Mars and space, but let's, let's, let me jump back to a few questions that folks had.
*  I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual idea, not the
*  actual facts of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers
*  hurts my heart a little bit because people are just talking past each other. But let me kind of
*  bring it up. Mick West, I've just recently started pay attention just in preparing to talk to you
*  about this world. And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career
*  out of trying to debunk. Sort of he's a, his natural approach to all situations is that of a
*  skeptic. I think it's, it's very useful and powerful, especially for me coming from a scientific
*  perspective to take the approach he does. It's valuable. And I think no matter what,
*  I think there's, I hope that people quote unquote, true believers are a little bit more open-minded
*  to the work of Mick West. I think it's quite useful and brilliant work. So let me ask,
*  he has a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible other explanations
*  of the things that were out there. He has some explanations of the things that you've seen
*  with the Tic Tac, like with your own eyes. Like he says that it's possible that you miscalculated
*  the size and the distance of the thing and so on when you were flying around.
*  I don't fight that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that.
*  No, let me do it right now. So, cause that comes up. Like how, how did you know it was about 40
*  feet long? I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like.
*  You know, I've looked down on things. So if I know, I know here's the known things. I know
*  when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish right around there. So when I look down,
*  I know what a hornet looks like looking down on them. Cause I've done it for all those years.
*  I mean, I got a good idea. So that's, that's why I said 40 feet, cause it's about hornet size.
*  So, and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge
*  distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you know,
*  so I would argue the fact of, you know, pure experience. There's, you know, professional
*  observers, which is what we're actually trained to do. And having done it for so long, no, it was,
*  and everyone came back with the same thing. They're like, yeah, it's about the size of a hornet.
*  From a human factors perspective, how often in your experience of those 16 years,
*  do you find that eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things. So like,
*  how often do you make mistakes with vision? You actually, you make vision issues a lot because
*  you're, and the sad part is your brain believes what your eyes see. We are actually trained to do
*  the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly, because your brain and eyes
*  can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instruments. Let's go back to landing at night. So
*  your eyes- How do you do that? Yeah, land at night, bat, just go- Your eyes assume that the runway
*  and your brain assumes that the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving. So if I
*  try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time. Well, not every time, but you die close to
*  every time trying to land on a boat. So we actually use instruments, which are counter
*  to your brain. So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training.
*  They have this thing, I think they still use it. It's called the MSDD multi-spatial disorientation
*  device or the spin and puke. It looks like a giant carousel and you're in these little modules. And
*  when you get out, you think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make yourself think
*  that I'm descending or climbing, but you're actually only going around in circles at a very
*  slow rate, as fast as a human can talk. But as they spin you around in a little sub thing
*  and slow it down and speed it up, your body does this. And you, you know, and then by visuals of
*  showing you like they can spin it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that
*  are, they can make the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity. They can move
*  the other way and you'll think you're screaming. You see it in amusement parks all the time.
*  You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing, you're sitting
*  there. So we get trained on all that stuff. So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well,
*  you're, you're disoriented or this, I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not because,
*  you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic Tac, I've got a heads up
*  display that tells me what my airplane's doing. So I've got, I know what I'm doing. I can look
*  outside. I've got a sense of what I'm doing, but I'm also looking inside to cross check of what I'm
*  seeing is in reality, what I'm doing. You actually, your brain gotten good at combining almost
*  adding extra sensory information. You have to, you have like supervision. So you're combining
*  what you're seeing and adjusting what the sensors, what you call them, the instruments are giving you.
*  And that, that in turn, it's a loop that adjusts the perception system that like,
*  that, that adjusts your brain's interpretation of what you're saying.
*  You'd be amazed at how good. So here's, here's another example. So if we go out over the water,
*  so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight. So when we fight, you know, two airplanes,
*  we're going to dog fight. As an instructor, and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come
*  back and you have to recreate it. So we call it drawing arrows. So you have to recreate that stuff.
*  So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right,
*  we're starting heading due east. And I know where the sun is at because in the short couple of
*  minutes that we're going to fight, the sun's really not going to move much. It's going to be
*  in a relative zone. I know that the sun is at, you know, let's just say one nine five degrees.
*  Right. So I'm starting going east and it's actually be down off my right hand side.
*  So now I know as I'm fighting, cause in the water, you don't have any reference like,
*  oh, I pass land, I pass light. No, you don't. And you can't use clouds cause clouds do move,
*  but you got to come back. Cause you go, here's where I started. And then you, when, as soon as
*  you end, you go, all right, I ended heading three five five. And then you recreate the turns and the
*  amount of turns and use the sun relative. So you can create this entire battle that went on with
*  arrows so that you can come back and debrief the guy that you were teaching on exactly what happened.
*  And you get really, really good at that. So when you come up and go, well, Dave, how do you know
*  you were at six o'clock? And you went around and he came up here. I go, because I'm trained to do
*  all that. And I take all the notes, why I'm flying. You can do it. But usually it's you memorize it
*  all and you get done. And then you read you, as soon as you're done, you knock it off, you look at
*  the other airplane, you get set and you start writing all your notes down. Yeah. And you're
*  writing it really fast on your cart and you go out of the stack of cards and you stick the new one
*  on your knee board card. So you're ready to go and here's the next setup. It's kind of, it's in some
*  way similar to what, like at the, at the highest level chess players do. I mean, you're, I mean,
*  they, they, they recap the games, but the, the richness of the representation that they use
*  and remembering like how the games evolved. It's not like it's much richer than the actual moves.
*  It's like these, a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words, like, like all the richness of
*  thinking they have about the way the game evolved. It's more like instinctual from years and years of
*  experience. So they try to put it into words, but they really can't. It's, it's just,
*  I understand that it's because for us, if we don't come back with anything, then there's no learning
*  to be had. Cause the whole thing is the debrief. When we get back and we talk about that's really
*  where their learning is. And it's the same thing. If you want to go back to chess, you know, when
*  you start off, you try and learn because you're remembering what you're doing. If you play against
*  someone, I'm always a big place play with someone better than you. That's how you learn. If you're
*  constantly beating people, you're not learning anything. You're just learning that they're not
*  good and you're better. When you, when you challenge yourself against someone that is going to,
*  is better than you, you learn. So I learned how to fight an airplane with, he's actually one of my
*  best friends. We'll call him Tom. I won't give his call sign cause I don't know what he wants to say.
*  So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight because Tom had just left Top Gun. He was the,
*  the training officer at Top Gun, which, so that's the guy, the training officer is the main guy at
*  Top Gun. So Tom was the training officer at Top Gun. So Tom, when I learned, cause I had come out
*  of A6 and we really don't fight cause it was a bomber. So I get in F-18s and I want to learn how
*  to fight cause it's a whole other side of the mission. It's the F and F fighter attack. The F-A-18
*  is fighter attack. So I had to learn how to fight. So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the
*  world who's going to teach me how to do it. And he did. And I would do something and then he would
*  go, I'd get to a situation where I had never been. And then I would go, well, I'm going to do this.
*  And then he would destroy me and he would come back and go, here's why you don't do that. And
*  then I would take that knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks. And over time,
*  cause you don't, no one walks out into that world. I don't care how gifted of an aviator and go, I,
*  I am the man or the woman. I am it. No, it's a learning process.
*  And so over all those years, you've gotten good. So I mean,
*  so what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the tic tac low zero.
*  Well, I mean, I'm not zero. So maybe even 90. I am 99.9%. So 0.1% my eyes deceive me, but remember
*  if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people. So the percentage is even lower.
*  Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't find that a particular debunking case that you saw, but I'm glad you
*  put it, you, um, you said those words out loud. So for me, from our perspective, uh, coming into
*  this world and looking at it, I'm a little bit more skeptical. Uh, so your eye account, I think
*  is the most fascinating story. And that, uh, I think, uh, that's inspiring to me and should
*  be inspiring to a lot of scientists out there. They should, uh, on so many levels, just like
*  we said, on the engineering level, that maybe there's propulsion systems where we can actually
*  build it can do some crazy, amazing stuff. So it's at the very least intriguing and at the
*  best inspiring. I just want to say that, but on the video side, it's like, it's, uh, the videos
*  for the Flir video, the go fast and the gimbal video, they are only interesting to me, to me
*  in the context of your story. Like without that, they're kind of low resolution. It's like,
*  it, it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical. So this is just where I'm coming from.
*  Maybe you can convince me otherwise, but so to bring up make West one more time,
*  he looks at the Flir video and he says that one of the most amazing video, uh, parts of the Flir
*  video for people who haven't seen it is at the end of it. Uh, the, the, the tick tack flies or appears
*  to fly very quickly to the left off the screen, off the screen. And what make West says is, uh,
*  that it, you know, make West probably others that the way to explain that is the tracking system.
*  Like we said, it's vision based tracking simply loses the, uh, like the object, the tracking
*  loses it. And so it simply allows the object to, uh, float off screen because it's no longer
*  tracking it. So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video looking at your face.
*  You do not. So can you maybe comment to that, uh, to that debunking, uh, uh,
*  sure. So, um, it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system.
*  No, for sure. And that's like me going, cause I'm a big formula one fan, you know, that's like me
*  going, Oh my God, Lewis, what were you doing? You could have done this with the car and you'd have
*  won the race. You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two
*  time. He's four time, four or five time world champion. But, um, that would be pretty stupid
*  to me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car. Um, or as a matter of fact, anyone driving
*  a formula one car. So I can't tell you how many times I've watched. You gotta remember when we
*  looked at this thing, when, when, when Chad came back with the video, we sat there and watched it.
*  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all right, right.
*  All right. Let's look at this. Um, you know, because you can look and see where the, you can
*  see where the airplane's going. You can see if it's looking left or right. And if you actually watch
*  all that stuff, it doesn't do that. It actually, when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the
*  tracking gate starts to open up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they
*  built the pod. The tracking gate will start to open up and, and, but the thing when it leaves so
*  fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough. It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing
*  can move around. Cause there's another theory that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod
*  passes underneath the airplane. So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this,
*  the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off and it'll, it'll, it swaps ends
*  because it has, you know, it's a gimbal. It can't just, it's not free floating. Um, but there's a
*  theory on one of them, Oh, it's here and it flipped over. It doesn't do that when it's looking out in
*  front. It stays like this. So yet another, another debunker who doesn't know this. So, you know,
*  and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos, like one of them,
*  the go fast as a bird and Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because
*  the he's on, he's on black hot. So the white object is actually colder than the ocean. Um,
*  that's flying while birds aren't colder than the ocean, they'd be dead. So the gimbal video to
*  comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the apparent rotation of the object.
*  It's something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of. And, uh, make West
*  suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain. No, cause what Mick West doesn't see
*  is so when they take, cause I've talked to the, uh, one of them actually I work with, so I know him,
*  I know I talk to him all the time. So, uh, and it's his best friend actually shot the video,
*  one of his best friends. The gimbal video, the gimbal video, both of them, the go fast and the
*  gimbal were shot by the same person. Okay. So, uh, and they were in each other's wedding. So
*  that's how well they know each other. Okay. So what you don't see is so the airplanes,
*  their clients still super Hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new phased array radar
*  that's made by Raytheon things. Incredible. Okay. It doesn't usually if it's, if it's out there and
*  it sees it, it's real. So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing
*  stuff and then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there. Well, the targeting
*  pod, if there's heat signature and you go, Hey, dot heat signature, something's there. It's real.
*  It's not, you're not picking up some extraneous things. So what you see in the gimbal video
*  of the thing and it rotates and you go, Holy shit, look at that thing. It's just sitting there and
*  it's in the wind and it's going against the wind. Why it's doing this, you know, someone goes,
*  Oh, it's an airplane. Now, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change
*  aspect because it's in a turn. This thing doesn't change aspect. It just wrote, it's just working.
*  The other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on their radar, there's an object
*  that they identify as their number one priority or their launch and steering.
*  So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pods going to look. That's what you
*  get in the gimbal video. There's five other, I think it's five, they're kind of in a V,
*  you know, like a geese would fly that are out in front of it and they're actually coming,
*  they're out in front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while
*  they're filming the gimbal video, which it's, I know Ryan has come out and talked about it,
*  but when you see it, you go, you know, if you take it in context, cause you go, oh, it's just the
*  video. Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there's actually other things out there
*  because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the vacays. It was,
*  it actually became, I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the fighter wing.
*  I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this? He goes, well, we got a notam out,
*  which is a notice to airmen, which means there's these objects out there in the warning area.
*  So anyone can, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area. It's all the warning area tells you
*  is that there's high military traffic and training out here. It's probably best not to be here,
*  but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there. So these things have the right wherever
*  they're from or whatever they are, you know, cause people are like, oh, they're balloons. Well,
*  balloons float. Balloons don't sit in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location. They had an
*  airplane cause there was two, there's the gimbal thing. That's a pretty big object. There's also,
*  they talk about, it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere. A translucent sphere. What the
*  transfer? How was that? And I've heard it's almost hit one. It's almost hit, hit them. So that's
*  another, that's one of the biggest, another biggest account is like almost hit a plane,
*  something that appeared to be a cube in a translucent sphere. What do you make of that?
*  What? I mean that, that's the most dangerous thing.
*  You're right. The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go, okay, so this thing passed
*  between two airplanes and it was, I think it was like a hundred feet or something like that of the
*  airplane that almost hit it. So they do is they come back and go, Hey, I had a near midair. What
*  do you have a near midair with? This floating beach ball with this cube inside of it. And you go, huh?
*  You know, so they send out a notam again and they, they do a, what's called a hazard report that says,
*  Hey, there's these objects out there. We almost hit one there and that gets sent off to the naval
*  safety center. What was done? I mean, what are you going to do? Can you, you know, catch one,
*  go out with a giant net and try and bag one, you don't know, because they've seen them, they picked
*  them up like hovering on radar. And then all of a sudden they're traveling at really high rates of
*  speed. So, you know, what are you going to do? Well, and that, let me ask this, cause this is
*  what people kind of think about after you witness tic tac and after this, these incidents, as far as
*  we know, uh, with the gimbal and the go fast, it seems like people in the military did not,
*  did not react like what, like did not freak out. It almost like, was it like a mundane event?
*  How do you explain that? Why didn't the people on the ship, not the higher ups,
*  why wasn't there a big freak out? Or as some people suggest, the higher ups knew about it
*  all along and just were not letting everyone know that there's some kind of secret military, uh,
*  you know, like, like tests almost. So let's talk about, so let's say you've got this cool new toy,
*  let's call it a cool new toy. You typically don't take your cool new toy out into an area where the
*  cool new toy could get damaged. Or what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new
*  toy and you got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know, $80 million airplane
*  that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic? Um, you know, tests are normally done in controlled
*  environments. Just it's like any test, a lab test or whatever. When you take things out into the real
*  world, you know, you're still going to test it in an area where if something goes wrong. So when
*  they started and we'll go back to Elon, so my friend that worked there, they had a rocket go
*  off, they were out in Kwajalein and when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket
*  and it ran out of fuel before it got all the way up and it came falling back down. Well,
*  when you're out on an atoll in the Pacific, if it's going up above you, the worst case is going to
*  land on you. So you're worried about where else is it going to land? And it actually crashed next to
*  the atoll and, and, you know, Elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the bus. So, um, that's a
*  test environment because you don't know what's going to happen. So, cause someone said, well,
*  when we chased the Tic Tac, well, it could have been some secret government thing. Well,
*  secret government things typically just don't come out and test to where there's going to be-
*  Unknowing pilots. We can't control a lot of things.
*  You're exactly right. So you go, you know, it's, you know, it's not the doctor evil
*  scientist that's going to throw shit out there to get, there's control and there's reasons that we
*  do it because a lot of stuff, especially when you get to, there's, there's, you build something in
*  theory, you model it, you go, Hey, this is, it looks like it's going to work. You get funding,
*  you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it, you know, you, like an airplane with
*  digital flight controls before it even leaves the ground, they've got things over the pitot
*  static system that are changing the, what the airplane thinks is the airspeed talking to it.
*  And it's probably up on jack. So the gear up, so it doesn't, it thinks it's flying. It doesn't know
*  it's sitting on jack stands and they're just changing the pressure on the pitot static system.
*  So they can actually make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go,
*  Hey, it looks like it's going to work. And then there's, when there's a bunch of stuff that they
*  do. That's a control environment where she can do the testing. Yeah. Throwing shit out in the
*  middle of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous thing that I've heard.
*  Is it possible? Yes. Is it more really, is it, is it, is it, is it more likely,
*  they're not doing that. And the other, the other side of that question is why do you think people
*  on the Nimitz and in the U S government in general, not freak out more at the incredible thing that
*  you've seen freak out in a positive way, freak out in the negative way, like what are the Russians
*  up to again, or, or more like, what is this? Like more turmoil. So if you would have put a Chinese
*  flag on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side of it. And I said, yeah, it had a big Russian
*  flag on the side of it, dude. Then it would have got a lot of attention. It would have went high
*  order. Right. If it was, you don't have to say Russia or China, just say, if there was another
*  country's emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them,
*  then it's a big deal. So here's what's going on. So we're literally in the middle of workups. And
*  it was a joint workup. Normally they, we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a
*  month. This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when the
*  ship pulled in at Thanksgiving. So we could run home up to the central valley, have Thanksgiving
*  with our family and then run back down and do this. Okay. So, you know, and I had just taken over,
*  I had had the squadron for a month. Right. So I'm a brand new CO. I'm the most junior guy on the,
*  as far as a commanding officer goes, if for time in the Navy. And actually at the time, I think it
*  was the most junior CO for O five command in the Navy. Right. So you go, okay, so I'm out here. I
*  got my squadron. I'm running it. I see this thing, you know, we catch shit for it. I have a squadron
*  to run. I have the, the, the, the Tic Tac was over here. And although an extraordinary event,
*  I have 17 air crew and 300 sailors that I'm responsible for, right. Their wellbeing,
*  making sure they're fed, making sure they're happy, they're birthing, you know, and I'm working with
*  my master chief and I'm working with my XO, uh, snap. And, and we're going through all this stuff.
*  I don't have a lot of time to worry about the Tic Tac. Yeah. If people need to talk to me. So
*  you gotta remember you got the captain of the ship, you got the air wing commander, and you got the
*  Admiral. Those are the top three. And you got the CEO of the, the Princeton, who is a major command
*  guy. And that's really your big major command. And then everything else is you got all the squadrons,
*  which are O five command, and you got the small boys that are out there, which is O five command.
*  So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on,
*  I'm pretty much in the top 20 with all my peers. And then I've got obviously the captain, uh,
*  and the Admiral, right. And then he's got some post command guys on his staff that we were friends
*  with. I talked to her. You're responsible for a lot of things. Yes. Oh yeah. This schedule. Yeah.
*  There's missions. You have to do a lot, get the job done. And there's no time for silly things.
*  That's exactly right. So, and we're the, we're the integration, you know, when a, when a, when
*  a battle group deploys, especially when you go to the Middle East for what we were doing,
*  the air power is the key. It's we take our airport with us. We can park it anywhere we want,
*  and we can do what we need to do. So we're kind of key players. So when you get the theory that,
*  oh, all these men in suits showed up. So the captain of the ship never said anything to me,
*  the Admiral never saying to me, the people on his staff that I was friends with never saying to me,
*  the other CEOs that I talked to on a daily basis never said anything to me. And no one ever came
*  and talked to me and I'm the guy that chased it. So in all the theories and all the debunkers and
*  all the stories, because I don't know if people think they're going to get rich on this, because
*  I made a big donut on this. I can tell you what I got paid for. I got paid to go out and spend
*  21 hours of my day going to LA and do a five minute talk for someone. And I'm like, and it
*  wasn't for the talk, cause I'll talk for free cause you're not paying me. I said, I said, and then I
*  got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest because they, my wife and I got to go cause it was just
*  looked like fun. Cause the whole town gets involved. And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly
*  in front of a large audience about this because it was just, you know, it was fun and I got asked
*  and Jeremy and George Knappen went the year before. So I went with, with Bob Lazar. So I got to hang
*  out with Bob and his wife and his wife and my wife. And you know, we all hung out kind of,
*  you know, talking not about UFO stuff, but just getting to know each other as people because,
*  you know, Bob's like me, the stuff that he talks about is not the center of his life. If anything,
*  it ruined his life. You know, he's just a really, really smart guy. That's just like the rest of us
*  trying to get through life. Yeah. That's nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things reading
*  Louis Elizondo's resignation note from his, uh, uh, the, he was a program director at the
*  a tip program. Like, yeah. One of the sad things is that he's mentioned that, you know, people in
*  government just don't take this seriously as a threat. Uh, like UFOs as a threat. Like you said,
*  if it doesn't have a Russian label on it, it's a, it's a sad thing to think about that,
*  that we have such a busy schedule that the anomaly, it doesn't, is a distraction that we don't want to
*  deal with. And it kind of just fades into history. Like literally it's kind of sad to think that if
*  aliens showed up, like, and, uh, it just didn't, cause they're not like when aliens show up,
*  they're not going to be a thing that's on the schedule. And if they don't start killing people,
*  they just kind of show up in some very, uh, nonchalant peaceful way briefly,
*  people would be like, that's, that's, that's, uh, I don't have time for this. That's so sad.
*  It's like anywhere in the world. So, you know, go back, let's go back way back,
*  way back in the time machine, you know, there were people kind of scattered around the globe,
*  you know, in Europe's a perfect example. Why does France speak French? And then right next to them,
*  Spanish, you know, Spain speaks Spanish, and then you'd kind of jump over and Germans are German and
*  the Polish people, everyone speaks a different language because if you look at the way the
*  train kind of subdivide the original people that were there, you know, thousands of years ago,
*  they speak differently, right? You'd be like the U S but see the U S is different. We all speak
*  English because what happened? We came over and we started on the East coast and we migrated West.
*  We won't get into the, you know, what happened and, you know, cause the native Americans all
*  spoke different languages. You know, it's that same type of thing. So, but anytime we have a
*  Tennessee to show up, you're, you're actually, you think about it, you're an alien. If I go to a
*  different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years where, you know, or a thousand years were
*  travel, we weren't traveling across oceans at the time we were, well, we don't think we were,
*  the Vikings probably were. Cause we had limited, you know, we had to have supplies and the boats
*  weren't as big. We had to build them by hand. We didn't have power tools and all that stuff. So,
*  you know, if you show up someplace, like when the conquistadors from Spain came over into South
*  America and you've got, you know, the natives, you're actually an alien, you know, and then you
*  look at what typically happens when aliens show up in a human alien world, you know, and when I say
*  alien, I mean, you are not from that area. The other, we, we take what we want and that's what
*  happened. I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations because that's how we are, you know, we humans are,
*  we're an interesting group. So you go, now what, what if something is from someplace else? Just,
*  let's just, let's just go off the grid and go as it's, let's say there are little green men.
*  What are their intents? Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou Elizondo and he said,
*  what do you think they were here for us? I don't know. He goes, what, I go, oh, they were observing.
*  They'd come down, they'd hang out. And he goes, well, what if they were prepping the battlefield?
*  What if they were observing to figure out what we do? And you go, that's interesting. The other
*  theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they just check in on us
*  because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization that's inferior to them
*  actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above because now these, they become the
*  threatened type. So you watch us grow until we start getting too much. You know, it's kind of
*  like you go, well, cause they always have a tendency to hang out around nuclear, right? And you go,
*  well, you know, they're, if this is an advanced civilization, I'm going to go science fiction,
*  kind of comical. They come down and watch us and go, look at the, the, the crazy upright monkeys
*  now have developed the atom bomb. Let's hope they don't destroy themselves. Yeah. If I was an alien
*  civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb. That's why the, I mean, there's
*  certainly an uptick of, uh, what is it? UFO sightings since, since the nuclear, since the nuclear.
*  Yeah. That's you go. Hmm. Um,
*  let me ask a little bit out there. A question, maybe it's a speculation, but
*  maybe touching on Roswell. Do you think it's possible that there is out of this world aircraft
*  or beings that are in the possession of one of the governments on this earth,
*  like the U S government, is it possible? So the one perspective of that, if it's possible,
*  is it possible to keep a secret like that? I would say this, I think it's very, it's highly
*  possible because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings and let's go, just look at
*  project blue book, go, it was what the, I forget how many thousands of sightings that there's a
*  percentage, it's like 10 or 15% of them, they, they still can't explain. Like our Tic Tac is one of
*  them. You know, they basically, the government has come out and said, we don't know what that was.
*  Okay. So, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that we don't know, and all of these thousands are still
*  that 15% makes up a pretty big number. What are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere
*  on the globe and was recovered? And I don't care if it's an intact system or you got pieces of it,
*  of a metal that we can't explain or some, some, um, biological matter, to say the least, it could
*  be intact or it couldn't, but the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that
*  could never happen. And I'm not talking just the United States, I'm talking the world. Globally.
*  So is there a chance that a foreign government actually possesses or our government or someone
*  in the, in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people has something that is not
*  from this world? And I'm not talking to Meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way
*  that allowed transport or observation. Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone, you know, like
*  Voyager flies around and does all that stuff. And we got stuff that just went past Pluto that's out
*  in the Kuiper belt. You know, there's, there's stuff out there floating around and what about
*  ours? It's going to crash into Jupiter eventually or whatever, because we've had stuff crash into
*  planets. So if that's the case, you would think something is out there that we have something
*  that we can't explain. And according to Lou, there is stuff that we can't explain, you know,
*  and I would assume that Lou who ran ATIP has, has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about
*  because, you know, cause I had a clearance. When you have a clearance, you were, you sign your name,
*  you're bound to that. And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to, you know,
*  and this is kind of where, you know, people have issues with Bob. So if, you know, and I leave it
*  to you to determine if you believe Bob or not. I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane,
*  normal, super smart guy.
*  Bob Luzaro, yeah.
*  Yes. There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out and talked, you know,
*  to those who will clearance, who, you know, are true to the government, you would say
*  he should have never spoke. He, he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.
*  If you ask Bob, why did you say something? His, his answer was, I understand there's an oath,
*  but I felt that the technology could benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away.
*  And I'll leave it. If you believe Bob, that's, that's kind of what Bob says.
*  And that, that's a such a interesting key point. If there is aircraft, a technology that's in the
*  possession of the, say the U S government, should they make that publicly known? This is the question
*  of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature of human civilization? Like the,
*  the way we, the way we think about our place in the world. Also the,
*  if that technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of military
*  conflict, should we release that information or not? If you were the government.
*  So here, well, here's exactly how. So for, for classified information, the government is the
*  people that classify it. So I can't go, I can't look at something and go, oh my God, this avion
*  bottle is now a top secret. I can't, I don't have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that.
*  That's up to the government. And I agree with that because I worked for the government for
*  24 years of my life. So I understand that. But now you go, there's reasons stuff is classified. Okay.
*  And it has to do with sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained. It's just like
*  the mob. If I have a spy and I'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster, but I have a guy on
*  the inside that's feeding me information, I can't do it. And a perfect example is if you've ever
*  seen the, it's the Tom Cruise movie, what is it Air America or whatever, but he, he plays the guy
*  in Louisiana who was hauling drugs for Pablo Escobar and he ended up getting a cargo plane
*  and the government, the CIA was kind of funding him to do stuff. That's how he got hooked up with
*  Pablo, but they put cameras on his airplane. And when Reagan had come out and said, here's pictures,
*  we have proof that they're running these drugs. It didn't take Pablo long to figure out those
*  pictures were taken from inside of the plane of this guy he had been working with. And that guy
*  ends up dead. Does that make sense? So you classify to protect the source. You classify to protect
*  the technology because if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there's levels,
*  depending on if it's a secret or top secret, there are levels of damage that can be done to the U S
*  government and our wellbeing as a country. And we owe it to this because we're all Americans,
*  you know, to me, no matter what some people will say even in this country, this is the greatest
*  country on the planet. This is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to
*  do. It's just don't be lazy. And I have stories of people that came over here and started with
*  nothing and they're, they're living the American dream and they'll tell you, and they didn't get
*  it because of, you know, like you, you came over here from Russia, you get no minority status or
*  anything else. You get, you're a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, whatever your religious view, but you
*  come over here, I kind of knew that from the last one, but you come over here, you basically
*  have made yourself, you're educated, you're working at literally the top research university
*  in the world, to be honest. I can do whatever the hell I can create with a bit of, with a lot of
*  hard work, I can do quite a lot. And no one gave it to you. So I mean, and I'm a believer that like,
*  that, I mean, we are a community. So like, there is a social aspect to it, but the freedom
*  and the American dream is a real thing. And this is this, I, you know, I joke about being Russian,
*  but I, I'm an American and this is, I do believe the greatest country on earth. So there's a reason,
*  the nationalist pride, the pride in your nation is a powerful thing. And around that, this secrecy
*  holds value. But to me, alien technology is bigger than that. I mean, it's, it's not so much a threat
*  as a, you're holding back something that could inspire the world, like human knowledge.
*  So let's talk in theory. So I'm going to go back to Bob, because I've talked to Bob. So Bob
*  is a propulsion guy, right? Right. Bob has a bicycle, the rocket motor, he built the rocket car,
*  you know, so he did that. So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system,
*  let's just say this is, I'm just talking, this is Dave's theory. I am, I own, I have,
*  I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don't understand. And I know it's a
*  propulsion system. So now I got to figure it out. Right. So who are you going to go to?
*  Right. You go find someone. So you go, wait, here's a guy who at the time was working at
*  Los Alamos, which they have proven, who is big into propulsion. He designs all this. He builds
*  a shit in his garage. Hey, he's super smart. Why don't we bring him in? So you hire him on
*  a contract and you go, Hey, we're going to brief you into a program. And he goes and works on
*  wherever he says he worked, you know, that's not important, but you get access to the technology
*  to try and figure it out. And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know,
*  we're figuring out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough
*  for us to figure the whole thing out. So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out
*  and tell anyone he works on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated. He's at a,
*  he's at a wall. You go, ah, I can't do it. So sometimes the best thing is to bring in a
*  fresh mind. So you go find someone else who's in a propulsion, you bring him in, they work,
*  they can't figure it out. Or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory,
*  hey, I've got all these theories on how it works, but we don't have the technology. We haven't
*  advanced enough to actually do what we need to do. We still have to advance technology more.
*  So then what do you do? You shelf it. You go, Hey, good projects over and the contract, you shelf it
*  and you wait another 10 years and you wait another 10 years until technology and our abilities and
*  our research advances more. And then you go find new people to bring in that are experts in that
*  field and go, Hey, we want you to work on this thing. And here's what we know about it so far.
*  Or you don't tell them anything. Because remember, if you reveal someone else's research,
*  you can taint their beliefs. They'll start to sway in that direction. So you go, I'm not going
*  to tell you anything. I'm going to give you this thing. And now you tell me what you think. And as
*  they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that maybe Bob and someone else solved earlier,
*  you can go, Hey, what about this? You don't have to tell them where it came from. What about this?
*  And now they can leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answer. And then we get
*  stuck by our evolution of technology. Do you shelve it again? Do you think that's the right
*  way to do it? Because it's heartbreaking. I don't listen, I love government. But we just had this
*  discussion about Elon and so on. The alternative approach is to release this to the world and say
*  there's a mystery here. And then the Elans of the world that Jeff Bezos, we talked about money,
*  but it's also not just money. It's like this engine that's within. We talked about the American
*  dream to say, I'm going to be the one that cracks this mystery open. And like that's within a lot of
*  us and like money aside, people in their garage just will. But you're thinking like a scientist.
*  Now let me, now let's shift to, let me think like a country. So we have country A, B and C.
*  And you can look at the nuclear arms race. So we know that Germany was really close.
*  We know that Russia was getting pretty close. We just won the race and we were the first ones with
*  it. And still to this day- And Germany could have won.
*  They could have won. They could have won, but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation
*  when they knew they had the answer. It is literally what it comes down to. Someone was smart enough to
*  realize that that got into the hands of the Nazis, that it would be the end. And that's a tough call
*  to do that knowing that you have the answer and you can't solve the problem because it will go
*  into the wrong hands. And that's kind of the fear when you look at this, you go, okay, so if we do
*  this, if we put it out there, we've got this technology. If we don't work on it, kind of
*  international space station, like we're all going to work on it together in a, you know, like
*  Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free from any weapons or anything more supposed. You
*  know, we got the international thing down there. We're all going to work together. If you did it
*  in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out, because what you don't want is
*  someone stealing information and getting it back to where countries are notorious to do this.
*  Hey, we're doing internationally, but we're secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come
*  up with the solution first. That's the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and
*  technology like that is power. It would literally change the game of the way the world operates.
*  And from not just a transportation or mankind, but from a military aspect, it's got huge, huge.
*  Yeah, yeah. So beautifully, beautifully presented. And there's, I feel like there's a tension between
*  those two places, the scientists view of the world and the national security view of the world.
*  Let me, let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists
*  kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system,
*  that's exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets. And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe
*  to almost any conspiracy theory to the degree, at least that the conspiracy theorists do.
*  I agree with you. But there does seem to be, and I tend to think of government as unfortunately
*  incompetent, at least the bureaucracy. It seems that the communication, like the three videos
*  that were released and just the way of DOD in general talks about the things we've been talking
*  about, it's just confused. It's contradictory. It's not inspiring. It's suspicious. It's just not,
*  even the way they released the videos. The Tic Tac, if presented correctly,
*  could just inspire a generation of scientists. It's like us going to the moon.
*  It's inspiring. I mean, it's incredible. And the way it was released was suspicious. It was like
*  low resolution video on a crappy website, like with some crappy documents. And I mean, why,
*  I don't know how to ask this question, but can government do better? Why are they doing it this
*  way in terms of communicating the things they do know to the public? Because I don't think they
*  know how. Especially in this topic, it's been hidden for so many years. And I don't think,
*  because I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff. I just think that when it comes in, like I said,
*  the government has a right to classify stuff, they classify everything because they don't know.
*  You have something, you don't know what it is, you don't know. So we just go, well, it must be
*  top secret. And let's put it in a vault. It's kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the
*  Ark and they put it in the, it's in the giant army warehouse. We don't even know what we have.
*  But I also believe that, and I'll say this openly, I don't think that the American people
*  need to know everything. I think there's a reason that stuff is classified for the protection
*  of this country. And I totally believe in that. So I was joking with Joe when he was talking about
*  the storm area 51 stuff. I'm like, yeah, that's probably the worst idea you could possibly have
*  is to just storm a military installation. It's just stupid. There are reasons that we have things
*  that we don't just let out to the public because if we do, as soon as you do let someone know that
*  you have something, they immediately try and encounter it. And perfect example, the US in
*  the sixties developed a bomber. It was a Mach 3 compression lift bomber called the XB70.
*  Okay. There was three of them built, three of them ever built. It was a like 60,000 foot high,
*  Mach 3. It was an incredible airplane when you see it. And there's actually the last one remaining
*  is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum. It would go, the wingtips would fold on. It looks like a concord,
*  but it's way faster. When that got out that we were developing it, the Soviet Union developed
*  the MiG-25, literally a high altitude interceptor to counter that bomber. And they built an entire
*  fleet of MiG-25s. We built three XB70s and we scrapped the program. Because now you go, well,
*  the technology is cool. We proved it, but now it becomes obsolete. So it's not even worth building
*  a whole fleet of these things. It's a chess game. We do something, they do something. We do something,
*  they do something. And we do something and then they counter it. You got to figure out how to
*  defeat it. So you go, oh, we'll build something. So the more we keep quiet, especially from a
*  defense standpoint, the better. Actually, that person, I think we talk too much. And I think
*  the military and the DOD is starting to see that we're too open. You announce, hey, we're building
*  this because there's a budget line and we live in a free society. But you don't have to release
*  all the specs. And you don't have to put everything in open source. But that's a problem when we go to
*  universities. If we want to go do work with MIT and you want to partner with MIT and you're a defense
*  company and you want to partner, you guys have a rule that if you create it, then it can be open
*  source because the university owns it and we are an institution of learning. Where the defense side
*  might go, we don't really want that published in a paper in Scientific America or IEEE.
*  It's so heartbreaking. I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Keiko Jackson, and just Concorgs.
*  The some of the best, if not the best engineering and science, but engineering really
*  ever is done in secrecy. And it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it.
*  It is, but some of it's due to funding. The US government has deep pockets.
*  Some of this new technology that you develop for an open source unless, and this goes back to the
*  original conversation. We now, there's enough money in the private sector that individuals control.
*  Bezos, I'm not talking Amazon. I'm talking Jeff Bezos.
*  A single individual.
*  Worth over $100 billion. He has the ability to do stuff. I'll tell you what,
*  the Gates Foundation with between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren Buffett and some of the other
*  money, because I think Bezos' ex-wife actually donated a huge chunk of her half into the Gates
*  Foundation. So, I mean, what's the Gates Foundation worth these days? And these are guys,
*  you know, brilliant, brilliant. I mean, some of the greatest minds that we have to go,
*  what are they doing? Because they have the ability, it's a nonprofit. They can go, hey,
*  I want to fund this. I want to fund this research.
*  They can look beyond the conflict between nations.
*  You can look beyond the conflict of having to have classification. You can do what you want.
*  It's just like, we classify how to do the whole nuclear, how to create critical mass.
*  But there's really smart high school kids that have figured out mathematics.
*  They do their science project, and then the government comes in and says, hey,
*  we got to classify your government because we just don't want this out in the public domain,
*  which I understand. But they never stop them from free thought and developing that. It's just,
*  we really don't want this out there. Okay, so I understand that. I totally understand that. But
*  if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey, we want to do this, and they're going to work with
*  Bezos, and they're going to work with Elon, and we're going to, you think about it, there's a
*  significant amount of money that could be available to R&D. And I'm not talking just science like this.
*  Medical research and all this. But then you go, well, who gets it? Because now you're competing
*  against the companies that actually do it. You go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds? I'd
*  say, we have a tendency to go, these are the best that we have. And I'd say, well, no, that's the
*  best that we know we have. But there's probably people out there that don't want to work. There's
*  brilliant minds that don't want to do anything with defense because they just disagree with what it
*  does. So they go to another path. They can do something else. And in the sense that
*  the Elons of the world, the Jeff Bezos, are actually, in a certain sense, much better than
*  DOD at finding the brilliant, weird minds out there. Because they're not tied to the government.
*  So when you work a government contract, the government writes, they tell you what they want,
*  and then they work with you on the requirements. And they usually have an end in mean. They have
*  an idea that this is what I want it to be. Where if you go to like SpaceX, where they come up with,
*  why don't we just land these things on a pad and reuse them? Well, if the government scientists,
*  if you're on a government contract says, no, that's not the requirements, we're not paying
*  for that. We want you to do this. You're kind of controlled. Or when Elon does it, his company,
*  they can do whatever the hell they want to do because they have no bounds. The only bounds they
*  have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something. So what do you do? You go out
*  to Kwajalein and you test it. And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we clean it up,
*  no big deal. We lost some money, but we'll move on. Money makes the world go around contrary to
*  what everyone thinks. But there's a lot of money that's sitting around that you can do a lot of
*  really cool stuff with. And I don't know. I'll guarantee that, what is it? Blue Origin, isn't
*  that Amazon? That they're doing some cool stuff because they have funny. And I joke with the guy
*  I know that worked at SpaceX. And he was funny because they were building the first test thing
*  and they were limited. And Elon found this 400 acre thing, I think it's about 400 acres,
*  down by Waco, Texas. And he's like, I go, how? He goes, dude, I worked with, he goes,
*  because he's done government contract, he goes, there's government contract and then there's
*  working at SpaceX with Elon money. And that's what he refers to it as, is Elon money, where it was
*  like, don't, I'll throw them, and he would throw the money at it and make it happen. And it's,
*  I'm talking this fast. I mean, he talks about, he has a great story about this. I mean, this is Elon,
*  but this is how fast you can do in the private sector vice, the government where there's the
*  bureaucracy is, they had a company that was a, basically a tool and die machine shop that did a
*  lot of their high precision parts for the rockets. They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with
*  other companies. And when the economy was down, the guy was actually looking at going out of
*  business. So the guy I know, he's telling me this story. He was talking to the guy, he had to go over
*  there and get something. And he's like, holy shit. He goes, hang on. So he calls up on the phone,
*  SpaceX, he says, Hey, is Elon there? Can you get them in the boardroom? We'll be there in 20 minutes.
*  So he grabs this guy who's literally going to fold his company. They go over to SpaceX,
*  and I may be getting some of this wrong if people are going to fact check me, but this is pretty
*  close. They go in the boardroom and he said literally within like an hour or two,
*  Elon has bought the guy's company. That guy is now a senior VP running his company and they're going
*  to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build the parts and they can
*  still contract out to make the money outside. And it happened like that fast. It's not just money.
*  Because I've seen I witnessed it too with Elon, I think it's whatever the whatever the forces of
*  capitalism that that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise to the top. But like, because I've also
*  worked for DARPA like for research for in terms of a source of funding. I there's a weight of
*  bureaucracy when I was working like being funded by DARPA. And with Elon, like I was literally in
*  the presence of like, anything is possible, cutting across all the bullshit of paperwork of
*  the way things were done in the past of the bureaucracy, the rules, the constraints, the
*  all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately. How much money and time do you
*  waste dealing with your bureaucracy when you could actually be doing real work? That's the difference.
*  This is why I honestly, when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were warned
*  about, when you look at it and go SpaceX can do something for half the price ahead of schedule
*  that what Boeing were paying Boeing, and you go, Oh, well, this just came out and you go, well,
*  then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this side? Yeah, because you've
*  got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly around in. It worked
*  like a champ, it went up, it hung out, it came back, it splashed down. It worked perfectly.
*  You know, we're going to dust it off. And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used
*  and then put to museums, they're going to reuse that dragon capsule. It came down, they're going
*  to dust it off, put a new coat of paint on it, slap it on top of another rocket and away it goes.
*  Holy cow. It's amazing. It's a shift. It's a complete shift in mentality. And for us as taxpayers,
*  we can explore at half the cost. Yeah, it's exciting, especially given the putting the
*  tic tac in context, like then the sky or it's limitless, the possibilities we could do with
*  this kind of mech. I think it's exciting. I think we live in an exciting time right now,
*  besides everything that's messed up in the world right now. Well, this is a hopeful,
*  like there's so much conflict going on, so much tension. That's to me, space exploration at the
*  moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have a hope for the future, to look up to the sky.
*  And we're humans. We can solve so many, we can solve all of this.
*  I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing and I said,
*  this would be great. Because when the government had come out a month ago and said, hey,
*  this does exist, we're doing this and we're going to release more stuff. And I was texting like Lou
*  and Chris Mellon and those guys before I went on because they had called me up to be on Tucker's
*  show. And I'm like, hey, I go, this would be great. Just come out with this, find the relic of a
*  spaceship, like pull out the Roswell wreckage if you have it. Pull out the Roswell wreckage and do
*  it. God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with the riots in the cities. And I mean, I know
*  it's an election year and all that, but God, it would be refreshing to not have to turn on my TV
*  and see everything that is just depressing in the world. To begin, holy cow, we actually do have this
*  and we're working on this technology. Imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft and they pull it out.
*  Imagine the innovation that happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than
*  that. Just the innovation that happens, the look on Musk's face, the look on Jeff Bezos' face and
*  all the brilliant engineers. It would change the game. It would change the game completely.
*  Let me ask the big question. I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it. Outside,
*  I mean, one of the things, the fact that you've laid your eyes on a UFO,
*  probably open your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings,
*  there could be other sightings that have legitimacy to them. What to you is the outside of your own
*  sighting is the most interesting sighting or UFO related event in history?
*  I think there's several. What is it? Ramish on Forest in England, the US guys that saw stuff
*  and actually got radiation burns. One guy was medically disabled, but they weren't going to
*  give him and he had help from John McCain. His office helped get the guy's disability reestablished.
*  I think that's a big one. I think there's people out there that have seen stuff,
*  and I'm talking credible because there's, you got to remember, there's a huge chunk of these
*  sightings that get disproven. They're actually explainable. You had sent me the question,
*  the Phoenix lights. Phoenix lights, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with some of these.
*  I'm not either. I want a funny story on that. I was at a conference. Hopefully, he doesn't watch
*  us and get offended. We had this, I call it speed dating. There was a table. There's about eight
*  people at a table and we would go sit at the table and they could ask us questions. Then after 10
*  minutes, we moved to the next table. I was speed dating all these people that are really into this.
*  It was funny, but I had sat down. It's always funny because some people will try and dominate
*  it, but you have to push the dominators away so that if you're quiet and introverted,
*  you can ask your question too. We got into this and the guy starts naming all these,
*  well, what about this? What about the Phoenix lights? I'm like, I don't know about the Phoenix
*  lights. What about this event? I don't know about that. He looks at me and he goes, well,
*  you're not a UFO guy. I go, no, I'm not, but I chase one, so I'm an expert. Have you? You
*  could see him get deflated because I'm a smart ass like that. Yeah. The first hand experience
*  from a credible, in some sense, these sightings have to do both with the evidence and the human.
*  Well, I think part of that is to us, that's a credibility piece because the four of us that
*  actually saw it plus the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video, none of us are
*  UFO obsessed people. When we come out and say, because to me, it's just in its five minutes of
*  my life. I did a lot of really cool, really neat things I've been able to do, but when you look at
*  it and go, to me, it's not the pinnacle of my life. To other people that they live in the UFO
*  world and it's like they, if you talk to people, they'll go, that are really into it, who've never
*  seen one? It kills them that they didn't see one. When here we are, because what's unique with ours,
*  which adds that level is it wasn't, we just didn't see it. It wasn't like, oh, look, something in the
*  sky and it was weird. We actually engaged with it. It was an engaged five minute thing. There's other
*  stories from other countries. There's a story back when the Soviet Union existed that they actually
*  would chase these things and one of them shot at some, it shot at it because they said, shoot at
*  it and it shot at it and then it got shot down. Then they said, don't ever shoot at them again
*  and don't chase them. Just so you can observe them, but don't go after them because obviously
*  they have firepower that we can't control. If you can make something float around and jam radars at
*  will and do whatever you want, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful. You can go
*  to Independence Day, they had that force field around, oh, now you got a cyber warfare. You got
*  to take the bug down. You got to take the warfare so now we can actually inhibit some type of damage.
*  You mentioned the Phoenix Lights. Somebody on Reddit said, ask him any thoughts on mass UFO
*  sightings like the Phoenix Lights. The interesting thing, like you said with the Tic Tac, is that
*  multiple people laid their eyes on this. What are your thoughts about the Phoenix Lights?
*  Here's the deal with massive sightings. The Phoenix Lights is unexplainable, although I know
*  the Air Force had said something about it. It was an A-10 drop and flares. I don't think so.
*  Flares don't burn that long. They just come out and they detract and they go away.
*  Although on the other hand, because clouds can do things. I lived in Central California for 18 years
*  and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky? It was really Vandenberg shooting a missile
*  off. They were doing ICBM tests at one time where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across and
*  they go land in the ATOL at Kwajalein. Then they can check the displacement, the accuracy,
*  and all that stuff. It's stuff that we do because we're a superpower.
*  When you see them go up, especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch on a clear
*  night, it'll have the stream, the glow. You can tell it's a rocket, but if you don't look up until
*  later when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere where the plume coming out of the
*  engine is not constrained. You can watch this on TV when even the SpaceX ones go up. It's nice and
*  narrow, narrow, narrow. Then it hits a point where it really starts to go up and it starts
*  to come to the sides because the forces aren't holding that all into one unique thing. It looks
*  really odd. Then it'll go off because it burns out and you get stage separation. Then you see the next
*  one go off and then it's gone. People don't understand that because they didn't watch it
*  from launch because we used to sit in our driveway and Vandenberg, it was a three-hour drive,
*  but you could sit and watch it. You knew they were launching at night, you'd watch. You watch
*  and it's really cool. If you don't see anything, what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust
*  plume, what's left, the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing it.
*  So you get these really weird shapes in the sky. That's part. But when you go to Phoenix Lights
*  and you go, hey, when 1,000 people see something, are you going to discredit all 1,000 people or
*  are you going to try and explain it away with something else? It's a weather balloon.
*  You know, it's a weather balloon. Again, just like the Tic Tac, I think is just inspiring
*  for the limitless nature of the science. I think more is going to come out. I think
*  some of the stuff that the To The Stars folks have done.
*  So there's a To The Stars Academy. What are your thoughts about them?
*  I talked to them quite a bit. I am not a part of To The Stars Academy,
*  I, you know, but you know, like I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this.
*  What's their mission? What's their hope? What's their...
*  When they started, their mission was to try and don't look at this as little green men,
*  but let's look at this as a technology and let's try and almost reverse engineer and figure out
*  how these things operate and how can we explain this from using our knowledge, you know, physics
*  based knowledge to go, how would something like this operate? That's really their bottom line was
*  to try and use and then couple that with, because they've got the series unidentified,
*  couple that with television to get the word out. So you're actually putting something instead of,
*  because everyone has a theory, you know, Ancient Aliens covers all kinds of theories,
*  you know, it's kind of off of, oh my God. And I've seen the stuff and I've seen stuff that I've said
*  taken out of context on shows that I did not talk to. So there's all that because you can take a
*  clip and go, oh, it's this, it's that, you know, and if I know about stuff like it, you can't
*  technically use my likeness unless I tell you you can. So if I haven't signed something you can't
*  do, there was a guy who put something out, you know, I was in it and I told him you can take it
*  down and you can talk to lawyers because I'm not, I'm not supporting you. So they use it to tell
*  some kind of narrative that doesn't, it's not connected to reality. Because let's face it,
*  if you're making TV shows, there's two reasons to do it. One, you want to get word out or two,
*  you want to make money or three, both. And so usually it's, I would say the, the make money
*  is probably the biggest thing to put a TV show out. And the mission of the, to the stars academy is
*  to not do that. This is, is to try to get some, when I, when they started and I talked to them,
*  cause I've talked to Tom and I've talked to Lou and those are the two main players. It was to
*  basically demystify the fact and get rid of the stigma that's tied to UFOs. And let's look at it
*  from a science base and then use TV to get the word out on the progress. And they've done some
*  pretty cool things. I mean, you know, they've, the, the Italian government gave them all kinds
*  of files that had been, you know, property of their government. They got a bunch from,
*  it might've been Argentina gave them all kinds of stuff. Like here's all our records. What can you
*  do with it? To try and now pull from country-based to a more global-based research, which is what you
*  were talking about. And then using independent scientists that are not tied to a government.
*  I mean, any government, but just using independent research agencies to start looking at some of the
*  metallurgy. Cause you go, Oh, I found this. We had this piece of metal. What is it? And some of the
*  stuff has been explained. They've got some objects, artifacts that have not been explained. And that's
*  slowly coming out, you know, and I think, uh, and your hope is the U S government will release some
*  of the government is the government, the U S government came out a month ago and said,
*  yeah, we have, we have, we have material that we cannot explain the origin. They have said that
*  they just haven't released the records from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about. I'm
*  like, come on. It's 70 some years old. I mean, let it out. I think you put it beautifully that
*  in this time, that will be a heck of an inspiring, hopeful thing to see. Like people don't just to
*  distract them. Yeah. The division is, I mean, nothing will unite us humans, descendants of chimps.
*  Uh, like, uh, the idea that there's life out there. Oh, it would literally change. I said this a while
*  ago, I forget. I think it was the London sun times had called me. And I said, you know,
*  personally, I think this is a global issue. It's not if there is stuff coming down, which we're
*  pretty sure there is, there's enough stuff that we can't explain. If there is stuff coming down,
*  then this is not a country based thing and it's not about technology and it's not about who's
*  going to win the next war because you don't know what they're doing. So you got really a couple of
*  theories. One, you've got ET or close encounters. And the other extreme is you've got independence
*  day. Are you going to prepare and bet on ET and close encounters or do you actually try and do
*  stuff in case it is independence that you actually have a game plan? And when you get into independence
*  day, that scenario, you know, and I don't like going too much into sci-fi, but let's just say
*  in theory that that becomes a reality. It's not a U S Russia, China, England, France, Spain,
*  name any country in any continent. It becomes a global issue. And the only way you can deny it,
*  it's just like Americans. We all, you know, we're divided. It's been that way forever. So if you
*  think we won't get through this, we'll get through it because we've had times just like this before.
*  Until Nazi Germany pops up. Nazi Germany pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the World
*  Trade Center. And then all of a sudden we're all like United. We all also have very, very short
*  memories. Yes, we do. Exactly. It's when you look and go, well, we can do this and you go, no, no,
*  if you think that everyone on the planet is good, you need to stop taking the drugs that you're
*  taking. You know, we said this, there were people during the rise of Hitler. No, no, it's, it's okay.
*  And no, no, it's okay. We're not going to do, we're not going to stop. No, no, it's okay.
*  No, no, it's okay. And you got to think the only thing that stopped Hitler was his ego
*  by going into Russia. If he just stuck with the pact with Stalin and not went to the East and
*  had to fight, and it was really the Russian winner that crushed them. And he would have put all his
*  high troops to the other side. There would have been a totally different outcome. The man in the
*  iron, the man in the high tower, whatever it's a Netflix show or Nazi actually wins it. And you
*  look, you know, we didn't know everything that was going on, especially the atrocities with the
*  concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews. I mean, it's, you look at that going,
*  if you really want to see evil, and then there's the whole side of what Stalin did, because he
*  actually exterminated more people than Hitler did, but that never gets the press. And the thing is,
*  we forget this, we forget this history in our conflicts today. We forget that there is the
*  nature of evil. We forget that there's real evil in the world. And the thing to fight that evil is
*  to be united, to be both, it's like this interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan, of being
*  both like kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong
*  and a bad motherfucker when you need to, to make sure that you, that like there's a balance between
*  kindness and force. Well it is, you use force when force is necessary, but you don't have to
*  walk around like Billy Badass all the time. I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with,
*  that literally could kick the shit out of whoever came near them, they never got in fights because
*  one, even people that didn't know them, because they were actually nice guys, you know, they were,
*  they're just good dudes. But you know, if you cross them, like I had a friend of mine, he was, he's a
*  nationally ranked wrestler. Went to Naval Academy with me. He's a very, very good friend of mine.
*  And he is, when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he did not lose a match his senior
*  year until he went to nationals. He just had a bad day. He actually lost to a guy he had pummeled
*  the shit out of. And he would cross, it was funny, we joke about it even with him, because when you
*  meet him, he's like the nicest, like local, hey, hey dude, you know, hey, how you doing? He's super
*  nice. And he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat. As soon as he crossed that ring, it was like
*  a totally different person. And he would go out there and just destroy people. I mean, physically
*  destroy, like put a hurt on. And he would get done and he's like super humble and they'd raise his
*  hand and he would, he'd have this blank expression. They'd raise his hand and he'd walk off. And as
*  soon as he crossed the line, he'd look up and smile and go, hey, hi guys, how you doing? Like
*  he literally just went and could have ripped someone's arms off. But as soon as he crossed
*  line, he was a totally different person. He's like, and he's that way today. I mean, he wouldn't
*  even tell you he's a wrestler. Yeah. That's kind of a symbol of the best of America. That's what
*  America is, that wrestler. You cross the line, you're, you're, you can be hard, but when,
*  once you're off the mat, you're just a kind human being. Yeah. I know you're super humble
*  saying it's better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring.
*  That's the entire trajectory of having a dream of accomplishing that dream of having one hell of a
*  career. What advice would you give to a young person, to a young version of yourself today
*  that listens to this and is inspired that wants to fly or wants to go to school?
*  Or wants to go to space and wants to build the rocket? Is there advice you could give them
*  about life, about career, about anything? Yeah. Yeah. First, let me start with,
*  and you had a question on it, inspirational people. So my grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier,
*  huge funeral, beer delivery guy was delivering beer in the sixties riots where the guys in the black
*  neighborhoods where white people didn't go. And my grandfather's Sicilian. He was one of the first
*  ones in his family born in the United States. So my great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles
*  that I knew growing up that actually came over on the boat. Huge, huge guy and just the nicest,
*  friendliest would give you the shirt off his back, obviously proven by his funeral. And I'm talking
*  at his funeral, the head of the black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio. The mafia guys
*  were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio. I mean, it was literally a mix of who's who. And he had told
*  me once, because when you're little, you start looking and I grew up basically, I was probably
*  middle-class, lower middle-class. My dad was a fireman. You're not rich. He's working for the
*  city. It was a paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up. And I was talking to my grandfather one
*  day and he said something to me, and this is literally how I run my life. He said, it was
*  about money because you'd see, back in the day, if you saw someone in a Mercedes, that was rare.
*  They weren't everywhere. You couldn't lease a car. He actually bought a car and usually he
*  bought a car with cash. So it was a totally different than we are now. And he said, he goes,
*  you know, David, he goes, they're no better than you and you're no better than anyone else. He
*  goes, you got to remember that. He goes, everyone's different. He goes, treat everyone with the respect
*  and dignity that they deserve. He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless, he goes,
*  it doesn't make them a bad person. That's who they chose to be. And you make choices in your life,
*  but never ever look down on someone because there will always be someone that will look down on you
*  and you should never ever do that. And I kept that close to me. He was a huge influence. He was my
*  mom's dad, just a big, big influence in my life and the way I carried myself. And he was one that
*  would say, you can be anything you want to be. He grew up dirt poor and the fact that he had bought
*  a house and took good care of my grandmother and did stuff like that, to him, that was a success.
*  And to me, it was always trying to better and move on. And he was the one, my parents were a big part
*  of this too, was instilling that anything is possible. So when I'm four years and 11 months
*  old in 1969, and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon and I'm asking my mom and she says,
*  well, they were all military pilots. And we had an international guard that at the time was flying
*  F-100, so I'm dating myself. And I was just fascinated with flight and I just looked at going,
*  that's really what I want to do. And I never lost sight of that. There was always, I could do this
*  or do that. And when I was going to go to college, before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was
*  accepted into natural resources at Ohio State. And I'm like, if I can't fly, I'll go be a forest
*  ranger. Cause I wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for fires. Cause that's
*  just, I like that stuff. You know, it was that or being an oceanographer, because I was fascinated
*  with Jacques Cousteau. And actually that's my degree. My undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau.
*  So influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques Cousteau. I have an oceanography degree. I got
*  an MBA from University of Houston, go Cougs, got to mention them. And then, so you look and people
*  go, what are you going to do with that? And I said, you know, I got an oceanography degree.
*  Cause I got, well, I'm going to sail on the ocean. So at least if the ship sinks, I'll know where I'm
*  at. And that was a kind of a running joke. And then- And then there's, so these passions
*  and underneath it is the belief that you can be anything you want to be. You can, you know, I told
*  my kids this, you know, when they were young, you know, it was tough, especially for my son. So when
*  Nate was about five, six years, we knew Nate was colorblind. You know, my wife's brothers are both
*  colorblind. It's really color deprived, color blind, you see black and white. He can't tell. He has
*  issues with greens, reds, browns. It's funny if you're ever around someone like that. Cause he'll go,
*  I'll go, what are you looking at? He goes right over there by the red thing. I'm like, what are
*  you looking at? I go this. I was like, he had a hat on one day. I go, which one are you going to get?
*  He had a hat in his hand. It was green. He goes, I'm going to get the green one. I go, oh, this one
*  right here. He goes, no, the one on my head. I go, Nate, that one's brown. He's like, leave me alone,
*  dad. He got the brown hat. Cause to him, it looked great. So he couldn't fly. He came and he said,
*  I go, what do you want to do, Nate? You know, you're talking to your kids and you know, what
*  do you want to do? He goes, I want to be a pilot. Now I got to tell him, cause he's looking at me,
*  cause I'm a pilot, you can't be a pilot. He's like, why can't I be a pilot? I said, because
*  you got eye issues. You know, so you got to redirect. And the other one was because I had,
*  I stopped flying. I was 42 years old and I was like, and it was my childhood dream. So it's like a
*  pro athlete. I know exactly what it feels like when, you know, Brett Favre has to walk away from
*  the NFL when you still can do it. Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time,
*  but whatever. So you do, when you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when
*  you have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it.
*  So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both of my kids and I said, you know,
*  find something that you want to do, that you love to do, and that you can do your whole life.
*  And you should be able to do good things for other people. You want to be able to help other people.
*  That's what I said. So both of my kids, and there's no one in my family, both of my children,
*  one of them is my daughter is a doctor doing residency in internal medicine right now.
*  And my son is in his third year and they're both going to be doctors. And I look at it as, you know,
*  people go, oh, you got two doctors. I don't care. I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage man or
*  you want to dig ditches, I don't care. Just be the best ditch digger that you can be.
*  I said, and be happy doing it because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of
*  money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money,
*  that's what makes the world go round. But what you realize, and I'll go back to my grandfather,
*  who didn't have a lot of money, and he was probably one of the most happy people on life.
*  And unfortunately, he died at, he died at 65. He had a massive heart attack because he didn't
*  tell that he kind of knew it was happening and he just made the choice to do it. It was devastating
*  to the entire family. But he didn't, he didn't have a lot of money. But I'll tell you what,
*  I know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there's nobody at them. And my grandfather,
*  who's a beer delivery guy, had, I, I, it literally, it was like three miles long. It was crazy. Yeah.
*  Who died? The Pope. That was because there's like, he's a Catholic. He's just, you know, Italian. He
*  goes, you know, who died? The Pope. And I go, no, that's my grandfather. And then the next funeral
*  I went to was my aunt, his sister. And there was like, you know, 30 people. And I looked at my
*  mother and I said, where's everybody at? She goes, oh, no, this is normal. This is what a normal
*  funeral looks like. So it's, you know, for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice. Kindness will
*  get you, I'm a big believer in karma. Kindness will get you a long way in the world. You know,
*  it's easy. It's, it's, it's easy to be nice. It doesn't cost you anything. I said, you know,
*  and get rid of the hate. And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of
*  everything. And there's a, there's a self realism, like, you know, if you really have trouble with
*  math, getting a PhD in applied math is probably not something you're going to be able to do,
*  but understand yourself, what your own capabilities are. And you know, inside your heart,
*  don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do. You have to determine that yourself
*  and go for it. And, and, and you can do anything. It's just, it's, it's a great,
*  the world's incredible. It really is. Let me ask the last big ridiculous question.
*  So you've lived much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death.
*  So let me ask kind of several different ways, the same kind of question. One, do you,
*  have you pondered your mortality, the finiteness of it, and the bigger question to ask even in the
*  context of your Tic Tac encounter is what do you think is the meaning of this thing we've got going
*  on here? The meaning of life, human life in this sense. So let me start with, have I pondered my own
*  mortality? Yes, quite often. And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell
*  you that I do believe in God. I've just seen too many things in the world that I can't explain.
*  And some people will explain it by subconscious. So I'll give you a story and this kind of puts
*  in the thing of do I fear death? So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with. We were
*  stationed in Japan together and Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins. So
*  there's a real high cancer rate for those that served on the base in Atsugi, Japan.
*  Him and his wife had one son and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday of cancer.
*  And I was hanging out with, I'll call him John, and I was hanging out with John. We were in oil
*  and gas. He had come to the same company and we were doing an event together. And he was opening
*  up to me because we were actually the demo pilots. We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff.
*  And him and I were sitting there talking and he was giving me the whole story and how it really
*  changed his look on life that we're only here for a finite time and that we're all going to die.
*  Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had moved to a
*  location that fit their, you know, close to the water where they could do stuff and I won't say
*  where. And he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed with throat cancer.
*  And I was talking to him, it was probably about maybe two months before he died.
*  And I said, dude, you're sad. I mean, this is your friend. And I'm kind of really bummed out. And
*  this is the guy that's dying of cancer. And here's what he tells me. He says, Dave, dude, we're all
*  going to die. He goes, but I have to look at it. I have to make the best of the time that I have.
*  And I said, I understand that. And he goes, with the exception of not being with my wife,
*  who he loved dearly, he goes, I'm okay with dying. I've had a really good life.
*  Because actually the original announcement when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me
*  because I don't do Facebook and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed. And about the
*  day before he died, for some reason I was thinking about him. And I had a dream,
*  or I think it was a dream or an altered reality. You can get into whatever.
*  But he was there. It was just him and I. And I was really sad in the dream. I was actually crying
*  and he was there and he was actually in his uniform. He was in his whites because he was a Navy.
*  And we were just talking and he looked at me and he said, and this is in my dream. He's like, Dave,
*  it's all going to be okay. And this is a vivid conversation I have. People are going to think
*  I'm weird about this. But I know what my dream was and maybe it's my subconscious creating the
*  dream. But in reality, to me, this was real, that it was put there for a reason. And he basically
*  explained everything. He's, it's okay. I'm going to be fine. My wife is fine. He goes, this is
*  what's meant to be. But in the bottom line was make use of every day that you have because you
*  don't know. And literally two days later I find out that he passed. So. But ultimately
*  he accepted the finiteness of it. He did. Well, you have to. And it's like, I talk about, you know,
*  money and job position and this and that. And I said, you can get in any, you know, you can go
*  to a company. Just remember when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company.
*  You have to. I said, if you look, I joke with people at work and I said, I said, you know,
*  when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that, I said, when you're sitting on 93 or
*  95, 128 and you're sitting in traffic and we're stopped, which doesn't happen right now because
*  of COVID, but normally it's stopped. It's bumper to bumper. And you're sitting here. Like I was
*  coming down here by the gas tank. When you're sitting there, look left and look right, you know,
*  and there can be a Lamborghini or an S5 50 Mercedes. And on the other side, there could be some
*  piece of crap car. We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time, trying to do the same
*  thing, which is just get home so we can be with our family. Cause the most important thing that we
*  have, it ain't money. It ain't our job. It's not our position. I go, cause when it's all said and
*  done, you could be, you know, you can be with the exception of the presidents of the United States.
*  I mean, name the vice presidents. Most people can't and eventually they're going to die.
*  Or eventually you're going to see a statue of a guy from the 1700s in the Boston area. And you're
*  going to go, I don't even know who that guy was. Did he impact my life? He probably did, but
*  eventually people forget. You realize what's important now. And the one thing that you have
*  is your family and your close friends. And that's, that's it. You can take all the money or
*  everything else. If you're down on your luck, you know, who is going to be, and we always just joke,
*  who are your true friends? It's the person. Well, there's, there's a once that I won't say, but you
*  know, Hey, you're broke down on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three o'clock in the
*  morning. Who are you going to call is going to get in their car without complaining and come and
*  get you. And that's life. Those that is life. The people you love. It's, it's, it's the people you
*  truly care about. And contrary to, I have, you know, Oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.
*  You got about that many real friends that you can count on and that's it. Everything else doesn't
*  matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't mean you don't be nice. I mean, I've there's acquaintance
*  friends that I'll do anything for and then come to my house and stuff. But then there's the people
*  that, you know, you know, like my cousins who are like my brothers that, you know,
*  at a moment's notice, you know, when, when my uncle passed away at a young age, you know,
*  who lived literally right down the street from me and my cousin Chad, and I got two boys, there's,
*  there's 14 of us, but there's only two boys. There's three of us together. And we all grew
*  up in the same neighborhood, same schools, play football together, all that. I said, if one of
*  those, if Ray or Chad ever needs me, if something happens, like when my uncle died, it wasn't, it
*  wasn't an issue if I'm coming home. It's I'm booking the ticket and I don't give a shit what
*  it costs because I will be there to be there with you. And then those two guys and my college
*  roommate is another one that I'm very, very close with. You know, you know, if there's, there's,
*  I have a handful of people that, you know, I will drop literally everything, even if my wife would
*  be pissed at me at times. She's like, seriously, I got, I got to do it. And now she knows, and it's
*  the same thing with her. I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they
*  really need her and she has to go, she would go and I would let her go. So given all that,
*  I'm honored that you would come here and talk to me and take the time. Dave was one of the
*  best conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. It's a pretty long one. It's probably
*  sets the record for the longest one. So I, I mean, I'm, I'm a loss of words. One of my favorite
*  conversations. Thank you so much for talking to Dave. You're welcome. Thanks for listening to this
