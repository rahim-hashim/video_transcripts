# Tim Urban: Elon Musk, Neuralink, AI, Aliens, and the Future of Humanity | Lex Fridman Podcast #264
**Lex Fridman:** [February 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd7fJgFkPU)
*  If you read a half hour a night, the calculation I came to is that you can read a thousand books in 50 years.
*  All of the components are there to engineer intimate experiences.
*  Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery, the most tantalizing mystery of all.
*  How many humans need to disappear for us to be completely lost?
*  The following is a conversation with Tim Urban, author and illustrator of the amazing blog called Wait, But Why?
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban.
*  You wrote a Wait, But Why blog post about the big and the small, from the observable universe to the atom.
*  What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful, the very big or the very small?
*  The very small seems a lot more mysterious.
*  I mean, they're very big, I feel like we kind of understand. I mean, not the very, very big, not the multiverse, if there is a multiverse, not anything outside of the observable universe.
*  But the very small, I think we really have no idea what's going on, or very much less idea.
*  But I find that, so I think the small is more mysterious, but I think the big is sexier.
*  I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space and the farness of stars, and it just continually blows my mind.
*  I mean, we still, the vastness of the observable universe has the mystery that we don't know what's out there.
*  We know how it works, perhaps. Like, general relativity can tell us how the movement of bodies works, how they're born, all that kind of things.
*  But how many civilizations are out there? What are the weird things that are out there?
*  Oh yeah, life. Well, extraterrestrial life is a true mystery, the most tantalizing mystery of all.
*  But that's our size. So that's maybe the actual, the big and the small are really cool,
*  but it's actually the things that are potentially our size that are the most tantalizing.
*  Potentially our size is probably the key word.
*  Yeah, I mean, I wonder how small intelligent life could get.
*  Probably not that small. And I assume that there's a limit that you're not gonna, I mean, you might have like a whale,
*  blue whale size intelligent being, that would be kind of cool.
*  But I feel like we're in the range of order of magnitude smaller and bigger than us for life,
*  but maybe not. Maybe you could have some giant life form. Just seems like, I don't know,
*  there's gotta be some reason that anything intelligent between kind of like a little tiny
*  rodent or finger monkey up to a blue whale on this planet.
*  I don't know, maybe when you change the gravity and other things.
*  Well, you could think of life as a thing of self-assembling
*  organisms and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger. Like there's no such thing as a human being.
*  A human being is made up of a bunch of tiny organisms working together and we somehow envision that as one
*  entity because it has consciousness. But maybe it's just organisms on top of organisms.
*  Organisms all the way down, turtles all the way down. So like earth can be seen as an organism.
*  People for alien species that's very different.
*  Why is the human the fundamental entity that is living and then everything else is just either a
*  collection of humans or components of humans. I think if it kind of is, if you think about,
*  I think of like an emergence elevator and so you've got an ant is on one floor and then the ant
*  colony is a floor above. Or maybe there's even units within the colony that's one floor above
*  and the full colony is two floors above. And to me, I think that it's the colony that is
*  the closest to being the animal. It's like the individual thing that competes with others while
*  the individual ants are like cells in the animal's body. We are more like a colony in that regard.
*  But the humans are weird because we kind of, I think of it if emergence happens in an emergence
*  tower where you've got kind of cells and then humans and communities and societies.
*  Ants are very specific. The individual ants are always cooperating with each other for the sake
*  of the colony. So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit. Humans can kind of go,
*  we take the elevator up and down emergence tower psychologically. Sometimes we are individuals that
*  are competing with other individuals and that's where our mindset is. And then other times we get
*  in this crazy zone, a protest or a sporting event and you're just chanting and screaming
*  and doing the same hand motions with all these other people and you feel like one. You feel like
*  one and you'd sacrifice yourself and now that's with soldiers. And so our brains can kind of
*  psychologically go up and down this elevator in an interesting way.
*  Yeah, I wonder how much of that is just the narrative we tell ourselves. Maybe we are just
*  like an ant colony. We're just collaborating always even in our stories of individualism,
*  of like the freedom of the individual, like this kind of isolation, lone man on an island kind
*  of thing. We're actually all part of this giant network of maybe one of the things that makes
*  humans who we are is probably deeply social, the ability to maintain not just the single
*  human intelligence but like a collective intelligence. And so this feeling like individual
*  is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy. So we make it special but we very well
*  could be just part of the ant colony. This whole conversation I'm either going to be doing a
*  Shakespearean analysis of your Twitter, your writing or very specific statements that you've
*  made. So you've written answers to a mail back of questions. The questions were amazing,
*  the ones you've chosen and your answers were amazing. So on this topic of the big and the
*  small, somebody asked, are we bigger than we are small or smaller than we are big? Who's asking
*  these questions? This is really good. You have amazing fans. Okay. So where do we sit at this
*  level of the very small to the very big? So are we bigger or are we small? Are we bigger than we
*  are small? I think it depends on what we're asking here. So if we're talking about the biggest thing
*  that we kind of can talk about without just imagining is the observable universe, the Hubble
*  sphere. And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter. The smallest thing we talk about is a
*  plank length, but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing, but that's 10 to the
*  negative 35. Now we're about conveniently about 10 to the one, not quite 10 to the zero. We're about
*  10 to the zero meters long. So we're writing. So it's easy because you can just look and say, okay,
*  for example, atoms are like 10 to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters across.
*  Right. If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th, which is right, that's now so an atom to us is us
*  to this, you get to like nebulas smaller than a galaxy and bigger than the biggest star. So we're
*  right in between nebula and an atom. Now, if you want to go down to quark level, you might be able
*  to get up to galaxy level. When you go up to the observable universe, you're getting down on the
*  small side to things that we, I think are mostly theoretically imagining are there and hypothesizing
*  are there. So I think as far as real world objects that we really know a lot about, I would say we are
*  smaller than we are big. But if you want to go down to the plank length, we're very quickly,
*  we're bigger than we are small. If you think about strings. Yeah, string, exactly. It was string
*  theory and so on. That's interesting. But I think like you answered, no matter what, we're kind of
*  middle-ish. Yeah. I mean, here's something cool. If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino, the
*  size doesn't really make sense. It's not really a size. But when we talk about some of these
*  neutrinos, I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun. So that's like, I mean,
*  a proton is real small, like really small. And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.
*  Let's talk about aliens. We already mentioned it. Let's start just by with the basic. What's
*  your intuition as of today? This is a thing that could change day by day. But how many alien
*  civilizations out there? Is it zero? Is it a handful? Is it almost endless? Like the
*  observable universe or the universe is teeming with life?
*  If I had a gun to my head, I have to take a guess. I would say it's teeming with life. I would say
*  there is. I think running a Monte Carlo simulation, this paper by Anders Sandberg and Drexler and a
*  few others a couple years ago, I think you probably know about it. I think the mean,
*  you know, using different, using different, you know, running through randomized Drake equation
*  multiplication, you ended up with 27 million as the mean of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy,
*  in the Milky Way alone. And so then if you go outside the Milky Way, that would turn into
*  trillions. That's the mean. Now, what's interesting is that there's a long tail
*  because they believe some of these multipliers in the Drake equation. So for example, the
*  probability that life starts in the first place, they think that the kind of range that we use
*  is for that variable is way too small. And that's constraining our possibilities. And if you actually
*  extend it to, you know, some crazy number of orders of magnitude, like 200, they think that
*  variable should be, you get this long tail where, I forget the exact number, but it's like a third
*  or a quarter of the total outcomes have us alone. Like, you know, I think it's like, I think it's
*  a sizable percentage has us as the only intelligent life in the galaxy, but you can keep going. And I
*  think there's like, you know, a non-zero like legitimate amount of outcomes there that have us
*  as the only life in the observable universe at all is on earth. I mean, seems incredibly counter
*  intuitive. It seems like, you know, you mentioned that people think you're, you know, you must be an
*  idiot because, you know, if you picked up one grain of sand on a beach and examined it and you found
*  all these little things on it, it's like saying, well, maybe this is the only one that has it.
*  And it's like, probably not. They're probably most of the sand, probably, or a lot of the sand,
*  right? So on the other hand, we don't see anything. We don't see any evidence, you know,
*  which of course people would say that the people who scoff at the concept that we're potentially
*  alone, they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons we wouldn't have seen anything. And they
*  can go list them. And they're very compelling. But we don't know. And the truth is, if this were a
*  freak thing, I mean, if this were a completely freak thing that happened here, whether it's
*  life at all or just getting to this level of intelligence,
*  that species, whoever it was, would think there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong.
*  So just being, again, using the same intuition that most people would use,
*  I'd say there's probably lots of other things out there.
*  Yeah. And you wrote a great blog post about it. But to me, the two interesting
*  reasons that we haven't been in contact, I too have an intuition that the universe is teaming
*  on life. So one interesting is around the great filter. So we either the great filter is either
*  behind us or in front of us. So the reason that's interesting is you get to think about what kind of
*  things ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization or lead to the destruction of
*  intelligent civilization. That's a very pragmatic, very important question to always be asking.
*  And we'll talk about some of those. And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility
*  that there could be aliens communicate with us all the time. In fact, they may have visited
*  and we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it. Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve
*  is just the range of life that can evolve is so large that our narrow view of what is life
*  and what is intelligent life is preventing us from having communication with them.
*  But then they don't seem very smart because if they were trying to communicate with us,
*  they would surely if they were super intelligent, they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of
*  life, we're not that rare. We're not some crazy weird species that hears and has different kinds
*  of ways of perceiving signals. So they would probably be able to, you know, if you really
*  wanted to communicate with an earth-like species, with a human-like species, you would send out
*  all kinds of things. You send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves and lots of things.
*  So if they're communicating in a way, they're trying to communicate with us and it's just we're
*  too dumb to perceive the signals. It's like, well, they're not doing a great job of considering the
*  primitive species we might be. So I don't know. I think if a super intelligent species wanted to
*  get in touch with us and had the capability of, I think probably they would.
*  They may be getting in touch with us. They're just getting in touch with the thing that we humans are
*  not understanding that they're getting in touch with us with. I guess that's what I was trying to
*  say is there could be something about earth that's much more special than us humans.
*  Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth or the thing that's of value and that's
*  curious and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful might be something that's not just like
*  tweets, okay? Like English language that's interpretable or any kind of language or any
*  kind of signal, whether it's gravity or radio signal that humans seem to appreciate. Why not
*  the actual, it could be the process of evolution itself. There could be something about the way
*  that earth is breathing essentially through the creation of life and this complex growth of life.
*  It's a whole different way to view organisms and view life that could be getting communicated with
*  and we humans are just a tiny fingertip on top of that intelligence and the communication is happening
*  with the main mothership of earth versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves as super important
*  and we're missing the big picture. I mean it sounds crazy but our understanding of what is
*  intelligent, of what is life, what is consciousness is very limited and it seems to be, and just being
*  very suspicious, it seems to be awfully human-centric. Like this story, it seems like the progress of
*  science is constantly putting humans down on the importance, like on the cosmic importance,
*  the ranking of how big we are, how important we are. That seems to be the more we discover
*  that's what's happening and I think science is very young. So I think eventually we might
*  figure out that there's something much, much bigger going on, that humans are just a curious
*  little side effect of the much bigger thing. That's what I mean, that as I'm saying it just
*  sounds insane. Well it just sounds a little like religious, it sounds like a spiritual.
*  It gets to that realm where there's something that more than meets the eye. Well yeah, but not,
*  so religious and spiritual often have this kind of woo-woo characteristic like and people write
*  books about them then go to wars over whatever the heck is written in those books. I mean more
*  like it's possible that collective intelligence is more important than individual intelligence,
*  right? It's the ant colony, what's the primal organism? Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?
*  Yeah, I mean humans, just like any individual ant can't do shit, but the colony can do these,
*  make these incredible structures and has this intelligence and we're exactly the same. I mean
*  you know the famous thing that no human knows how to make a pencil. Have you heard this?
*  No. This is great.
*  There's not, a single human out there has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil,
*  so you have to think about you have to get the wood, the paint, the different chemicals that make
*  up the yellow paint, the eraser is a whole other thing, the metal has to be mined from somewhere
*  and then the graphite, whatever that is. And there's not one person on earth who knows how
*  to kind of collect all those materials and create a pencil, but together that's one of the,
*  that's child's play, it's just one of the easiest things. So you know the other thing I like to
*  think about, I actually put this as a question on the on the blog once, there's a thought experiment
*  and I actually want to hear what you think. So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around and
*  she says, I'm going to cast a spell on all of humanity and all material things that you've
*  invented are going to disappear all at once. So suddenly we're all standing there naked, there's
*  no buildings, there's no cars and boats and ships and no mines, nothing right. It's just the stone
*  age earth and a bunch of naked humans, but we're all the same, we have the same brain, so we all
*  know what's going on and we all got a note from her so we understand the deal and she says,
*  she communicated to every human, here's the deal, you lost all your stuff,
*  you guys need to make one working iPhone 13 and you make one working iPhone 13 that could pass
*  in the Apple store today, you know in your previous world for an iPhone 13, then I will restore
*  everything. How long do you think, and so everyone knows this is the mission, we're all aware of the
*  mission, everyone, all humans, how long would it take us? That's a really interesting question,
*  so obviously if you do a random selection of 100 or 1000 humans within the population,
*  I think you're screwed to make that iPhone. I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization
*  among the human civilization, like there's a few hackers out there that can like solo build an
*  iPhone. But with what materials? So no materials whatsoever, it has to, I mean it's virtually,
*  you have to build factories, I mean to fabricate.
*  Okay, and how are you going to mine them? You know, you got to mine the materials,
*  where you don't have any cranes, you don't have any, you know. Okay, you 100% have to have the,
*  everybody's naked? Everyone's naked and everyone's where they are, so you and I would currently be
*  naked, it's on the ground in what used to be Manhattan, it's a grassy island. So you need
*  a naked Elon Musk type character to then start building a company,
*  you have to have a large company then. Right, he doesn't even know where he, you know, where is
*  everyone? You know, oh shit, how am I going to find other people I need to talk to? But we have all
*  the knowledge of, yeah, everyone has the knowledge that's in their current brains. Yeah, I've met some
*  legit engineers. Crazy polymath people. Yeah, but the actual labor of, because you said, it's like
*  the original Mac, like the Apple II, that can be built. But even that, you know, even that's going
*  to be tough. Well, I think part of it is a communication problem. If you could suddenly
*  have, you know, someone, if everyone had a walkie talkie, and there was, you know, a couple, you
*  know, 10 really smart people were designated the leaders, they could say, okay, I want, you know,
*  everyone who can do this to walk west, you know, until you get to this little hub and everyone else,
*  you know, and they could actually coordinate, but we don't have that. So it's like people just,
*  and then what I think about is, so you've got some people that are like trying to organize,
*  and you'll have a little community where a couple hundred people have come together,
*  and maybe a couple thousand have organized, and they designated one person, you know, as the leader,
*  and then they have sub leaders, and okay, we have a start here, we have some organization. You're
*  also going to have some people that say, good, humans were a scourge upon the earth, and this
*  is good, and they're going to try to sabotage, they're going to try to murder the people with
*  them who know what they're talking about. The elite that possess the knowledge.
*  And so maybe everyone's hopeful for the, you know, we're all civilized and hopeful for the
*  first 30 days or something, and then things start to fall off. You know, people start to lose hope,
*  and there's new kinds of, you know, new kinds of governments popping up, you know, new kinds of
*  societies, and they don't play nicely with the other ones, and I think very quickly, I think a
*  lot of people will just give up and say, you know what, this is it, we're back in the stone age,
*  let's just create, you know, agrarian, we also don't know how to farm. No one knows how to farm.
*  There's like, even the farmers, you know, a lot of them are relying on their machines, and so we
*  also are, you know, mass starvation, and that, you know, when you're trying to organize, a lot of
*  people are, you know, coming in with, you know, spears they've fashioned and trying to murder
*  everyone who has food. That's an interesting question. Given today's society, how much violence
*  would that be? We've gotten softer, less violent. And we don't have weapons, so we don't have
*  weapons. We have really primitive weapons now. But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics
*  where murder is bad. It used to be less, like human life was less valued in the past, so murder
*  was more okay, like ethically. But in the past, they also were really good at figuring out how
*  to have sustenance. They knew how to get food and water because they, so we have no idea. Like the
*  ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh at what's going on here. They'd say, you guys know,
*  you don't know what you're, none of you know what you're doing. And also the amount of people
*  feeding this amount of people in a very, in a stone age, you know, civilization, that's not
*  gonna happen. So New York and San Francisco are screwed. Well, whoever's not near water is really
*  screwed. So that's true. You're near a river, a freshwater river. And you know, anyways,
*  it's a very interesting question. And what it does, this and the pencil, it makes me
*  feel so grateful and like excited about like, man, our civilization is so cool. And this is,
*  talk about collective intelligence. Humans did not build any of this. It's collective human super,
*  collective humans is a super intelligent, you know, being that is, that can do absolutely,
*  especially over a long period of time can do such magical things. And we just get to be born.
*  When I go out, when I'm working and I'm hungry, I just go click, click, click, and like a salad's
*  coming. The salad arrives. If you think about the incredible infrastructure that's in place for that,
*  for that quickly ages the internet to, you know, the electricity, first of all, that's just powering
*  the things, you know, how the, where the, the amount of structures that have to be created and
*  for that electricity to be there. And then you've got the, of course, the internet,
*  and then you have this system, where delivery drivers and they have, they're running bikes
*  that were made by someone else and they're going to get the salad and all those ingredients came
*  from all over the place. I mean, it's just, so I think it's like, I like thinking about these things
*  because it, it makes me feel like, just so grateful. I'm like, man, it would be so awful
*  if we didn't have this and people who didn't have it would think this was such magic we live in.
*  And we do. And like, cool. That's fun. Yeah. One of the most amazing things when I showed up,
*  I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union and the supermarket was, people don't really realize that,
*  but the, the abundance of food, it's not even, so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.
*  I just ate bananas every day for many, many months because I haven't had bananas in Russia.
*  And the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want. Plus there were like somewhat
*  inexpensive relative to the other food. And the fact that you can somehow have a system
*  that brings bananas to you without having to wait in the long line, all of those things,
*  it's magic. I mean, also imagine, so first of all, the ancient hunter gatherers, you know,
*  you picture the mother gathering and eating all this fresh food. No. So do you know what an avocado
*  used to look like? It was a little like a sphere. Yeah. And the fruit of it, the actual avocado part
*  was like a little tiny layer around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume. We've,
*  we've made crazy like robot avocados today that are nothing to do with like what they,
*  so same with bananas, these big sweet, you know, you know, and not infested with bugs and grow,
*  you know, they used to eat the shittiest food and they're eating, and they're eating, you know,
*  uncooked meat or maybe they cook it and they're just, it's gross and it's things rot. So you go
*  to the supermarket and it's just, it's just a, it's like crazy, super engineered cartoon food,
*  fruit and food. And then it's all this processed food, which, you know, we complain about in our
*  setting. Oh, you know, we complain about, you know, we need too much process. That's a, this is a good
*  problem. I mean, if it's, if you imagine what they would think, Oh my God, a cracker, you know,
*  delicious, a cracker would taste to them. Um, you know, candy, uh, you know, uh, pasta and spaghetti,
*  they never had anything like this. And then you have from all over the world, I mean, things that
*  are grown all over the place, all here in nice little racks organized and on a middle-class
*  salary, you can afford anything you want. I mean, it's again, just like incredible gratitude, like,
*  ah, uh, yeah. And the question is how resilient is this whole thing? I mean, this is
*  another darker version of your question is if we keep all the material possessions we have,
*  but we start knocking out some percent of the population, how resilient is the system that
*  we built up or if we rely on other humans and the knowledge of built up on the past, the distribute,
*  the distributed nature of knowledge, how, um, how much does it take? How many humans need to disappear
*  for us to be completely lost? Well, I'm trying to go off one thing, which is, um, Elon Musk says that
*  he has this number a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people you need to
*  be on Mars to truly be multi-planetary. Yeah. Multi-planetary doesn't mean, you know, uh,
*  like when, when, when Neil Armstrong, you know, goes to the moon, that's, they call it a great
*  leap for mankind. Yeah. It's not a great leap for anything. It is a great achievement for mankind.
*  Now he's like, think about if the first fish to kind of go on land just kind of went up and gave
*  the shore high five and goes back into the water, that's not a great leap for life. That's a great
*  achievement for that fish. And there should be a little statue of that fish and is, you know,
*  in the water and everyone should celebrate the fish. But it's, um, but we talk about a great
*  leap for life. It's permanent. It's something that now from now on, this is how things are.
*  So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars, by the way, is because you can count on
*  one hand, like the number of great leaps that we've had, you know, like no life to life and
*  single cell or simple cell to complex cell and single cell organisms to animals to, you know,
*  multi-cell animals, um, and then ocean to land and then one planet to two planets. Anyway,
*  diversion. But the point is that, um, we are officially that leap for all of life,
*  you know, has happened once the ships could stop coming from earth because there's some horrible
*  catastrophic world war three and everyone dies on earth and they're fine and they can turn that
*  certain X number of people into 7 billion, you know, population that's thriving just like earth.
*  They can build ships. They can come back and recolonize earth because now we are officially
*  multi-planetary where it's a self-sustaining. He says a million people is about what he thinks.
*  Now that might be a specialized group. That's great. That's a very specifically, you know,
*  selected million that has, um, very, very skilled million people, not just maybe the average million
*  on earth, but I think it depends what you're talking about, but I don't think, you know,
*  so 1 million is one 7,000th, one 8,000th of the current population. I think you need a very,
*  very, very small fraction of humans on earth to get by. Obviously you're not going to have the same
*  thriving civilization if you get to a too small a number, but it depends who you're killing off,
*  I guess, is part of the question. Yeah. If you killed off half of the people just randomly right
*  now, I think we'd be fine. It would be obviously a great awful tragedy. Um, I think if you killed
*  off three quarters of all people randomly, just three out of every four people drops dead,
*  I think we'd have, obviously the stock market would crash. We'd have a rough patch, but, um,
*  I almost can assure you that the species would be fine. Well, cause the million number, like you
*  said, it is specialized. So I think, um, cause you have to do this, you have to basically do the
*  iPhone experiment. Like literally you have to be able to be able to manufacture computers.
*  Yeah. Everything. If you're going to have the self-sustaining means you can, you can, you know,
*  any major important skill, any important piece of interest, you know, kind of infrastructure on earth
*  can be built there in this, you know, just as well. It'd be interesting to, um, list out what
*  are the important things, what are the important skills? Yeah. I mean, if you have to feed everyone,
*  so, you know, mass farming, things like that, um, you have to, um, you have to, you have mining
*  these questions. It's like the materials might be, I don't know, I don't know, five mile, two miles
*  underground. I don't know what that agile, but like, it's amazing to me just that these things
*  got built in the first place and they, you know, they never got, no one built the first, the mind
*  that we're getting, uh, stuff for the iPhone for probably wasn't built for the iPhone, you know,
*  or in general, early mining, you know, was for, you know, I think obviously I assume that the
*  industrial revolution, when we realized, oh, fossil fuels, we want to extract this magical energy
*  source. I assume that like mining took a huge leap without knowing very much about this. I think,
*  you know, you're going to need, you need mining. You're going to need like a heart, a lot of
*  electrical engineers. If you're going to have a civilization like ours, and of course you could
*  have oil and lanterns, we could go way back. But if you're trying to build our today thing, you're
*  going to need, uh, you know, energy and electricity and then, and mines that can bring materials.
*  And then you're going to need a ton of plumbing and everything that entails.
*  Yeah. And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer. So like turning raw materials
*  into something useful. That whole thing, like factories, some supply chain, transportation.
*  Right. You know, I mean, you think about, when we talk about like world hunger, one of the major
*  problems is, you know, there's plenty of food and by the time it arrives, most of it's gone bad in
*  the truck, you know, in a, in a kind of an impoverished place. So it's like, you know,
*  we take, again, we take it so for granted, all the food in the, in the supermarket is fresh.
*  It's all there. And which always stresses me. If I were running a supermarket, I would always be so
*  like miserable about like things going bad on the shelves. Um, or if you don't have enough,
*  that's not good. But if you have too much, it goes bad. Anyway, of course there would be
*  entertainers too. Like somebody would have a YouTube channel that's running on Mars.
*  There is something different about a civilization on Mars and earth
*  existing versus like a civilization in the United States versus Russia and China. Like that,
*  that's a different, fundamentally different distance, like philosophically.
*  The quote will it be like fuzzy? We know there'll be like a reality show on Mars that everyone on
*  earth is obsessed with. And you know, if I think if people are going back and forth enough, then
*  it becomes fuzzy. It becomes like, Oh, our friends on Mars. And there's like this Mars versus earth,
*  like, you know, and it become like fun tribalism. Uh, I think if people don't
*  rarely go back and forth and it really, they're there for, I think if you get kind of like,
*  Ooh, we hate, you know, a lot of like us versus them stuff going on.
*  There could be also war in space for territory. As a first colony happens, China, Russia,
*  or whoever the European, different European nations, Switzerland finally gets their act
*  together and starts wars. This is supposed to staying out of all kinds of crazy geopolitical
*  things. Like we have not even, no one's really even thought about too much yet that like,
*  it could get weird. Think about the 1500s when it was suddenly like a race to like,
*  you know, colonize or capture land or discover new land that hasn't been, you know, so it was like
*  this, this, this new frontiers, right? And there's not really, you know, the land is not, you know,
*  the thing about Crimea was like this huge thing. Cause this tiny peninsula switched. That's how like
*  optimized everything has become. Everything has just like really stuck. Mars is a whole new world
*  of like, you know, territory, naming things and, you know, and it's a chance for new kind of
*  governments maybe, or maybe it's just the colonies of these governments. So we don't get that
*  opportunity. I think it'd be cool if there's new countries being, you know, totally new experiments.
*  That's fascinating. Cause Elon talks exactly about that. And I believe that very much. Like that
*  should be like from, from the start, they should determine their own sovereignty. Like they,
*  they should determine their own thing. There was one modern democracy in the late 1700s,
*  the U S I mean, it was the only modern democracy. And now of course that's there's hundreds or
*  dozens, many dozens, but I think part of the reason that was able to start, I mean, it's not
*  that people didn't have the idea. People had the idea. It was that it was a, they had a clean slate,
*  new place, you know, and they suddenly were, you know, so I think it's, it would be a great
*  opportunity to have, there's a lot of people have done that, you know, if I had my own
*  government on an island, my own country, what would I do? And it's the, the, the U S founders
*  actually had the opportunity, that fantasy. They were like, we can do it. Let's make, okay, what's
*  the perfect country? And they tried to make something. Sometimes progress is, it's not held
*  up by our imagination. It's held up by just, there's no, you know, blank canvas to try something on.
*  Yeah. It's an opportunity for a fresh start. You know, the funny thing about the conversation
*  we're having is not often had, I mean, even by Elon, he's so focused on Starship and actually
*  putting the first human on Mars. I think thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring. It makes
*  his dream. It makes us hope for the future. So, and it makes us somehow like thinking about
*  civilization on Mars is helping us think about the civilization here on earth. Yeah. How we should
*  run it. What do you think are like in our lifetime? Are we going to, I think any effort that goes to
*  Mars, the goal is in this decade. Do you think that's actually going to be achieved? I have a
*  big bet, $10,000 with a friend when I was drunk in an argument that the Neil Armstrong of Mars,
*  whoever he or she may be, will set foot by the end of 2030. Now this was probably in 2018 when
*  I had this argument. So like what if a human has to touch Mars by 20 and by the end of 2030. Oh,
*  by the year 30. Yeah, by January 1st, 2031. Yeah. So, did you agree on the time zone or what? No,
*  no. Yeah. It's coming on that exact day. That's going to be really stressful. But,
*  but anyway, I, cause I think that there will be, that was 2018. I was more confident then. I think
*  it's going to be around this time. I mean, I still won the general bet because his point was you are
*  crazy. This is not going to happen in our lifetimes. They're not for many, many decades.
*  And I said, you're wrong. You don't know what's going on in SpaceX. I think if the world depended
*  on it, I think probably SpaceX could probably, I mean, I don't know this, but I think the tech
*  is almost there. Like I don't think, of course it's delayed many years by safety. So they first want
*  to send a ship around Mars and they want to land a cargo ship on Mars. And there's the moon on the
*  way too. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's a lot, but I think the moon, a decade before seemed like
*  magical tech that we, that humans didn't have. This is like, no, we, we can, it's, it's, it's,
*  it's totally conceivable that this scene Starship, like it's, um, it is a interplanetary colonial
*  or interplanetary transport like system. That's what they used to call it. The SpaceX, the way
*  they do it is every time they do a launch, something fails usually, you know, uh, when
*  they're testing and they learn a thousand things, the amount of data they get and they improve.
*  Each one has, it's, you know, it's like they've moved up like eight generations in each one.
*  Anyway, so it's not inconceivable that pretty soon they could send a Starship to Mars and land it.
*  There's just no good reason. I don't think that they couldn't do that. And so if they could do
*  that, they could in theory send a person to Mars pretty soon. Now taking off from Mars and coming
*  back again, I think, I don't think anyone want to be on that voyage today because there's just,
*  you know, there's still, it's still amateur hour here and getting that perfect. I don't think we're
*  too far away. Now the question is, so it's every, so every 26 months earth laps Mars, right? It's
*  like the sinusoidal or soil or orbit or whatever it's called, the period 26 months. So it's right
*  now, like in the evens, like 2022 is going to have one of these 2020, late 2024. So people could,
*  this was the earliest estimate I heard. Elon said, maybe we can send people to Mars in 2024,
*  you know, to land in 2020, early 2025. That is not going to happen because that, that included 2022
*  sending a cargo ship to Mars, maybe even a one in 2020. And so I think they're not quite on that
*  schedule, but to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance and 2029, I have another chance. We're not very
*  good at like backing up and seeing the big picture. We're very distracted by what's going on today.
*  And what's what we can believe because it's happening in front of our face. There's no way
*  that humans going to be landing on Mars and it's not going to be the only thing everyone is talking
*  about, right? I mean, it's going to, it's, it's going to be the moon landing, but even bigger deal
*  going to another planet, right? And, and, and for it to start a colony, not just to, again,
*  high five and come back. So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s is going to be the new 1960s.
*  We're going to have a space decade. I'm so excited about it. And it's, again, it's one of the great
*  leaps for all of life happening in our lifetimes. Like that's wild. To paint a slightly cynical
*  possibility, which I don't see happening, but I just want to put sort of value into leadership.
*  I think it wasn't obvious that the moon landing would be so exciting for all of human civilization.
*  Some of that have to do with the right speeches, with a space race,
*  like space, depending on how it's presented can be boring. I don't, I don't, I don't think it's been
*  that so far, but I've actually, I think space is quite boring right now. Not, not, not, no,
*  SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago, space, some writer, I forget who wrote, it's like the
*  best magic trick in the show happened at the beginning. And now they're starting to do this
*  like easy hazard. It's like, you can't go in that direction. And the line that this writer said is
*  like watching astronauts go up to the space station after watching the moon is like watching
*  Columbus sail to Ibiza. It's just like, you know, it's everything is so practical. You're going up
*  to the space station, not to explore, but to do science experiments in microgravity. And you're
*  sending rockets up, you know, not, you know, mostly here and there, there's a probe, but mostly
*  you're sending up to put satellites to, you know, for, for, for direct TV, you know, an eye or
*  whatever it is. It's kind of like lame earth industry, you know, usage. So I agree with you,
*  space is boring there. The, the, the first human setting foot on Mars, that's gotta be a crazy
*  global event. I can't imagine it not being, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm taking for granted the
*  speeches and the space race and the, I think the value of, I guess what I'm pushing is the value of
*  people like Elon Musk and potentially other leaders that hopefully step up. It's extremely
*  important here. Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX, it's not just the ingenuity
*  of SpaceX, but like what they've done publicly by having a figure that tweets and all that kind of
*  stuff like that, that that's a source of inspiration. NASA wasn't able to quite pull off with a shuttle.
*  That's one of his two reasons for doing this. SpaceX exists for two reasons. One, life insurance
*  for the species. If we're on, you know, if you're, if you're, if you're, I always think about this
*  way, if you're an alien on some far away planet and you're rooting against humanity and you win
*  the bet, if humanity goes extinct, you do not like SpaceX, you do not want them to have their eggs in
*  two baskets now. Yeah. You know, it's, it's like, obviously this, you know, you could have some,
*  you know, something that kills everyone on both planets, some AI war or something. But,
*  but the point is obviously it's good for our chances, our long-term chances to be having,
*  you know, two self-sustaining civilizations going on. The second reason he's, you know, he values
*  this, I think just as high is it's the greatest adventure in history, you know, going multi-planetary
*  and that, you know, it's, you know, people need some reason to wake up in the morning and, and,
*  and it'll, it'll just be this hopefully great uniting event too. I mean, I'm sure in today's
*  nasty, awful political environment, which is like a whirlpool of that sucks everything into it. So
*  doesn't mean you name a thing and it's become a nasty political topic. So I hope, I hope that
*  space can, you know, Mars can just bring everyone together, but, you know, it could become this
*  hideous thing where it's, you know, oh, you know, billionaire, some annoying storyline gets built.
*  So half the people think that anyone who's excited about Mars is an evil, you know, something. Yeah.
*  Anyway, I hope it is super exciting. So far, space has been a uniting, inspiring thing. And in fact,
*  especially during this time of a pandemic has been just a commercial entity, putting out humans
*  into space for the first time was just one of the only big sources of hope. Totally. And ah,
*  just like watching this huge skyscraper go up in the air, flip over, go back down and land. I mean,
*  it just makes everyone just want to sit back and clap and kind of like, you know, the way I look at
*  something like SpaceX is it makes me proud to be a human. And I think it makes a lot of people feel
*  that way. It's like good for our self-esteem. It's like, you know what, we're pretty, you know,
*  we have a lot of problems, but like we're kind of awesome. Yeah, we're awesome. If we can put
*  people on Mars, you know, sticking an Earth flag on Mars, like damn, you know, we should be so proud
*  of our like little family here. Like we did something cool. And by the way,
*  I've made it clear to SpaceX people, including Elon, many times and I just like once a year
*  reminder that if they want to make this more exciting, they send the writer to Mars on,
*  you know, on the thing and I'll blog about it. So I'm just, you know, continuing to throw this out
*  on which I'm trying to get them to send me to Mars. I understand that. So I just want to
*  clarify on which trip does the writer want to go? I think my dream one, to be honest, would be like
*  the, you know, like the Apollo eight, where they just looped around the moon and came back
*  because landing on Mars, um, give you a lot of good content to write about. Great content, right? I
*  mean, the amount of kind of high minded, you know, and so I would go into the thing and I
*  would blog about it. Uh, and I, and I, and I'd be in microgravity. So I'd be bouncing around my little
*  space. I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon. They don't need to do a whole Starship.
*  And, um, and I would bounce around and I would get to, and I might, I've always had a dream
*  of going to like one of those nice jails for a year because I've just have nothing to do
*  besides like read books and I, and no responsibilities and no social plans. So this is the ultimate version
*  of that. And anyway, it's a side topic, but I think it would be, but also if you, I mean,
*  to be honest, if you land on Mars, it's epic. And then if you die there, like finishing your writing,
*  it will be just even that much more powerful for the, for the impact. Yeah. But then I'm gone and
*  I don't even get to like experience the publication of it, which is the whole point of some of the
*  greatest writers in history didn't get a chance to experience the publication of their, I know. I
*  don't really think that I think like, I think back to Jesus and I'm like, oh man, that guy really
*  like crushed it, you know? But then if you think about it, um, it doesn't like, you could literally
*  die today and then become the next Jesus, like 2000 years from now in this civilization. That's
*  like, there are, you know, they're like in magical in the clouds and they're worshiping you. They're
*  worshiping Lex. Like, and like, that sounds like your ego probably would be like, wow, that's pretty
*  cool. Except it irrelevant to you because you never even knew it happened. This feels like a
*  Rick and Morty episode. It does. It does. Okay. You've, uh, you've talked to Elon quite a bit.
*  You've written about him quite a bit. Just it'd be cool to hear you talk about what are your ideas of
*  what, you know, the magic sauce is you've written about about with Elon, what, what makes him so
*  successful, his style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams, his, um, the people he connects with,
*  the kind of problems he tackles. Is there kind of comments you can make about what makes them
*  special? I think that obviously there's a lot of things that he's very good at. He has, um, he's,
*  he has, he's obviously super intelligent. His heart is very much in like, I think the right place,
*  like, you know, I really, really believe that, like, and I think people can sense that, you know,
*  he just doesn't seem like a grifter of any kind. He's truly trying to do these big things for the
*  right reasons. And he's obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right? Not everyone is. Some
*  people are as talented and have cool visions, but they just don't want to spend their life that way.
*  So, but that's none of those alone is what makes Elon. Elon, I mean, if it were, there'd be more
*  of him because there's a lot of people that are very smart and smart enough to accumulate a lot
*  of money and influence and they have great ambition and they have, you know, their hearts
*  in the right place. Um, to me it is the very unusual quality he has is that he's sane in a
*  way that almost every human is crazy. What I mean by that is we are programmed
*  to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning, um, for good reason.
*  If you go back 50,000 years, uh, and conventional wisdom says, you know, don't eat that berry,
*  you know, or this is the way you tire, tie a spearhead to a spear. Uh, and you're thinking,
*  I'm smarter than that. Like you're not, you know, that, that, that comes from the accumulation of
*  life experience, accumulation of observation and experience over many generations. And that's a
*  little mini version of the collective super intelligence. It's like, you know, it's equivalent
*  of like making a pencil today. Like, um, people back then, like the conventional wisdom, like had
*  this super, this, this knowledge that no human could ever accumulate. So we're very wired to
*  trust it. Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know, just say that they believe
*  the mountain is, is they worship the mountain is their God, right? And the guy in the mountain
*  determines their faith. That's not true. Right. And the conventional wisdom is wrong there, but, um,
*  believing it was helpful to survival because you were, you, you, you, you were part of the crowd
*  and you stayed in the tribe. And if you started to, you know, you know, insult their, the mountain
*  God and say, that's just a mountain, it's not, you know, you didn't fare very well. Right. So it,
*  for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait to just trust what other people said,
*  uh, and believe it. And truly, you know, obviously, you know, the more you really
*  believed it, the better today, um, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world, um, and a
*  huge giant society, our brains are not built to understand that they have a few settings,
*  you know, and none of them is, uh, you know, 300 million person society. So there, so your, your
*  brain is basically, um, uh, is treating a lot of things like a small tribe, even though they're
*  not, and they're, and, and, and they're treating conventional wisdom as, as, you know, very wise
*  in a way that it's not, if you think about it this way, it's like a picture, a, like a bucket
*  that's not moving very much, moving like a millimeter a year. And so it has time to collect
*  a lot of water in it. That's like conventional wisdom in the old days, when very few things
*  change, like you're, you're 10, you know, great, great, great grandmother probably lived a similar
*  life to you, maybe on the same piece of land. And so old people really knew what they were
*  talking about today, the buckets moving really quickly. And so, you know, the wisdom doesn't
*  accumulate, but we think it does because our brain settings doesn't have the, oh, move,
*  you know, quickly moving bucket, uh, setting on it. So, um, my grandmother gives me advice all the
*  time and I have to decide, is this, so there are certain things that are not changing, like
*  relationships and love and loyalty and things like this, her advice on those things, I'll listen to
*  it all day. She's one of the people who said, you've got to live near your people. You love live
*  near your family, right? I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right? That is wisdom because
*  that's happens to be something that hasn't, doesn't change from generation to generation.
*  For now, right. She all right. For now. She's also telling me, right. So I'll be the idiot telling
*  my brain that they'll actually be in the metaverse. Like being exactly, it doesn't matter. And I'm like,
*  you have to stop the same when you're not in person, they're going to say it is exactly the same.
*  And they'll also be thinking to me with their neurolink. And I'm going to be like, slow down.
*  I don't understand what you're saying. You just talk like a normal person. Anyway. So my grandmother
*  then, but then she says, you know, you're, I don't know about this writing you're doing, you should
*  go to law school and you know, you know, you want to be secure. And that's not good advice for me,
*  you know, given the world I'm in and what I like to do and what I'm good at, that's not the right
*  advice, but because the world is totally, she's in a different world. So she became wise for a world
*  that's no longer here, right? Now, if you think about that, so then when we think about conventional
*  wisdom, it's a little like my grandmother and there's a lot of, no, it's not maybe, you know,
*  60 years outdated, like her software, it's maybe 10 years outdated conventional wisdom, sometimes 20.
*  So anyway, I think that we all continually don't have the confidence in our own reasoning when it
*  conflicts with what everyone else thinks, when with what seems right. We don't have the guts to act on
*  that reasoning for that reason, right? You know, we, and so there's so many Elon examples, I mean,
*  just from the beginning, building Zip2 was his first company. And it was internet advertising
*  at the time when people said, you know, this internet was brand new, like kind of like kind
*  of thinking of like the metaverse, VR metaverse today and people being like, oh, we're saying,
*  you know, we, you know, we still facilitate internet advertising, people are saying, yeah,
*  people are going to advertise on the internet. Yeah, right. Actually, it wasn't that he's magical
*  and saw the future is that he looked at the present, looked at what the internet was,
*  thought about, you know, the obvious, like advertising opportunity this was going to be.
*  It wasn't rocket science. It wasn't genius. I don't believe I think it was just seeing the truth.
*  And when everyone else is laughing, saying, well, you're wrong. I mean, I did the math and here it
*  is right. Next company, you know, x.com, which became eventually PayPal. People say, oh, yeah,
*  people are going to put their financial information on the internet. No way. To us,
*  it seems so obvious. If you went back then, you would probably feel the same way. You'd think
*  this is that is a that is a fake company that no, it's just obviously not a good idea. He looked
*  around and said, you know, I see where this is. And so again, he could see where it was going,
*  because he could see what it was that day. And not what it you know, not people conventional wisdom
*  was still a bunch of years earlier. SpaceX is the ultimate example. A friend of his apparently
*  bought actually compiled a montage video montage of rockets blowing up to show him this is not a
*  good idea. And if but just even the bigger picture, the amount of billionaires who have like thought
*  this was I'm going to start launching rockets and you know, the amount that failed I mean,
*  it's not conventional wisdom said this isn't a bad endeavor. He was putting all of his money into
*  Yeah. landing rockets was another thing, you know, well, if you know, here's the classic kind of way
*  we reason which is if this could be done, NASA would have done it a long time ago, because of
*  the money it would save this could be done, the Soviet Union would have done it back in the 60s.
*  It's obviously something that can't be done. And the math on his envelope said, well, I think it
*  can be done. And so he just did it. So in each of these cases, I think actually, in some ways,
*  he long gets too much credit as you know, people think it's it's that he's you know, it's that his
*  Einstein intelligence or his he can see the future he has incredible. He has incredible guts. He's
*  so courageous. I think if you actually are looking at reality, you're assessing probabilities,
*  and you're ignoring all the noise, which is wrong, so wrong, right? And you just,
*  then you just have to be, you know, pretty smart and pretty courageous. And you have to have this
*  magical ability to be sane, and trust your reasoning over conventional wisdom, because
*  your individual reasoning, you know, part of it is that we see that we can't build a pencil,
*  we can't build, you know, the civilization on our own, right? We it's so we kind of count,
*  you know, tout to the to the collective, because for look, for good reasons, but this is different
*  when it comes to kind of what's possible. You know, the Beatles were doing their kind of Motowny
*  chord patterns in the early 60s. And they were doing what was normal, they were doing what was
*  clearly this kind of sound is a hit. And they started getting weird, because they had they were
*  so popular, they had this confidence to say, let's just we're gonna start just experimenting.
*  And it turns out that like, if you all these people are in this like one groove together doing
*  music, and it's just like, there's a lot of land over there. And it seems like, you know, I'm sure
*  the managers would say, and that the all the record exactors, I know, you have to be here, this is
*  what sells. And it's just not true. So I think that Elon is why the term for this that actually Elon
*  likes to use is reasoning from first principles, the physics term. First principles are your axioms.
*  Physicists, they don't say, well, what's, you know, what's what what do people think? No, they say,
*  what are the axioms? Those are the puzzle pieces. Let's use those to build a conclusion. That's our
*  hypothesis. Now let's test it, right. And, and they come up with all kinds of new things constantly
*  by doing that. If Einstein was was assuming conventionalism is right, he never would have
*  even tried to create something that really disproved Newton's laws. And the other way to
*  reason is reasoning by analogy, which is a great shortcut. It's it's when we look at other people's
*  reasoning, and we kind of photocopy it into our head, we steal it. So reasoning by analogy, we do
*  all the time. And it's usually a good thing. I mean, we don't if you it takes a lot of mental
*  energy and time to reason from first principles, it's actually, you know, you don't want to reinvent
*  the wheel every time, right? You want to often copy other people's reasoning most of the time.
*  And I, you know, most of us do it most of the time. And that's good. But there's certain moments
*  when you're forget just for a second, like, succeeding in like the world of like, Elon,
*  just who you're going to marry, where are you going to settle down? How are you going to raise
*  your kids? How are you going to educate your kids? How you should educate yourself? What kind of
*  career paths in terms of these moments? This is what on your deathbed, like you look back on and
*  that's what these are the few number of choices that really define your life. Those should not
*  be reasoned by analogy, you should absolutely try to reason from first principles. And Elon,
*  not just by the way in his work, but in his personal life. I mean, if you just look at
*  the way he's on Twitter, he's not had not how you're supposed to be when you're a super famous,
*  you know, you know, industry titan, you're not supposed to just be silly on Twitter and do memes
*  and, and getting little little quibbles with you. He just does things his own way, regardless of
*  what you're supposed to do, which sometimes serves him and sometimes doesn't. But I think
*  it has taken him where it has taken. Yeah, I mean, I probably wouldn't describe his approach to
*  Twitter as first first principles. But I guess that's the same. I think it is. Well, first of
*  all, I will say that a lot of tweets, people think, oh, like, he's going to be done after that. He's
*  fine. He's just one man, time man of the year. Like, it's something is it's not sinking him.
*  And I think, you know, it's not that it's not that I think this is like super reasoned out. I think
*  that, you know, Twitter is his silly side. But I think that he saw he would his reasoning did not
*  feel like there was a giant risk and just being his silly self on Twitter, when a lot of billionaires
*  would say, well, no one else is doing that. So it must be a good reason. Right? Well, I gotta say
*  that he inspires me to that's okay to be silly. Totally on Twitter. And but yeah, you're right.
*  The big inspiration is the willingness to do that when nobody else is doing it. Yeah. And I think
*  about all the great artists, you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs, almost all of
*  them. They had a moment when they trusted their reasoning. I mean, Airbnb was over 60 with VCs.
*  A lot of people take obviously, they know something we don't. Right. But they didn't they said,
*  I think they're all wrong. I mean, that's that takes some kind of different wiring in your brain.
*  And then that's both for big picture and detailed like engineering problems. It's fun to talk to
*  him. It's fun to talk to Jim Keller, who's a good example of this kind of thinking about like
*  manufacturing, how to get cost on they always talk about like, they talk about SpaceX rockets
*  this way. They talk about manufacturing this way, like cost per pound or per ton
*  to get to orbit or something like that. This is the reason we need to get the cost down. It's a
*  very kind of raw materials. Yeah. Like just very basic way of thinking. First principles.
*  It's really the first principles of rocket are like the price of raw materials and gravity,
*  you know, and wind. I mean, these are your first principles and fuel. Henry Ford,
*  what made Henry Ford blow up as an entrepreneur? The assembly line. Right. I mean, he did that he
*  thought for a second and said, this isn't how manufacturing is normally done this way. But I
*  think this is a different kind of product. And that's what changed it. Because, you know, and
*  then what happens is when someone reasons from first principles, they often fail, you're going
*  out into the fog with no conventional wisdom to guide you. But when you succeed, what you notice
*  is that everyone else turns and says, wait, what, what are they doing? What are they all
*  they flock over? Look at the iPhone, iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously famously good at
*  for reasoning from first principles, because that guy had crazy self confidence. He just said, you
*  know, if I think this is right, like everyone in that, I mean, I don't know how I don't know how
*  he does that. And, and I don't think Apple can do that anymore. I mean, they lost that that one
*  brain, his ability to do that was made that in a totally different company, even though there's
*  10s of 1000s of people there. He said he didn't say, and I'm giving a lot of credit to Steve
*  Jobs. But of course, it was a team at Apple who said they didn't look at the flip phones and,
*  and say, okay, what kind of we know, let's make a keyboard that's like clicky and you know,
*  really cool, Apple keyboard, they said, what should a mobile device be? You know, what the
*  axioms, what are the axioms here? And none of them involved a keyboard necessarily. And by the time
*  they piece it up, there was no keyboards, it didn't make sense. Everyone suddenly is going,
*  wait, what, what are they doing? What are they now every phone looks like the iPhone? I mean,
*  that's that's how it goes. You tweeted, what's something you've changed your mind about?
*  That's the question you've tweeted. Elon replied brain transplants, Sam Harris responded nuclear
*  power. There's a bunch of people with cool responses there. In general, what are your
*  thoughts about some of the responses? And what have you changed your mind about big or small,
*  perhaps in doing the research for some of your writing? So I'm writing right now,
*  just finishing a book on kind of why our society is such a shit place at the moment, just polarized.
*  And, you know, we have all these gifts, like we're talking about just the supermarket, you know,
*  we have these exploding technology, fewer and fewer people are in poverty. You know, it's
*  Louis CK, you know, likes to say, you know, everything's amazing, and no one's happy, right?
*  And but but but it's really extreme moment right now, where it's like, hate is on the rise, like
*  crazy things, right? And if I could interrupt briefly, you did tweet that you just wrote the
*  last word, I sure did. And then there's some hilarious asshole who said, now you just have to
*  work on all the ones in the middle. Yeah, I heard that. I mean, when you when you earn a reputation
*  as a as a tried and true procrastinator, you're just going to get shit. Yeah, forever. And that's
*  fine. I accept my fate there. So do you mind sharing a little bit more about the details of
*  what you're writing? So you're Yeah. What what how do you approach this question about the state
*  of society? I wanted to figure out what was going on. Because what I noticed was a bad trend. It's
*  not that you know, things are bad. It's that things are getting worse in certain ways, not in every
*  way. If you look at Max Roser stuff, you know, he comes up with all these amazing graphs. This is
*  what's weird is that things are getting better in almost every important metric you can think of.
*  Except the amount of people who hate other people in their own country, and the amount of people that
*  hate their own country that the amount of Americans that hate America is on the rise, right? The
*  amount of Americans that hate other Americans is on the rise. The amount of Americans that hate the
*  president is on the rise, all these things like on the very steep rise. So what the hell what's
*  going on? Like there's something there's something causing that it's not that we know a bunch of new
*  people were born who were just dicks. It's that something is going on. So I think of it as
*  a very simple oversimplified equation, human behavior. And it's the output that I think the
*  two inputs are human nature and environment, right? And this is basic, you know, super,
*  super kindergarten level, like, you know, animal behavior. But I think it's worth thinking about,
*  you've got human nature, which is not changing very much, right? And then you got you throw that
*  nature into a certain environment, and it reacts to the environment, right? It's shaped by the
*  environment. And then eventually, what comes out is behavior, right? Human nature is not changing
*  very much, but suddenly we're behaving differently, right? We are, again, you know, look at the polls,
*  like, it used to be that the president, you know, was liked by I don't remember the exact numbers,
*  but you know, 80% or 70% of of their own party and, you know, 50% of the other party. And now it's
*  like 40% of their own party and 10% of the other party, you know, it's, it's, and it's not that the
*  presidents are getting worse, maybe some people would argue that they are, but more so, there's
*  a lot of, you know, idiot presidents throughout the what's going on is something in the environment
*  is changing. And the best difference you're seeing is a change in behavior. Easy example here is that,
*  you know, by a lot of metrics, racism is getting is becoming less and less of a problem. You know,
*  this hard to measure, but there's metrics like, you know, how upset would you be if your kid married
*  someone of another race? And that number is plummeting, but racial grievance is skyrocketing,
*  right? There's a lot of examples like this. So I wanted to look around and say, and the reason I
*  took it on the reason I don't think this is just an unfortunate trend, unpleasant trend that
*  hopefully we come out of is that all this other stuff I like to write about all this future stuff,
*  right? And is this magical? I always think of this, I'm very optimistic in a lot of ways. And I think
*  that our world would be a utopia would seem like actual heaven, like whatever Thomas Jefferson was
*  picturing as heaven, other than maybe the eternal life aspect, I think that if he came to 2021 US,
*  it would be better. It's cooler than heaven. What we live in a place that's cooler than 1700s heaven,
*  again, other than the fact that we still die. Now, I think that future world actually probably would
*  have quote, eternal life. I don't think anyone wants eternal life, actually, if people think
*  they do. Eternal is a long time, but I think the choice to die when you want, maybe we're uploaded,
*  maybe we can refresh our bodies. I don't know what it is. But the point is, I think about that utopia.
*  And I do believe that like, if we don't botch this, we'd be heading towards somewhere that would seem
*  like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes. Of course, if things go wrong, now think about the trends here.
*  Just like the 20th century would seem like some magical utopia to someone from the 16th century,
*  the bad things in the 20th century were kind of the worst things ever in terms of just absolute
*  magnitude. World War II, the biggest genocides ever. You've got maybe climate change, if it is
*  the existential threat that many people think it is. We never had an existential threat on that
*  level before. So the good is getting better and the bad is getting worse. And so what I think about
*  the future, I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a species, five million mile long
*  canoe, each of us sitting in a row. And we each have one arm, we can paddle on the left side or
*  the right side. And what we know is there's a fork up there somewhere. And at the river forks,
*  and there's a utopia on one side and a dystopia on the other side. And I really believe that
*  that's, we're probably not headed for just an okay future. It's just the way tech is exploding,
*  like it's probably going to be really good or really bad. The question is, which side should
*  we be rowing on? We can't see up there, right? But it really matters. So I'm running about with
*  this future stuff and I'm saying none of this matters if we're squabbling our way into kind of
*  like a civil war right now. So what's going on? So it's a really important problem to solve.
*  What are your sources of hope in this? So like, how do you steer the canoe? One of my big sources
*  of hope, and this is my putting my answer to what I changed my mind on, is I think I always knew
*  this, but it's easy to forget it. Our primitive brain does not remember this fact, which is that
*  I don't think there are very many bad people. Now, you say bad, are there selfish people? Most of us,
*  I think that if you think of people, there's digital languages, ones and zeros. And our
*  primitive brain very quickly can get into the land where everyone's a one or a zero. Our tribe,
*  we're all ones. We're perfect. I'm perfect. My family is that other family, is that other tribe.
*  There are zeros and you dehumanize them, right? These people are awful. So zero is not a human
*  place. No one's a zero and no one's a one. You're dehumanizing yourself. So when we get into this
*  land, I call it political Disney world because the Disney movies have good guys. Scar is totally bad
*  and Mufasa is totally good, right? You don't see Mufasa's character flaws. You don't see Scar's
*  upbringing that made him like that, that humanizes him. No, lionizes him, whatever. You are-
*  Well done.
*  Mufasa's a one and Scar's a zero. Very simple. So political Disney world is a place,
*  a psychological place that all of us have been in. And it can be religious Disney world, it can be
*  national Disney world and war, whatever it is. But it's a place where we fall into this delusion
*  that there are protagonists and antagonists and that's it, right? That is not true. We are all
*  0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that. We are also, on one hand, I don't think there's that many really
*  great people, frankly. I think if you get into it, people are kind of a lot of people. You know,
*  most of us have, you know, if you get really into our most shameful memories, the things we've done
*  that are worse, the most shameful thoughts, the deep selfishness that some of us have in areas
*  we wouldn't want to admit, right? Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right? On the other
*  hand, if you actually got into, really got into someone else's brain and you looked at their
*  upbringing, you looked at the trauma that they've experienced and then you looked at the insecurities
*  they have and you look at all their- if you assemble the highlight reel of your worst moments,
*  the meanest things you've ever done, the worst, the most selfish, the times you, you know,
*  you stole something, whatever, and you just have- people think, wow, Lex is an awful person.
*  If you highlighted your- if you did a montage of your best moments, people say, oh, he's a god,
*  right? But of course, we all have both of those. So, I've started to really try to remind myself
*  that everyone's a 0.5, right? And 0.5s are all worthy of criticism and we're all worthy of
*  compassion. And the thing that makes me hopeful is that I really think that there's a bunch of
*  0.5s and 0.5s are good enough that we should be able to create a good society together. There's
*  a lot of love in every human. And I think there's more love in humans than hate. You know, I always
*  remember this moment. This is- we're in an anecdote, but I was at a- I'm a Red Sox fan,
*  Boston Red Sox baseball, and Derek Jeter is who we hate the most. He's on the Yankees.
*  He is. And hate, right? Ugh, Jeter, right? He was his last game in Fenway. He's retiring. And he
*  got this rousing standing ovation and I almost cried. And it was like, what is going on? We hate
*  this guy, but actually, there's so much love in all humans. You know, it felt so good to just give
*  a huge cheer to this guy we hate because it's like this moment of like a little fist pound being like,
*  of course, we all actually love each other. And I think there's so much of that. And so, the thing
*  that I think I've come around on is I just- I think that we are in an environment that's bringing out
*  really bad stuff. I don't think it's- if I thought it was the people, I would be more hopeful. Like,
*  if I thought it was human nature, I'd be, you know, I'd be more upset. It's the two independent
*  variables here, or there's a fixed variable, there's a constant, which is human nature,
*  and there's the independent variable environment, and the behavior is the dependent variable.
*  I like that the thing that I think is bad is the independent variable, the environment,
*  which means I think we can- the environment can get better. And there's a lot of things I can go
*  into about why the environment I think is bad, but I have hope because I think the thing that's bad
*  for us is something that can change. The first principles idea here is that most people have
*  the capacity to be a 0.7 to a 0.9 if the environment is properly calibrated with the right incentives.
*  Yeah, if we're all 0.5s, I think that environments can bring out our good side. You know, yes,
*  if maybe we're all on some kind of distribution, and the right environment can, yes, can bring out
*  our higher sides. And I think in a lot of ways, you could say it has. I mean, the US environment,
*  we take for granted how the liberal laws and liberal environment that we live in. I mean,
*  like in New York City, right, if you walk down the street and you like assault someone,
*  A, if anyone sees you, they're probably going to yell at you, you might get your ass kicked
*  by someone for doing that. You also might end up in jail, you know, if it's security cameras,
*  and there's just norms, you know, we're all trained. That's what awful people do, right?
*  It's not that human nature doesn't have it in it to be like that. It's that this environment
*  we're in has made that a much, much, much smaller experience for people. There's so many examples
*  like that where it's like, man, you don't realize how much of the worst human nature is contained
*  by our environment. But I think that, you know, rapidly changing environment, which is what we
*  have right now, social media starts. I mean, what a seismic change to the environment. There's a lot
*  of examples like that. Rapidly changing environment can create rapidly changing behavior. And
*  wisdom sometimes can't keep up. And so we, you know, we can, we can really kind of lose our grip
*  on some of the good behavior. Were you surprised by Elon's answer about brain transplants or
*  Sam's about nuclear power or anything else? Just Sam's, I think is, I have a friend,
*  Isabelle Beaumet gay, who has a, who's a nuclear power influencer. I've become very convinced. And
*  I've not done my deep dive on this, but here's, in this case, this is, this is reasoning by analogy
*  here. The amount of really smart people I respect who all who seem to have dug in, who all say
*  nuclear power is clearly a good option. It's obviously emission free, but you know, the
*  the concerns about meltdowns and waste, they see it, they say completely overblown. So judging from
*  those people, secondary knowledge here, I will say I'm, I'm, I'm a strong advocate. I haven't done my
*  own deep dive yet, but it does seem like a little bit odd that you've got people who are so concerned
*  about climate change, who have, it seems like it's kind of an ideology where nuclear power doesn't
*  fit rather than rational, you know, fear of climate change that somehow is anti nuclear power. It just,
*  yeah, I personally am uncomfortably reasoning by analogy with climate change. I've actually have not
*  done a deep dive myself. Me neither, because it's so, man, it seems like a deep dive. And,
*  and my reasoning by analogy there currently has me thinking it's a truly existential thing,
*  but feeling hopeful. So let me, this is me speaking, and this is speaking from a person who's not done
*  the deep dive. I'm a little suspicious of the amount of fear mongering going on. I've, especially
*  over the past couple of years, I've gotten uncomfortable with fear mongering in all walks
*  of life. There's way too many people interested in manipulating the populace with fear. And so I
*  don't like it. I should probably do a deep dive because to me it's at the, well, the, the big
*  problem with the opposition to climate change or whatever the fear mongering is that it also grows
*  the skepticism and science broadly. It's like, and that, so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.
*  I have listened to a few folks who kind of criticize the fear mongering and all those
*  kinds of things, but they're few and far in between. And so it's like, all right, what is the truth
*  here? And it feels lazy, but it also feels like it's hard to get to the, like, there's a lot of kind
*  of activists talking about idea versus, um, like sources of objective, like calm first principles
*  type reasoning. Like one of the things I know it's supposed to be a very big problem, but when
*  people talk about catastrophic effects of climate change, I haven't been able to like see really
*  great deep analysis of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years, raising, uh, rising sea levels.
*  What are the models of how that changes human behavior, society? What are the things that
*  happen? There's going to be constraints on the resources and people are going to have to move
*  around. This is happening gradually. Are we going to be able to respond to this? How would we respond
*  to this? What are the best, like, what are the best models for how everything goes wrong? Again,
*  I was, uh, this is a question I keep starting to ask myself without doing any research, uh,
*  like motivating myself to get up to the, this deep dive that I feel is deep, just watching people not
*  do a great job of that kind of modeling with the pandemic and sort of being caught off guard and
*  wondering, okay, if we're not good with this pandemic, how are we going to respond to other
*  kinds of tragedies? Well, this is part of why I wrote the book because I said we're going to have
*  more and more of these like big collective, what should we do here situations, you know, whether
*  it's how about when, you know, uh, we're probably not that far away from people being able to, um,
*  go and decide the IQ of their kid or like, you know, make a bunch of embryos and actually,
*  you know, pick the highest IQ. Can possibly go wrong. Yeah. And also like imagine the political
*  sides of that and like something that only wealthy people can afford at first and just the nightmare,
*  right? We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species where we can actually get into a
*  topic like that and, and come up with where the collective brain can be smart. I think that there
*  are certain topics where I think of, I think of this, and this is again, another simplistic model,
*  but I think it works is that there's a higher mind and a primitive mind, right? You can, you know,
*  in your head and these team up with others. So when the higher minds are in a higher mind is,
*  is more rational and puts out ideas that it's not attached to. And so it can, it can change its mind
*  easily because it's just an idea and the higher mind can get criticized. Their ideas can get
*  criticized and it's no big deal. And so when the higher minds team up, it's like all these people
*  in the room, like throwing out ideas and kicking them and, and, and one idea goes out and everyone
*  criticizes it, which is like, you know, shooting bows and arrows at it. And there's the truth,
*  the true idea is, you know, the bow, the arrows bounce off and it's so, okay, it rises up and the
*  other ones get shot down. So it's this incredible system. This is what, you know, this is what
*  good science institution is, is, you know, someone puts out a thing, criticism arrows come at it. And,
*  you know, most of them fall and the needle is in the haystack end up rising up, right?
*  Incredible mechanism. So what that's happening is a bunch of people, a bunch of flawed medium
*  scientists are creating super intelligence. Then there's the primitive mind, which, you know,
*  is the, the, the, the more limbic system me part of our brain. It's the, it's a part of us that is
*  very much not living in 2021. It's living many tens of thousands of years ago and it does not
*  treat ideas like this separate thing. It identifies with its ideas. It only gets involved when it
*  finds an idea sacred. It starts holding an idea sacred and I starts identifying. So what happens
*  is they team up too. And so when you have a topic, uh, that a bunch of primitive, that really rouses
*  a bunch of primitive minds, um, it, uh, it quickly, the primitive minds team up and they create an
*  echo chamber where suddenly no one can criticize this. And in fact, if the ad is powerful enough,
*  people outside the community, you can, no one can criticize it. We will get your paper attracted.
*  We will get you fired, right? That's not higher mind behavior. That is crazy primitive mind.
*  And so now what happens is the collective becomes dumber than an individual, a dumber than a reason,
*  a single reasoning individual. You have this collective is suddenly attached to this sacred
*  scripture with the idea and they, and they will not change their mind and they get dumber and
*  dumber. And so climate change, what's, what's worrisome is that climate change has in many ways
*  become a sacred topic where if you come up with a nuanced thing, you might get called branded a
*  denier. So there goes the, there goes the super intelligence, all the arrows, no arrows can be
*  fired. But when you get called a denier, that's a social penalty for firing an arrow at a certain
*  orthodoxy. Right? And so what's happening is the big brain gets like frozen, right? And it becomes
*  very stupid. Now you can also say that about a lot of other topics right now. Uh, you know, you,
*  you know, um, uh, you just mentioned another one, I forget what it was, but that's also kind of
*  like this, the world of vaccine. Yeah. Yeah. COVID. Okay. And here's my point earlier is that we,
*  what I see is that the political divide has, is like a whirlpool that's pulling everything into
*  it. And in that whirlpool, uh, thinking is done with the primitive mind, uh, tribes. And so
*  I get, you know, okay, obviously something like race, right? That makes sense. That,
*  that also right now, the topic of race, for example, or gender, these things are in the
*  whirlpool, but that at least is like, okay, that's something that the primitive mind would always get
*  really worked up about, you know, it's, it taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.
*  Um, COVID, you know, make this COVID in a way too, but you know, climate change, like that should
*  just be something that our rational brains are like, let's solve this complex problem. But the
*  problem is that it's all gotten sucked into the red versus blue whirlpool. And once that happens,
*  it's in the hands of the primitive minds and we're losing our ability to be wise together,
*  to make decisions. Uh, we're, it's like, it's like, it's like the big species brain is like,
*  or the big American brain is like drunk at the wheel right now. And we're about to go into our
*  future with more and more big technologies, uh, scary things, but to make big right decisions and
*  not, you know, we're getting dumber as a collective and that that's part of this environmental problem.
*  So within the space of technologists and the space of scientists, we should allow the arrows.
*  That's one of the saddest things to me about is like the scientists, like I,
*  I've seen arrogance, there's a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe. It's the arrogance,
*  it's a, it's how you built up the, this mechanism that defends this wall that
*  defends against the arrows. It's, uh, arrogance, credentialism, like, um, just ego really.
*  And then just, it protects you from actually challenging your own ideas. This ideal of science
*  that makes science beautiful in, in a time of fear and in a time of division created by perhaps
*  politicians that leverage the fear. It, like you said, makes the whole system dumber, the science
*  system dumber, uh, the, the tech developer system dumber if they don't allow the challenging of
*  ideas. What's really bad is that like in a normal environment, you're always going to have echo
*  chambers. And so what's the opposite of an echo chamber? I created a term for, cause I think we
*  need it, which is called an idea lab, an idea lab, right? It's like people treat, it's like people act
*  like scientists, even if they're not doing science, they just treat their ideas like
*  science experiments and they toss them out there and everyone disagrees and disagreement is like
*  the game. Everyone likes to disagree, you know, on a certain text thread where everyone is just,
*  you know, saying, you know, it's almost like someone throws something out and just, it's an
*  impulse for the rest of the group to say, Oh, I think you're being like, uh, overly general there.
*  Or I think like, aren't you kind of being, I think that's like your bias showing. And it's like,
*  no one's getting offended because it's like, we're all just messing. We all of course respect each
*  other. Obviously we're just, we're just, you know, trashing each other's ideas and that the
*  whole group becomes smarter. You're always going to have idea labs and echo chambers, right? In
*  different communities. And most of us participate in both of them, you know, and you know, maybe in
*  your marriage is a great idea lab. You love to disagree with your, your spouse and maybe in,
*  but this group of friends or your family at home, you know, you know, in front of that sister,
*  you do not bring up politics because she's now enforced when that happens, her bullying is forcing
*  the whole room to be an echo chamber to appease her. Now what's, what scares me is that usually
*  have these things existing kind of in bubbles and usually there's like, and they each have their
*  natural defenses against each other. So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber. They
*  don't like, they, they, they will cut you out. They don't like, they don't like to be friends
*  with people who disagree with them. You notice that they will cut you out. They'll cut out their
*  parents if they voted for Trump or whatever. Right? So they're, um, that's how they do it.
*  They will say, I'm going to stay inside of an echo chamber safely. So my ideas, which I identify
*  with, um, because my primitive mind is doing the thinking are not going to ever have to get
*  challenged because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen. But if they leave and they go into
*  an ideal of environment, they're going to, people are going to say, what? No, they're going to
*  disagree. And they're going to say, and the person is going to try to bully them. They're going to
*  say, uh, that's really offensive. And people are going to say, no, it's not. And they're going to,
*  they're going to immediately say, these people are assholes. Right? So the echo chamber person,
*  it doesn't have much power once they leave the echo chamber. Likewise, the idea lab person,
*  they have this great environment, but they go into an echo chamber where everyone else is,
*  and they do that, they'll get kicked out of the group. They'll get branded as something, you know,
*  a denier or a racist, uh, you know, a right-winger or radical, you know, these, these,
*  these nasty words. Um, the thing that I don't like right now is that the echo chambers have
*  found ways to forcefully expand into places that normally are, have a pretty good immune system
*  against echo chambers, like universities, like science journals, places where usually it's like,
*  there's a strong idea lab culture there, Veritas, you know, you know, that that's,
*  that's an idea lab slogan. Um, you have, is that these people have found a way to,
*  a lot of people have found a way to actually go out of their thing and keep their echo chamber
*  by making sure that everyone is scared because they can punish anyone, whether you're in their
*  community or not. That's, uh, all brilliantly put. When's the book coming up? And the idea
*  June, July, we're not quite sure yet. Okay. I can't wait. Thanks. It's awesome.
*  Do you have a title yet or you can't talk about that? Still working on it. Okay. Uh,
*  if it's okay, just a couple of questions from mailbag. I just love these. I would love to,
*  I would love to hear you, uh, riff on these. So one is about film and music. Why do we prefer
*  to watch? The question goes, why do we prefer to watch a film we haven't watched before,
*  but we want to listen to songs that we have heard hundreds of times.
*  This question and your answer really started to make me think like, yeah, that's true.
*  That's really interesting. Like we draw that line somehow. So what's the answer?
*  So I think let's use these two minds again. I think that when your higher mind is the one
*  who's taking something in and they're really interested in, you know, what are the lyrics?
*  Or I'm going to learn something or what, you know, the reading a book or whatever. And the higher
*  mind is, um, is trying to get information. And once it has it, there's no point in listening to
*  it again. It has the information. Um, you know, your rational brain is like, I got it.
*  But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever, you're, that's something you can do
*  again and again, because it actually, your primitive brain loves it, right? And it never
*  gets sport of things that it loves. So I think music is a very primal thing. I think music goes
*  right into our primitive brain. Um, a lot, you know, um, you know, I think it's, of course,
*  that's a column of collaboration. You're, you know, your, your rational brain is absorbing the
*  actual message. And, but I think it's all about emotions and even more than emotions. It literally
*  like the music taps into like some very, very deep, um, you know, primal part of us. And so
*  when you hear a song once, even your, some of your favorite songs, the first time you heard it, you
*  were like, I guess that's kind of catchy. Yeah. And then some, and then, then you end up loving
*  it on the 10th listen, but sometimes you even don't even like a song. You're like, oh, this
*  song sucks. But you suddenly, you find yourself on the 40th time, cause it's on the radio all the
*  time, just kind of being like, oh, I love this song. And you're like, wait, I, I don't, I hated
*  this song. And what's happening is that the sound is actually, the music is actually carving a
*  pathway in your brain and it's a dance. And when your brain knows what's coming, it can dance. It
*  knows the steps. So your brain is your internal kind of, um, your brain is actually dancing with
*  the music and it knows the steps and it can anticipate. Um, and it, and it, and so there's
*  something about knowing, having memorized the song, that makes it incredibly enjoyable to us.
*  But when we hear it for the first time, we don't know where it's going to go. We're like an awkward
*  dancer. We don't know the steps and your primitive brain can't really have that much fun.
*  And in the movies, that's more, that's less primitive. That's the story you're, you're,
*  you're taking in, but a really good movie that we really love. Often we will watch it like 12
*  times, you know, it's still like it, you know, not, not that many, but versus if you're watching a
*  talk show, right. You're listening to, if you're listening to a podcast, one of your podcasts,
*  as a perfect example, there's not many people that will listen to one of your podcasts, no matter how
*  good it is 12 times, because it's, you, you, once you've got it, you got it. It's a form of
*  information that's very higher mind focused. That's how I,
*  well, you know, the funny thing is there is people that listen to a podcast episode many, many times.
*  And often I think the reason for that is not because the information is the chemistry is the
*  music of the conversation. So it's not the actual, it's the art of it. They like, yeah,
*  yeah, they'll, they'll fall in love with some kind of person, some weird personality,
*  and they'll just be listening to, they'll be captivated by the, the beat of that kind of
*  person. Like a standup comic. I've watched like certain things, like episodes, like 20 times,
*  even though I, you know, I have to ask you about the wizard hat. You're on a blog about Neuralink.
*  I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times, hanging out with those folks.
*  Um, that was one of the pieces of writing you did that like
*  changes culture and changes the way people think about a thing.
*  The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings are somehow, um,
*  it's like, you know, it's like calling the origin of the universe, the big bang.
*  It's a silly title, but it somehow sticks to be the representative of, uh, of that in the same
*  way the wizard had for the Neuralink is, um, somehow it was a really powerful way to,
*  to explain that. You actually proposed that the, the man of the year cover of time should be,
*  um, one of my drawings, one of your drawings is an outrage that it wasn't. Okay. So, uh,
*  what are your thoughts about like all those years later about Neuralink? What would,
*  do you find this idea? Like what excites you about is the big long-term philosophical things?
*  Is it the practical things? Do you think it's super difficult to do on the neurosurgery side
*  and the material engineering, the robotic side? Or do you think, um, the machine learning side
*  for the brain computer interfaces, where they get to learn about each other, all that kind of stuff?
*  I would just love to get your thoughts. Cause you're one of the people that really considered
*  this problem, really studied it. Yeah. Computer interfaces. I mean, I'm super excited about it.
*  It's a, I really think it's actually Elon's most ambitious thing, more than colonizing Mars,
*  because that's just a bunch of people going somewhere, even though it's somewhere far.
*  Neuralink is changing what a person is, um, eventually. Now I think that Neuralink
*  engineers and Elon himself would all be the first to admit that it is a maybe that whether they,
*  whether they can do their goals here. I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to,
*  their eventual goals are, you know, of course in the, in the interim, they have a higher
*  probability of accomplishing smaller things, which are still huge. Like basically solving paralysis,
*  you know, strokes, Parkinson, things like that. I mean, it can be unbelievable. And, you know,
*  anyone who doesn't have one of these things, like we might, you know, we should, everyone should be
*  very happy about, um, this kind of, um, helping with different disabilities. Um, but the thing
*  that is like, so the grand goal is this augmentation where it's, you take someone
*  who's totally healthy and you put a pre-machine interface in any way to give them superpowers.
*  Um, I, you know, it's the, the possibilities of they can do this, if they can really, so,
*  you know, they've already shown that they are for real with, you know, they've created this robot.
*  Elon talks about like, it should be like LASIK where it's not, it shouldn't be something that
*  needs a surgeon. This shouldn't just be for rich people who have waited in line for six months.
*  It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK and eventually, hopefully something that isn't covered
*  by insurance or, you know, something that anyone can do. Um, something this big a deal should be
*  something that anyone can afford eventually. And when we have this, again, I'm talking about a very
*  advanced phase down the road. So maybe a less advanced phase, just to, just there, maybe right
*  now, uh, if you think about when you listen to a mute, when you listen to a song, what's happening
*  is, do you actually hear the sound? Well, not really. It's that the sound is coming out of the
*  speaker. The speaker is vibrating. It's vibrating air molecules. Those air molecules, you know,
*  get vibrated all the way to your, your head. Um, uh, the pressure wave and then it vibrates your
*  ear drum. Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head that then vibrates bones and
*  fluid, which then it stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex, which give you the perception
*  that you're hearing sound. Now, if you think about that, do we really need to have a speaker to do
*  that? You could just somehow, if you had a little tiny thing that could vibrate your drums, you could
*  do it that way. That seems very hard, but really what you need to go to the very end with a thing
*  that really needs to happen is your auditory cortex neurons need to be stimulated in a certain
*  way. If you have a ton of Neuralink things in their Neuralink electrodes and they get really
*  good at stimulating things, you could play a song in your head that you hear that is not playing
*  anywhere. There's no sound in the room, but you hear it and no one else could. It's not like they
*  can get close to your head and hear it. There's no sound. They could not hear anything, but you hear
*  sound. You can turn up, so you open your phone, you have the Neuralink app, you open the Neuralink
*  app, you know, and, and, or just Neuralink. So, so basically you can open your Spotify and you can
*  play to, you know, you're, you're, you can play to your speaker, you can play to your computer,
*  you can play right out of your phone to your headphones, or you can, you now have a new one.
*  You can play into your brain. And this is one of the earlier things. This is, you know, something
*  that seems like really doable. So, you know, no more headphones. I always think it's so annoying
*  because I can leave the house with just my phone, you know, and nothing else. Or even just an Apple
*  watch. There's always this one thing, like, and headphones. You do need your headphones, right?
*  So I feel like, you know, that'll be the end of that. But there's so many things that you,
*  and you keep going, the ability to think together, you know, you can talk about like super brains.
*  I mean, one of the examples Elon uses is that the low bandwidth of speech. If I go to a movie,
*  and I, and I come out of a scary movie and you say, how was I so it was terrifying? Well,
*  what did I just do? I just gave you, I just gave you, I had five buckets I could have given you.
*  One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy, whatever. That's about it. And I had
*  much more nuanced experience than that. And I don't all I have is, you know, these, these words,
*  right? And so instead, I just hand you the bucket. I put the stuff in the bucket and give it to you.
*  But all you have is the bucket, you just have to guess what I put into that bucket. All you can do
*  is look at the label of the bucket and say, I'll us when I say terrifying, here's what I mean.
*  So the point is, it's very lossy. I had this all this new and nuanced information of what I thought
*  of the movie, and I'm sending you a very low res package that you're going to now guess what the
*  high res thing looked like. That's language in general, our thoughts are much more nuanced.
*  We can think to each other, we can do amazing things. We could have a brainstorm that doesn't
*  feel like, oh, we're not talking in each other's heads. Not just that I hear your voice. No, no,
*  no, we are just thinking no, no words are being said internally or externally. The two brains are
*  literally collaborating is something it's a skill. I'm sure we'd have to get good at it. I'm sure
*  young kids will be great at it and old people will be bad. But you think together and together,
*  you like, oh, had the joint epiphany. And now how about eight people in a room doing it, right?
*  So it gets, you know, there's other examples. How about when you're a dress designer or a bridge
*  designer and you want to show people what your dress looks like? Well, right now you got to
*  sketch it for a long time here. Just beam it onto the screen from your head so you can picture it.
*  If you can picture a tree in your head, well, you can just suddenly, whatever's in your head,
*  you can be pictured. So we'll have to get very good at it and take a skill, right? You know,
*  you're going to have to, but the possibilities, my God, talk about like, I feel like if that works,
*  if we really do have that as something, I think it'll almost be like a new ADBC line. It's such a
*  big change that the idea of like anyone living before everyone had brain machine interfaces is
*  living in like before the common era. It's that level of like big change if it can work.
*  Yeah. And the like replay of memories, just replaying stuff in your head.
*  Oh my God. Yeah. And copying, you know, you can hopefully copy memories onto other things and
*  you don't have to just rely on your, you know, your wet circuitry.
*  It does make me sad because you're right. The brain is incredibly neuroplastic and so it can
*  adjust. It can learn how to do this. I think it'll be a skill, but probably you and I will be too
*  old to truly learn. Well, maybe we can get, there'll be great trainings. You know, I'm spending the
*  next three months in like, you know, in a neuro, one of the neurolink trainings. But it'll still be
*  a bit of like grandpa can't. Definitely. This is, you know, I always think, how am I going to be old?
*  I'm like, no, I'm going to be great at the new phones. It's like, how can it be the phones?
*  It's going to be that, you know, the kid's going to be thinking to me and I'm going to be like,
*  I just, can you just talk please? And they're going to be like, okay, I'll just talk and they're
*  going to. So that'll be the equivalent of, you know, yelling to your grandma today.
*  I really suspect that. I don't know what your thoughts are, but I grew up in a time when
*  physical contact interaction was valuable. I just feel like that's going to go the way
*  that's going to disappear. Why? I mean, is there anything more intimate than thinking with each
*  other? I mean, that's, you talk about, you know, once we were all doing that, it might feel like,
*  man, everyone was so isolated from each other. Yeah, sorry. So I didn't say that intimacy
*  disappears. I just meant physical having to be in the same, having to touch each other.
*  People like that. If it is important, won't there be whole waves of people start to say, you know,
*  there's all these articles that come out about how, you know, in our metaverse, we've lost
*  something important. And then now there's a huge, I'll first the hippies start doing it and then
*  eventually it becomes this big wave and now everyone won't, you know, if something truly is
*  lost, won't we recover it? Well, I think from first principles, all of the components are there
*  to engineer intimate experiences in the metaverse or in the, in the, in the cyberspace. And so to me,
*  it's, it, it, I don't see anything profoundly unique to the physical experience. Like, I don't
*  understand. But then why are you saying there's a loss there? No, I'm just sad because I won't,
*  oh, it's a loss for me personally, because the, the, the world. So then you do think there's
*  something unique in the physical experience for me because I was raised with it. Yeah. So whatever,
*  so that anything you're raised with, you fall in love with, like people in this country came up with
*  baseball. I was raised in the Soviet union. I don't understand baseball. I get, I like it,
*  but I don't love it the way Americans love it. Um, and so, because a lot of times it went to, to,
*  to baseball games with the father and then there's that family connection. There's a young kid
*  dreaming about, I don't know, um, becoming an MLB player himself. I don't know something like that,
*  but that, that's what you're raised with. Obviously it's really important, but I mean,
*  fundamentally to the human experience, listen, we're doing this podcast in person. So clearly I,
*  I still value it, but. But it's true. If this were obviously through a screen, we all agree. That's
*  not the same. Yeah, it's not the same. But if this were some, you know, we had contact lenses on and
*  like, you know, maybe neurolink, you know, play maybe again, forget, again, this is all the, the
*  devices, even if it's just as cool as a contact lens, that's all old school. Once you have the
*  brain machine interface, it'll just be projection of, you know, it'll take over my visual cortex.
*  My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room and so will yours. So we will see, we will hear,
*  really hear and see as if where you won't have any masks, no VR mask needed. And at that point,
*  it really will feel like you will forget. You'll say, well, read together and physically or not,
*  it'd be so unimportant you won't even remember. And you're right. This is one of those
*  shits in society that changes everything. Romantically, people still need to be
*  together. That there's a whole set of like physical things with a relationship that are needed,
*  you know, like, like what, like sex, sex, but also just like that, that there's pheromones,
*  like there's the physical touch is such a, that's like music. It's goes to such a deeply primitive
*  part of us that what physical touch with a romantic partner does that I think that,
*  so I'm sure there'll be a whole wave of people who their new thing is that, you know, you're
*  romantically involved people you never actually in person with, but, and I'm sure there'll be
*  things where you can actually smell what's in the room and you can, yeah, and touch. Yeah. But I
*  think that'll be one of the last things to go. I think there'll be, there's something that to me
*  seems like something that'll be, be a while before people feel like there's nothing lost by not being
*  it's, it's, it's very difficult to replicate the human interaction. Although sex also, again, you
*  could not to get too like weird, but you could have a thing where you, you basically, you know,
*  or, you know, you're, let's just do a massage because it's less like awkward, but like you,
*  someone, you know, everyone is still imagining sex. So go on. A masseuse could massage a fake body
*  and you could feel whatever's happening, right? So you're lying down in your apartment alone,
*  but you're feeling a full. That'll be the new like YouTube or like streaming where it's one
*  masseuse massaging one body, but like a thousand people are experiencing. Exactly. Right. Now think
*  about it right now. You know, Taylor Swift doesn't play for one person. It had to go around and every,
*  every one of her fans just to go play for or a book, right? You do it and it goes everywhere.
*  So it'll be the same idea. You've written and thought a lot about AI. So AI safety specifically,
*  you've mentioned you're actually starting a podcast, which is awesome. You're so good at
*  talking, so good at thinking, so good at being weird in the most beautiful of ways. But you've
*  been thinking about this AI safety question. Where today does your concern lie for the,
*  for the near future, for the longterm future? Like quite a bit of stuff happened, including with
*  Elon's work with Tesla autopilot. There's a bunch of amazing robots with Boston dynamics and everyone's
*  favorite vacuum robot, I robot Roomba. And then there's obviously the applications of machine
*  learning for recommender systems and Twitter, Facebook, and so on. And, you know, face recognition
*  for surveillance, all these kinds of things are happening. Just a lot of incredible use of not the
*  face recognition, but the incredible use of deep learning machine learning to capture information
*  about people and try to recommend to them what they want to
*  consume next. Some of that can be abused. Some of that can be used for good,
*  like for Netflix or something like that. What are your thoughts about all this?
*  Yeah, I mean, I really don't think humans are very smart. All like all things considered, I think
*  we're like limited. And we're not we're dumb enough that we're very easily manipulable,
*  not just like, oh, like our emotions, people can, you know, our emotions can be pulled like
*  puppet strings. I mean, again, I look at like I do look at what's going on with political polarization
*  now. And I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening. So yeah, there's a lot to be scared of
*  for sure. Like very scared of. I get excited about a lot of very specific things. Like one of the
*  things I get excited about is I like the so the future of wearables, right? Again, I think that
*  would be like, oh, the wrist, the fit bit around my wrist is going to seem or the whoop
*  is going to seem really hilariously old school in 20 years. Like with Neuralink,
*  like a big bracelet, right? It's going to turn into little sensors in our blood, probably. Or,
*  you know, even, you know, infrared, we're, you know, just just just just things that are going
*  to be collecting 100 times more data than it collects now, more nuanced data, more specific
*  to our body. And it's going to be, you know, super reliable, but that's the hardware side.
*  And then the software is going to be this is I've not done my deep dive. This is all speculation,
*  but the software is going to get really good. And this is the AI component. And so I get excited
*  about specific things like that. Like think about if you're if if hardware were able to collect
*  first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome and we know a lot more about what a genome
*  sequence means because you can collect your genome now and we just don't know much. We okay,
*  we don't have much to do with that information as AI gets. So now you have your genome. You've got
*  what's in your blood at any given moment, all the levels of everything, right? You have the exact
*  width of your heart arteries at any given moment. You've got all the all the virons, all the viruses
*  that ever visited your body because there's a trace of it. So you have all the pathogens,
*  all the things that like you should be concerned about health wise and might have threatened you,
*  you might be immune from all that kind of stuff. They also of course, it knows how fast your heart
*  is beating and it knows how much you know exactly the amount of exercise, knows your muscle mass and
*  your weight and all that. But it also maybe can even know your emotions. I mean, make it if emotions,
*  you know, what are they, you know, where do they come from? Probably pretty obvious chemicals once
*  we get in there. So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe in collecting information.
*  You know, because right now you have to do the thing, what's your mood right now? And it's hard
*  to even assess, you know, you're in a bad mood, it's hard to even. But by the way, just as a
*  shout out to Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's in your scientist at Northeastern just wrote a,
*  not just like a few years ago, wrote a whole book saying our expression of emotions has nothing to
*  do with the experience of emotion. So you really actually want to be measuring. That's exactly.
*  You can tell because one of these apps pops up and says, you know, what, how do you feel right now?
*  Good, bad? I'm like, I don't know, like I feel bad right now because the thing popping up reminded
*  me that I'm procrastinating. So I was on my phone, I should be like, you know, like that's not my,
*  so I think it will probably be able to very, get all this info, right? Now the AI can go to town.
*  Think about when the AI gets really good at this and it knows your genome and it knows, it can just,
*  I want the AI to just tell me what to do. When it turns up, okay, for wanting to, so how about this,
*  now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right? And the meal service has everything,
*  you know, all the, you know, million ingredients and supplements and vitamins and everything.
*  And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals. I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know,
*  maintain my weight, but I want to have more energy or whatever. I just want, or I want to, you know,
*  I just want to be very healthy and I want to, obviously everyone wants the same like 10 basic
*  things, like you want to avoid cancer, you want to, you know, various things, you want to age slower.
*  So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at, you know, a little thing pops up and it says like,
*  you know, beep beep, like, you know, 15 minutes you're going to eat because it knows that's a
*  great, that's the right time for my body to eat. 15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall
*  where a drone has come from the factory, the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect
*  meal for my, that moment for me, for my mood, for my genome, for my blood contents. And it's,
*  because it knows my goals. So, you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time and then I want
*  to wind down here. So those things you have to tell it. Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it
*  knows what kind of components of a meal you've enjoyed in the past so you can assemble the perfect
*  meal in terms of taste. Exactly. It knows you way better than you know yourself, better than any
*  human could ever know you. And a little thing pops up. You still have some choice, right? Still,
*  it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee because it knows that, you know, my cutoff,
*  they says, you know, I can have coffee for the next 15 minutes only because at that point it
*  knows how long it stays in my system. It knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late.
*  It knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow because that's my calendar. And so I think a lot
*  of people's this is, I think something that humans are wrong about is that most people will
*  hear this and be like, that sounds awful. That sounds dystopian. No, it doesn't. It sounds
*  incredible. And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like, I wish I was like making
*  awful choices every day like I was in the past. And then this isn't these are important decisions.
*  Your important decision making energy, your important focus and your attention can go on
*  to your kids and on your work and on, you know, helping other people and things that matter. And
*  so I think AI can, I think when I think about like personal lifestyle stuff like that, I really
*  love like, I love thinking about that. I think it's going to be very exciting. I think we'll all be
*  so much healthier that when we look back today, one of the things that's going to look so primitive
*  is the one size fits all thing. You're getting like reading advice about keto.
*  Each genome is going to have very specific one, you know, unique advice coming from AI. And so,
*  yeah, yeah, the customization that's enabled by collection of data and the use of AI. A lot of
*  people think what's like they think of the worst case scenario that data being used by authoritarian
*  governments to control you all that kind of stuff. They don't think about most likely,
*  especially in a capitalist society, it's most likely going to be used as part of a competition
*  to get you the most delicious and healthy meal possible as fast as possible. Yeah. So the world
*  will definitely be much better with the integration of data. But of course, you want to be able to
*  be transparent and honest about how that data is misused. And that's why it's important to have
*  free speech and people to speak out like when some bullshit is being done by companies. That we need
*  to have our wits about us as a society. Like this is free speech is the mechanism by which the big
*  brain can think, can think for itself, can think straight, can see straight. When you take away
*  free speech, when you start saying that in every topic, when any when any topic's political,
*  it becomes treacherous to talk about. So forget the government taking away free speech.
*  If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation about any topic that's political and the politics
*  is so all consuming and it's such a incredible market to to polarize people, you know, for media
*  to polarize people and to bring any topic it can into that and get people hooked on it as a political
*  topic, we become a very dumb society. So free speech goes away as far as it matters. So, you know,
*  people say, oh, people like to say outside, you know, that you don't even know what free speech is.
*  Free speech is, you know, it's, you know, your free speech is not being violent. It's like, no,
*  you're right. My first amendment rights are not being violated. But the culture of free speech,
*  which is the second ingredient of two, you need the first amendment and you need the culture of
*  free speech. And now you have free speech and the culture is much more specific. You obviously can
*  have a culture that bullies people right now. Take any topic again that has to do with like,
*  you know, some very sensitive topics, you know, police shootings, or, you know, what's going on
*  in, you know, K through 12 schools or, you know, even, you know, climate change. You know, take
*  any of these and the first amendment is still there. You're not going to get arrested no matter
*  what you say. Their culture or free speech is is gone because you will be destroyed. Your life can
*  be over, you know, as far as it matters. If you say the wrong thing, but even, you know, but a
*  culture of really vigorous culture of free speech, you get no penalty at all for even saying something
*  super dumb. People will say, like people will laugh and be like, well, that was like kind of
*  hilariously offensive and like not at all correct. Like, you know, you're wrong and here's why. But
*  no one's like mad at you. Now the brain is thinking at its best. The IQ of the big brain is like as
*  high as it can be in that culture and the culture where you say something wrong and people say,
*  oh wow, you've changed. Oh wow. Like, look, this is his real, you know, colors. You know,
*  the big brain is, is dumb. You still have mutual respect for each other. So like,
*  you don't think lesser of others when they say a bunch of dumb things, you know, it's just the play
*  of ideas, but you still have respect. You still have love for them because I think the worst case
*  is when you have a complete free, like anarchy of ideas where it's like, like everybody lost hope
*  that the something like a truth can even be converged towards, like everybody has their own
*  truth. Then it's just chaos. Like if you have mutual respect and a mutual goal of arriving
*  at the truth and the humility that you want to listen to other people's ideas and a forgiveness
*  that other people's ideas might be dumb as hell, that doesn't mean there are lesser beings, all
*  that kind of stuff. But that's like a weird balance to strike. Right now people are being
*  trained, little kids, college students being trained to think the exact opposite way, to think
*  that there's no such thing as objective truth, which is, you know, the objective truth is the
*  end on the compass for every thinker. Doesn't mean we're necessarily on our way or refining,
*  but we're all aiming in the same direction. We all believe that there's a place we can eventually
*  get closer to. Not objective truth, you know, teaching them that disagreement is bad violence.
*  It's like, you know, you quickly sound like you're just going on like a political rant
*  with this topic, but like it's really bad. It's like genuinely the worst. If I had my own country,
*  I mean, it's like I would teach kids some very specific things that this is doing the exact
*  opposite of. And it sucks. It sucks. Speaking of a way to escape this, you've tweeted 30
*  minutes of reading a day equals, yeah, this whole video and it's cool to think about reading like
*  in an as a habit and something that accumulates. You said 30 minutes of reading a day equals 1000
*  books in 50 years. I love like thinking about this, like chipping away at the mountain.
*  Can you expand on that sort of the habit of reading? How do you recommend people read?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's incredible if you do something a little of something every day,
*  it compiles. It compiles. You know, I always think about like the people who achieve these
*  incredible things in life, these great like famous legendary people, they have the same number of
*  days that you do. And it's not like they were doing magical days. They just they got a little
*  done every day. And that adds up to monument. They're putting one brick in a day. Eventually,
*  they have this building, this legendary building. So you can take writing someone who, you know,
*  there's two aspiring writers and one doesn't ever write, doesn't, you know, manages to never,
*  zero right, zero pages a day. And the other one manages to do two pages a week. Right? Not very
*  much. The other one does zero pages a week, two pages a week, 98% of both of their time is the
*  same. The other person just 2% they're doing one other thing. One year later, they have written,
*  they write two books a year. This prolific person, you know, in 20 years, they've written 40 books.
*  They're one of the most prolific writers of all time. They write two pages a week. Sorry,
*  that's not true. That was two pages a day. Okay, two pages a week, you're still writing about a
*  book every two years. So in 20 years, you still written 10 books, also prolific writer, right?
*  Huge massive writing career, you write two pages every Sunday morning, the other person has the
*  same exact week and they don't do that Sunday morning thing. They are a wannabe writer. They
*  always said they could write, they talk about how they used to be here and nothing happens. Right?
*  So it's, it's inspiring, I think, for a lot of people who feel frustrated, they're not doing
*  anything. So reading is another example where someone who reads very, you know, doesn't read
*  and someone who's a prolific reader, you know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowan types.
*  I'm like, how the hell do you read so much? It's infuriating, you know, or like James Clear puts
*  out his like, his 10 favorite books of the year 20, his 20 favorite books of the year, like,
*  your 20 favorites, like I'm trying to just read 20 books, like that would be an amazing year. So,
*  but the thing is they're not doing something crazy and magical. They're just reading a half hour a
*  night. You know, if you read a half hour a night, the calculation I came to is that you can read
*  a thousand books in 50 years. So if someone who's 80 and they've read a thousand books,
*  you know, between 30 and 80, they are extremely well read. They can, they can delve deep into
*  many non-fiction areas. They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader, avid fiction reader.
*  And again, that's a half hour a day. Some people can do an hour, a half hour in the morning audio
*  book, half hour at night in bed. Now they've read 2000 books. So I think it's, it's just,
*  it's motivating. And you realize that a lot of times you think that the people who are doing
*  amazing things and you're not, you think that there's a bigger gap between you and them,
*  there really is. I, on the reading front, I'm a very slow reader, which is just a very frustrating
*  fact about me. But I'm faster with audio books. And I also, I just, you know, I'll just,
*  it's just hard to get myself to read, but I've started doing audio books and I'll wake up,
*  throw it on, do it in the shower, brushing my teeth, you know, making breakfast, dealing with
*  the dogs, things like that, whatever, until I sit down and that's, I can read, I can read a book a
*  week, a book every 10 days at that clip. And suddenly I'm this big reader because I'm just
*  while doing my morning stuff, I have it on. And also it's this fun, it makes the morning so fun.
*  I'm having a great time the whole morning. So I'm like, oh, I'm so into this book. So I think that,
*  you know, audio books is another amazing gift to people who have a hard time reading.
*  I find that that's actually an interesting skill. I do audio books quite a bit.
*  It's a skill to maintain, at least for me, probably the kind of books I read, which is often
*  like history or like, there's a lot of content and if you miss parts of it, you miss out on stuff.
*  And so it's a skill to maintain focus, at least for me.
*  Well, the 10 second back button is very valuable.
*  So I just, if I get lost, sometimes the book is so good that I'm thinking about what the person
*  just said and I just get the skill for me is just remembering to pause. And if I don't,
*  no problem, just back, back, back, back, just three quick backs. So that of course is not that
*  efficient, but that's, but it's, I do the same thing when I'm reading. I'll read a whole paragraph
*  and realize I was tuning out. You know, I haven't actually even considered it, try that. I've been
*  so hard on myself maintaining focus because you do get lost in thought. Maybe I should try that.
*  Yeah. And when you get lost in thought, by the way, you're processing the book. That's not wasted
*  time. That's your brain really categorizing and cataloging what you just read. And like,
*  well, there are several kinds of thoughts, right? There's thoughts related to the book and there's
*  a thought that it could take you elsewhere. Well, I find that if I am continually thinking
*  about something else, I just say, I'm not, I just pause the book. Yeah. Especially in the shower or
*  something when like, that's sometimes when really great thoughts come up. If I'm having all these
*  thoughts about other stuff, I'm saying clearly my mind wants to work on something else. I'll just
*  pause it. Quiet Dan Carlin. I'm thinking about something else right now. Exactly. Exactly.
*  Also you can, things like you're, you have to head out to the store. Like I'm going to read
*  20 pages on that trip, just walking back and forth, going to the airport. I mean, flights,
*  you know, the Uber, and then you're walking to the, walking through the airport, you're
*  sending the security line. I'm reading the whole time. Like I know this is not groundbreaking.
*  People know what audio books are, but I think that more people should probably get into them
*  than do. Cause I know a lot of people, they have this stubborn kind of things that I don't like.
*  I like to have the paper book and sure, but like, it's pretty fun to be able to read.
*  I listen to a huge number of audio books and podcasts, but I still, the most impactful
*  experiences for me are still reading and I read very, very slow. And it's very frustrating when
*  like, uh, you go to these websites, like that estimate how long a book takes on average,
*  those always, they do like a page a minute when I read like best a page every two minutes at best.
*  At best when you're like really like, actually not pausing.
*  I just, my ADD, it's like, I, I just, it's hard to keep focusing. And I also like to really absorb.
*  So I, on the other side of things, when I finish a book, 10 years later, I'll be like, you know,
*  that scene when this happens in another friend of Reddit, be like, what? I don't remember any like
*  details. I'm like, oh, I can tell you like the entire, so I absorbed the shit out of it, but I
*  don't think it's worth it to like have to read so less, so much less in my life.
*  I actually, so in terms of going to the airport, you know, in these like filler moments of life,
*  I do a lot of, uh, it's an app called Anki. I don't know if you know about it. It's a space
*  repetition app. So there's all of these facts I have when I read, I write it down if I want to
*  remember it. And it's these, it, uh, you review it and the one, the things you remember, it takes
*  longer and longer to bring back up. It's like flashcards, but a digital app. It's called Anki.
*  I recommend it to a lot of people. There's a huge community of people that are just like obsessed
*  with it. Anki. So this is extremely well known app and idea like among students who are like
*  medical students, like people that really have to study. Like this is not like fun stuff. They
*  really have to memorize a lot of things. They have to remember them well. They have to be able to
*  integrate them with a bunch of ideas. So, and I find it to be really useful for, um,
*  like when you read history, if you think this particular factor, they'd probably be extremely
*  useful for you because you're, um, that'd be interesting actually thought, cause you're doing,
*  you talked about like opening up a trillion tabs and reading things.
*  You know, you probably want to remember some facts you read along the way. Like you might
*  remember, okay, this thing I can't directly put into the writing, but it's a cool little factoid.
*  I want to all the time store that in there. And that's what I go Anki drop it in. And
*  oh, you can just drop it in. Yeah. And you drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video.
*  Well, no, I guess I can type it though. So yes. So Anki, there's a bunch of,
*  it's called space repetition. There's a bunch of apps that are much nicer Anki. Anki is the, uh,
*  the ghetto, like Craigslist version, but it has a giant community because people are like,
*  we don't want features. We want a text box. Like it's very basic, very stripped down. So
*  you can drop in stuff. You can drop it. That sounds really up. I can't believe I have not
*  come across this. You actually, once you look into it, you'll realize that how have I not come.
*  You are the person. I guarantee you'll probably write a blog about it. I can't believe you actually
*  have. Well, it's also just like your people too. And, um, my people say, what do you write about?
*  Literally anything I find interesting. And so for me, every once I, once you start a blog,
*  like your entire worldview becomes, would this be a good blog post? Would this be, I mean,
*  it's the lens I see everything through, but, um, I constantly coming across something or,
*  you know, or just a tweet, you know, um, something that I'm like, Ooh, I need to like share this with
*  my readers. My readers to me are like my, like my, like my friends who I'm like, I'm gonna,
*  Oh, I need to show, I need to tell them about this. And so I feel like just a place to, I mean,
*  I clock things in a document right now, if it's like really good, but it's, um, the little
*  factoids and stuff like that. I think, especially if I'm learning something, if I'm like,
*  So the problem is when you save stuff, when you look at it, like tweet and all that kind of stuff
*  is, uh, you also need to couple that with a system for review. Cause what Enki does is like,
*  literally it determines for me, I don't have to do anything. There's this giant pile of things
*  I saved and it brings up to me, okay, here's, um, I don't know, uh, uh, when Churchill did something
*  right. I'm reading about World War II a lot now, like a particular event. Here's that. Do you
*  remember when, what year that happened? And you say yes or no, or like you, you get to pick,
*  you get to see the answer and you get to self-evaluate how well you remember that fact.
*  And if you remember, well, it'll be another month before you see it again. If you don't remember,
*  it'll bring it up again. That's a way to review tweets, the review concepts. And it offloads the
*  kind of the process of selecting which parts you're supposed to review or not. And you can
*  grow that library. I mean, obviously medical students use it for like tens of thousands of
*  facts. And it just gamifies it too. It's like, you can passively sit back and just, and the thing
*  will like make sure you eventually learn it all. Versus, you know, it's, you don't have to be the
*  executive calling that like the program, the memorization program someone else is handling.
*  I would love to, to hear about like you trying it out or space repetition is an idea. There's
*  a few other apps, but Anki is the big must. I totally want to try. You've written and spoken
*  quite a bit about procrastination. I like you suffer from procrastination, like many other people
*  suffering quotes. How do we avoid procrastination? I don't think the suffer is in quotes.
*  I think that's a huge part of the problem is that it's, it's, it's treated like a silly problem.
*  It, people don't take it seriously as a dire problem, but it can be, it can, it can ruin your
*  life. There's like, talk, we talk, cause we talked about the compiling concept with, you know, if you
*  read a little, you know, you, if you write, if you write two pages a week, you write a book every
*  two years, you're a prolific writer, right? And the difference between, you know, the, again,
*  it's not that that person's working so hard. It's that they have the ability to, when they commit
*  to something like on Sunday mornings, I'm going to write two pages. That's it. They, they respect,
*  they have, they have enough, they have, they respect the part of them that made that decision
*  is a respected character in their brain. And they say, well, that's, I decided it, so I'm going to
*  do it. Procrastinator won't do those two pages. That's just exactly the kind of thing the
*  procrastinator will keep on their list and they will not do. But the, it doesn't mean they're any
*  less talented than the writer who does the two pages. Doesn't mean they want it any less.
*  Maybe they want it even more. And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be just as happy having done it
*  as the writer who does it. So what they're missing out on, picture a writer who writes 10 books,
*  you know, bestsellers, and they go on these book tours and, you know, they, and they just,
*  they're so gratified with their career and, you know, and they think about what the other person
*  is missing who does none of that, right? So that, that is a massive loss, a massive loss.
*  And it's because the internal mechanism in their brain is not doing what the other person's is.
*  They don't have the respect for the part of them that made the choice. They feel like it's someone
*  they can disregard. And so to me, is this in the same boat as someone who is obese because they're
*  eating habits make them obese over time or their exercise habits? That, you know, that's a huge
*  loss for that person. That person is, you know, the health problems and it's just probably making
*  them miserable. And it's, and it's self-inflicted, right? It's self-defeating, but that doesn't make
*  it an easy problem to fix just because you're doing it to yourself. So to me, procrastination
*  is another one of these where you are the only person in your own way. You are, you know,
*  you are failing at something or not doing something that you really want to do. You know,
*  it doesn't have to be work. Maybe you're, you want to get out of that marriage that, you know, you
*  realize it hits you. You shouldn't be in this marriage. You should get divorced and you wait
*  20 extra years before you do it or you don't do it at all. That is, you know, you're not living
*  the life that you know you should be living, right? And so I think it's fascinating. Now,
*  the problem is it's also a funny problem because there's short-term procrastination,
*  which I talk about as, you know, the kind that has a deadline. Now, some people, you know,
*  this is when I bring in, there's different characters. There's the panic monster comes
*  in the room and that's when you actually, you know, the procrastinator can, there's different
*  levels. There's the kind that even when there's a deadline, they stop panicking. They just, they've
*  given up and they really have a problem. Then there's the kind that when there's a deadline,
*  they'll do it, but they'll wait to the last second. Both of those people, I think, have a
*  huge problem once there's no deadline because, and most of the important things in life,
*  there's no deadline, which is, you know, changing your career, you know, becoming a writer when you
*  never have been before, getting out of your relationship, you know, be doing whatever you
*  need to, the changes you need to make in order to get into a relationship. There's a thing after it,
*  launching a startup, launching a startup, right? Or once you've launched a startup,
*  firing is the right someone that needs to be fired, right? I mean, going out for fundraising
*  instead of just trying to, you know, there's so many moments when the big change that you know
*  you should be making that would completely change your life if you just did it has no deadline.
*  It just has to be coming from yourself. And I think that a ton of people have a problem
*  where they will, they think this delusion that, you know, I'm going to do that. I'm definitely
*  going to do that, you know, but not this week, not this month, not today, because whatever.
*  And they make this excuse again and again, and it just sits there on their list,
*  collecting dust. And so yeah, to me, it's, it is very real suffering.
*  And the fix isn't fixing the habits, just like not-
*  I'm still working on the fix, first of all. So there's, okay, there is,
*  there's, just that you have a boat that sucks and it's leaking and it's going to sink. You can fix
*  it with duct tape for a couple of, you know, for one ride or whatever. That's not really fixing
*  the boat, but you can get you by. So there's duct tape solutions to me. So the panic monster
*  is the character that rushes into the room once the deadline gets too close or once there's some
*  scary external pressure, not just from yourself. And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.
*  Again, there's a lot of people who won't, you know, do that thing. They've been writing that
*  book they wanted to write, but there's way fewer people who will not show up to the exam. You know,
*  most people show up to the exam. So that's because the panic monster is going to freak out if they
*  don't. So you can create a panic monster. If you want to, you know, you really want to write music,
*  you really want to become a singer songwriter, well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it and
*  say, hey, on, you know, this day, two months from now, come and see, I'm going to play you some of
*  my songs. You now have a panic monster, you're going to write songs, you're going to have to,
*  right? So there's duct tape things, you know, you can do things, you know, people do,
*  I've done a lot of this with a friend and I say, if I don't get X done by a week from now,
*  I have to donate a lot of money somewhere I don't want to donate.
*  And that's, you would put that in the category of duct tape solutions.
*  Yeah, because it's not, why do I need that? Right? If I really had solved this, this is something I
*  want to do for me. It's selfish. This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here and do the
*  work I need to do to get the goals I want to get. Right? There's a lot, all the incentives
*  should be in the right place. And yet if I don't say that, I will, it'll be a week from now and I
*  won't have done it. Something weird is going on. There's some resistance, there's some force that
*  is prevent that is in my own way. Right? And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,
*  okay, now I'll panic and I'll do it. So that's duct tape. Fixing the boat is something where I
*  don't have to do that. I just will do the things that I, again, it's not, I'm talking about super
*  crazy work ethic, just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples because I have a serious
*  problem that I've been working on. And in some ways I've gotten really successful at solving it.
*  In other ways, I'm still still floundering. So you're the world's greatest duct taper.
*  Yes. Well, I'm pretty good at duct taping. I probably could be even better. And I'm like,
*  and I'm, and I'm, you're procrastinating and becoming a better duct tape. Literally, like,
*  yes, there's nothing I won't. So here's what I know what I should do as a writer. Right? It's
*  very obvious to me is that I should wake up. It doesn't have to be crazy. I don't have to 6 AM or
*  anything sane, or I'm not going to be one of those crazy people of 530 jogs. I'm going to wake up at
*  whatever, you know, 738, 830, and I should have a block, like just say nine to noon where I get up
*  and I just really quick make some coffee and write. It's obvious because all the great writers in
*  history did exactly that. Some of them have done that. That's common. There's some that I like
*  these writers. They do the late night sessions, but most of them they do it as a session. But
*  there's a session that's most writers write in the morning. And there's a reason I don't think I'm
*  different than those people. It's a great time to write. You're fresh, right? Your ideas from the
*  the from dreaming have kind of collected. You have all the new answers that you didn't have yesterday
*  and you can just go. But more importantly, if I just had a routine where I wrote from nine to noon
*  weekdays, every week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours of writing, which doesn't sound
*  like a lot, but it's a lot. A 15, 15, no, this is no joke. This is, you know, you're not your
*  phone's away. You're not talking to anyone. You're not opening your email. You are focused writing
*  for three hours. That's a big week for most writers, right? So now what's happening is that every
*  weekday is a minimum of a B. I'll give myself, you know, an A might be, you know, wow, I really
*  just got into a flow mode for six hours and had, you know, great. But it's a minimum of a B. I can
*  keep going if I want. And every week is a minimum of a B with those 15 hours, right? And if I just
*  talk about compiling, if I, this is the two pages a week. If I just did that every week, I achieve
*  all my writing goals in my life. And yet I wake up and most days I just either I'll revenge
*  procrastination late at night and go to bed way too late and then wake up later and get on a bad
*  schedule and I just fall into these bad schedules or I wake up and there's just, you know, I'll say
*  I was gonna do a few emails and I'll open it up and I'm suddenly on text and I'm texting and
*  or I'll just go and, you know, I'll make a phone call and I'll be on phone calls for three hours.
*  It's always something. Or I'll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall, but because
*  there's no sacred, this is a sacred writing block, I'll just hit the wall and say, well, this is icky
*  and I'll go do something else. So duct tape, what I've done is, there, White But White has one
*  employee, Alicia. She's the manager of lots of things. That's her role. She truly does lots of
*  things. And one of the things we started doing is either she comes over and sits next to me where
*  she can see my screen from nine to noon. That's all it takes. The thing about procrastination is
*  usually they're not kicking and screaming. I don't want to do this. It's the feeling of, you know,
*  in the old days when you had to go to class, you know, your lunch block is over and it's like,
*  oh, shit, I have class in five minutes. Or it's Monday morning. You go, oh,
*  yeah. But you said, you know what, but you go, you say, okay. And then you get to class and it's not
*  that bad once you're there, right? You know, you have a trainer and he says, okay, next set. And
*  you go, okay. And you do it. That's all it is. It's someone, some external thing being like,
*  okay, I have to do this. And then you have that moment of like, it sucks, but I guess I'll do it.
*  If no one's there though, the problem with the procrastinator is they don't have that person
*  in their head. Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame if they don't do stuff. And
*  that stick in their head is hugely helpful. I don't really have that. And so anyway, Alicia's
*  sitting there next to me. It's not, she's doing her own work, but she can see my screen and she,
*  of all people, knows exactly what I should be doing, what I shouldn't be doing.
*  That's all it takes. The shame of just having her see me while she's sitting there not working
*  would be just be too, it's too weird and too embarrassing. So I get it done and it's amazing.
*  It's like game changer for me. So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough, but I'm
*  curious to, I'm still trying to, what is going on? I think part of it is that we are actually wired.
*  I think I'm being very sane, human actually is what's happening. You're not sane is not the
*  right word. I'm being a natural human that we are not programmed to sit there and do homework
*  of a certain kind, that we get the results like six months later. That is not, so we're supposed to
*  conserve energy and fulfill our needs as we need them and do immediate things.
*  We're overriding our natural ways when we wake up and get to it. I think sometimes because the pain,
*  I think a lot of times we're just avoiding suffering and a lot of people, the pain of not doing it
*  is actually worse because they feel shame. So if they don't get up and take a jog and get up early
*  and get to work, I'll feel like a bad person and that is worse than doing those things. Then it
*  becomes a habit eventually and it becomes just easy, automatic. It becomes, I do it because
*  that's what I do. But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame necessarily, the pain of
*  doing those things is worse in the immediate moment than not doing it. But I think that there's this
*  feeling that you've captured with your body language and so on. I don't want to do another
*  set. That feeling that people have seen that are good at not procrastinating are the ones that have
*  trained themselves to the moment they would be having that feeling. It's like Zen, Sam Harris
*  style Zen. You don't experience that feeling. You just march forward. I talked to Elon about this a
*  lot actually offline. It's like he doesn't have this. No, really not. The way I think, at least
*  he talks about it and the way I think about it is it's like you just pretend you're a machine
*  and running an algorithm. You know you should be doing this. Not because somebody told you
*  this is probably the thing you want to do. Look at the big picture of your life and just run the
*  algorithm. Ignore your feelings. Just run as if- Just framing. Frame it differently. Yeah.
*  You can frame it as like it can feel like homework or it can feel like you're living your best life
*  or something when you're doing your work. Yeah. Maybe reframe it. But I think ultimately is
*  whatever reframing you need to do, you just need to do it for a few weeks and that's how the habit
*  is formed and you stick with it. I'm now on a kick where I exercise every day. It doesn't matter
*  what that exercise is. It's not serious. It could be 200 push-ups. But it's the thing that I make
*  sure I exercise every day and it's become way, way easier because of the habit. And I don't,
*  at least with exercise because it's easier to replicate that feeling, I don't allow myself to
*  go like, I don't feel like doing this. Right. Well, I think about that even just like little
*  things like I brush my teeth before I go to bed and it's just a habit. Yeah. And it is effort.
*  If it were something else, I would be like, oh, I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to do
*  that. I'm just going to lie down right now. But it doesn't even cross my mind. It's just like
*  I just robotically go and do it. Yeah. And it almost has become like a nice routine. It's like,
*  oh, this part of the night. It's like a morning routine for me. Stuff is like, that stuff is kind
*  of just like automated. Yeah. It's funny because you don't like go, like, I don't think I've skipped
*  many days. I don't think I skipped any days brushing my teeth. Right. Like unless I didn't have a
*  tooth part, like I was in the woods or something. And what is that? Because it's annoying. To me,
*  there's, so the character that makes me procrastinate is the instant gratification monkey.
*  That's what I've labeled him. Right. And there's the rational decision maker and the instant
*  gratification monkey. And these battle with each other. But for procrastinate, the monkey wins.
*  I think the monkeys, you know, you read about this kind of stuff. I think that the
*  this kind of more primitive brain is always winning. And in non procrastinators, that primitive
*  brain is on board for some reason and isn't resisting. So but but when I think about brushing
*  my teeth, it's like the monkey doesn't even think there's an option to not do it. So it doesn't even
*  like get there's no hope. The monkey has no hope there. So it doesn't even like get involved. And
*  it's just like, yeah, we have to just like kind of like robotically just like, you know, it's kind
*  of like Stockholm syndrome, just like, Oh, no, no, I have to do this. It doesn't even like wake
*  up. It's like, yeah, we're doing this now. For other things, the monkeys like, oh, no, no, no,
*  most days I can win this one. And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance. And it's
*  like, it's a lot of it's like the initial transition. So I think of it as like jumping
*  in a cold pool, where it's like, I will spend the whole day pacing around the side of the pool in
*  my bathing suit, just being like, I don't want to have that one second when you first jump in,
*  and it sucks. And then once you're once I'm in, once I jump in, I'm usually you know, once I start
*  writing, I'm suddenly I'm like, Oh, this isn't so bad. Okay, I'm kind of into it. And then I then
*  sometimes you can't tear me away, you know, then I suddenly I'm like, I get into a flow. So it's
*  like, once I get into cold water, I don't mind it, but I will spend hours standing around the side
*  of the pool. And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense, when I go to the gym with a trainer,
*  in 45 minutes, I do a full full ass workout. And it's not because I'm having a good time,
*  but it's it's it's because it's that you have to go to class feeling, right. But when I go to the
*  gym alone, I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone for 10 minutes before the next set.
*  And I'll spend an over an hour there and do way less. So it is the transition once I'm actually
*  doing the set, I'm never like, I don't want to stop in the middle. Now it's just like, I'm gonna
*  do this and I feel happy. I just did it. So it's something there's something about transitions
*  that is very that's why procrastinators are late. A lot of places. It's I will procrastinate getting
*  ready to go to the airport. Even though I know I should leave at three, so I cannot be stressed,
*  I'll leave at 336. And I'll be super stressed. Once I'm on the way to the airport immediately,
*  I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier? Now I'm back to on my phone doing what I was doing.
*  I just had to get in the damn car or whatever. So yeah, there's some very, very odd irrational.
*  Yeah, like I was waiting for you to come and you said that you're running a few minutes late.
*  And I was like, I was like, I'll go get a coffee. Because I can't possibly be the one who's early.
*  Right. I can't I don't understand. I'm always late to stuff. And I know it's disrespectful.
*  In the eyes of a lot of people, I can't help it's not you know, you know what I'm doing
*  ahead of it. It's not like I don't care about the people. I'm often like, you know, for like
*  this conference, I'd be preparing more. Right. Like it's like, it's like I obviously care about
*  the person. But misinterpreted it is like there are there are some people that like, show up late
*  because they like they kind of like that quality in themselves. That's a dick, right? There's a lot
*  of those people. But more often, it's someone who shows up frazzled and they feel awful. And they're
*  furious at themselves. Yeah, so regretful. Exactly. I mean, that's me. And I mean, also,
*  all you have to do is look at those people alone running through the airport. Right.
*  There's they're not being disrespectful to anyone there. They just inflicted this on themselves.
*  Like hilarious. Yeah. You've tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying, quote, I imagine one of the
*  reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because this is because they sense once hate is
*  gone, they will be forced to deal with the pain. What has been a painful but formative experience
*  in your life? What's the flavor, the shape of your pain that fuels you? I mean, honestly, the
*  first thing that jumped to mind is my own like battles against myself to get my work done,
*  because it affects everything. When I just took five years in this book, and granted, it's a it's a
*  beast. Like I probably would have taken two or three years, but it didn't need to take five. And
*  that was a lot of not just, you know, not just that I'm not working, it's that I'm over researching,
*  I'm making it I'm adding in things I shouldn't because I'm perfectionist, you know, being a
*  perfectionist about like, Oh, well, I learned that now I want to get it in there. I know I'm going to
*  end up cutting it later. Just, you know, or I over outline, you know, something, you know, trying to
*  get it perfect when I know that's not possible. She's making a lot of immature kind of like, I'm
*  not actually that much of a writing amateur I've written, including my old blog. I've been a writer
*  for 15 years. I know what I'm doing. I could advise other writers really well. And yet I do a bunch of
*  amateur things that I know while I'm doing them is an I know I'm being an amateur so that a it
*  hurts the actual product it makes you know it'd be it's waste your vet your precious time. See,
*  when you're mad at yourself when you're in a negative, you know, self defeating spiral,
*  it almost inevitably will you'll be less good to others like, you know, I'll just just I used to,
*  you know, early on in my now marriage, one of the things we always used to do is I used to plan
*  mystery dates, you know, New York City, great, great place for this, I'd find some weird little
*  adventure for us, you know, it could be anything. And I wouldn't tell her what it was. I said,
*  I reserving you for Thursday night, you know, at seven. Okay. And it was such a fun part of
*  our relationship. Started writing this book and got into a really bad, you know, personal space
*  where I was like, in my head, I was like, I can't do anything until this is done, you know, like,
*  no, and I just stopped like ever valuing like, like joy of any kind. Like I was like, no,
*  no, that's when I'm done. And that's a trap or very quickly, you know, you know, because I always
*  think, you know, think it's gonna be a six months away. But actually, five years later, I'm like,
*  wow, I really wasn't living fully in for five years is not we don't live very long, like,
*  you know, about your prime decades, like that's like a sixth of my prime years, like, wow, like,
*  that's a huge loss. So to me, that was excruciating. And, you know, and it was a bad
*  pattern, a very unproductive, unhelpful pattern for me, which is I'd wake up in the morning in
*  this great mood, great mood every morning, wake up thrilled to be awake, have the whole day ahead of
*  me, I'm gonna get so much work done today. And but you know, first, I'm going to do all these other
*  things, and it's all gonna be great. And then I end up kind of failing for the day with those goals,
*  sometimes miserably, sometimes only partially. And then I get in bed, probably a couple hours
*  later than I want to. And that's when all the real reality hits me suddenly, so much regret,
*  so much anxiety, furious at myself, wishing I could take a time machine back three months,
*  six months a year, or just even to the beginning of that day. And just tossing and turning now,
*  I mean, this is a very bad place. That's what I said suffering real procrastinators suffer in a
*  very serious way. So look, I, you know, I know this probably sounds like a lot of like first
*  world problems, and it is, but it's real suffering as well. Like, it's so to me, it's like, it's
*  painful because you're not being you're not being as good a friend or a spouse or whatever, as you
*  could be, you're also not treating yourself very well, usually not being very healthy in these
*  moments, you know, you're often, and you're not being I'm not being good to my readers. So it's
*  just a lot of this. And it's like, it feels like it's one small tweak away. Sometimes it's like,
*  that's what I said, it's like, you just suddenly are just doing that nine to 12. And you get in
*  that habit, everything else falls into place, all of this reverses. So if I feel hopeful, but it's
*  like, it is a I have not figured I haven't fixed the boat yet. I have some good duct tape.
*  And you also don't want to romanticize it, because it is true that some some of the greats in history,
*  especially writers suffer from all the same stuff, like they they weren't quite able I mean,
*  you might only write for two or three hours a day, but the rest of the day is often spent,
*  you know, kind of tortured. But
*  Well, right, this is the irrational thing is, if I if, and a lot of this goes for a lot of
*  people's jobs, people, especially who work for themselves, you'd be shocked how much you could
*  wake up at nine, or eight or seven or whatever, get to work and stop at one, but you're really
*  focused in those hours, one or two, and do 25 really focused hours of stuff, product stuff a
*  week. And then there's 112 waking hours in the week, right. So we're talking about 80 something
*  hours of free time, you can live, you know, if you're just really focused in your, you know,
*  yin and yang of your time, and that's what that's my goal is black and white time, I really focus
*  time and then totally like, clean conscience free time. Right now, I have neither it's a lot of
*  gray, it's a lot of I should be working, but I'm not, oh, I'm wasting this time, this is bad. And
*  it's just as massive. So if you can just get really good at the black and the white, so you just wake
*  up, and it's just like full work. And then I think a lot of people could have like all this free time,
*  but instead, I'll do those same three hours. It's like you said, I'll do them really late at night or
*  whatever, after having tortured myself the whole day, and not had any fun. It's not like I'm having
*  fun. I call it the dark playground, by the way, which is where you are when you know you should be
*  working, but you're doing something else. It's, you're doing something fun on paper, but it's
*  never it feels awful. And so yeah, I spent a lot of time in the dark. And you know, you shouldn't
*  be doing it. And you still do it. And yeah, it's not clean conscience fun. It's bad. It's toxic.
*  And I think that it's, there's something about, you know, you're draining yourself all the time.
*  And if you just did your focused hours, and then if you actually have good clean fun, fun can be
*  anything. Reading a book can be hanging out with someone who can be really fun. You can go and do
*  something cool in the city, you know, that is critical. It's you're recharging some part of
*  your psyche there. And I think it makes it easier to actually work the next day. And I say this from
*  the experiences when I have had, you know, good stretches. It's like, it's you're you know what
*  it is. It's like you feel like you're fist pounding one part of your brain, just pounding the other
*  part. Like you're like, you're like, we got like, like we treat, we treat ourselves well, like is
*  how you're internally feel like I treat myself. And it's like, yeah, no, it's work time. And then
*  later you're like, now it's playtime. And it's like, okay, back to work. And you're in this very
*  healthy, like parent child relationship in your head versus like this constant conflict. And like
*  the kid doesn't respect the parent, the parent hates the kid. And like, yeah. And you're right.
*  It always feels like it's like one fix away. So that there's hope. I mean, I guess, I mean,
*  so much of what you said just rings so true. I guess I have the same kind of hope.
*  But you know, this podcast is very regular. I mean, I'm impressed. Like, and I think partially
*  there is a bit of a duct tape solution here, which is you just the, because it's always easy
*  to schedule stuff for the future for myself, right? Because that's future Tim and future Tim
*  is not my problem. So I'll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim. And I will, and I will not
*  then not do it. But in this case, you can schedule podcasts and you have to show up.
*  Yeah, you have to show up. Right. It seems like a good medium for procrastinating.
*  This is not my, this is what I do for fun. I know. But at least this is the kind of thing,
*  especially if it's not your main thing, especially if it's not your main thing,
*  it's the kind of thing that you would dream of doing and want to do and never do. And I feel like
*  your regular production here is a sign that something is working, at least in this regard.
*  Yeah, in this regard. But this, I'm sure you have this same kind of thing with the podcast. In fact,
*  because you're going to be doing the podcast as possible, the podcast becomes what the podcast is
*  for me. This is your procrastinate. If you think about being 80, and if you can get into that
*  person's head and look back and be like, just deeper, great, you just, you know, yearning,
*  you could do anything to just go back and have done this differently. That is desperation. It's
*  just you don't feel it yet. It's not in you yet. The other thing you could do is if you have a
*  partner, if you want to partner with someone, now you could say we meet these 15 hours every week.
*  And that point, you're going to get it done. So working with someone can help.
*  Yeah, that's why they say like a co-founder is really powerful for many reasons. But that's
*  kind of one of them. Because to actually for the startup case, you, unlike writing, perhaps,
*  it's really like a 100 hour plus thing. Like once you really launch, you go all in. Like everything
*  else just disappears. Like you can't even have a hope of a balanced life for a little bit. So
*  their co-founder really helps. That's the idea.
*  You're one of the most interesting people on the internet. So as a writer, you look out into the
*  future. Do you dream about certain things you want to still create? Is there projects that you want
*  to write? Is there movies you want to write or direct or? Endless. So it's just endless sea of
*  ideas. No, there's specific list of things that really excite me. But it's a big list that I know
*  I'll never get through them all. And that's part of why the last five years really like, you know,
*  when I feel like I'm not moving as quickly as I could, it bothers me because I have so much
*  genuine excitement to try so many different things. And I get so much joy from finishing things. I
*  don't like doing things. But a lot of writers are like that. Publishing something is hugely joyful
*  and makes it all worth it. Or just finishing something you're proud of. Putting it out there
*  and have people appreciate it. It's like the best thing in the world. Every kid makes some
*  little bargain with themselves, has a little dream or something. And I feel like when I do something
*  that I make something, for me it's been mostly writing, and I feel proud of it and I put it out
*  there, I feel like I like again, I'm like fist pounding my seven year old self. There's a little
*  like, I'm, I like I owe it to myself to do certain things. And I just did one of the things I just
*  paid off some debt to myself. I owed it and I paid it and it feels great. It feels like very like,
*  you just feel very, a lot of inner peace when you do it. So the more things I can do, you know,
*  and I just have fun doing it, right? So I just, for me that includes a lot more writing. I just,
*  short, short, not short blog post. I write very long blog posts. But basically short writing in
*  the form of long blog posts is a great, I love that medium. I want to do a lot more of that.
*  Books yet to be seen. I'm going to do this and I have another book I'm going to do right after
*  and we'll see if I like those two. And if I do, I'll do more, otherwise I won't.
*  But I also want to try other mediums. I want to make more videos. I want to,
*  I did a little travel series once. I love doing that. I want to do, you know, more of that.
*  Almost like a vlog.
*  Like, no, it was, I let readers in a survey pick five countries they wanted me to go to.
*  That's awesome.
*  They picked, they sent me to weird places. They sent me, I went to Siberia. I went to Japan.
*  I went from there to, this is all in a row, into Nigeria, from there to Iraq,
*  and from there to Greenland. And then I went back to New York, like two weeks in each place.
*  And I got to, you know, each one, I got to, you know, have some weird experiences. I tried to,
*  like, really dig in and have like, you know, some interesting experiences. And then I wrote about it
*  and I taught readers a little bit about the history of these places. And it was just,
*  I love doing that. I love writing. So, you know, and I'm like, oh man,
*  like I haven't done one of those in so long. And then I have a big like desire to do fictional
*  stuff. Like I want to write a sci-fi at some point and I would love to write a musical.
*  That's actually what I was doing before Wait But Why. I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.
*  We were halfway through a musical and he got tied up with his other musical and Wait But Why
*  started taking off. And we just haven't gotten back to it. But it's such a fun medium. So such
*  a silly medium, but it's so fun. So you think about all of these mediums on which you can be
*  creative and create something and you like the variety of it. Yeah, it's just that if there's
*  a chance on a new medium, I could do something good. I want to do it. I want to try it. It sounds
*  like so gratifying and so fun. You know, like I think it's fun to just watch you actually sample
*  these. So I can't wait for your podcast. I'll be listening to all of them. I mean, that's a cool
*  medium to see where it goes. The cool thing about podcasting and making videos, especially with a
*  super creative mind like yours, you don't really know what you're going to make of it until you
*  try it. Yeah, podcasts I'm really excited about, but I'm like, I like going on other people's
*  podcasts. And I never tried having my own. So with every medium, there's the challenges of how the
*  sausage is made. So like the challenges of the challenge of actually- Yeah, but it's also, I like
*  to like, I'll go on like, as you know, long ass monologues and you can't do that. If you're the
*  interviewer, like you're not supposed to do that as much. So I have to like rein it in and, and
*  that's, that can be, that might be hard, but we'll see. You could also do solo type stuff. Yeah,
*  maybe I'll do a little of each. You know what's funny? I mean, some of my favorite is more like
*  solo, but there's like a sidekick. So you're, you're, you're having a conversation, but you're like
*  friends, but it's really you ranting, which I think, I think you'd be extremely good.
*  That's funny. Yeah. Or even if it's 50 50, that's fine. Like if it's just a friend who I want to
*  like really riff with, I just don't, I don't like interviewing someone, which I won't, that's not
*  what the podcast will be, but I can't help. I've tried moderating panels before and I cannot help
*  myself. I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator who's too involved. It's very
*  unappealing. So I, you know, interviewing someone and I'm like, I can't, I don't even, I don't,
*  I just, it's not my, I can grill someone, but that's different. That's my curiosity being like,
*  wait, how about this? And I interrupt them and I'm trying to see the way your brain works. It's
*  hilarious. It's awesome. It's like lights up with fire and excitement. Yeah. I actually, I love
*  listening. I like watching people. I like listening to people. So this is like me right now having
*  just listening to a podcast. This is me listening to your podcast. I love listening to a podcast
*  because then it's not even like, but once I'm in the room, I suddenly can't help myself.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, big last ridiculous question. What is the meaning of life?
*  The meaning of like an individual life, your existence here on earth or, or maybe broadly
*  this whole thing we've got going on descendants of apes, um, busy creating. Yeah. Well, there's,
*  yeah. For me, I feel like, um, I want to be around as long as I can. If I can, if I can do some kind
*  of crazy life extension or upload myself, I'm gonna, because who doesn't want to see how cool 20,
*  the year 3000 is. Imagine you did say mortality was not appealing. No, it's not appealing at all
*  to me. Now it's ultimately appealing. As I said, no one wants eternal life. I believe if they
*  understood what eternity really was. And I did Graham's number as a post and I was like, okay,
*  no one wants to live that many. Yeah. But I'd like to choose. I'd like to say, you know, I'm truly
*  over it now and I'm going to have, you know, at that point we'd have our whole society would have
*  like sit, we'd have a ceremony. We'd have a whole process of someone signing off and you know, it
*  would be beautiful and it wouldn't be, well, you know, I think you'd be super depressed by that
*  point. Like who's going to sign off when they're doing maybe, maybe. Yes. Okay. Maybe it's dark,
*  but at least, but the point is if I'm happy, I can stay around for five, you know, but my,
*  I'm thinking 50th century sounds great. Like, I don't know if I want more than that 50,
*  50 sounds like a right number. And so if you're thinking, if you would sign up for 50, if you
*  had a choice, one is what I get. That is bullshit. Like if you want, if you're someone who wants 50,
*  one is a hideous number, right? You know, anyway, so for me personally, I want to be around as long
*  as I can. And then honestly, the reason I love writing, the thing that I love most is like,
*  it's like a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right? And that can be my friends
*  and it can be readers. And that's why I would never want to be like a journalist where their
*  personality is like hidden behind the writing or like even a biographer, you know, there's a lot of
*  people who are great writers, but it's, I like to personally connect. And if I can take something
*  that's in my head and other people can say, oh my God, I think that too. And this made me feel so
*  much better. It made me feel seen like that feels amazing. And, and I just feel like we're all having
*  such a weird common experience on this one little rock in this one little moment of time where this
*  weird, these weird four limb beings, and we're all the same. And it's like, we're all, we all,
*  the human experience. So I feel like so many, many of us suffer in the same ways and we're all going
*  through a lot of the same things. And to me, it is very, if I lived, if I, it was on my deathbed
*  and I feel like I had like, I had a ton of human connection and like shared a lot of common
*  experience and made a lot of other people feel like, like, uh, not alone. Do you feel that as a
*  writer? Do you, do you like hear and feel like the inspiration, like all the people that you make
*  smile and all the people you inspire? Honestly, not, not sometimes, you know, when we did an in-person
*  event and I, you know, meet a bunch of people and it's incredibly gratifying or, you know, you just,
*  you know, you get emails, but I think it is easy to forget that how many people sometimes you're,
*  you're just sitting there alone typing, dealing with your procrastination.
*  But that's why publishing is so gratifying because that's the moment when all this connection happens.
*  And especially if I had to put my finger on it, it's like, it's having a bunch of people who feel
*  lonely and they're like, existence is all realize, like all, you know, connect, right? So that, if
*  I do a lot of that, and that includes, of course, my actual spending, you know, a lot of really high
*  quality time with friends and family and like, and make the whole thing as heartbreaking as like
*  mortality and life can be, make the whole thing like fun and at least we can like laugh at ourselves
*  together while, while going through it. That to me is that, yeah. And then your last blog post will
*  be written from Mars as you get the bad news that you're not able to return because of the malfunction
*  in the rocket. Yeah. I would like to go to Mars and like go there for a week and be like, yeah,
*  here we are. And then come back. No, I know that's what you want. Yeah. And that's fine,
*  by the way. If I, if I, yeah. If, if, so you think you're picturing me alone on Mars as the
*  first person there and then it malfunctioned. Right. No, you were supposed to return, but it
*  malfunctions. And then there's this, the, the, so it's both the hope, the awe that you experienced,
*  which is how the blog starts. And then it's the overwhelming, like feeling of existential dread,
*  but then it returns to like the love of humanity. Well, that's the thing is if I could be writing
*  yeah. And actually like writing something that people would read back on earth, it would make
*  it feel so much better. Yeah. You know, if I were just alone and no one was going to realize what
*  happened. No, no, no, you get to write. Yeah. Also that would bring out great writing. Yeah.
*  I think so. You're deathbed on Mars alone. I think so. Yeah. Well, that's exactly the future. I hope
*  for you, Tim. All right. This was an incredible conversation. You're, you're a really special
*  human being, Tim. Thank you so much. You're, you're for spending your really valuable time with me.
*  I can't wait to hear your podcast. I can't wait to read your next blog post, which you said
*  in a Twitter reply, you'll, you'll get more to after the book, which at that to the long list of
*  ideas to procrastinate about them. Thanks so much for talking to me, man. Thank you.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Urban to support this podcast. Please check
*  out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Tim Urban himself.
*  Be humbler about what you know, more confident about what's possible and less afraid of things
*  that don't matter. Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
