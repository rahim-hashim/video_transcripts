# Ed Calderon: Mexican Drug Cartels | Lex Fridman Podcast #346
**Lex Fridman:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PIOoJMMptA)
*  when it's quiet, that's when it hits you.
*  That's what I think that's what a lot of people experience when they come back
*  from a conflict zone, you know, the
*  everything that was life and death, everything that mattered, all the noise,
*  all the chaos, all the people that are around you that would die for you, kill
*  for you, you would kill for them.
*  All these millions of dollars worth of equipment and stuff like that you were
*  responsible for now are all gone and it's just you.
*  The following is a conversation with Ed Calderon, a security specialist who has
*  worked for many years on counter narcotics and organized crime investigation
*  in the Northern border region of Mexico.
*  I highly recommend you follow the writing and courses on his Patreon and website
*  edsmanifesto.com.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, I'm going to hand it over to you.
*  Now, dear friends, here's Ed Calderon.
*  What does your experience in counter narcotics, investigating the Mexican
*  drug cartel teach you about human nature?
*  Wow.
*  I mean, first off, anybody can be got.
*  Anybody can be corrupted.
*  You know, you you work in that field and you you realistically the training we
*  got and profiling and investigation and stuff like stuff like that was basically
*  from the older guys there.
*  And some of those guys were already corrupted from the from the start.
*  So trust no one.
*  I remember seeing that X-Files episode where that was stated.
*  You quickly learn that even if you are somebody that to your own mind appears
*  incorruptible, you know, small changes happen around you.
*  Wheels get greased.
*  Money gets put in front of you and or things get threatened like your life.
*  And sometimes a payment for some of this corruption is just to continue on living.
*  You encounter people that seem incorruptible that go through FBI
*  background checks that go through all of the the security measures that all of us
*  were put through through, you know, polygraph test.
*  And then later on, you know, it turns out they were on the take or they became
*  somebody that was corrupted.
*  I think what I found out is that anybody at any level, they could be a very strong,
*  hard to get person right now.
*  But people get corrupted through their families, through need.
*  Mexico is a place where a lot of instability occurs.
*  So financial needs, health.
*  So a crack could form through the wall of integrity.
*  And then over time, it seeps in somehow.
*  Mexico has a culture of corruption.
*  Like, you know, you have your kid that goes to school at public school and you want
*  him to be in the morning, not in the afternoon school.
*  Time period. So you go off and grease the wheels with the director of the school.
*  People hearing this in Mexico nod their heads because this is something that
*  happens from early on.
*  So there's systemic, systemic and cultural thing to it, you know, as far as getting
*  around rules. And this happens because, you know, the people that are in charge in
*  Mexico, the government is, you know, their their tandem amount is trust between
*  criminals and the cartels down there for a lot of the culture.
*  So people don't trust the government and much less criminality.
*  So when you meet a person sticking on human nature, do you think it's possible to
*  figure out if they can be trusted?
*  So you said anyone could be corrupted.
*  You know, how long would you need to talk to a person?
*  And you're even in your own personal private life, just a friend.
*  Or is trust the thing that's never really guaranteed?
*  I think trust is never really guaranteed.
*  I know a lot of people are going to say that's a sad way and hard way of living
*  your life. But, you know, life experience at my end.
*  You know, people change.
*  You know, the dynamics of a relationship might change.
*  I look at people's character, specifically their past and past experiences if I can.
*  Somebody that presents themselves in front of you as somebody.
*  But you quickly learn that that somebody is just a mask or a persona that they kind
*  of created for themselves.
*  And they might not even be aware of the persona.
*  Like, is there some deep psychological stuff?
*  Sometimes I've experienced a lot of failure in my life.
*  You can see it in my nose. You know, you can see it in my lack of a digit, you know,
*  the amount of, you know, the amount of failure you can see in somebody and how they
*  wear them sometimes is a pretty telling thing as far as them being able to be trusted
*  or that you can trust their story or their experience.
*  And when I say experience, I mean, I've met some criminals, former criminals or, you
*  know, some people of that background that I trust with my life, you know, because
*  they're not not reformed.
*  But they figured out that that's not not a life that can live long enough to kind of
*  continue on. And I've also met people that are in law enforcement that I wouldn't
*  trust with my car keys, you know, because, you know, whatever persona they adopt
*  adopted over the over the years is a pretty good one.
*  Pretty good mask. Sometimes such a good mask.
*  They don't even know they're wearing it.
*  And on top of that, it's not just the psychology.
*  There's also in your biology to it.
*  I've I've been very fortunate and deliberate to surround myself with good
*  people throughout my life, but I've recently gotten to sort of observe not close
*  to me, but nearby somebody that could be classified as a sociopath.
*  Yeah. And and and a narcissist.
*  Like, I don't want to use those psychological terms, but just it's like, oh,
*  people, you know, come with different biology, too.
*  So it's not just like the the trauma you might experience in your early life and
*  all the deep complexity that leads all the deep complexity that leads to the
*  psychology that you are have as an adult.
*  But it's also the biology come with the nature that you might not just have the
*  the machine that can empathize deeply with the experience of others or maybe a
*  machine that gets off, gets a dopamine rush from the manipulation of other
*  humans or the control of other humans.
*  Yeah. I mean, for an example of my my own background, my mom didn't have a father.
*  You know, she is she he left really early on in their in their childhood.
*  You know, my mom raised her two sisters and basically kept a household.
*  She was a great mom.
*  She was a badass. You know, she was very independent.
*  She showed me how to be independent.
*  She showed me how to kind of watch out for others and kind of build me up in that
*  way. And I had a great childhood as far as you know, as far as her and kind of
*  like how she molded me. Later on, I figured out that when I had my own kid,
*  you know, I I figured out that she was basically trying to make me into what she
*  didn't have in a way.
*  And if I can get to see somebody's parents, you know, that's usually a that's
*  usually a sign of something, at least for me, as far as figuring out where people
*  are. I think there's something to be said about nature and nurture.
*  And now some people come up.
*  Some people are just born with that predatory instinct, you know, and you'll
*  never know. I mean, they spend their whole life practicing how to hide it.
*  But if you can figure out somebody's background, childhood, where they're from,
*  you can kind of tell something about them.
*  You know, I'm from Tijuana, you know, I'm a survivor.
*  That's that's my background as far as where I'm from.
*  Culturally, genetically, psychologically, the full shebang.
*  Yeah, I guess some people are born with certain predispositions and if they're in
*  the right environment, some of the negative aspects might flourish more than
*  others. You know, for me, I mean, I grew up skateboarding in Tijuana and I
*  remember breaking into my first backyard pool.
*  It was a house that a cartel guy owned and we used to skate the pool in the back
*  of it. So I learned how to pop open padlocks with a with a small vehicle,
*  hydraulic lift. And I remember doing that.
*  And later on in life, I got to train with people from other parts of Mexico and
*  and work with them. And I remember pulling that trick off and they were like
*  looking at me like, what you learned that like burglars in Tijuana, you know,
*  and they're like, wow, that's interesting.
*  Like are all people from Tijuana like that?
*  And I said, no, we're not all like that.
*  But I guess in some way we are because, you know, Tijuana produces some
*  produces kids like that. You know, she produces like the environment itself
*  produces produces a pretty specific person, I guess.
*  You know, we're our normal is our normal or a baseline normal is way different
*  than most.
*  The trajectories that you can take in life are are defined in a way that aren't
*  available elsewhere in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you develop I mean, that's part of that psychological part of that is
*  cultural and so on.
*  Part of that is a cultural trauma, but then also the ethical lines based on the
*  corruption. Because I grew up in the Soviet Union.
*  There's the same kind of understanding that there's some gray area of corruption.
*  Yeah, there's it's always there like on the outskirts or even in the center.
*  How you can grease things to make things easier and how it's like a personal
*  thing. I'll just, you know, pay off the and Tijuana we have a more of the that's
*  what we call it. You know, when you when you pay a cop off, no more of the that
*  means a bite.
*  So and what's what's the bite aspect?
*  So you get stopped for a traffic violation of some sort and the cop walks up to
*  you. Obviously, you don't say the word bite, but it's like it's like a slang
*  term for it.
*  And he asked for your paperwork and, you know, and if you get fined or get a
*  ticket, you say, can I pay the ticket here is what they say.
*  And, you know, put your money inside the paperwork and hand it over to the cops.
*  More data you think it's, you know, I'm just going to do it and nobody knows, you
*  know, but it's a systemic thing.
*  Everybody like a lot of people do it.
*  And then they don't trust the police because they are fed with this.
*  Yeah, I mean, same thing was in the Soviet Union.
*  It's funny.
*  But then there's something inside you where that kind of those opportunities
*  come like with a police officer where you realize you could just pay a little
*  bit of money and get out of a thing.
*  And then you realize you can pay a little bit of money or do a favor to get your
*  kids in a better school or something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  But there comes opportunities where you were.
*  All right.
*  If if I do this little thing, I can make I can get a huge promotion.
*  I can get a huge increase in my power or get a lot of money and something
*  inside you says, no, it's not right.
*  Yeah.
*  And I wonder what that is that because like.
*  Yeah, I want because it feels different than the legal systems of the language
*  operate. There's some kind of basic human integrity, human decency.
*  I wonder if that's like constructed or it's always there.
*  If this is like again, nature versus nurture.
*  Yeah, I think, you know, for me, it was looking at seeing that in somebody else
*  that I kind of learned about it.
*  There's a man that I consider a mentor figure.
*  His name is Lieutenant Colonel Liza Oda.
*  He was a lieutenant colonel from the army that basically came over and took over
*  the group that I used to work with.
*  He was incorruptible.
*  You know, he was that that was the the essence of the aura that he projected.
*  The first time he the first time he went off on patrol when he was placed in charge
*  of us, I actually drove him around Tijuana.
*  He was one of those lead from the front type of people.
*  The amount of assassination attempts he got was basically a proof of how
*  incorruptible he was because they kept trying to pay him off.
*  And when that didn't work, they tried to kill him several times.
*  I think the last assassination attempt took the use of his legs.
*  That man is still a dangerous person in my mind.
*  But for me and, you know, people can gather a little bit about my background
*  and where I'm from and some of the access I currently have to train the federal
*  institutions here in the US as far as my background and if I was corrupted or not,
*  because there's a lot of that out there.
*  The the Catholic guilt that's kind of built into some of us is always kind of
*  there, you know, in Kukui viva bajo la cama.
*  The devil was under the bed.
*  You know, so I don't consider myself Catholic.
*  Consider myself culturally Catholic, I think, is what I kind of kind of say with that.
*  I had a pretty good structure with my dad and my mom at the house.
*  And, you know, they never let me get away with things.
*  And I think my mom was pretty, pretty big moral compass for me.
*  But Lieutenant Colonel, kind of leading from example and seeing his work and how
*  how much profound change he caused in the people that work with him as far as, you
*  know, we felt supported and we felt like we had a guiding figure during this.
*  Tijuana was the most dangerous city on the planet when I was working there and he
*  took charge.
*  What does it take to be a man, the lieutenant colonel who maintains integrity
*  after assassination attempts?
*  Is it possible for a normal human to do that?
*  Or again, as a genetic?
*  That's an interesting question.
*  I'll say this.
*  Seeing him, I mean, the last assassination attempt he had that took the use of his
*  legs. He was with his kid.
*  There was a recklessness to it.
*  You know, I can see that now, like now that I have enough distance from it, I could
*  see that there's a recklessness to being that way.
*  And also you putting jeopardy people around you if you take that route.
*  So I think there's a sacrifice to it, a very powerful and hard one to make for a lot
*  of people. For me, it was I wouldn't get picked to get on board with some of the
*  operations groups that I wanted to work with because I was known for not taking
*  money or not being trusted by certain older segments of the organization that I
*  was with with stuff because they knew that I wouldn't get money.
*  So there's always a weird sacrifice to it.
*  And you're almost kind of like masochistic in that way when you get approached with
*  it. They're like, why are you being an idiot?
*  You know, why are you driving around that beat up car?
*  Look at the Hummer H2 that just drove in with the other guy that is doing exactly
*  your same job. Society as a whole down there doesn't reward it or at least
*  doesn't see it in the people that don't take that route in Mexico.
*  You know, for them, all cops are corrupt.
*  You know, all of them.
*  And, you know, seeing it from the outside, I'm not there anymore.
*  There is, you know, there's almost like a why didn't you, Ed?
*  You know, that could have been easier maybe.
*  Or you could have you could have been dead long ago, you know, because people that
*  are on the take down there are usually owned by one side or the other.
*  And when that gets found out, you know, if you have somebody that you're paying off
*  that hints you off of drug operations in the area, your rivals are pretty keen on
*  killing you.
*  Money aside, so like like a Hummer aside, how much of a motivator is fear?
*  It's a big one.
*  You know, I'll say, you know, for me, I didn't I don't think I was going to live
*  to see 30.
*  And I was sure of it.
*  Did that concept scare you?
*  Was that just a principle of life that you're operating under?
*  I lost my brother when I was 13 on it, too.
*  Like, you know, he was 19.
*  He was like the the VIP of the family, you know, you miss him.
*  Oh, every day.
*  He was a you know, he was a, you know, skateboarded BMX motorcycle hunter, one
*  of the best marksmen that I've ever seen shoot.
*  So better than you at everything.
*  Yeah, he was the best of us is what we would say.
*  And when he died, there was a there was it's almost like a concert at this
*  funeral.
*  You know, I met three of his girlfriends that all introduced themselves like the
*  one, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  I to this day, every now and then I get pulled aside down when I go back home and
*  the your Eric's brother, you know, despite all the stuff that I've done, I'm still,
*  you know, every now and then I get recognized.
*  That made my mom and my dad go into a horrible depression and basically, you
*  know, left me to my devices when I was a kid from 13 onwards.
*  I had this self destructive, you know, aspect to me after that, I think, you
*  know, so again, something that's come up in therapy, you know, after I've been
*  gone through all that and had this notion that if I can only die good in some way,
*  shape or form or for something that it would it would matter and they would kind
*  of, you know, look at me with the same reverence I did it my brother.
*  So dying isn't the problem.
*  The goal of life is to die for something good.
*  Yeah, at least that was my that was my mindset going through that job.
*  I remember I was in medical school before that, you know, second year medical
*  school was doing pretty good.
*  And then 9-11 happened and, you know, that wasn't an option anymore for me.
*  The economy was horrible.
*  Couldn't afford to stay there.
*  So I saw it sat in the newspaper and my brother's my big brother was still alive
*  and he's like, you know, you're not going to do that shit.
*  You know, we wouldn't dare.
*  And all of a sudden I was in a field having my hair shaved off and a bunch of
*  the guys that later turned into the Zeta cartel military were in charge of our
*  training, you know, and I went through that process.
*  In what field were you and why is your head being shaved and what the hell was
*  going through your mind?
*  What was the leap that you took?
*  I was sold the idea of this being a new Americanized police force that they were
*  constructing in Mexico.
*  So elite, special force kind of prestigious elite.
*  The people in charge of our training were a lot basically ex Mexican, Mexican
*  Goff people.
*  Goff is what the special forces kind of originated.
*  A lot of their members turned into the Zeta cartel.
*  So they were brutal in their training.
*  We were sold this idea of it being, you know, scientific, like educated,
*  educated based and like a career path.
*  And all of a sudden we're in this refurbished prison that wasn't good enough
*  to be a prison and they turned it into a training ground.
*  And I quickly kind of realized that they were training us to be a paramilitary
*  group, not a community policing organization, which in my mind, that's, I
*  thought that's what we're going to be doing.
*  What was the hardest process of that training for you?
*  Is this just like a fragile, innocent boy becomes a man kind of process?
*  It's a, they're turning us into something that they could use.
*  So it's a breaking down.
*  They break down the individual, you know, it's a physically and mentally.
*  Yeah, I think it's a, it's a, it's a half done initiation process, I think in a way,
*  you know, looking at it from now to the past, the, the shaving of the hair, the
*  stripping off your identity, you know, everybody gets a, gets a number.
*  The uniforms, the running around and, and, you know, being treated like human
*  garbage.
*  The first thing they said to us when we were lined up in that field was a, a
*  Pani Berga para comer aquí, se acabó el pan, which means there's bread and
*  dick to eat here and the bread ran out a week ago, right?
*  So it was, I mean, I can't equate it to anything in the military, every in the
*  United States, because people down there could actually get physical with us.
*  I mean, they could actually hit us and punch us and shit like that, which is not
*  allowed here anymore, at least in most of the military isn't as horrible as
*  down there.
*  The AK-47 is being shot around us to simulate reality, basically causing
*  hearing loss, that type of stuff.
*  So chaos, abuse, really challenging you, again, physically and mentally.
*  And an open door there always.
*  So if you don't want to be here, you can just walk out and the more you go into it
*  time wise, you're more invested you are.
*  So in a way you're kind of building your own chains while you're going through
*  that process.
*  Were you tempted to walk out?
*  Yeah, several times, several times, specifically seeing some of the ways
*  that people that I thought were better or stronger than me were walking out or
*  quitting because of something that happened in there.
*  There was some sexual assault stuff happening in there as well.
*  Are you afraid of that?
*  Always, you know, you're in a place like that and there's females in the
*  environment and some of the instructors are doing what they do.
*  So that was like a cause for alarm.
*  I mean, these people are in charge of our safety and education and look at what's
*  happening here.
*  So you could see some of the smarter ones leaving, you know, not looking at
*  this as a viable choice for life.
*  How did that change you, those few months?
*  I had this motivation, this idealistic motivation in my head, you know, of
*  making a difference.
*  And they drill, they drill a lot of nationalistic kind of, you know, the
*  flag marching, it being part of a group and the group being behind you and all
*  of this.
*  What was the nationalistic pride?
*  It was in the nation of Mexico.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  What's the vision of this great nation of Mexico that you were, did you believe,
*  did it get into your blood?
*  I got into, I mean, it's indoctrination, you know, it's a paramilitary group.
*  So everything there is basically modeled after the military.
*  So that's what they were trying to kind of instill in us.
*  I was a, I was a team leader in there after three months.
*  Basically I was, we went through a bunch of trials, physical trials, mental trials
*  and stuff like that.
*  And some of us were named team leaders and I, you know, bought into it.
*  You know, I'm the, I'm supposed to be here.
*  Look at me.
*  I'm, I'm, I'm making headways.
*  I'm, I'm, I'm sticking out a bit, you know, and I was pretty proud of what I
*  was going through there, six months.
*  Then you get the reality check when you signed the dotted line and how that, none
*  of it really meant anything as far as what we were about to go out and do.
*  You know, an example of this, we were trained with a 92 FS Beretta, which is
*  a nine millimeter pistol, Italian made.
*  We got to shoot 20 rounds out of that gun.
*  And then we, when we got out, we were handed a Glock 17, which I've
*  never seen one in my life.
*  I was trying to figure out where the safety was and a few other people there
*  were handling those guns in a horrible manner.
*  So we were very under trained under equipped and there was a lot of assumptions
*  about what we knew and all of a sudden we were being cast into this, the, the
*  start of one of the, you know, bloodiest and longest lived modern conflicts in
*  our history that doesn't get called that, but it's, it's basically been an
*  ongoing war in Mexico that, that is still to this day, you know, amassing bodies.
*  So the Mexican drug war.
*  The Mexican drug war, which is, you know, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it
*  started because when I was going through training, there was already stuff going
*  on, I went into training at 2004 and there were already, you know, major
*  cartel related events all over Mexico by then, but not at the, at the size or
*  scope as I was about to go into, you know, when, uh, President Felipe Calderon
*  kind of took office down there and actually officially kind of kicked it off
*  by putting the military in play as part of a, as part of it's basically militarized
*  the drug war, you know, including us.
*  Who are the major players in this drug war?
*  So the politicians, the military, the police force, the cartels, all Mexican,
*  and the United States, China, just to lay out all the pieces on the board.
*  First off, there are giant local drug markets in Mexico that are fought over,
*  you know, just local drug markets that are huge in scope.
*  So no exporting to other locations.
*  Just to start.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So, um, a big, a big problem in Mexico is basically those local drug markets.
*  And an example of that, and one I have a lot of experience with is the one in
*  Tijuana, which not only feeds the local populace, but also feeds the populace
*  from San Diego that crosses down into, into Tijuana and buys their product there.
*  Um, and now, you know, a phenomenon that's occurring now is, uh, marijuana
*  trafficking is going from California down into Mexico because they produce
*  better weed, you know, which is fascinating to see now.
*  So there's already a channel and you kind of like reusing that channel.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people in vehicles getting checked when they drive down
*  Tijuana is being called San Diego South now because, you know, all the economic
*  migrants, you know, uh, living down there, 90% of all houses in Tijuana, new
*  houses are being bought up by Americans.
*  So that'll tell you something about the impact and change that's going on down there.
*  So you have these local drug markets that are being fought over.
*  You also have these drug routes that go through Mexico, up into Mexico, around
*  Mexico, through the ocean, under the wall, you know, drug tunnels over the wall.
*  And on backpacks, uh, on, uh, migrants that go up into the United States.
*  Uh, not only do the cartels make money off, uh, drug trafficking, but also
*  extortion, money laundering, uh, paid protection schemes, um, you know, any
*  mining operation in Mexico will have to pay protection, you know, or else they'll
*  get hit, uh, a lot of times money, the largest money makers for some of these
*  criminal groups are, you know, protecting and taxing anybody that goes across the
*  border.
*  So that's also a big issue.
*  Uh, and it's not just, again, uh, some Americans think it's like the cartels,
*  you know, they, they imagine this single or maybe two or three groups.
*  There's, there's several out there.
*  Uh, I don't have a current estimate, but last time I checked, it was somewhere
*  in the vicinity of 50, 70, the different groups, some small that just dedicate
*  themselves to a single little town somewhere.
*  There are armed groups that are basically in control of that area to some bigger
*  federations, like the Sinaloa cartel, which is probably currently the largest,
*  the most powerful one in Mexico and the new generation cartel, which is growing
*  exponentially right now.
*  Um, uh, so these criminal groups are, are players in that conflict.
*  Then another player that doesn't get talked about is politics, politicians.
*  Uh, there's a, there's an ongoing discussion that has been going on, I think,
*  since Trump was elected about, uh, cartels being a terrorist organism, cartels being
*  terrorist organizations or not, or if they fit that description.
*  Well, um, you know, we are living through, uh, multiple assassinations on political
*  candidates on in Mexico right now.
*  And most of those assassinations are motivated by one side sponsoring one
*  candidate and the other side sponsoring the other.
*  What I mean by sides, I mean cartel groups.
*  So they're, they have elected officials that are on the take.
*  And this is, we have, you know, many governors who are under investigation on the
*  run or in prison right now, uh, state governors.
*  So politics is involved in it.
*  That's a big player as well.
*  That doesn't, you know, when you, when you think about the cartel problems, you
*  don't think, well, some, at least some, most people don't think about that aspect
*  of it.
*  So to have integrity as a politician in Mexico means you have no protection and
*  under constant threat of assassination.
*  We just seen the arrest and prosecution of the head of all Conrad cartel
*  operations when I was active, uh, in the form of Garcia Luna, who was, uh, he was,
*  he was the guy, Philippe Calderon, who kicked off the drug war.
*  That was his guy.
*  Turns out he was, turns out he was on the deck at that level.
*  Is there like a spectrum of how on the take you can be, are there ethical lines
*  that you can cross some of it as money?
*  And then is it possible to operate in a gray area that does not result in
*  destructive ethical violations?
*  Deep ethical violations.
*  I have no idea.
*  I don't think, I don't think there is realistically, I mean, anything that kind
*  of supports some of these groups, you know, you're supporting things of,
*  of horrible nature.
*  Uh, there, I just posted recently on my Instagram account of a lady that
*  was in Guanajuato.
*  She's one of seven recently assassinated women that are looking for their kids.
*  Basically, uh, there's a bunch of, uh, groups and organizations out there in
*  Mexico and some in Tijuana that I've actually walked with who are taking
*  control of trying to find the bodies of their kids.
*  That's her up there.
*  Maria Carmela Vazquez, a mother who searched for a missing son was shot to
*  death outside her home on Sunday.
*  Her son, Osmar Vazquez disappeared on June 14th.
*  The 46 year old woman is the fifth mother to be killed this year while
*  searching for their missing loved ones.
*  She was a member of the Pinyamo missing person collective.
*  There's many groups out in Mexico who basically have given up on trusting the
*  government to find their kids.
*  Um, the number of missing in Mexico is a debated topic, uh, because, you know, the
*  government itself doesn't release those numbers, uh, or at least hasn't, uh, done
*  a good job about keeping them and or releasing them.
*  Um, Mexico was a country that has industrialized body disposal, you know,
*  uh, and Tijuana, we had the stew maker, the legendary stew maker, which is a guy
*  that basically use caustic acid, uh, acid, uh, to get rid of bodies at a massive
*  level.
*  So there's a separate operation for getting rid of bodies and murdering.
*  At least, at least in Tijuana, we saw that phenomenon and I, it's, it's obvious
*  that it's, it's going on all over Mexico.
*  Who's having those discussions about mass murder and getting rid of people.
*  I've been reading a lot about World War II recently, and there's, there's
*  aggressive innovation on the Nazi side of how to get rid of large number of
*  people.
*  That's for the longest time, both the Soviets and the Soviets were more brutal
*  with this is literally it's a engineering problem of how you kill a large number of
*  people and get rid of their bodies.
*  So the Soviets were more into, uh, just laying people, laying people down into the
*  grave face down and shooting them in the back of the head and then doing that on
*  mass scale.
*  So you just pile people on and then there was obviously innovation with the
*  Holocaust in terms of gassing people and all that kind of stuff.
*  I'm not sure exactly where these trade craft skills are coming from specifically.
*  Um, you hear discussions of Israelis training some of the cartel groups back in
*  the late nineties, uh, specifically the Ariane Fias cartel.
*  There's a lot of stories about that.
*  A security specialist coming down and showing them things like how to make
*  caustic soda, um, how to put, uh, rocks inside of bodies and then chicken wire
*  them around and throw them into the ocean or the, or river so that the bodies
*  don't float.
*  And when you kind of put rocks inside of body to make sure the body doesn't
*  float.
*  So you, uh, you open up the intestinal tract, put rocks inside.
*  Uh, you cut where tattoos are, you take off hands and faces and throw them
*  somewhere else and you wrap them in chicken wire.
*  So make it not identifiable.
*  Yeah.
*  And throw them into a body of water.
*  And this is, this, this is a horrible thing, but it's actually the craft.
*  It's a trade craft.
*  It's trade.
*  It's it's trade craft and it's, uh, it there's a, there's a link to the
*  U S as far as some of that trade craft.
*  You have to remember that, uh, the United States had a thing called school of
*  the Americas and, and the CIA and they showed things and a lot of that stuff is
*  out there in the hands of people that are of that generation.
*  So there's a manual, there's a manual on, uh, like with chapters and it's like
*  how to get rid of the body.
*  There's manuals out there.
*  Under time constraints or what, what are, how identifiable can the body be afterwards?
*  What, what are geographical constraints?
*  All that kind of stuff.
*  I think, I think that was common back in the early two thousands, uh, and maybe
*  the late nineties when some of these things were going on, but they've lost even
*  that as far as respect for the government or bodies being found right now.
*  You, what you usually see is just bodies being burnt to a crisp and buried in
*  a field somewhere.
*  That's usually what you'll see.
*  Uh, some of the groups like this, uh, this woman, uh, this woman belonged to
*  basically taking upon themselves to go out to find, uh, clandestine graves, uh, in
*  the outskirts of, of, of the towns that they're, that they live in, um, probing
*  the ground with these metal probes and seeing if the, uh, the, whatever they
*  encounter in the bottom of these, uh, these clandestine graves, stinks or not.
*  Uh, if they find IDs or clothing, they kind of gather that and they basically
*  presented to the investigative authorities in the towns or the states they live in,
*  which basically are doing their jobs.
*  You know, over 90% of all murders in Mexico were never resolved.
*  Uh, I mean, it's, uh, so they've, they've even stopped trying to get rid of bodies
*  in that way, you know,
*  How does a cartel take power?
*  How does it gain control of this local area that you mentioned and then grow
*  get, take control of a region and how does it do so in this dynamic relationship
*  between, um, politicians and the military and the police force?
*  It's the thing that happens over time.
*  There has always been a big effort, even when I was in, uh, to buy or own certain
*  members of the police force, even when we're going through training, some people
*  get pulled out during training because they were found out to have some sort of
*  parent or sibling that was a cartel member or they, uh, their FBI background
*  check came back negative, you know, even when they were already in the training
*  program.
*  Um, so I think part of it is first off, they, uh, take advantage of the fact that
*  Mexico is a young country, it's a country of young people.
*  Um, we have a, a big group of young people that have little to no opportunities
*  to come up.
*  Uh, when I was in, when I went to take that career path, a lot of my friends
*  took the other option, you know, they, they went to work for some of these
*  criminal groups.
*  Um, so they have this going for them.
*  They basically have a lot of bodies to, to, to, to hire cheaply.
*  And leverage in terms of, uh, forcing those bodies to do whatever is needed
*  because the alternative for those people is nothing.
*  There's no options.
*  So you have a kid somewhere who was working on a field, you know, or you have
*  a kid like me that was out of the job, out of school.
*  And the only options for me was, uh, this ad in the newspaper, which seemed like a
*  long shot or going with, uh, some of my friends that had cars now and, uh, were
*  hanging out all night at these bars.
*  And some of them had, you know, Draco AK 47, uh, pistols in their cars and it
*  would look cool, you know?
*  So there is a trajectory, there's many trajectories possible in your life where
*  you could have been still operating in a criminal organization in Mexico.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's, it's not a lot of options, you know, do you think you'd be good at
*  it?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I'm pretty good at what I do now, which is teaching people how to detect
*  it and kind of fight against it.
*  You know?
*  So I think, uh, I have a sense that that the skills transfer pretty well.
*  That's also the dark side of this whole thing.
*  A lot of the people that I used to work with, you know, I, I know things and I
*  have some training and I had some specialized training and I currently do,
*  I've done, you know, presentations for the secret service and the FBI and you
*  name it, I've gone there and shown them what I do.
*  A lot of my, a lot of the people that I used to work with who are out of the job
*  are in the wind, you know, and some of these people are way more trained than I
*  am, you know?
*  Uh, it's interesting what the, the reason why I get, get looked for and they
*  asked me questions is because I actually have the experience that my university
*  was the most dangerous city on the planet.
*  And when people ask me about some of that stuff, like I could speak from
*  experience as far as encountering some of that directly.
*  Some of the people that I used to work with were way better at it than I am.
*  Are in the wind.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting thing in Mexico.
*  If you are of a police organization and you get fired or you quit, you are
*  ineligible to join another police organization that, that discounts you.
*  So for somebody like me, who was a professional operations group member,
*  police officer in Mexico of that region, there's no options for me outside of that.
*  So they, they themselves basically have created this inescapable box for some of
*  these people that go into that line of work and where do they go after?
*  You know, I've heard offers of $12,000 to join some of the organizations out there.
*  Plus, you know, they get benefits, not unlike the government, you know, I'm
*  still waiting for my liquidation, my, my, my liquidation check.
*  This has been out of it, out of service for like six, seven years.
*  I'm still waiting for my check.
*  Uh, so some of these people, it's obvious that the opportunities are
*  presented to them out there are stronger, you know, and again, the youth is.
*  What gets eaten by this war.
*  And that's one of the main things that they start with just the youth.
*  We had a phenomenon in Tijuana early, early nine, uh, late nineties, early
*  few thousands called the narco juniors.
*  Narco juniors are basically bored middle middle, middle, middle, uh, middle
*  class or upper class families had kids that were bored and they just joined
*  some of these cartel groups, uh, these cartel groups on them opportunities to
*  get into regular industry, to go through the family businesses, to kind
*  of establish themselves, use some of those businesses to store for storage
*  or figure out how to use some of their transportation businesses for drug
*  mule-ing.
*  So this is how they start getting into different areas, you know, that
*  they regularly couldn't.
*  And, you know, that's how it starts.
*  You know, you owe somebody, uh, they get into paid paid protection, uh, the
*  type schemes that, which are also common all over Mexico and, uh, sooner or later
*  they start owning businesses and they regulate some of their income.
*  So they become part of the, uh, part of the, part of the local economy in a big
*  way.
*  I had this experience in Sinaloa where we were driving down this shitty street
*  and all of a sudden it became a cool, nice, you know, curvy high highway type
*  thing.
*  And I looked around there.
*  It's like, this is a nice road.
*  And the guy was with me.
*  He said, yeah, the cartels built it.
*  You know, um, you go to some of these towns and the cartels are the government
*  there.
*  They build the hospitals, they built the churches, they built the schools.
*  COVID happens.
*  They're enforcing the mask mandates, you know, they're out enforcing force in the
*  mask mandates, the state home policies.
*  They're the ones, uh, delivering supplies to the townspeople in bags, you know,
*  courtesy of so-and-so cartel, you know, so they, they, they become the, the
*  Robin Hood characters of their environments.
*  If they're smart, you know, these groups basically turn into that, you know,
*  Robin Hood, you know, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, or at least
*  that's the projection that they give.
*  What's the role of violence in this operation?
*  I'm extreme.
*  Uh, you know, it used to be that there were rules, as you say, like, you know,
*  we don't go after kids, don't go after women, but all those things are gone now.
*  You know, they had been gone for decades, I think.
*  Uh, the escalation of violence, you know, you kill one of mine, I'll kill four of
*  yours, you kill four of mine, I'll go after your family because you were hiding.
*  Um, there's stories of, uh, high level cartel people getting their sons and
*  daughters, you know, murdered, mutilated, uh, and revenge killings.
*  So I think it's, uh, it's at a point where it spiraled out of semblance of a
*  rule set as far as who can get exposed to some of this violence.
*  Those highly produced ISIS videos where they show torture and executions, uh,
*  according to some of the sources that I've talked to here in the United States
*  that were looking at that phenomenon.
*  They said that it seems to be that that was influenced by some of the Narco blog
*  videos that were coming out of Mexico early in the early 2000s.
*  Basically that some of these groups were the first ones that got wind of the
*  fact that you can, um, export terror or the horror that an execution has through
*  social media way back when Facebook was a bit more, a bit more of a wild land
*  area.
*  You could see these in newsfeeds, uh, videos of executions, tortures, and stuff
*  like that coming out of Mexico on Facebook way back when this was a different time.
*  Um, people who criticize social media and the moderation is a tough, it's a
*  tough job because the brutal world out there.
*  I mean, I remember seeing some of these ISIS videos on, on, on Facebook way back
*  when, and they, you know, they cracked down on all that.
*  But, uh, one that's kind of clear and I'll see, I'm not going to say where to
*  find it, but people out there might've seen it because some of these videos get
*  shared through WhatsApp groups and chat groups out there.
*  Uh, one of the ones that caught my attention way back when was a guy getting,
*  two guys getting executed by a chainsaw.
*  Um, and you know, people can kind of imagine what that would be like, but, uh,
*  this is produced on purpose.
*  Like it's videotaped on purpose.
*  It's a cartel group caught two rival cartel members and a way to send a message
*  to those other rival cartel is to basically execute these people in front of a camera.
*  Uh, I mean, you can't get to your rivals, but you can, you can make them see what
*  they're doing or at least make their people look at what happens if you, you
*  know, invade their territory.
*  So it's an escalation of brutality in the violence as well.
*  I mean, and then at least a terror and then sort of mass communication of terror.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you, you have videos of some of these people engage in cannibalism in
*  front of a video to see how brutal they are or, uh, people taking out somebody's
*  heart while they're alive, you know, and filming it and, you know, it used to be
*  social media as a whole, you would see some of these videos, they would, they
*  would get put down in a few days, but now there's a telegram groups.
*  Uh, there's a, you know, there's live leaks.
*  There's a bunch of other sites out there that kind of disperse some of these
*  videos and it's basically a bulletin board for them as far as, you know,
*  Hey, you got into my territory.
*  Well, this is what's going to happen to you.
*  Right.
*  Is there a game theoretic way to, uh, remove this kind of brutality, to
*  deescalate the brutality?
*  Cause it seems like if a cartel takes power that exceeds the power of politicians
*  in a locality, there's a strong incentive to reduce the brutality, to, uh, to crack
*  down on this kind of chainsaw executions.
*  You know, uh, there was a recent leak of, uh, government files.
*  Call them the Wacamaya leaks.
*  It's a, our version of the WikiLeaks, I guess.
*  And it was a mostly, uh, documents coming out of the Mexican military.
*  I haven't seen it talked about a lot here in Stateside, but it's a
*  pretty big thing down in Mexico.
*  And in some of those documents, it reveals how powerless the government is.
*  I mean, as far as the military goes.
*  So that's another player in Mexico, the military, uh, the military has been
*  has been out in the, in force in the streets, basically doing a policing role
*  since Felipe Calderon was, uh, as administration, he basically
*  militarized the drug war.
*  Um, Felipe Calderon was at the, uh, to the right of the political spectrum.
*  And his main rival who was his way to the left is now in power.
*  And one of the campaign promises he had was to demilitarize the drug war, to send
*  the military back to its barracks and all that.
*  And he's basically continuing on.
*  They just passed a, uh, some legislation that basically, uh, keeps the military
*  on the streets for a few more, few more years, you know?
*  Um, and I think some of these documents that were leaked, uh, are very telling
*  as far as why that is, uh, they have the military now has a vast amount of power
*  when it comes to security industry.
*  I mean, they're in charge of building airports and train lines in Mexico now.
*  Um, their documents themselves show how certain regions, uh, in Mexico who have
*  a specific military, uh, presence work for one side or favor one side of the cartel.
*  They're corrupted too.
*  So there's these military forces that are in part corrupted.
*  Yes.
*  And the cartel who's operates with violence, somehow finding a
*  balance between each other and no, I, it just feels like throughout human
*  history, there's, uh, dictators or leaders that come into situations like this
*  and really cracked down on the violence.
*  Yeah.
*  So it seems like that's not happening.
*  It seems like there's a kind of a market of violence happening here.
*  There's a systemic amnesia that happens every presidency in Mexico.
*  So, uh, president comes in, he has five to six years to do whatever he needs to
*  do.
*  And he does everything.
*  And as soon as he's gone, everything he did, even, even the, what was
*  working gets chopped off.
*  Police, uh, organizations get defunct or change, or their names get changed.
*  Uniforms change.
*  So there's a lot of turnover, uh, everywhere.
*  Every five years, federally, there's a turnover and things change.
*  What about the cartels?
*  Do they persist?
*  Yeah.
*  The leadership persists.
*  I mean, the Sinaloa cartel has, uh, has had a figurehead behind it since the
*  eighties, the same one, you know?
*  Uh, I mean, it's a, it's a federation of smaller cartels that are all kind of
*  linked up, but the pretty much historically who was considered the head of the
*  Sinaloa cartel, El Maio Sambada has been, has been there since, you know, since
*  the eighties.
*  So in a way, yeah, he, he's persisting.
*  He's surviving all of these, uh, presidencies.
*  Again, these documents that were leaked are a clear sign of what strengths and
*  weaknesses there are as far as the government's main weapon against some of
*  these criminal groups, which is the military.
*  And if people doubt this, they can look it up now online because all these
*  documents are out there.
*  Um, but you know, this is a clear thing.
*  The Mexican Navy or the Marina doesn't work with the Mexican army.
*  They don't speak to each other.
*  So that should tell you everything you need to know as far as the
*  trust.
*  That could be just bureaucratic dysfunction.
*  They don't trust each other.
*  Are they both struggling with the problem of corruption?
*  Some of these documents that are already, that are already out there talk about,
*  uh, uh, the ports in Mexico, which are probably the main conduit of, uh,
*  precursors of methamphetamines and precursors of things like fentanyl into
*  the country, they're operated and guarded by the Marina, right?
*  So these things are happening under their watch and, and they're
*  and then you get, uh, talks of talk about the army in certain places,
*  basically working, uh, counter cartel operations on to, to specifically one
*  side, not, not another, you know, as far as the rival groups out there.
*  And we have a long history of some of these, uh, groups going, uh, military
*  groups going rogue, Los Etas are a prime example of this, these, uh, special
*  forces, uh, units, uh, that, uh, basically turned around and went to work as
*  bodyguards for the golf cartel and then decided, uh, but what they basically
*  did was an internship with a cartel, you know, they went out there, did
*  bodyguarding for the golf cartel and then realized that can do a better job
*  than they were doing.
*  So they started their own sparking off one of the, again, one of the bloodiest
*  kind of like, uh, internal cartel wars in Mexico's history.
*  Who was El Chapo?
*  El Chapo was a part of the leadership or at least a faction of the leadership
*  in the cartel.
*  It's a federation of different, uh, of small organizations.
*  Well, I say small organizations, basically families or organizations
*  that, uh, conform this larger group, which is the Sinaloa cartel that
*  is based out of Sinaloa.
*  Basically, uh, they are people that, uh, have a family and power
*  nucleus is there in Sinaloa.
*  I mean, uh, who was he?
*  I think he was, uh, he was a high level operator for the Sinaloa cartel.
*  He, uh, he had his own drug routes, his own networks, his family is, uh, his
*  family, uh, nucleus down there is still in control of some of those operations.
*  So his arrest really didn't change anything.
*  Um, but he wasn't the mastermind number one leader that I think the media and
*  the government kind of portrayed him as, you know, who was the mastermind.
*  If you go down there and you read, uh, what most of the, uh, brave journalists
*  in Mexico that we have, uh, say another aspect of this war is that a lot of
*  journalists get killed.
*  I think Mexico has a, I think has some of the top numbers in the world.
*  And this is not no secret to anybody.
*  Uh, El Mayo Sambada is the name of the, the historical figurehead of this cartel
*  or at least somebody who people theorize or suspect to be the, uh, the, the, the
*  main guy or the main person that is in charge of some of the sub-discriminate
*  group is still alive.
*  That's the going rumor that he's still very much alive.
*  And the interesting thing about him is that he learned his craft in Los Angeles.
*  So people thinking that Sinaloa cartel isn't a Mexican thing.
*  It's actually, uh, he, uh, he apparently learned a lot of his craft from, uh,
*  people in the United States.
*  And that's the craft of leadership, the craft of business, the craft,
*  the craft of getting a product from Columbia, putting it through Mexico.
*  And the logistics, the logistics part of it.
*  And he somehow is, uh, operating in the shadows.
*  So he's not a known entity.
*  I don't have a clear number of this, but he was interviewed by a magazine
*  called process in Mexico and some pictures were taken of him.
*  It was over 10 years ago, probably.
*  And that's the last time anybody's ever seen a picture of him.
*  What's it like to be a journalist in that?
*  So, uh, can, can a journalist have a conversation with him and live?
*  Nonetheless, he asks to have that conversation.
*  I think he, he reached out to this, uh, journalist to talk about it.
*  Um, there's a, there's a media wing, uh, to the work that we do, a sister
*  page called demo there and, and it's, uh, run by some pretty good people.
*  And the way we met is that I was basically training them how to
*  work in hostile environments.
*  And they were like, oh, we're going to go report on cartel activity in Mexico.
*  And I was like, you know, that is a year and a half ago, a reporter went to the
*  president's daily briefing, uh, press conference that he has, they call them
*  my Mayanera president and the president, uh, Manuel Lopez Obrador and told him to
*  his face, like, uh, I have threats on my life.
*  They're trying to kill me.
*  And it happened.
*  There's been a slew of assassinations and murders of the members of
*  the press all over Mexico.
*  It's not an easy job.
*  Uh, either they say too much or they say things that favor one side or the other,
*  which is another aspect of it that is interesting.
*  I don't, I don't consider myself a reporter.
*  I don't report on the news in Mexico.
*  I have friends that do that very well.
*  I commentate on some of it only.
*  Uh, but you see a lot of these, uh, cartel reporters go down there, talk to a specific
*  side and basically speak one side of the story.
*  And that is not something that the other side wants.
*  You know, if you, if you go down there and speak to one side, you're saying
*  what they want people to know or hear.
*  So in a way you're kind of spreading some of their cartel propaganda in a way.
*  And that's how some people, you know, get shot.
*  Do you think it's possible to go in there and have a conversation with a cartel
*  leader or somebody like me for somebody like Sean Penn?
*  This is what I will say.
*  Uh, after, after that whole Sean Penn thing, I think a lot of people would
*  reconsider a meeting with anybody of any level that has any variety here in the
*  United States, they don't, they wouldn't trust anybody to get that close.
*  Um, there are people out there that will talk to reporters and help people that
*  are working on a lab laboratory somewhere in a hillside, somewhere down, down south,
*  you know, the Sierra, uh, you know, low level people that get authorization to
*  speak to reports and stuff like that.
*  But they don't say anything that isn't being taught or shown in their various
*  different ways or outlets out there for them.
*  I mean, some of these guys have Instagram accounts, you know, some of
*  these guys said blog about it, you know, not the leaders, tick tock, no, not the
*  leaders, I think after what happened to, to a shop of Gooseman, I think that, that,
*  uh, that opportunity, that window was closed, uh, for, for some of the leadership
*  down there, I think I disagree.
*  I think, uh, they're just more sensitive, realizing that there has to be a deep
*  trust, it's not just anybody and not any high profile I've gotten a chance to speak
*  to some very high profile leaders that don't speak to journalists and they
*  understand the value of trust.
*  If they have something to say, which I don't think they do, you know, I
*  don't think they at least unless at some point in the future, which is something
*  I suspect might, it might be coming, that there is some sort of armed
*  intervention and or external attack on some of these criminal groups that
*  really puts the pressure on them.
*  You don't think there's a human aspect to this of a human being wanting
*  their story to be known versus versus this is different than the propaganda
*  machine of I have something to say, I have some message to put out there to play
*  the game of politics and power and money and all that kind of stuff.
*  Isn't there also a human being underneath all that armor that for, for the sake
*  of perhaps ego legacy wants to be understood?
*  I think in a way they already do that.
*  Uh, there's corridos, which are basically Mexican folk songs that get, uh, that
*  get, uh, sung about some of them.
*  So in a way, some of these, some of these singers are reporting on some of their
*  lives and it's like, uh, it's a great honor to have a corrido made about you.
*  No, I, somebody, somebody made a corrido about me based on my interviews, right?
*  I didn't pay for it.
*  So it's a real one.
*  It's, it feels cool.
*  So creating a myth, the legend of the man.
*  I think it's about, uh, I think a way you can, you can find somebody like that is
*  somebody that wants to get their story specifically clear and straight.
*  Uh, you know, coming from that culture and getting to work for the government down
*  there and then not being, not working for the government down there and being on the
*  outside, being critical of not only the government that is in place now, but also
*  the government that actually work with.
*  Uh, I can tell you that there's villains all over the place down there.
*  Everybody's a villain, you know, at all levels in some way, shape or form.
*  And some of these people, I think in a way, including El Chapo, I think that some
*  of that, that meeting was about film rights and, and stories and being able to
*  get his story out there.
*  I think I don't, I'm not, I'm not too sure.
*  And I wasn't there, but I suspect that some of that was going on.
*  If you can bring an honest voice down there, they can trust to put that out there.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think, I think you could try.
*  I'm interested in that kind of thing.
*  I, um, because ultimately in some of those places, like.
*  Inside a cartel at the very top is when you can really look at the raw
*  aspects of human nature in a way you can't necessarily elsewhere.
*  There's a youth coming into power down there.
*  And when I say youth, I mean, some of the old guard is going out and some of the
*  new guard is coming in.
*  Uh, an example of this is, uh, El Chapo Guzman's sons who are now in their own
*  right, kind of getting, gaining legendary status, uh, is, uh, his son, there was an
*  attempted arrest on his son that led to the famous Culiacanazo incident, uh, which
*  we are now learning more about because some of the Guacamaya leaks are kind of
*  speaking more about what happened that day.
*  Uh, basically a federal operation, uh, to, they say to, to arrest El Chapo
*  Guzman's, uh, son, um, turned into a siege to try and get them free.
*  They called in the Calvary, basically the whole of the Sinaloa cartel
*  showed up to try and rescue them.
*  Interesting thing about that is in reading some of the documents and also just seeing
*  some of the videos and stuff like that came out of that incident.
*  The cartels were the ones evacuating the citizenship from the area.
*  They were the ones going restaurant to restaurant saying, Hey, if you want to
*  exit the city, go through here, take your families, get down, but you have to leave
*  because the army is coming here and they're going to fight us.
*  Um,
*  so there's like a deep morality to, to all of that underneath the violence.
*  There's a humanity.
*  I mean, it's their home.
*  Yeah, it is their home.
*  Uh, and they were fighting for their home and they were fighting
*  for leadership from their home.
*  Uh, there is a morality, there is a humanity there.
*  And again, I don't know if people want to paint them all with the
*  villainy aspects, you know, uh, that's, I mean,
*  everybody's a villain in every, in somebody else's story.
*  You know, if we, if you kind of look at it that way,
*  people should check out your page, try and check out your field notes.
*  You have, you're a really good writer.
*  Your Instagram too.
*  You write about, you have a quote in your field notes about villains.
*  Quote, I once worked for a villain, a savior to some and the biblical
*  demon of old to others, a true product of his environment.
*  He was the best and the worst of us were all potential villains in someone
*  else's story, he would say to us as you, as we would head out into the unknowns
*  that the night had waiting for us.
*  It was during one of these nights that I looked around me and saw horns and
*  pitchforks among my people and realized what he meant.
*  We were no nights of the round table.
*  Whatever we were, we were needed in the end.
*  I guess that justified most of what was about to happen.
*  Uh, do you think El Chapo, do you think people like him are good or evil?
*  I think there's no one without the other.
*  I think there's a, there's a cost to, there's a cost to, uh, their goodness
*  that they do, you know, the roads they build, the hospitals, the career
*  paths that they pay for, uh, there's there, there are doctors in Mexico
*  that their careers were paid for by some of these groups, uh, and they do a
*  lot of amazing good for the community.
*  I remember there was a, a surgeon, uh, reconstructing cleft palates.
*  In one of my travels that I did out there, I, I had, I spent some time
*  actually going out there after I got out of the job to train people and the
*  type of stuff that I show people.
*  And, uh, they, uh, they told me like, I told them like, you're doing God's work.
*  This stuff, this stuff is like legit.
*  This is God's work, you know, building smiles for people.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  And then can I talk to you?
*  Yeah.
*  He said, you know, my career path was paid for by.
*  Cartel, a group of cartel members, they paid for my career path because they
*  wanted somebody on hand that could fix their teeth.
*  Do you think some aspects of that is just sort of manipulative control or is
*  some of it also just again, a care for the population for fellow human beings
*  that are one of your own?
*  I think both, you know, I think there's, again, that's hard to, it's hard to
*  just make them saints or devils.
*  Some of the good they do in some of their communities and don't ask anything
*  for in return, you know, uh, and even if they don't ask it for anything in return
*  where the military shows up, they are immediately met with rocks and roadblocks
*  and everybody's, uh, main weapon down there, since most Mexicans can't buy or
*  own firearms, the main weapon down there is silence and their eyes to report to
*  the people that they consider the good guys in their environment.
*  Right.
*  So that's a hard question.
*  You know, I think, uh, I think there's a bit of both and both the government
*  and the criminal groups that are operating down there.
*  Silence is their main weapon.
*  So El Chapo is currently in prison.
*  Is he worth talking to?
*  I'd say yes.
*  Is there a way to get him to talk to you?
*  I'd say yes.
*  Is there things that to you are interesting about him that are still not understood?
*  Is he a window into something that you don't understand about that world still?
*  Or curious about in that world?
*  I think he's a window into the family dynamics of that world.
*  I want to say family dynamics.
*  Um, Mexico has a big thing about compadres, you know, and hermanos.
*  I mean, we have people that we call family that were not necessarily our family.
*  Uh, he is somebody that witnessed the, the, the construction of what is now
*  the Sinaloa cartel, like he was in it way back when he started off as a, as a farmer
*  and then went into trafficking.
*  He's from a town called Bandira, which is basically, you know, that's the, uh,
*  the Wakanda of cartels, basically.
*  That's where a lot of that originates.
*  Um, the, the things that he saw as far as how some of these things got built, I think
*  would be an interesting topic of conversation with somebody like him.
*  So that story is a story of evolving family dynamics.
*  So part of the story of the cartel is individual humans, marrying other families,
*  getting, uh, getting named the padrino, basically godfathers to other people's kids.
*  Um, forming family and blood ties and influence ties to people, not only in
*  Mexico, but in the United States, it's seeing how that dynamic and family
*  dynamic is still there, you know, so he's gone, he's in prison, but he is,
*  he's probably on his way to be our next, uh, clandestine saint.
*  You go to the, uh, the chapel of Malverde.
*  Malverde is basically a Mexican Robin Hood, the folk saint down there, who, uh,
*  is a saint of traffickers.
*  And at his shrine, you have small little chapel, the shrine right next to it.
*  So he's on his way to sainthood in Mexico, you know, not, not recognized by the
*  Catholic church, but that doesn't matter in Mexico anymore.
*  Speaking to somebody like him, who you can consider him somebody that lost,
*  you know, he's, he's arrested, but his family's okay.
*  His, uh, his legacy is out there.
*  He's going to be named.
*  He's probably going to be the next folk saint when he passes away.
*  Do you think he feels like the new wave of what the cartel has become has
*  betrayed him, has left him behind or, um, because it seems like the way the
*  cartel operated has changed over the decades.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, number one, their power and influence is bigger.
*  You know, uh, they, there are seen the law cartel operations in Columbia
*  straight, straight to the, like in the source of it.
*  And, uh, then there are clear, uh, they have a clear presence in, in
*  places like Chicago and Los Angeles.
*  Uh, they're in the United States, the whole thought process that a lot of
*  Americans have like, ah, we don't want that trouble over here.
*  We don't want them to get here, like build the wall and all this.
*  So they're deeply integrated into legitimate businesses.
*  I mean, they've been having kids and families up here since for a long time.
*  Some of these people have pass up American passports that works not only
*  directly for them, but have blood ties down there.
*  You know, there's been.
*  Drag nets and arrest of some of these, uh, criminal organizations, uh, states.
*  I new generation cartel had one, two, three years ago where the guest
*  operation on the condo, I think it was called, there was over 80 of their
*  operatives and this is a new cartel that is very militaristic and growing in
*  Mexico and they had over 80 arrests in the United States, you know, that, uh,
*  of members of them operating here.
*  And so you could be a legitimate operator inside the United States.
*  That's hard to detect.
*  Makes you wonder how many in the U S government, the politicians here is it
*  is the role of the United States in the drug war financially in terms of power.
*  It's very big.
*  Yeah.
*  Surely there's politicians that have a finger into this.
*  Immigration is part of it.
*  Uh, illegal immigration as part of it.
*  And the influence of that has as a, as a bargaining chip and a political chip.
*  We saw this with the first caravan kind of coming up and how it was politicized
*  the money, fast and furious and guns being basically let walk down into Mexico.
*  People that don't know, basically the ATF had this operation where they were
*  looking at straw purchasers or firearms.
*  Basically people buying up a specific type of firearms that were on a
*  shopping list that the cartels wanted to buy, including, uh, you know, 50
*  cows, uh, FN five seven pistols, which are small pistols with a high velocity
*  round that will go through a bulletproof vest, um, AR 15 of all kinds, uh, that
*  could quickly be modified into full auto down in Mexico with a, with a drilling
*  a few holes and making a few things, uh, to them.
*  So these people were buying all these, the ATF was watching them and allowing
*  them to walk those firearms into Mexico under the guise of trying to track them
*  somehow, which doesn't make a lot of sense for most people to kind of look at
*  that operation.
*  The only people found the, the only reason people found out about it was
*  because of the murder of a few federal agents of the U S federal agents that
*  were killed with those guns.
*  One of my friends was shot with one of those pistols outside of his house and
*  they shot him and they shot her, his wife.
*  Uh, both of them were killed.
*  Daughter was in the back seat, lost a part of her arm.
*  When that happened, the guns were unique.
*  There were like, oh, we didn't ever like the matter.
*  Policies is what they call them.
*  They're the cop killers.
*  I haven't seen those before, so they were unique and interesting.
*  And later on in life, I was watching CNN and seeing the hearings going on.
*  I was like, oh, that's where they came from.
*  Uh, two federal agents changed a lot and it was politicized.
*  There was a whole scandal up here, but in Mexico, how many people died with
*  those firearms, you know, being let down, being let go down there.
*  And also what type of sentiment you think the local populous has of the United
*  States after all those guns were basically handed over to some of these groups.
*  You know, gun trafficking is another giant part of the equation and part of the
*  problem down there as far as, uh, as far as the amount of munitions, uh, weapons.
*  And now we were also getting, um, trade craft material from conflict zones
*  outside of Mexico, so weaponized drones.
*  The first time we saw, uh, some of those weaponized drones was, uh, in Syria.
*  And like, uh, like a few weeks later, you know, grenades were being
*  dropped on the roofs of some, uh, public officials, uh, building cartels.
*  Are using drones.
*  Yeah.
*  That's been going on for a while.
*  There's a place in Michoacan has some pretty interesting videos.
*  And the interesting part of it is because the federal police down there are actually
*  working hand in hand with a United Carteles Unidos group, which is basically
*  the local cartels to try and fight off the new generation cartel moving into
*  Michoacan.
*  So even the federal forces are fighting with the cartels to try and keep this
*  larger cartel out and there's videos of these, uh, civilian drones, basically
*  dropping explosives, uh, they found some explosive testing ranges out there that
*  are basically replicating stuff that you would see the IRA use during the con
*  troubles out there from homemade mortars.
*  Um, you know, IEDs have been used in Mexico that not that much, but they're,
*  they're making like a presence again.
*  You know, we don't have a lot of ordinance around like Iraq, but we do have
*  a big mining industry down there.
*  So mining, mining explosives of all kinds are pretty easy to get.
*  So you start seeing that.
*  And also, I mean, there's some exotic weaponry coming in from the south now
*  and from the ocean that some of it is probably a U S military equipment sold to
*  various South American governments that are now not as stable as they were.
*  And they're kind of making their way into black markets.
*  So a lot of those, uh, 50 cow and vehicle mounted technical type machine guns and
*  some of the RPGs and, uh, man pads or remote control guided missiles that you
*  that have been found in cartel hands are probably making their way up from down
*  south.
*  Do you get these like multimillion dollar systems, like the high Mar system
*  in the, in the Ukraine, you're like super sophisticated advanced technology or
*  we're not.
*  So like, this is like military grade.
*  I'm not sure what the application would be exactly in the Mexico.
*  Some of the, some of the sophisticated stuff I see in our man pads, which is
*  basically remote guided missiles.
*  That's I've seen some of those found out.
*  What is the application exactly?
*  A display of power.
*  There are no flight zones over parts of Mexico for this reason.
*  The new generation cartel took down a helicopter.
*  There's been incidents of military helicopters falling from the sky and it
*  bit that they said that it was mechanical issues, but again, I'm not, I'm not going
*  to do conspiracy theories out there, but there's, there's a lot of videos on
*  tick tock of, uh, seeing Laura cartel forces at parties and carrying around,
*  uh, rocket launchers on their backs.
*  And, you know, so
*  so there's an increased probability of mechanical failures over those areas
*  when you're flying a helicopter.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no flight zones over some parts of Mexico.
*  And, uh, another thing you're seeing now is night vision, uh, night vision
*  equipment, uh, that is clearly military grade from the U S that was probably
*  abandoned in some more field out there.
*  So maybe Afghanistan or somewhere like that.
*  And it's, uh, it's being found in safe houses and in the hands of cartel forces.
*  You want to talk about a scary opponent, somebody wearing night vision
*  with a suppressed firearm.
*  Those types of capabilities are now out there.
*  Also, there's this tendency to think, uh, in every now and then you'll see these
*  cartel videos with these guys carrying around these 50 cows and they show up,
*  stand there like, you know, the boasting about the rifles and everybody laughed
*  at them because the 50 cal or anything like that without an optic on it, you
*  know, is like, you're going to shoot your prey and shoot, basically see if you can
*  hit anything with it.
*  Uh, but now there's a, a few of my sources have seen, you know, sophisticated,
*  uh, laser guided, uh, range finders and, and siting systems on some of these that
*  are being found out there.
*  How much damage can 50 cal?
*  What's the application?
*  They started getting them specifically with the proliferation of armored
*  vehicles in Mexico, Mexico has a giant industry in armored vehicles as far as.
*  So there's a race in terms of, uh, armoring, like protecting, especially high value
*  targets and then weapons that can deal with those armored, protected, high value
*  targets.
*  There was a, an attempted assassination of a state prosecutor somewhere in, I
*  think central Mexico, I forget exactly where, but she was, uh, riding around a
*  up armored, uh, Jeep, uh, Cherokee, I think it was, and their main means of, of,
*  uh, firepower was 50 cows and that car was left in pieces.
*  He survived then.
*  And so I think the armored vehicle company that sold her that vehicle has
*  it in the display room.
*  Uh, then before my time, probably two, three years before I was actually active,
*  they tried to kill the head of public security and, and the state of Baja.
*  And with him, it was a grenade launcher, 40 millimeter grenade launcher.
*  It, uh, it skipped off the V other armored vehicle and landed in the car
*  behind it, made the back explode.
*  Uh, one of the guys that I used to work with was actually in that car.
*  He survived it.
*  Um, but you started to see, oh, they're, you know, using our vehicles now.
*  Let's get 50 caliber now to try and defeat that armor.
*  So that, yeah, there's, there's, there's always this, uh, this race of
*  technology basically down there armored vehicles, you know, how do you take
*  on an armored vehicle?
*  Well, there's a few ways 50 cows, you know, if you can mount them in a right
*  way and shoot at a car like that, or a bunch of kids with balloons and, uh,
*  acrylic paint on the front windshield and blind the vehicle so it doesn't, so
*  they can't drive it anymore.
*  There's another way, uh, tow line across a road painted like the painted, painted
*  black, so you can't see it and cut the thing in half.
*  Again, I'm not saying any secrets.
*  These are things that people have seen out there.
*  Uh, yeah, but shoot at the radiator, you know, uh, some of these radios are not,
*  uh, even the more sophisticated, uh, vehicles out there don't have a sufficient,
*  uh, armoring around the radiator or the battery housing of some of these vehicles.
*  There was a case of a guy, I think his nickname was at Pela Vacas or something
*  like that out in Sinaloa, a level cartel guy, he had an armored vehicle.
*  He was, you know, riding around and he got ambushed, shot at his car.
*  He was like, ah, I have armor.
*  He can't shoot me.
*  And somebody went up to his car and just put the barrel right in the locking
*  mechanism and that got him, you know?
*  So it's an interesting place as far as people getting certain types of guns.
*  Armor is prolific down there.
*  I mean, everybody down there, like cartel, cartel members, you're
*  seeing them wearing plate armor.
*  So that's an issue.
*  It's not like you can shoot somebody square in the chest and it'll go down.
*  Are they afraid to kill Americans?
*  So I know I was traveling in Ukraine on the front.
*  So like a lot of the journalists would travel in like armored vehicles.
*  And at first I was like, it seems like this would attract attention.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it seems like they would want to hit those targets.
*  But then, then I realized over time, as I learned, there's a, there's a fear of
*  killing Americans that could be a drastic escalation of conflict.
*  It's not like a beehive.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, it's yeah, there's, there's, there is a tendency to shy away or stay away from
*  that, you know?
*  I mean, these, they don't want the heat or the attention outside of that.
*  Everyone's game, everyone's game.
*  But also there's been many cases of Americans being killed down there.
*  I mean, we saw the Mormon massacre, uh, happened down there and all of them were
*  American, Mexican, they had both nationalities and the blonde kids, you know,
*  white being a massacre in the middle of a desert, uh, and the cars, uh, basically
*  catching fire.
*  This happened and, you know, the America, Americans, uh, sent the FBI down there to
*  kind of review some of what happened down there.
*  And, uh, I think that was when Trump started, uh, talking about kind of reviving
*  this whole notion of cartels being labeled as a terrorist organization, probably more
*  for other political pressure point he was using to try and get Mexico to reinforce
*  its Southern border, uh, which it hasn't, but there's escalation.
*  You know, Oh, this, this already happened and nothing happened.
*  So we can probably get away with it, you know?
*  And again, there's a newer generation moving forward now of people coming into
*  power, more brutal, more technically savvy.
*  Well, they have the experience of their parents and the people behind them and
*  what they've done and what got away with.
*  And now, yeah, more savvy about information warfare.
*  Their main recruiting tool is tech talk.
*  You go to tech talk and you'll see a bunch of these kids, uh, at an
*  archipelago dancing around.
*  And some of these are videos by cartel members, filming other cartel members in
*  cartel control territory.
*  And that's a window into that life for who's on tech talk now, kids.
*  And the enticing aspect of that is the money, the fun, the high roller life,
*  and the possibility of making it to a level, you know, a fame of, uh, respect,
*  power, money here in the U S somebody might, you know, I want to mention,
*  and I would like that, that's their mindset.
*  I want to live, you know, like that rapper down there.
*  I mean, if you can buy a house for your mom, you know, or pay off some debts
*  that she might have or a car, that's enough to kill for.
*  So you also, one of the many things you did is, uh, you did security, try to
*  protect in this, in this war, try to protect people, high value people.
*  How do you do you and others?
*  How is it possible to protect a high value target, like a celebrity or an
*  important politician in the situation?
*  So I was, uh, I was tasked to protect the governor of Baja and his family.
*  I was basically replacing a whole contingency of people that were already
*  there that turned out to be corrupted.
*  That wasn't my field.
*  I was operational.
*  I was working with other people doing the counter narcotics stuff and, uh,
*  the director of the institution that I was in basically called me and said,
*  they, uh, you're going to go and replace this as these people.
*  And I, what happened to them?
*  I see you were known as a person that could be kind of trusted.
*  I was tasked for that.
*  So I think they considered that.
*  And, uh, and I specifically worked for a governor named, uh, Jose Guadalupe
*  Osuna Mian, uh, who was probably one of the best governors we have had in the
*  state and people want to see if I'm trustworthy or not, they can ask him
*  directly and I still speak to some of the members of his family and we're still,
*  you know, friends in that way.
*  It's protecting people like technically a difficult problem to solve.
*  For my experience in that time and place, he was basically spearheading,
*  you know, counter the drug war in Baja when he was in power.
*  So he had threats from all over, not only him, but his family.
*  First thing I realized working that job in Mexico is that, uh, we had, we had
*  people coming in to do specialized training of that regard, Israelis, you
*  know, teaching us how they would do things in Israel that didn't make a lot
*  of sense for us in Mexico, you know, uh, we had people that had some secret
*  service experience kind of show us how, showing us how they would do like
*  celebrity bodyguarding or bodyguarding somebody, maybe in California of that
*  nature didn't make sense for us.
*  Then we got to experience some cross-training with, um, uh, NSW
*  naval, naval special warfare people who were coming off, uh, protection
*  details in Afghanistan and Iraq.
*  Is there some useful crossover there?
*  We were struggling with the acceptance that we were basically doing
*  protection details in a war zone.
*  So the approach, uh, that had to be taken in Mexico was some of the
*  approach you would take in Afghanistan during a war.
*  Some of the overt militaristic type approaches to security that we had to
*  adopt, you know, from, uh, we didn't move him in a single armored vehicle.
*  We had two of them that looked exactly alike.
*  So when we would move around, we would switch one car through the other every
*  now and then we would arrive to an event.
*  They would open the door and would be one of us.
*  And they were like, Hey, where's the governor?
*  He's in the back one.
*  So they would move to that.
*  So we had to do stuff like that.
*  And again, this is a young me who didn't have any specialized training.
*  I was, I was on YouTube learning, learning some of these things, uh, going
*  online, learning about armor vehicles, learning about architectural armor.
*  I think you just described a large percentage of the Ukrainian military, how
*  they operate, which is on YouTube, trying to figure out how to use some of the
*  segment and, uh, that's actually incredibly effective.
*  You know, I've do quite a lot of stuff where I'm totally not an expert, totally
*  uneducated and so on.
*  It's kind of surprising how quickly you can get caught up as we're talking
*  offline.
*  If you take a course, if you talk to an expert, if you learn from an expert, you
*  can like catch up really quickly.
*  For me, it was all of a sudden they have this, uh, director calling me in and I'm
*  wearing vans, you know, in jeans, you know, t-shirt.
*  And all of a sudden I had 80, 80, some people that I had to move around and I
*  was in charge of, uh, securing planes and, uh, which I, what do I know about that?
*  Airport hangars, uh, armored vehicle maintenance and, and, and, and purchasing
*  and figuring out how to set up a counter assault, uh, group for, for a protection
*  detail.
*  And I was like, where am I going to learn all this?
*  Were you able to quickly figure, figure some of these things out?
*  On the fly, basically, you know, as I was going, I remember having this experience,
*  uh, being in the, uh, our security office on my laptop, figuring out how to set up
*  a counter surveillance, uh, side to our protection detail, basically how to have
*  people looking for people that might be looking for us, you know, type thing.
*  And then going to, uh, San Diego to Coronado and training with some people
*  from, uh, former SEAL guys and, uh, NCIS people who did that job in war zones and
*  seeing them critique some of the solutions that we came up with on the fly
*  and being like, oh, we never saw that before.
*  Yeah, this is, we're doing it down there.
*  So getting that compliment and also getting their feedback, like we probably
*  do this or do that.
*  And it's, it was a learning process on the fly.
*  That was pretty, I mean, seat of your pants level.
*  Is it possible for the family and for the high value person to, um, to have a
*  sense of normalcy, to have a normal life?
*  I mean, I tried, I was already starting off on the wrong foot basically because
*  trust had been violated by the people that I was replacing.
*  So I had to gain that back.
*  Then young kids in that family that wanted to have a, you know, go out and
*  stuff like that in the most violent city on the planet.
*  So I had to do my homework and figure out places where they were safe to go to
*  and make friends with certain club owners and figure out ways to put security in
*  some of these places and having to create this bubble of normalcy around
*  some of these people was pretty difficult.
*  And, uh, there's no way that that is a normal for anybody.
*  And, you know, God bless them.
*  The, the, I know it didn't, I know it wasn't easy and I know they'd affected
*  their lives and they, they lost on a big part of their youth being under that,
*  that security supervision and bubble does probably does a lot for, for somebody
*  specifically growing up like that.
*  You know, uh, you lose opportunities of things that we take for granted, you
*  know, just going out, just not telling anybody and going to the store, you know,
*  because you want to get some snacks or something like that.
*  That's not available to some of these people.
*  I have to be honest when I was in Ukraine, that was a really big benefit.
*  You'd escape.
*  No, I couldn't hang out.
*  I couldn't eat when I'm stressed.
*  I would fast and not eat much.
*  So I get lost weight.
*  So it's great.
*  It's great for the diet.
*  That's a good idea to be basically be under protective custody.
*  That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a good idea for a good, you know, you
*  tie it and just life.
*  It allowed me to focus, get a lot of reading done, uh, focus on the
*  important things in life.
*  I mean, uh, I joke, of course, but there's some, there's some complexity to
*  this in terms of normalcy of the family, but also just how to operate, like
*  have a mental clarity and a lack of fear.
*  Just basically be good at your job, whatever that job is as a politician,
*  as a leader, uh, even as a soldier.
*  Somebody that I like, and I think it is, it's a Belize Aola.
*  She had this to me or said something like this to a group of us that there's
*  nothing wrong with being paranoid.
*  It's about educating your paranoia and knowing what to be afraid of.
*  If you're afraid of everything, you know, you're basically overwhelmed.
*  But if you start, start educating yourself as far as specifically what to
*  prioritize, as far as what to worry about, you know, war zone, uh, working,
*  protecting somebody, you know, you're not looking at everybody.
*  These faces just, just looking at their hands because that's what's going to
*  kill you, you know, that's an example of focalizing, you know, what you're
*  paranoid and what you're afraid of.
*  So looking at the hands, that's the specific to the particular situation,
*  but also figuring out which situations to avoid and which it's okay.
*  I mean, that's like ultimately one of the biggest things you could do.
*  Route analysis, you know, you, you have to get to the airport and you send off
*  two cars to analyze two routes.
*  And then on the fly, you just change trajectory to, to create randomness
*  and unpredictability and have that as a security feature.
*  Um, having to, uh, a convoy of, uh, four vehicles separated into two
*  convoys and show up different in different parts to again, make it hard
*  for people to guess where you're going to be putting out false information as
*  far as who, where it's going to be, who's going to be in that type of stuff.
*  It's kind of amazing how many assassination attempts Hitler avoided
*  just by having a pretty strict schedule and being a little bit off in terms of
*  timing, just like showing up 15 minutes late or to a slightly different location.
*  We're going through training, uh, specifically around this type of
*  stuff and, and operational training.
*  They basically showing us how to ambush people.
*  You know, when I started making a group for myself, as far as counter
*  ambush, you know, this cat teams that they call them up here in the U S
*  basically a group of a group to respond to a high violent, uh, uh, ambush.
*  First off, the first rule, if you find yourself in an ambush, it wasn't a
*  successful ambush because if you, if you find yourself in it, you're alive, you know?
*  Yes.
*  Um, but if you want to create an amazing counter ambush team, you have to, you
*  know, you have to make them ambushers.
*  And with ambushing, you figure out where all the, uh, opportunities of not only
*  successfully doing what you need to do are in your favor, but also to escape
*  with your life, you know, we're not, uh, we're not going to be received by
*  virgins in heaven.
*  We're not, that's not the type of mentality that we had down there, but, uh,
*  we started learning about some of these things and also seeing, you know, cartel
*  forces apply some of these ambush tactics to the military or the federal forces.
*  What is an ambush or what are we talking about?
*  So that's a surprise attack with an asymmetry of power kind of thing.
*  There's a contingency somewhere moving towards a place that you control and own
*  where you have the advantages where they can't see you, but you can see, you can
*  see them where they can't predict you, but you can predict where they're going
*  to pass, go through, you know, places where they forcibly have to pass, uh,
*  places where they're predictable places where you can not only predict, but also
*  have a plan for yourself to escape an exit, uh, that place.
*  So how do you transfer counter ambush?
*  You turn into a, like a perfect ambusher.
*  That's how you train for counter.
*  So always trying to make sure you have more information about other people.
*  You have the element of surprise, all of those things.
*  And Musashi would say, you know, your enemy, know his sword, you know,
*  that basically that, you know, it's simplified.
*  There's a lot of enemies around you in Mexico.
*  There's a lot of uncertainty, right?
*  Cause it's, well, I guess that's what route analysis is.
*  Yeah.
*  You prepare for the probable.
*  Yeah.
*  And if the impossible happens, you're halfway out of it, hopefully, you know,
*  and if you find yourself in an ambush, it wasn't a successful one.
*  Uh, you, you, uh, as far as our training and the kind of the mindset, my experience
*  with it, you, the adversarial thinking part of it has always been a very powerful
*  one, I think one that a lot of people ignore kind of like lead to the wayside.
*  Uh, specifically in all conflicts out there, there's a tendency for a military
*  force or a conventional force of any kind to be trained in a way where they
*  dehumanize the enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  And when that happens, you become blind to the enemy story.
*  It's his capability, his story, his ability.
*  Uh, you, if you treat the other side, like an inhuman monster, it's
*  hard to take notes, you know?
*  So there's a part of this is a radical empathy for, for, for the quote unquote
*  enemy, at least for me personally.
*  Uh, I wasn't, I wasn't one of the guys that would be in, grab them and beat the
*  shit out of them and put them in the back of a van, just tie them up and gag them.
*  So you were able to see them as human.
*  I learned that from my mother.
*  You know, she said, uh, uh, nobody's against you at there for themselves.
*  Learn this and you will, you will make friends of enemies.
*  She said that when I graduated and I've carried that with me
*  throughout my whole career.
*  But isn't there then a pain of killing another human?
*  Always.
*  But there isn't, again, I apologize to go back to Ukraine as my only
*  experience of this kind of harshness.
*  And it is a powerful experience.
*  There's a dehumanization that happens.
*  I suppose this is common in war.
*  There's something like a video game aspect or people are almost having fun.
*  There's a humor.
*  And I think underneath that the prerequisite is to see the enemy in the
*  same way you see the enemy when you play call of duty, you don't really think.
*  You're thinking of them as NPCs, the bad guys.
*  The Russians are called orcs in Ukraine.
*  I mean, there's all kinds of other names.
*  For us, it was Mugrosos.
*  You know, malandros Mugrosos, like dirty people, you know, there's always something.
*  Over time.
*  Those are just words, but over time it gathers a kind of, um, like a meaning to
*  it that's more than just the words orcs.
*  They're less than human.
*  Yeah.
*  They're dirty.
*  They're too dumb to understand the evil they're doing or whatever, whatever the.
*  It's useful.
*  It's useful.
*  Yeah.
*  It's part of the program.
*  But like, that's what I've talked to soldiers and some of them.
*  Do have stories of momentarily remembering that there's a human on the other side.
*  Um, I talked to one woman who's this really bad ass soldier and she saw this really
*  brave soldier on the other side do something that was almost stupid, how brave it was.
*  And then she was trying to shoot him and she missed and she says she could sleep
*  the night after thinking, why does she miss?
*  Why does she miss?
*  And then she thought she missed because he was a hero and she had this brief
*  realization that there was a hero on the other side, like the other side is heroes.
*  And then, but then that quickly disappeared again, but she had this moment.
*  There's a human being that rises to defend his nation, to defend his people.
*  And he could be heroic on the other side.
*  There are things that we're trained to depress or conceal or hide and kill in us.
*  When you're trained for something like that, or when you're in conflict zone like
*  that and you hear the narrative constantly being blared out that the other side is a
*  orc or, you know, whatever, whatever word you want to use.
*  But, you know, we live in a day and age when you can see, uh, Americans going off to
*  Japan and shaking hands with some of their former enemies.
*  I mean, some of us have seen that and how things change.
*  I think years from now, a lot of the stuff that we are taking right now is of the most
*  importance won't matter anymore.
*  The question is how many years?
*  The question I asked of a lot of people in that part of the world and a lot of them
*  currently, they're also self aware about it.
*  They're like, I'm not sure I trust my current feelings, but the current feelings
*  are generational.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for decades, I will not just hate the leadership.
*  I will hate all of Russian people.
*  I can't understand that on my side of my life experience because, you know, our war
*  has been an internal war, you know, amongst our people and monster houses.
*  Why that is the propaganda.
*  It, there's also a deep grain of truth that there is a oneness to the people of that
*  region.
*  Yeah.
*  But people will get very offended at that idea because right now it's a very strong
*  nationalist borders.
*  But there is a cultural history that connects people.
*  I mean, in some deep sense, we're all connected.
*  Well, I'll come from Western Africa and then all came from fish before then, depending
*  on your view of history, of life on Earth.
*  But there is a oneness to us.
*  And often you forget that in conflict.
*  I had an experience working.
*  There was a friend of mine who took the other path.
*  And went to work for some of these criminal groups.
*  I was operational and I was, we saw a bunch of people in a gas station parked.
*  Back then, the main, you know, modus operandi that they had was that they would
*  impersonate or dress up as federal police.
*  And that's how they would move around the city.
*  We saw these suburbans in a, in a, in a gas station.
*  And some of the guys were carrying our AK-47s, you know, and that's, that's not a
*  standard issue firearm.
*  So, you know, we saw that and I got off on foot and walked by to try and get a, you
*  know, better sense of what was going on.
*  I took everything off, uh, wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
*  And, uh, I got a whistle from one of the guys, uh, that was there and my name was
*  called.
*  It was one of the guys that I grew up with.
*  Redhead kid looked like El Canelo, you know, uh, there's redheads in Mexico.
*  I think it's probably some of the Irish that, uh, that betrayed the American side
*  during the last Mexico-American war that stayed down there, had a bunch of kids.
*  So it's probably from there.
*  Love is stronger than anything else.
*  So there's a redhead kid.
*  When I say kid, I mean, he was my age.
*  He's always going to be younger now.
*  He whistled, told my name, say, Hey, what are you doing here?
*  It's like, gosh, you know, going home, going to get a taxi.
*  So, okay.
*  Walk as he walks over, say as a plate carrier with AK round, uh, magazines on his
*  chest, uh, AK without a stock on it.
*  Just carrying in his hand.
*  He comes over and he hugs me.
*  I could feel the, uh, the magazines on my chest.
*  I mind you, I have a gun on me, you know, tucked and, uh, uh, next
*  cell is buzzing in my back pocket.
*  As people are trying to figure out what's going on.
*  Um, he asked me small talk shit like, Hey, it's like, what are you doing?
*  Like, what do you, what do you work at?
*  And I'm like, ah, I'm just looking for a job.
*  You know, you used to work at a video store.
*  Uh, how's so-and-so of your family?
*  Good.
*  How's so-and-so of your family?
*  Good.
*  It's like, yeah, it's like, this is an interesting job you have.
*  He's like, yeah, it's pretty good.
*  They pay as well.
*  You get around, you know, you get a car, you know, there's money and nobody
*  fucks with you and you get respect.
*  I was like, that's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he's like, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just
*  like, oh, that's, I'm too much of a coward for that.
*  I told him conversation like any other.
*  Yeah.
*  Between two friends.
*  He hugs me before I go.
*  I said, I'm something to him.
*  I can't remember what.
*  And he says, Hey, in my ear, I know what you do for a living.
*  It's not a safe place for you to be.
*  And I walk off.
*  And I'm like, I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  A few moments later, the army showed up and you could feel the amount of rounds
*  going off from two blocks away.
*  We came back with our guys and it was, it was over.
*  So he didn't survive that.
*  I looked at him.
*  I looked at him.
*  I looked at him.
*  I looked through the bodies and the cars that were left.
*  You know, there was bodies all over the place.
*  People left there.
*  It was a mess.
*  I spent like an hour looking for him.
*  The only way I could recognize him was his hair.
*  I stayed with his body all night.
*  There's a, there's a bridge in Tijuana that goes over the river and a place
*  called La Mesa and that's where the forensic offices were.
*  His body was taken there and I stayed with his body until it was released.
*  I told his family about it because I knew them.
*  And that aspect of, you know, us versus them or they're the enemy and
*  you like that, you know, my mom told me those words.
*  So nobody's against you.
*  They're just for themselves.
*  So don't make the mistake of dehumanizing anybody.
*  And those roles could have been easily reversed.
*  I could have been shot in the face there.
*  That aspect of conflict brings where the bad guys, good guys, you know,
*  heroes, villains, you know, I, there's an innocence to that, that goes away.
*  Is your mom still with us?
*  No, almost three weeks before I decided to quit.
*  She passed away.
*  Did that have a role to play?
*  A major one.
*  After I got done on the protection detail with the governor, like everything down
*  there again, the whole cycle, you know, he got his turn.
*  So when he went away, you know, politics change and down there, basically, if
*  you're a can, a gubernatorial candidate, you have either a friend, a friend of
*  a friend or a family member be the head bodyguard guy and the guy that won the
*  elections had his head bodyguard guy already there.
*  So all of us were sent back to whatever we came from.
*  So I went back to work on the streets.
*  I was back on the operations group.
*  I was working with the sub director directly with him, basically back on the
*  ground doing the stuff that I was doing before that job, we were moving away
*  from the successes that had been had by people like Liza Ola when they were in
*  charge of that whole process, the people that I used to work with, some of the
*  only successes in that counter push against cartels in Mexico, and you can
*  kind of like, it's documented.
*  You can read about it out there.
*  A bunch of people wrote papers on it.
*  Some of the only successes were had by Liza Ola and the place where he had
*  leadership, he not only pacified Tijuana.
*  He also did the same in Juarez.
*  He was sent to be the police chief in Juarez too, but politics change
*  and heroes become villains.
*  A lot of people started calling him a villain because of his unorthodox
*  approach and human rights violations and all of this type of stuff kind of
*  come through the forefront and people forgot, people forgot what it took to
*  get Tijuana off the most dangerous city list on the planet and people were
*  vilified.
*  People like him and the police force that I was a part of started getting
*  compromised.
*  A lot of the things that were put forth to try and keep us honest, there was a
*  program, they had these centers called C3s.
*  Basically you would go there every year, you would get your financials
*  checked, you would get a physical psychological evaluation, you would get a
*  polygraph exam done on you, all the works to try and see if you were somebody
*  doing something wrong.
*  And all of that was canceled because it violated your human rights.
*  If you get fired from a job because of a failed polygraph exam, because that was
*  not an actual admissible way of firing somebody.
*  So all of a sudden you had people that were known cartel compromised people
*  that were fired five, six years ago, showing back up to work with their back
*  paid and everything.
*  So this started happening and I quickly realized that it was going to be hard to
*  stay there.
*  I was driving home from work and I got a call from my brother that my mom had been
*  going through some health issues that had turned into psychiatric issues.
*  So we were basically taking turns trying to take care of her, locking the doors so
*  she wouldn't wander off and stuff like that.
*  So not only was I dealing with the job on the street, but I was dealing with that.
*  And also I had a two year old and a marriage that was difficult at that time.
*  So I was trying to figure all these things out.
*  Made more difficult by your job.
*  Yeah, it's not a financially secure job, you know, and the pressures that it has
*  and the odd hours and all that made it really hard.
*  And then all of a sudden my brother calls me and tells me that let's go to the
*  hospital.
*  Something happened to my mom.
*  It wasn't my turn to watch her.
*  So I felt pretty shitty about that.
*  I got to the hospital and the doctors came out and told us that she was gone.
*  It was a massive heart attack.
*  She had a pacemaker by then.
*  So she was gone.
*  She was in her sixties.
*  So we kind of expected something, but that was hard for me.
*  She was my center.
*  She was going to be the one that I would ask for advice as far as work, you know,
*  if she leaves or not.
*  The ground was removed from underneath.
*  There was nobody.
*  There was, yeah, there's nothing underneath me.
*  I get three days off work.
*  That's what they gave me.
*  And I'm trying to grieve as I go back to work.
*  Dark shit crosses my mind as I'm going through that process of trying to figure
*  things out.
*  Dark shit like suicide, dark shit.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was very low for you.
*  Very, very hard.
*  Yeah.
*  I wasn't allowed to grieve basically.
*  And I wasn't allowed to grieve for a few years for different reasons.
*  I went back to work and I went to other people.
*  Also you yourself were not allowing yourself to grieve.
*  Is it like, there was other people with me that didn't allow me to grieve.
*  You know, I went to work, got called into the office and I was basically
*  told that I was going to be reassigned after what I just went through.
*  The reassignment was going to be something that I saw as unacceptable.
*  It was the people in charge at that point were obviously corrupted.
*  And what I got from their conversation was that they wanted us to work
*  for a specific side.
*  And I knew that that was the time to go.
*  I asked for a license, basically licenses, unpaid absence from work,
*  basically leave of absence.
*  I think it's what you call it up here, which by law is allowed.
*  And I was denied for no reason.
*  So I'm invested in this job.
*  I have a good salary and I have a category in there.
*  So by the level of time you spend in there, you get a category.
*  So I was a pretty high category agent.
*  I had all this training and again, training that would be useless in the
*  private sector and the public sector in Mexico.
*  I couldn't change from one corporation to another.
*  I couldn't go to work for another police institution.
*  I took a deep breath and I resigned.
*  I went to the office.
*  I said, I need to resign.
*  They said, what?
*  I need to resign.
*  Some of the people in the office that knew me from a long time were like,
*  what's wrong with you?
*  They thought I was having a mental breakdown.
*  Handed it all over the, all the paperwork, took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in
*  there, blade armor, tear gas, all that kind of stuff.
*  I took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in there, blade armor, tear gas, grenades,
*  gas mask, satellite radio, MP5 magazines and MP5, submachine gun, Glock, Glock
*  magazines, all of it, helmet.
*  And I put it in the, I handed it over in the armory and I left.
*  I made some phone calls.
*  Um, I was married to, uh, an American and my daughter's American.
*  I never envisioned myself coming to the United States, uh, do that process for
*  myself, you know, because I was invested in that job.
*  I thought I was going to die or retire from that.
*  And, uh, it quickly became like an issue because everybody's wondering why I
*  left the job so abruptly.
*  So there was some threats made when I left by people inside the office and I
*  probably, you know, it's anonymous yet.
*  So there's significant pressure not to leave.
*  It's hard to leave this kind of job.
*  Yeah.
*  The system makes it difficult to leave the individuals to the degree that you
*  might be corrupted, really don't want you to leave.
*  There's no support.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no support.
*  And it's probably the opposite of support.
*  Yeah.
*  Almost like implied or, or explicit or implicit threats.
*  Yeah.
*  Luckily I had developed some friendships in the United States for some, with some
*  of the people that I used to work with and cross-drain with and, uh, some
*  friendships that I developed with people that I would, uh, just talk to and make
*  friends with stateside.
*  One of them was, uh, is a Navy SEAL reservist whose name is Dan Stanchfield
*  and his wife, Kelly.
*  They opened the doors of their house to me and my kid and my wife at that time.
*  As I seek to basically look for the American dream, um, I crossed the
*  border with my kid and, uh, nobody knew anything, you know, I hadn't, they
*  didn't tell anybody, just, you know, my wife and, uh, and I was off.
*  Uh, when I came to the States, I already kind of dabbled in the whole training
*  field and showing some of my experience to people.
*  So I had at least a seed of that out there.
*  People knew me for that.
*  Um, but all of a sudden I was, uh, in the middle of an avocado orchard, uh, in the
*  middle of California and everything's quiet.
*  And there's no more radios going off all of the night.
*  There's no more three, three cell phones on the counter.
*  There's no guns.
*  There's no rifles.
*  There's no, um, 80 people calling to, to, to calling to see what's going on.
*  There's nothing.
*  It's just quiet.
*  And it's during the time when Trump got elected.
*  So the immigration process that usually would take, I had most things going for me
*  and my immigration process that would take at the most of the year took two years.
*  So it was, it was not a, it's not an easy process to not only come to the U S but,
*  uh, you know, come to the U S with, uh, with that pressure, kind of underlying
*  pressure as far as being an immigrant at that time here.
*  And then your own personal psychological, the PTSD of, of going from a war zone to,
*  uh, avocado orchard, the word PTSD and TBI and all of these things.
*  I did not, I didn't know any of them.
*  Uh, it was through people that I got to meet, uh, in the training field, uh, that
*  were, you know, Marines, uh, uh, seals, uh, Marisot guys, those types of people
*  that started giving words to some of the things that I felt, which I didn't really
*  know, you know, uh, we would treat, uh, post-traumatic stress with alcohol and
*  vacation time, the bottle of mezcal, you know, when you see the bottom of it,
*  your troubles are gone.
*  Cured.
*  Yeah.
*  Immediately.
*  That was, if I was an alcoholic as well as all of the other stuff, I was, I was
*  drinking myself to sleep every, every third night, uh, my marriage obviously
*  was failing, you know, it was.
*  It wasn't easy for her, you know, she, she was brave and she did what she could.
*  And I, I totally respect, understand her process with it, but, and I
*  know when it's quiet, that's when it hits you.
*  That's what I think.
*  That's what a lot of people experience when they come back from a conflict zone.
*  You know, the, uh, everything that was life and death, everything that mattered,
*  all the noise, all the chaos, all the people that are around you that would die
*  for you, kill for you, you would kill for them, uh, all these millions of dollars
*  worth of equipment and stuff like that you were responsible for now are all gone.
*  And it's just you walking into a circle K and buying three cans of fosters
*  to drink yourself to sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  You write on your Patreon brilliantly about BTSD, about the cost of things
*  you've done and seen.
*  And we're far from that chaos and noise of death being close and life being real.
*  That is when some of us remember in the quiet nights in a field in Tennessee,
*  looking at fireflies, walking through a fair, holding hands with a lover,
*  asking you what's wrong at your kid's birthday party, leave early to avoid
*  the ending of a celebration.
*  That is what the quiet means to some of us.
*  So that's speaking to that silence, the quiet.
*  Um, how do you live with and thrive with this newly learned term of PTSD?
*  If anything, I would recommend people that have any of these issues to go to
*  places where other people have their issues.
*  So you can, it's not a competition, but you get to see the scope of problems
*  in the world and you sometimes feel kind of lucky as far as your own.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes you appreciate all the different kinds of struggles that people go through.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I went through some horrible shit, but there's some people there that
*  went through other more horrible shit or stuff that I, I don't think I could've
*  survived when I went through that process of figuring things out.
*  You know, the first thing that glaringly pointed out or stuck out to me was my
*  inability to process things in a way that I could have survived.
*  So I had a pause button on me since I was 13, basically.
*  Uh, then I got to bury many of my friends and form their wives or
*  girlfriends of what happened.
*  And then I got to bury a lot of my friends and my family.
*  And then I got to bury a lot of my friends, my wife, my kids, my
*  friends, my friends, my family, my friends, my family, my family.
*  Inform their wives or girlfriends of what happened.
*  And that all again was paused because I wasn't allowed to process.
*  You know, I spent years without going on vacation because I was a workaholic.
*  And, uh, I found that the core of my issues, uh, alcohol, the giant pause
*  button in the form of alcohol, basically I, I would drink my problems away or
*  specifically I would, it's like, uh, if you have a mess in your house, you just
*  put a big tarp over it, you know, to cover it up and alcohol was that for me.
*  And it festered more and more as I not only went through the process of learning
*  about PCSD, going through therapy, but refusing to let that go, you know, like
*  going through therapy and seeing what other people's problems were, and I don't
*  want to, you know, this is the only thing I have, I'm not, you know, I'm not
*  hurting anybody with it, you know?
*  Why, why am I, why do I need to get rid of that?
*  Uh, by this point I was traveling across the country and training people and
*  showing some of the experiences that I had to other people speaking, being on
*  podcasts and having conversations like the one I'm having with you.
*  So speaking to the skills that you developed.
*  And in a way, basically reliving and reopening a bunch of shit for
*  myself every time I do it.
*  Um, so it was, that was getting triggered.
*  And the way I would manage that was I would drink, you know, at the end of the
*  night, after a weekend class somewhere, when I talk about the fireflies and a
*  field in Tennessee, it was a moment where I was forcing myself to try and be sober.
*  And we did this medical class out in, uh, out in the hills in Tennessee, a
*  beautiful green place, a beautiful family there that, that hosted us.
*  And it's the first time I ever saw fireflies.
*  I was like, I thought I was having a hallucinogenic experience when I say,
*  why is that?
*  Why are they, why is the dust glowing?
*  You know, is what I thought a friend of mine is a, is a veteran.
*  He's ran off to the woods and grabbed one and brought it to me and showed it to me.
*  It's like, holy shit.
*  What is that?
*  The firefly.
*  Wow.
*  How do they glow?
*  I don't know.
*  And he's crushed it in his hand as it has gone.
*  And I, you know, brought me back immediately to holy shit.
*  You know, uh, it kind of like, I was off somewhere and I was back and I had to go drink.
*  I went through that process of like going off at getting on it, going off,
*  getting off at my marriage.
*  Separate.
*  And that was a, another end of the world aspect to everything, you know, you know,
*  I lost my mother, I lost the job and then the marriage failed and it was on me.
*  I basically went somewhere and did a stock of everything that was going on.
*  And made a decision to stop drinking.
*  Yeah.
*  Had had some bad relationships after, and I just came to a place where I need to stop drinking.
*  You've gotten to a point so low.
*  Was this a decision you arrived at by yourself?
*  Was there some inspiration or was it just the point is so low?
*  Lots so much.
*  It was the start of COVID.
*  So, uh, this is recent.
*  That's probably two.
*  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have two years over in December.
*  So when you talk to Rogan the first time, you're still struggling with his demons.
*  Yeah.
*  I was in and out of the car.
*  Basically is what I would say.
*  You know, I was in and out of, and then trying to get rid of it.
*  That must be a super stressful experience talking to Joe Rogan.
*  The first time you drink that night.
*  You remember?
*  The second time I was there, I went somewhere.
*  God, shit face.
*  It was, it was stressful.
*  Not, not for any other reason than I felt the responsibility to the people that
*  couldn't speak about it.
*  So that's the pressure.
*  It was the start of COVID and things got started getting shut down and slowed down.
*  My dad got really sick and almost died.
*  We had to set up like some Jason Bourne level shit that is at my brother's place.
*  We, we, he was in Mexico, you know?
*  So we had to bribe a guy to get us an oxygen tank and I had to root Jimmy Riga, a
*  respirator and it was, it was, it was, it was some shit.
*  But my dad was like, he survived it, you know, everybody, the doctor would like say
*  goodbye and then my dad was like, yeah, say goodbye to him.
*  You know,
*  I guess he does gangster.
*  I got it.
*  Tough guy.
*  He did, he did some gangster shit that day.
*  But on my end, I was being isolated basically as COVID is everybody's slowing
*  down, no more classes, no more excuses to go out there and drink and no more
*  socializing, so social drinking turned into alone drinking more and more and more.
*  I bought a bottle of gin.
*  Because I was, I was down in Mexico taking care of my dad and they closed
*  down beer production in Mexico.
*  So beer went away and beer was a way I kind of managed it, you know?
*  It's not hard alcohol.
*  It's just beer.
*  So, you know, but that went away.
*  So it was just hard alcohol.
*  That was, it was available down there.
*  I, one night alone at the, at the house, my dad's house.
*  I, I drank a bottle of gin, a whole bottle of gin.
*  I almost died.
*  And after that, you know, some people started noticing that, that I was
*  isolating more and more and it was kind of eating away at me.
*  I was in a relationship at that point when I, I started seeing everything
*  just kind of fall apart around me.
*  And I, I drank half of a glass of wine and it made me sick to my, like
*  internally in my mind.
*  And my kid said to me, and I don't know, nobody coached her.
*  Nobody said anything to her.
*  She was, she's a pretty intuitive kid.
*  She said, I don't drink anymore, dad.
*  I don't know where in the middle of the night.
*  I don't know where.
*  And I stopped.
*  I stopped that night.
*  I stopped that night.
*  I remember waking up at three in the morning and taking a cooler that I
*  had and just dumping all the beers in it and chucking them in the garbage
*  and with a knife poking each of them to not be tempted to go back for them.
*  And then the second day I went around and started fighting with my dad.
*  I was like, I'm going to go back to my dad.
*  I'm going to go back to my dad.
*  And then the second day I went around and started finding the hides that I had
*  because I had some, you know, hides.
*  And, and then I went somewhere and locked myself in for two weeks.
*  I had the, the withdrawal, the clearest nightmares that I've ever had in my life
*  for two, three weeks.
*  And then I went somewhere.
*  I want to keep them private, but I went somewhere where they offered a place for me.
*  And when I asked them about it, it's a community.
*  I gave them some money for their school as a donation.
*  I gave them like a few, a few thousand dollars.
*  I said, yeah, sure, come, you know, you can, you can go through this process here.
*  Cool as fuck people.
*  The first thing they did when I got there is they stood me up in front of everybody
*  and asked me for the donation and then told everybody that I was an alcoholic.
*  And if anybody saw me drinking, I was to be kicked out of there immediately.
*  And I felt horrible.
*  So that's what, that was where I started.
*  Is that temptation still there?
*  There was a moment when it was.
*  Uh, and, uh, some, uh, therapy circle.
*  There's a, there's a rodeo clown friend of mine who his body's, his spine is basically
*  fused together, you know, type of guy.
*  Uh, we've been friends and enemies and friends again, you know, in, during the
*  heart therapy, uh, circle sessions.
*  Oh, so like there's an intimacy there.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, he didn't know anything about me.
*  Uh, one time when we were telling our story, he stood up and told his story
*  and then he heard mine and then he was pissed off at me and didn't want to talk
*  to me for a while.
*  And then later he told me that it was because, uh, he saw what I did with my
*  experience and how much of a difference that he's perceived that I was making
*  with it and he felt jealous that he can do the same with his experience because
*  he was just a broken X rodeo cloud.
*  He told me when I was going through the process, like, Hey, you're, you're
*  internet celebrity person, you know, you're, you're known.
*  Uh, aren't you worried about people finding out that you're, that
*  you're recovering drunk?
*  And I said, yeah, it's fucking scary as shit.
*  If people find out that I am going through this process, it's scary that,
*  you know, the critique, you know, I already get a lot of shit for being a
*  ex police officer in Mexico and all that, uh, all the negativity that comes from
*  that.
*  And he said, don't be, you know, that you can't pickpocket a naked man.
*  So just get naked.
*  And what does that mean?
*  Right about it.
*  Post it online.
*  You never know somebody, somebody out there might get inspired to do
*  their own kind of process.
*  So I started posting cowardly in a way because I wanted to make other
*  people keep me on the path, you know, but in other ways, you know, uh,
*  desperation, you know, I don't, I don't want to drink anymore.
*  I don't want to go back to the bath, which I know leads directly to a bad
*  death.
*  I'm not afraid of death.
*  I just want a good one.
*  I don't want a bad one.
*  I think that was going to lead me to a bad death.
*  As I writing about it and sharing it online, you know, through my, uh,
*  fever dreams post and just being humorous about it online and getting a
*  lot of hate on one side, you know, having a few people and companies that I
*  worked with kind of step back and seeing this guy's has some issues to
*  having other people kind of make fun of or make light of that, uh, weakness
*  portrayed us to getting hate, getting criticism because here you are a
*  condo narcotics police officer.
*  There's no, there's a drinking problem.
*  So is that like supposed to be what like flaws revealed weakness, uh, or
*  perception of alpha in the U S I guess that some people have, you know,
*  you were supposed to be strong and here you are.
*  I mean, I'm not, I'm not Jocko Willnick.
*  I'm not David Goggins, you know, I'll, I'll, I wake up at 10 in the morning
*  sometimes and I'll have cornflakes with my eight year old, you know?
*  Um, I like days off.
*  I w I used to wake up at three 30 in the morning every day to, to, to review
*  what happened during the night and then go off for a jog and then the gym and
*  just be ready to be able to murder somebody with my hands if I had to.
*  But that is, I couldn't maintain that during the whole process of getting
*  out of it now, leaving alcohol.
*  I remember just being honest with it and just seeing the two sides of it.
*  You know, Joe told me never read the comments section, right?
*  Which is a beautiful, it's a beautiful piece of advice, but, uh, it, it, it,
*  they get you sometimes when you talk about some of these things openly.
*  And some of the comments were positive and I've been seeing people comment,
*  sending me messages and meeting people on the road that are five months in.
*  Uh, 10 months, uh, some people that have been on that, uh, wagon for way longer
*  than I have, um, and, uh, there's, it's, what's cool when you meet people that
*  are superhuman or perform and take an extreme ownership of things and are just
*  amazing people that are thriving out there.
*  It's inspirational.
*  I see some of these people and I'm like, holy shit, I need to figure out how to
*  get to some semblance of that, but I'm not that, you know, I've been through the
*  ringer, I fucked up a shit ton of times.
*  You know, my nose is a example of that.
*  I have a few missing teeth, but in a way I think all of that is part of the process
*  and not a lot of people want to talk about, you know, independently of the
*  experience I got down there and some of the things that I show and talk about.
*  And some of the advocacy I do related to women like her that are, you know,
*  trying to look for a better life and trying to find their missing kids, uh,
*  training people to not get into those situations, uh, but also showcasing the
*  fact that people that go through some of these processes have a journey to go
*  through, you know, uh, I just came into your studio with a duffel bag straight
*  from the airport and I'm going to leave, uh, early tomorrow morning to somewhere
*  else.
*  I've been on the road for almost, I think five years nonstop.
*  I go back to a specific place every week to see my kid for two, three days.
*  And then I'm back out, you know, you know, some people are like, are you running?
*  Like, are you worried?
*  Is this afraid about something?
*  No, but I am, you know, on this weird path, I guess, trying to look for something
*  that I think I've been missing as far as my afterlife of a sort, you know, coming
*  out of that.
*  That is, are you looking for some kind of a deeper understanding of humanity?
*  Like from the specific experiences you had to get some deeper understanding of
*  what the hell we're all doing here.
*  I meet people every weekend with different stories.
*  Uh, you know, people come to some of my classes, I know I show them how to
*  weaponize the environment, how to arm themselves, how to not get abducted.
*  I meet people that have gone through those experiences and then are basically
*  trying to work through some of their own issues by going through the training
*  like that.
*  I get to meet people that are, you know, people that I've only seen online, you
*  know, or the scene in videos.
*  I remember meeting Royce Gracie in a Harvard city.
*  I heard of that guy.
*  He's a pretty interesting character.
*  I remember seeing him in a bootleg VHS video.
*  I told him about it.
*  Uh, we were doing a class, uh, out at, uh, uh, Emerson knives.
*  It's a, it's a, it's a knife company, but the, but the Mr.
*  Emerson also has like a jujitsu gym there where Roy straightens out of that's
*  his, uh, that's his space.
*  And, you know, they're teaching how to defend against somebody trying to stab
*  you and I'm showing them all the ways you can get around that and fabricate
*  and improvise and smuggle things.
*  Basically the, the adversarial side of that, it just, that's what I'm known for.
*  The psychology and kind of the ways that people do that.
*  And I remember him seeing some of the stuff that I was doing and just being
*  like, where are you from Mexico?
*  Next.
*  It makes sense.
*  You know, somebody from Brazil, you know, tipping the hat to somebody from
*  Mexico, as far as with him, uh, seeing the violence and some of the, uh,
*  the mentality behind it.
*  So for people who don't know, Hoyce Gracie is the legendary martial
*  artists that probably introduced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to the American
*  audience, to the world, to the process of UFC and showing the effectiveness of it.
*  And, um, in practice that a little skinny guy can defeat a big aggressive guy.
*  So an Anaconda, a small Anaconda walking into that, uh, ring with his family
*  behind wearing pajamas, wearing pajamas.
*  And I was like, what is this guy wearing pajamas for?
*  And then he would strangle people with those pajamas.
*  Uh, I remember seeing that and just having it, I think probably what a generation
*  before had with Bruce Lee, I guess, our, my generation was Royce walking into
*  that, uh, walking into that octagon and changing, you know, paradigms, seeing
*  him in that gym, um, it's also, I have a gun owner and shooter, which is
*  interesting, you know, having, seeing somebody like him who is, you know, well
*  versed with his hands also be a man that has gone into the realm of being
*  well versed with, with weaponry.
*  Which is an aspect of, of martial arts and, uh, the martial way of thinking
*  that, you know, some people kind of the purists will stick with one side of it,
*  but he's obviously a warrior in a lot of ways.
*  So just as a small tangent.
*  So you're somebody that you don't just look at our arm combat.
*  You look at the full spectrum of the chaos of combat that's outside of the
*  realm of Jiu-Jitsu and even just mixed martial arts, unarmed, armed with
*  knives and beyond was his mind open to the, the fuller spectrum of violence.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was, he was in the middle of this class that we were doing where
*  people were basically focusing on both.
*  Ernest Emerson, who's a famous for his knives.
*  He has the knife company.
*  It's a nice for NASA, you know, not only that, but he's also a very avid
*  martial artist he trained with a lot of Filipino martial arts related to
*  knives and stuff like that, but a different mindset, you know, a defensive
*  mindset, trying to train people how to defend against that.
*  And you have Royce who's a, he's from Brazil.
*  I mean, he has some street in him.
*  That's something that, you know, those guys, those, we say in Mexico,
*  uh, seeing the ways he would, uh, he stepped in there and, and provided some
*  encouragement to the people there as far as, uh, you know, how people sometimes
*  focus on the, uh, this is a system and this is a way, but there's other ways
*  out there that might negate or defeat the ways that you are concentrating on.
*  You know, so kind of get out of that bubble.
*  My whole kind of speciality or what I focus on is mindset and figuring out the
*  software that some of these people gain and gather from, if I need to arm myself,
*  you know, the easiest thing to manufacture in most places, a pointed object.
*  So I can take that crystal big pen that you're writing on that, uh, notepad with
*  and, uh, using the friction from the carpet, I can turn it into a hypodermic
*  needle that you can then poke into somebody's neck.
*  Oh, what's the process of doing that?
*  I can do it right now if you want.
*  No, but can you, can you use your words for the listener?
*  And also, cause I'm terrified.
*  No, I could, I could, basically you can take the friction, the, the, the heat
*  and friction created from this carpet.
*  Yes.
*  You can grab that pen in of itself.
*  It will pierce flesh, but it will slow itself down because it has a few, uh,
*  angles on to the, on the tip.
*  Oh, you want to wear it down the angles.
*  So if you take that tip off and you grab it and grind it on an angle on the
*  carpet, the heat will actually turn it into a hypodermic needle.
*  If you know what you're doing, hypodermic meaning like it's, it smoothens the entry.
*  It'll make a point in an angle that will guide it its way into your flesh.
*  So you can actually go through a torso with that.
*  If you know what you're doing as a small tangent, you also gave me a present.
*  Could be one of the most epic presence I've ever received.
*  Do you give it to Rogan?
*  Uh, can you explain what I'm holding in my hands?
*  There's a guy online coffin tramp is a moniker.
*  Uh, it is a G 10 rod.
*  G 10 is a very strong material, basically capable.
*  They, a lot of people make actually G 10 knives, which are basically non-magnetic,
*  non-ferrous objects that can be utilized as a stabbing.
*  Um, the core of it isn't, uh, isn't an actual pencil core.
*  It's a G 10 core and it's, uh, encased in, uh, Oak hard Oak.
*  So that is capable again of stabbing through a torso.
*  Now the guy that made that, uh, this an artisan, you know, he makes that,
*  it looks like a pencil concealed in it in the nature of the object itself.
*  But that small object is capable of being introduced into a chest cavity.
*  Um, you know, uh, all it takes is about the half of your thumb or the length of
*  your thumb to stab into your chest cavity.
*  And now your pericardium is pierced and it's being filled with fill of blood or
*  your whole heart is pierced and you have a few minutes to live if you're at a
*  standing heart rate.
*  So this is, uh, this, this has the effectiveness of a knife.
*  It has an effect of this of a shank or, or, or, or an ice pick, you know, it's
*  not going to cut, but it's going to make a hole where it not the chin be here.
*  The pen is literally mightier than the sword.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's, uh, it's,
*  this is really epic from like a perspective of an academic.
*  This is, this is a simple of both intelligence and violence.
*  I love it.
*  And also the, the current state of affairs where people need to arm themselves
*  with things that are concealed as far as their purpose in a place where in a
*  country or in a society that limits their ability to arm themselves.
*  So if you're going to a safe place, you're going to a place where no weapons
*  allowed, which means rich, a target, rich environment.
*  If you're a predator, uh, that's a sign of rebellion.
*  Let this be a signal of everyone should be terrified when you're around me.
*  Cause even a pencil can murder you.
*  And I intend to use this.
*  And nobody, nobody owns life, but anybody that can hold a frying pan owns death
*  is a quote that I heard once, which is a beautiful one.
*  I'm looking at you.
*  If anyone betrays me, this is the way to go.
*  Can you given all your experience and all the different ways and you think about
*  martial arts and violence in Mexico, in the, in the world, speaking of hoist,
*  what is your approach to conflict?
*  Uh, like a, like a street fight.
*  What advice would you give people in the full spectrum of what a street
*  altercation might entail?
*  What is the best way to approach it?
*  I think before you get there, you have to prepare, you know,
*  so one of the first things I tell people is, uh, if you don't have a basic T
*  triple C training class behind you, you should reanalyze your, your life
*  and your ability to prepare T triple C, basically how to stop somebody from
*  bleeding out or dying from a stab wound, gunshot wound, or any of those types
*  of wounds, uh, or an amputated leg during an ID scenario, anything you would see
*  in a Boston marathon, a marathon type event or a Vegas shooting event where
*  people are getting shots, stabbed, cut.
*  So understand how to help people, how to help yourself post.
*  You're no good.
*  You don't want to be a, you don't want to be a detriment to the situation.
*  You want to be an asset.
*  So build yourself up as an asset for in a situation like that, because you
*  might be doing that on yourself or on somebody else.
*  And also it helps you understand, uh, what situations are going to result in
*  a lot of, in a difficult situation to deal with afterwards.
*  Yeah.
*  It also teaches you what to stab and what to shoot.
*  If you're thinking about it in a full and on all the dimensions of it, you know,
*  you know, there's, there's all weapon, all knowledge can be weaponized.
*  And I think that's the approach.
*  All people should kind of figure out for themselves when they start getting ready
*  or if they want to take the responsibility of their own safety in their hands.
*  So in a self-defense situation, there's a lot of questions here, but
*  what, what does one stab?
*  There's the carotid arteries, which are used commonly in jujitsu is something
*  to choke because they feed a computer, you know?
*  So there's a lot of blood flowing through that required for the successful
*  operation of the computer.
*  And not a lot of stuff is guarding the outside world from your carotid arteries.
*  That's a really weird design, by the way.
*  It is not a smart one.
*  It doesn't even make sense because with mammals, they bite each other's neck.
*  Like, why can't you have more protection?
*  Cause this is the only, like us humans don't use our mouth to kill each other,
*  but most mammals, most predators do.
*  And it's like, why the hell don't we protect this?
*  We do have a defensive mechanism and you see it sometimes when people are
*  ambushed and people try to open up each other's necks from behind.
*  If you push somebody's neck forward, the carotids will actually lower themselves
*  and be encased in more flesh and muscle.
*  If you pull a head back, not so much.
*  So that's a way that at least I think the evolutionary, we have a defensive
*  mechanism for that.
*  There's a few videos out there of people's getting their neck sewn back
*  shut after somebody pushed their head forward to try and slice their necks
*  and they survived, you know?
*  So this is a viable target.
*  The heart is another one.
*  Interesting about the thing about the heart and people get alarmed when I talk
*  about this and show it in classes.
*  Again, a lot of the classes I do are for orientation and to, for people
*  to recognize that behavior.
*  So a lot of law enforcement comes to some of these classes,
*  they're, oh, that's horrible.
*  That's how somebody will kill somebody.
*  Yeah, this is how people that know their thing, their shit will try and approach
*  somebody and stab you to death.
*  This is how they would do it.
*  There's a tendency to view what we see in John Wick or view what we see in this
*  martial arts community where they're slicing and dicing people different
*  myriads of ways.
*  A lot of that is based on dueling based cultures, like the Filipino martial arts
*  or some of the Italian martial arts out there where somebody's facing off with
*  somebody else with a similar weapon and where both of us are agreeing to
*  basically get into a stabbing competition.
*  That would make sense in that scenario, in that context, but I've never seen a
*  lot of people actually get into these one-on-one knife altercations.
*  What we see now in a modern context when it talks about weaponry is an ambush,
*  counter-ambush based scenario where somebody pulls out a knife turning, a
*  grappling situation on the street or when somebody turns a striking exchange of
*  punches, it punches into pulling out a cheap gas station knife or a pen or a
*  rock from the ground or a handgun.
*  Most modern combatives, when it comes to weaponry, should be kind of based on the
*  whole aspect of ambush and counter-ambush.
*  There's a lot of people showing valuable type of material and coursework on this
*  out there.
*  My whole approach and my specific kind of realm is in the aspect of how people go
*  from the process of learning some of these things from experiential stuff.
*  People that grow up in rural places, grow up on pig farms that actually get the
*  experiences of processing a pig, for example, or processing an animal.
*  Those people will have more skills as hunters.
*  Those people will have more skills with a knife if they pick it up as a weapon
*  and then most of the martial artists that I've seen kind of approach some of
*  these classes where I go and have a simulated torso in the form of a pig
*  hanging in a room somewhere.
*  Some of that has to do with just the familiarity and the comfort of just like
*  the biology of a living organism, like that if you cut off certain things, if
*  you cut a certain thing, it's just a meat vehicle.
*  The same thing, the medical training should come first, or if you don't have
*  that be a hunter or go to a butchery class that will teach you more about how
*  to use a knife on somebody else than anything, that'll give you the experience
*  of flesh.
*  Most people, I do this example every now and then where I have people bring in a
*  tactical knife and they'll bring in a butter knife and I ask them which will go
*  through a torso.
*  We have a pig there so it simulates a torso pretty closely.
*  Most people will say, nah, that butter knife is not going to go through.
*  And it does.
*  It does go through.
*  It's thin enough, strong enough, sturdy enough that it'll go through.
*  Kitchen knife, a cheap one that cost 89 cents at a Walmart and an expensive $400
*  one.
*  And the cheap one will outperform the expensive one.
*  The tip will snap off during some of it.
*  Yeah, I have to say that just as a small tangent, I went to a farm and just seeing
*  the butchering of meat and so on and the processing of meat and pigs and cows,
*  whoo, that's uncomfortable.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think it also it's honest and raw and like that's something that probably
*  everyone should experience regularly.
*  Is it, it's also humbling to remind you.
*  Like when I had a dog, Homer, he's a Newfoundland, I was very close with and
*  we lost them.
*  And I just remember that I carried him.
*  He's like 200 something pounds.
*  And I said to carry him, I had to put him to sleep.
*  And like one of the biggest realizations is like, oh, this is just a, this is just
*  a biological thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, and to realize that this is just meat, this is not, and you can cut it.
*  And then if you bleed, you also in the life can disappear from you.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all gone.
*  It's like, holy shit.
*  There's this meat vehicle that some people have referred to as Lex.
*  I'm just a few stabbings away from like leaving.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm leaving.
*  Goodbye.
*  That's a soul that just flies away.
*  It used to be that we had to hang around, you know, people would come back from
*  battle and we would hear things next to the campfire as far as, oh, he stabbed
*  somebody here and this happens.
*  But now we live in an age where you can, you know, when I do a class, I, this is,
*  this is a stab to the heart.
*  And here's like five videos of it happening live, you know, on live leaks
*  or whatever, and we can deconstruct that.
*  Not only that, but what weapon was used?
*  Oh, it was a gas station folder.
*  It was a pioneer woman knife from Walmart with flowers on the handle, you know,
*  whatever it was, and the people start realizing that it doesn't take a lot.
*  That it doesn't take a lot of training because a lot of these people are not
*  high level assassins trained by ninjas in the Hills or anything like that.
*  There are people that grew up really or learned by seeing that behavior in others.
*  And when they start coming to the realization that it is pretty easy to do
*  that and they start figuring out like, how do you counteract that?
*  Well, number one, learn the behavior yourself so you can recognize it.
*  The whole aspect of being a good counter ambush team is to be a best, the
*  best ambusher in the planet.
*  So again, the whole aspect of Musashi saying, know your enemy know his sword.
*  You know, you figure that out as far as learning that behavior.
*  You know, when you start seeing how some of these stabbings occurred occur,
*  the first thing you notice is that one of one of the hands is always kind of out
*  of the picture or there's a lack of symmetry in the people that are about to
*  do something horrible.
*  So when you see lack of symmetry in the environment, somebody with their
*  hands going backwards, um, there's a crowd of people and some, and, and two or
*  one individual is looking counter where everybody else is looking.
*  Or there's a hyper aware individual in the crowd.
*  Uh, the hyper aware are always usually out there to fuck somebody over or are
*  they're trying to keep those predators from fucking somebody else over.
*  So unless you step back and you put yourself in the process of learning how
*  they learn and you become that potential nightmare person, it's hard to recognize
*  that in a, in a crowd.
*  It feels like one of the significant ways to win or as a street fighter is
*  to avoid it by sort of sending pacifist signals in every way, meaning avoiding
*  the situation whenever there's like, uh, like a hyper vigilant people, you just
*  kind of avoid signaling that you're one of the players of interest.
*  If we're talking about counter ambush, at which point do you do that versus
*  shift to the aggression?
*  I think violence should be always an option.
*  You know, everybody should have that option and you need to be good at that option.
*  I think, uh, as I think I heard Jordan Peterson talk about the fact that
*  everybody needs to be dangerous, but keep that shit under control.
*  You know, I think he was referring to a different context, but I know, I'm
*  referring to the ability of the little physical conflict.
*  Uh, there's two cases that I saw of people just utilizing social engineering
*  to a beautiful degree to deescalate shit.
*  Right.
*  One guy, uh, somewhere at first off, if you're in a place where people are
*  grabbing your wife's ass or something like that, like, what are you doing there?
*  You know, there's a load of things that are wrong with everything that you're
*  doing in your life to be in that environment, but let's say you're in an
*  inescapable situation, there was this guy who was in a compromised position.
*  Uh, somebody wanted to fight him, uh, like legit kick his ass.
*  And he said, okay, uh, let's go.
*  But I just, I need to warn you that I have hep C before we go outside.
*  And that I was getting my phone out to film this, you know, maybe, uh, and even
*  I was just lowered my phone to give them a slow clap.
*  That was a beautiful move.
*  You know?
*  Um, and then there was this other man, uh, there was a, there was a riot
*  somewhere in, uh, uh, in Ensenada, the municipality of Ensenada and Baja.
*  They were protesting some of the people that pick those fields down there.
*  Part of a tribe called Los Tricis, very hardy, hardworking people, but
*  nefarious people too, they're, they're pretty, they're pretty good at their thing.
*  Um, there was a riot line they couldn't break and this old man walks in the middle
*  of the riot line and yells, grenade and throws an avocado in the middle of all the
*  cops and you broke that riot line with an avocado.
*  Uh, that could have gone wrong in so many ways.
*  But it didn't, I don't know.
*  To me, it's like, it's, there's a small lessons there.
*  There is a case to be made about social engineering, about learning about
*  behavior, about learning how to lie and how to kind of move your way or navigate
*  your way around situations like that.
*  Small things like bartering, knowing how to bribe people in conflict zones is the
*  thing that I show when I talk about or train people to work in hostile
*  environments, deescalation, you know, specifically kind of figuring out what
*  is a value in the environment, what things you shouldn't be doing in an
*  environment that might be considered disrespectful or out of place, you know,
*  people have a tendency that, that it didn't grow up in places that are violent
*  to make continuous eye contact with somebody that might be an issue or
*  smiling when there's nothing to smile about.
*  I think, uh, you know, uh, there's a picture I saw somewhere of Russians taking
*  a portrait and there's Americans there and the Americans are smiling, but the
*  Russians aren't because what is there to smile about, which is true.
*  And of course it's not as simple as smile or not smile.
*  There's subtlety to it.
*  Like you said, eye contact is a super interesting one.
*  Cause, um, I found in my, in my own life, like not making eye contact is that
*  people will be joking, but it's a really powerful way for to deescalate.
*  And there's such a fascinating thing though, cause you could talk about
*  drunk fights that are just, uh, that are harmless, but I feel like the same
*  dynamic applies to the most violent conflict, including wars.
*  I feel like ego is part of this.
*  So to me, the question of conflict where there's a street fight or anything
*  else is the calculus of, are you willing to take an L, uh, in terms of psychology,
*  somebody grabs your wife's ass.
*  You mentioned, boy, if you let that happen, you go home, you're going to
*  have to pay the price of you were the person who didn't define you like in
*  your relationship, you didn't defend your wife's honor.
*  You're going to psychologically pay that price yourself.
*  And depending on your wife, she might secretly also lose a
*  little bit of respect for you.
*  Now how you play that calculus.
*  Cause now we see the war in Ukraine.
*  I would say there is elements of similar posturing in the United States and in
*  Europe and in, uh, Ukraine, Russia, China leadership, macro at a back at a geopolitics.
*  It's still somebody grabs somebody's ass and you're not backing down.
*  So to take those losses and basically just posture, you know, lower your head
*  and live to fight another day type of situation.
*  The thing with modern violence is, you know, the access to weaponry, uh, you know,
*  and I mean, again, nobody owns life, but anybody can hold a frying pan can own death.
*  I've seen people, um, you know, get double-leg takedown somebody on the ground.
*  It's a different thing doing in the mats versus concrete.
*  That's a good way to kill somebody.
*  You know, the most prolific impact weapon on the planet is the planet itself.
*  You can see various videos of people online where they fall and they hit
*  their head or somebody hits their head.
*  And they go into the stretched out fit basically.
*  Uh, and that might not kill you then, but it'll kill you that night or the
*  second night, if you don't get checked out, you know, people bleed out internally,
*  get an edema again, the whole aspect of me showing how some of these things, not
*  only some of these methodologies and somehow people prepare for violence and
*  how people experience violence, how they make their weapons, how the people fight
*  in the streets and stuff like that.
*  It's to recognize that behavior from the inception, you know, uh,
*  there's a video I show where there's a bunch of street kids in Rio de Janeiro.
*  I think it's during the Olympics where they're snatching chains
*  and cell phones from people.
*  And it's a fun video, you know, see it.
*  And it's, uh, the first thing you learn about it is how they target people.
*  Now, who are they going after?
*  There's a bunch of people there.
*  Why are they going after that specific person?
*  And they start learning about profiling and how they identify victim mentality,
*  you know, or the Vic, the perfect victim, you know, lack of awareness.
*  They keep on a straight line avoidance, avoidance of eye contact.
*  If they're doing something, if areas are wrong, uh, and how they pick who
*  they're going to go after, you know, the small people, the women, you know,
*  even some of the men and they separate the men that they're perfect victims
*  versus the men that was going to turn around and punch them in the face.
*  You know, what are they looking for?
*  You know, well, first off, you know, you, you notice that the men that are in that
*  environment that look at them and are aware of their presence, the hyper aware
*  are the ones that are not good to target.
*  So that's the first lesson there.
*  So it's probably a good idea not only to be hyper aware, but to recognize
*  that hyper awareness and others.
*  If I want to separate myself from the victim crowd.
*  Another thing you notice is these are kids going after some grown adults.
*  And some of these grown adult men are with women and you see them, you know,
*  kind of getting outside of the grasp of the, the,
*  the kids that are trying to rip their chains off their neck or their cell phones.
*  And they have no consideration for the women around.
*  Uh, you see other men that are with women and you see them grab the women and put
*  them behind them and immediately they'll say this, this is the wrong one.
*  Let me move off to the next one.
*  So that, that small little lesson in that, in those videos will show you first how
*  these kids are growing up to, to profile and target who the perfect victims are.
*  That's a school for them.
*  And that is an adversarial school.
*  We should look at that school and apply to ourselves.
*  So in general, you think conflict, ultimately the people that are doing
*  conflict are looking for, for weakness.
*  I mean, they're looking for opportunity, you know, opportunistic.
*  That's the predators.
*  That's what they do.
*  They look for an opportunity, you know, uh, from jumping down from a tree and,
*  and getting the slowest gazelle to, uh, looking for the opportune moment to
*  pounce on something that's probably big, but the risk is worth it.
*  I feel like there's several motivations, but, but isn't, isn't there also.
*  Uh, power hierarchy motivation as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you, there's something about the big guy that attempts you to send a message,
*  especially with gangs and they send, aren't they constantly, uh, sort of trying
*  to signal that they're at the alpha?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's, I mean, there's a different situation.
*  It could be, you could be facing a sociopathic predator who is looking for
*  something in you that you're the resource that they're looking after.
*  Maybe it's a woman, you know, it could be a group of people that don't like the
*  fact that you have a specific, uh, nationality, uh, or your passport is
*  stamped in a specific way or that you pray to whatever God, all these have
*  factor in, uh, but in the end, they all do the same thing.
*  They look for an advantageous position.
*  If I were to target you, I would put you in between that wall and, you know, me.
*  So you have two avenues of exits and I would step on one of your feet to keep
*  that avenue closed.
*  So you have to go this way.
*  So this is where my knife is going to be.
*  You see that behavior mirrored everywhere in the world.
*  First off, you look for advantages, right?
*  If it's something that it's unavoidable, like you're in between me and my ability
*  to go home, or you're in between me and my ability to feed my family, or you're
*  in between me and my ability to posture to the people that are behind me, the
*  young guys that I'm in charge, I will do everything in my power to end you.
*  Right.
*  The motivations are not my realm, but the ways they do it are, are, you know,
*  and basically the advantage part of it.
*  So desperation is, uh, is dangerous.
*  It's a dangerous school.
*  When I say dangerous school, I mean, the most dangerous people
*  usually come from those desperate environments.
*  You know, you can have people in Coronado holding onto logs in the ocean and go
*  through this millions of dollars worth of training and just be professional killers
*  for the government and just be these incredible human beings.
*  And then there's a kid that will walk up to one of them when he's off, you know,
*  and put an ice pick right into his chest when he's least expecting it.
*  And that doesn't mean that one is superior than the other.
*  It just means that there are more, that there's more than one way to become that.
*  You know, teenagers terrifying me.
*  It feels like the intensity of desperation, like the capacity of a teenager,
*  like 16, 17 to be desperate and also not have the matured understanding of
*  ethics of the world, like they have this intensity of feeling, uh, that
*  I was unlike anything else.
*  They don't have a volume knob to that.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like, uh, it's like a garden hose without a nozzle on it.
*  So you can regulate it.
*  They haven't developed that.
*  They haven't learned that maybe from somebody else or it used to be warrior
*  culture cultures, you would, you would be a apprentice under somebody or you
*  would learn some of these things from other people, even some gang, modern
*  gangs have a little bit of that.
*  But if you're not, and you're just this kid that's been playing call of duty,
*  uh, all of his life, or that has been witnessing violence and media, and there's
*  no sense of, it's probably a bad idea to go off and do this because all of these
*  repercussions, I could see how that could be a danger to society and some of the
*  volume knobs, some of the countermeasures, the people exploding on somebody else
*  with a, with a weapon, you know, that you see videos constantly online.
*  I remember seeing this one of these two, uh, teenage girls somewhere in the
*  U S and one of them just, there's a fight, there's a hair pulling competition.
*  And all of a sudden one of them takes out a knife and it just happens like that.
*  And it's just pure and restrained downward stabbing.
*  You know, you're like, wait, where does that come from?
*  Well, uh, she's from an environment where she saw that as an option.
*  She didn't see the repercussions of it.
*  And she found herself in a place where she thought that was the only viable
*  option pulling out a weapon.
*  And that's, I think that's, that's the dangerous part of it.
*  So how do you prepare, uh, to win those kinds of situations, to
*  escape those kinds of situations?
*  Like you said, this training, it's exposing your mind.
*  I always tell people, like, if you don't have a combative base, you don't have a
*  base, uh, boxing, jujitsu.
*  And that, that gives you what, like an awareness of your body kind of thing?
*  It gives you an awareness of your body.
*  It gives you a spatial awareness.
*  If somebody, if you, if you can't see the points with your peripheral vision, if
*  you can't see the points of somebody's feet in your peripheral vision, they are
*  in range to stab you in the heart if they wanted to, and that's something you
*  learn from boxing that you learn from jujitsu.
*  You learn from a bunch of combat arts where you're, you learn about
*  distance and angling people.
*  That comes from this experience that you have, you know, again, a lot of these
*  things were just a horse play when we're growing up in some cultures or, you
*  know, rough and tumble with your brothers and shit like that.
*  But we're, some of us are growing up in single kid homes now and we don't get
*  that, we were missing that.
*  And if you don't have it, then you find it in the, you find it in a jujitsu gym.
*  You find it in a boxing gym.
*  You have it, you find it in a Thai boxing gym.
*  You find it in places where they specialize in focusing on certain
*  aspects of this whole combative, uh, whole, right.
*  It used to be before UFC, you know, the Kung Fu man, you know, that Kung Fu guy,
*  that's just street lethal shit.
*  You can't use it in the sporting, you can't show you this because it'll kill you.
*  Now we pretty much know that most of that was, you know, flights of fancy or BS,
*  you know, it pains me too, man.
*  I wanted to learn some of the D-Mock, single punching and killing technique.
*  You know, I remember those books, but that's just not...
*  I'm still on the lookout for that.
*  Maybe somewhere, you know, maybe if you put a pen in your hand, that, that
*  might turn into that, but that's the only way, that's the only way, right.
*  But, uh, a lot of these myths are kind of like faded away.
*  And now you see people that have different combative bases, combining
*  them all and becoming a fighter.
*  Now that's, the UFC fight, two people fighting each other is one thing.
*  You know, you being in the middle of the Portland riots and a bunch of state
*  troopers throwing gas at rioters and then rioters themselves fighting each other.
*  And you finding yourself in the middle of that.
*  That's a completely different thing.
*  And if you think you're going to, you know, go on, go on the ground and
*  get in a guard with a, with a, with a guy swinging around a shovel, a piece
*  of a shovel handle, right.
*  As tear gas is going on because you got, uh, stopped there and your car was, you
*  know, windows were broken and your family's in the backseat, you know,
*  that is a different situation.
*  So, you know, I'm getting medical, uh, learning how to learning about weaponry,
*  you know, uh, I personally don't really like fighting on the ground, but that's
*  why I forced myself to go to train with different people out there, you know, uh,
*  on the ground, you get to catch wrestling to top and bottom.
*  Neither.
*  You don't like either.
*  I personally, I like being in a car and running everybody over.
*  That would be great.
*  You know, if I could, or driving really far away or, um, I had this, I had this
*  experience in Utah, uh, some friends of mine, uh, military, uh, some of your best
*  shooters, some of the best years in the U S you know, coming from the, uh, the
*  Marine Corps were showing, you were showing me how they, you know, would shoot
*  something from really far away.
*  And I was like, Oh, you don't even have to be in the same vicinity.
*  The scope of violence, how far you can be from it or how close you could be from it.
*  Just wait till we get to see what we can do in the cyber attack world.
*  We can destroy your whole wellbeing, your whole life, your identity.
*  That's another aspect of it too.
*  Financial and then, uh, figure out where you live in terms of ambush.
*  Yeah.
*  Figuring out everything about you such that hurting you is easy.
*  I have a class where we specifically deep work on social engineering and kind of
*  how, how, how you can go about something that, you know, at a micro level.
*  Uh, we, I do a class with a guy named Matt Fiddler who does, uh, basically
*  he's, he's one of the premier experts on how to get into and bypass locks.
*  Basically, uh, you'll, he'll show you how to open up every single bypass, every
*  single commercial lock available in the United States, like he'll spread it out
*  and then open up everything.
*  And that's right.
*  And my part in his class is I talk about how you can pull some of that off in a
*  public space and not get caught or how you would employ some of these things in
*  a context where it's like useful for law enforcement, for the military, stuff like
*  that.
*  And, uh, so we have this exercise in a public space where there's a bunch of
*  padlocks in the environment, right?
*  And they, they paint them pink.
*  So people know it's our padlocks.
*  They were not breaking into anybody else's padlocks.
*  If we get approached and asked about it.
*  But I asked the students like, so you have to gather all these padlocks from
*  this public space, you know?
*  So how would you do it?
*  So a lot of them are trying to pick them, you know, they're like very suspiciously
*  picking them and stuff like that.
*  They get caught and it's a whole situation, but the smart ones will basically
*  develop a social media campaign related to the bad blocks, right?
*  Um, a beautiful, a beautiful example of this.
*  And this actually happened here in Texas.
*  I did a class out in Dallas.
*  We put the padlocks over this public mall and the students basically came up with a
*  breast cancer awareness campaign online that they, they made fake, uh, well, they
*  made flyers for it.
*  They did the social media page on a campaign.
*  They, they did this email chain.
*  So when they went there, people were expecting them.
*  So they normalized the behavior through social media and they were walking around
*  bowl cutters in the middle of them all, cutting these things off.
*  That's a beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a beautiful solution to a complex problem of that nature.
*  And again, what the weaponizing part of it, anything could be, all knowledge could
*  be weaponized.
*  And it's, if you focus on getting in a street fight with somebody with your fist
*  or a knife, you know, you're missing out on the whole complexity of violence and
*  the way that it's now being utilized.
*  So in terms of breaking out locks and restraints and captivity, let's talk about
*  a dark topic that you're one of the world experts in kidnapping.
*  So you teach courses on counter kidnapping and terrorism.
*  I read an estimate that criminal gangs get $500 million a year in ransom payments
*  from kidnapping.
*  So just at a high level, what is kidnapping?
*  Who does it and why?
*  What are some insights that can help us understand what is this problem in the
*  world?
*  It happens in different ways in different parts of the world.
*  I mean, I just sent off a group of people that train some of the Ukrainians.
*  And some of the stuff that they were showing them was some of the counter
*  custody stuff that I showed them.
*  A friend of mine named Vince went out there, was showing them some of the
*  aspects of how to utilize things like Kevlar cordage and how to infuse it in
*  their uniform.
*  So if they get zip tied to cut them open, it's a war setting.
*  So it talks about being captive in a war zone.
*  But the information or the methodology actually comes from Mexico, that
*  methodology, as far as how I learned it.
*  In terms of how to escape from restraints.
*  Yeah.
*  So in Mexico, you have abductions happening where cartels who hold control
*  over a specific place or zone are having a hard time with financial situations as
*  far as maybe they're not making enough money to pay everybody off.
*  So they let them freelance basically.
*  In a lot of ways, some of these criminal groups freelance or some of these groups
*  actually professionalize and to abduct the businessmen, abduct the sons of
*  businessmen or people that have money to ask for ransoms for them, basically.
*  And they've taken, you know, captivity and abduction to like an art form in
*  places like Mexico and has a history all over the world.
*  But specifically my experience with it, with it was going to cartel safe houses
*  that turn into holding places.
*  You would see, you know, homemade prison cells and stuff like that.
*  And people being held in captivity for months, if not years, as they were milking
*  their family for everything they owned.
*  So it turns out into a business.
*  They're not actually even interested in hurting the people physically.
*  They're interested in hurting them financially.
*  Financially.
*  And also this, if they get hurt, they're hurt for a purpose, which is to make
*  their family pay up faster or more.
*  Some of the abduction groups that I've seen out there, professional ones in
*  Mexico, basically make it a living to target people that have abduction
*  insurance or that work for companies that have good abducting insurance.
*  So it's, it's almost like an ATM for them.
*  You know, it's like, ah, here again.
*  Huh?
*  So there's some of that going on.
*  Some not so much.
*  Some abductions are express.
*  I mean, I'll grab you with a, in gunpoint, take you to an ATM.
*  You empty it out and then you're on your way.
*  That's an express kidnapping.
*  That might not be worth you doing anything insane.
*  You know, you just go with the motions.
*  Um, but some people do get picked up.
*  You know, uh, I have trained people with prior experiences of abductions in
*  Mexico and here in the United States, people that have spent some time in
*  captivity with loved ones here, like ex-boyfriends or boyfriends that tie
*  them up and beat the shit out of them.
*  And the restraints that you utilize are zip ties and handcuffs sometimes, or
*  duct tape or their own clothing, things of this nature.
*  Basically what somebody is looking for when they tie anybody up is to
*  convince you that they are in control.
*  That they are God and that any hope of you releasing those restraints or
*  getting out of that situation is hopeless.
*  From a cartel group picking you up in the middle of a dirt road somewhere in
*  Cancun to, uh, ex-boyfriend showing up at your house and tying you up till
*  you agree to get back with them.
*  That's the same thing.
*  Uh, and some of the restraints that are being utilized, uh, come from different
*  places. I mean, I remember as an instructor I had way back when told me
*  that the proliferation of zip ties as a restraint in criminal abductions came up
*  after the movie Heat came out because everybody wanted to be Robert De Niro
*  zip tying people in the bank robbery at the end of the movie.
*  Criminals saw that and it became a good thing.
*  Can you actually speak to the, is it possible to systematically learn how to
*  escape restraints like handcuffs, rope, zip ties?
*  The best at it are not the military.
*  They're not seer program people.
*  They are criminals.
*  I learned how to get out handcuffs from a 15 year old who was in charge of a
*  meth sales and, and, uh, La Avenida Revolucion in Tijuana.
*  Is there a system to it?
*  I mean, it's not specifically a system.
*  It's a, usually what they, what happens is they'll buy a set of handcuffs and
*  they will mess around with them in a playing feature.
*  So one thing I do in a class is first off, I'm honest about the fact that
*  some, you know, all the restraints are temporary, even marriage.
*  This is, this is like, wait, can we just pause on the deep philosophical?
*  You're like the immortal Musashi with that statements.
*  All, all restraints are temporary.
*  Even marriage.
*  Uh, I'll just, I'll just, I just like adding that one in there for last
*  because this is a dark subject.
*  Every cage can be escaped.
*  All restraints are temporary.
*  You, you either free yourselves from the restraints, somebody else takes them off
*  or you're dying and your body rots away around them.
*  You know, those are the options.
*  Um, and I like that first option myself.
*  The second option is pretty cool.
*  If you can convince somebody to do that for you.
*  Uh, but that first option is an interesting one.
*  You have to deconstruct restraints.
*  Not all restraints are made the same.
*  Uh, you can train to get out of handcuffs here in the U S and, you know,
*  focus on a pair of Smith and Wesson handcuffs, which are kind of the
*  most common brand of handcuffs here.
*  But if you find yourself in detention somewhere in Russia, the handcuffs
*  out there are completely different.
*  You know, the key way is different.
*  The mechanism is different, but some of the same.
*  Ways of bypassing those mechanisms are right.
*  This down.
*  So in Russia, what kind are they using?
*  And I think they're traveling there and need this information.
*  I'll send you a specific model and details on how to get out of those.
*  Uh, but basically asking for a friend.
*  I'm sorry.
*  So what I do is I take, I take a pair of Smith and Wesson handcuffs.
*  I put them in the middle of a three people in the, in a class.
*  I spread them out and I have them place them on each other in a just playing manner.
*  I have Hank, I have handcuffs Keith there, and I have a pair of bolt
*  cutters here in case somebody gets stuck, doesn't stupid.
*  So they play with each other as far as putting them on randomly.
*  I show them how to put them on appropriately.
*  And then I show them a handcuff key and a handcuff key will open up handcuffs.
*  Interestingly enough.
*  Um, but the thing about a handcuff key is it's not made to be used by
*  the person that is in those handcuffs.
*  So that's the first lesson there.
*  If you have a handcuff key, handcuff keys are the most used tool to open
*  up handcuffs in custody situations.
*  You know, both criminals escaping from the police to people escaping from criminals.
*  Just the standard hidden handcuff key.
*  So I show them how to modify the handcuff key.
*  So it's more optimal to use on yourself with just basic garbage that you can find
*  piece of wire, a zip tie piece, basically how to put a leverage arm on the handcuff
*  key so you can actually spin it in the keyway behind your back or in front of you.
*  Trying to think.
*  I don't think I've ever been handcuffed.
*  Uh, appropriate way to handcuff somebody's palms out.
*  How much restriction is there in terms of there's a lot if it's a, is a hinge
*  handcuffs, there's a lot of restriction with no change.
*  Can you reach back?
*  You could try and reach back or you can basically put yourself in a, in a
*  not compromised position and feed the most of your palm meat into the handcuff
*  way so when they shed it, uh, shed it on you, you have more space to work with.
*  So you can spin your hand.
*  We call it a passive resistance.
*  Um, again, you go through a process with them where you deconstruct how people
*  are handcuffed, uh, handcuff keys and how to modify a handcuff key to be able to
*  use on yourself and these, all of these things they're constructing as we go.
*  So they basically, Hey, what's a grinding surface?
*  Well, there's concrete outside.
*  So they grind an angle on the key so you can get a key not to go straight into
*  the keyway, but you can get it into the key way at an angle, for example.
*  It's something that's, it's something that is out there as far as a method.
*  You can't spin a key behind your back because it's small.
*  It's designed to be used by somebody else opening those handcuffs on you.
*  So you put an arm on it so you can leverage our arms so you
*  can spin it behind your back.
*  You learn how to put yourself in not a compromised position.
*  If somebody asks you for your handcuffs, your hands so they could be cuffed,
*  you don't do this, you know, you do that, or you put yourself in a
*  gable grip behind your back, which is a pretty strong grip and it's
*  hard to spread those hands apart.
*  It's also something that people go into automatically when they're in fear.
*  So all of these things are advantageous for you.
*  And, uh, you learn not only people get restrained, but you see videos of them
*  because I show a bunch of, uh, induction that's actually happening live.
*  Again, the best thing is avoidance, but specifically when you work around
*  restraints is number one, learn how some of these restraints work.
*  Number two is learning how some of the ready-made tools to get out of the
*  restraints look like function.
*  And number three, which is the advanced level is learn how to construct all
*  of these things yourself, which is, I think that is the, that is the
*  best thing you can show somebody.
*  For handcuffs, I just use a standard pair of handcuffs and then we deconstruct
*  other very specialized handcuffs that might be out there and you show them.
*  If you're going to travel somewhere, learn what restraints are commonly
*  in the available in the environment.
*  Somebody going to North sub-Saharan Africa, carrying a plastic handcuff key
*  is that's going to be useless out there because there's not going to be standard
*  handcuffs out there that would be open with that type of key out there.
*  You're probably going to be tied up with a chain and a padlock of some sort,
*  maybe a 40 millimeter Chinese padlock with a plastic core that you can open
*  with a, a lighter, if you can burn the core, melt the core open, or, uh, if
*  you can leverage that open, that's a pretty easy thing to open or a bobby
*  pin, you could reach all the way in the back and open the latch.
*  What about rope?
*  Uh, common.
*  Yeah, it is common.
*  Uh, this is one of my favorite things for rope.
*  Something I usually carry in some places.
*  Another gift for you if you want the ceramic razor blade.
*  Nice.
*  Is it capable of cutting?
*  Nice.
*  Small.
*  Uh, you can put it behind a label.
*  I've seen some students put the Levi's label on there and just sew it back on.
*  Um, it is non-metinetic, non-ferrous.
*  So in and out of, uh, you know, that type of situation, you can get in and it's
*  something you can have with you everywhere.
*  This is a pretty fancy one, or you can just grab a simple razor blade and
*  actually learning how to use or leverage your razor blade between your palms and
*  know how to go up and down with it to be able to cut yourself on a rope.
*  Of course.
*  So that's just practice to do that well.
*  It's practice and it's also exposure to just, this is a
*  possibility, this is how you could hide it.
*  Again, the whole smuggling aspect comes from a criminal, uh,
*  criminal mindset type setting.
*  So how, how things are hidden, where they're hidden.
*  And when I talk about concealing objects of this nature, it's
*  usually comes from smuggling.
*  You know, the fact that I have something in a notebook comes from heroin smuggling.
*  If you're not looking at the school of criminality, you're, you're
*  missing out on a big part of the equation.
*  So for people who want to learn about this, do you teach courses on this?
*  Do you know what's the rec, what's the rec, how do you get in touch with you
*  or learn from you?
*  Do you have stuff online or is it only?
*  So I have some stuff on my Patreon, uh, specifically.
*  I have a Patreon where I share a lot of the online material, like basically a
*  bunch of this isn't my notebook.
*  I have a bunch of stuff that I, I just met somebody in Philadelphia that
*  showed me a pretty unique way of utilizing a box cutter as a weapon.
*  So I wrote some of that down and filmed some of it.
*  Um, and it's not for any other reason.
*  I'm not trying to create dangerous people out there.
*  It's like, Hey, look at this.
*  This is something that's out there.
*  Right.
*  Um, so a lot of that information, some of those notes and stuff like that,
*  I keep on my Patreon.
*  I used to share it openly on Facebook and Instagram, but that, uh, that
*  has not been possible anymore.
*  Well, I'm a member of your Patreon and I recommend people sign up.
*  It's really great.
*  Cause you also have philosophy.
*  You're the, you're the, uh, the Mexican Miyamoto Musashi.
*  Uh, so it's not just these skills.
*  It's also the philosophy around it.
*  Like I got that book, that book of five rings before I went into training.
*  Like I took that with me through training.
*  The whole aspect of, you know, go to places, uh, frightening to the common
*  brand of men, you know, be put in jail and extricate yourself with your own wisdom.
*  I think he was speaking about experiencing experience, you know, the
*  whole warrior's journey, the hero's journey, the hero's journey, the hero's
*  journey of going out there and actually risking.
*  Um, I think that's a pretty big basis and aspect of what the work I do
*  and showing some of these things.
*  There's a tendency to people say, Hey, I'm afraid to go to Mexico.
*  Uh, what do I need to know?
*  Like, well, if you're afraid to go to Mexico, go to Mexico.
*  Um, I mean, I was in Detroit.
*  I was pretty afraid when I was in Detroit and some parts of
*  Detroit and, uh, the South side of Chicago.
*  Um, but, uh, I don't want to be dictated where I can go and where I can't go
*  because of safety, I want to take responsibility for that myself and figure
*  out ways of being more capable and an asset to the people around me and myself.
*  And that comes from experience.
*  Um, and people don't want to risk getting a shoulder injury, rolling a
*  jujitsu or don't want to risk getting a bloody nose in boxing, but that is the way.
*  Well, there's some assets to fitting in.
*  You quote Hattori Hanzo on imitation.
*  The most important thing you should keep in mind when you go on a Shinobi
*  mission is to imitate well, the language of the target province and
*  the ways of the local people.
*  This includes their appearances, the way of wearing clothes, the way of shaving
*  their head, the way of making up their hair, the way of making up a sword or
*  short sword and the way of refinement and luxury.
*  So how do you fit into some of those places?
*  So, you know, Mexico, but a person like me that doesn't know anything about
*  Mexico and say, I'm interviewing somebody in a leadership position in a dark
*  cartel, how quickly do you learn how to fit in?
*  I mean, it's not about fitting in.
*  It's about coming up with a narrative for yourself.
*  What that book is talking.
*  That's a, that's a quote from the book called a Shoninki, which is like a, an
*  actual legit ninja manual from like the 1500s or something like that.
*  Um, and, uh, they're not talking about blending in.
*  They're talking about creating a narrative or a lie to your appearance
*  and your behavior and your knowledge base.
*  That's what they're talking about.
*  So I would say first, if you're going to go to a place like that, first off,
*  learn what is common there, what type of common restraints might be placed on you?
*  What criminal groups work out there?
*  What type of guns they have?
*  Not only what type of guns they have, but go to the gun range in Vegas and learn
*  how to fire some of these firearms yourself so you know how to load them.
*  In case you run into a bad situation, how to tie the sword, how they, how they
*  wear their short swords could equate to how, you know, if you run into some issues,
*  also, it would give you a good idea how many rounds those hold so you can run
*  at the right moment.
*  I like how you focus in on the, on the tools of violence, but there's also the
*  social engineering deescalation, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So if you are in an environment like that and you are carrying around a camera,
*  that might be an issue or the opposite.
*  It might not be an issue.
*  Well, if you're asked like, were you with, I'm with a news organization or am I
*  with a Christian aid group here?
*  Yeah.
*  And if you are with a Christian aid group, it's probably a good idea to learn
*  some of the Bible, right?
*  If you, like, if you want a quick way of having somebody out there, try and stop
*  talking to you, you can start talking about Jesus in the middle of a, you know,
*  in a little cartel territory when they approach you and take out the Bible.
*  That, that'll quickly deescalate.
*  So what I usually prefer to do is I find somebody from the New York Times and the
*  Wall Street Journal and beat them up in front of the, just to send a signal to
*  journalists.
*  And I too don't like journalists.
*  That could be, that could be a way, but, uh, I think a lot of us miss the fact
*  that we are capable of taking control of our own narrative and what we communicate
*  to people around us.
*  I could show up here, uh, drinking a monster energy drink, dumping it on the
*  ground, scratching, you know what?
*  Then just sit down and just be a rude motherfucker.
*  That's not who I am, but I can do that.
*  And you will believe me if I am good at it.
*  Some of us miss the, uh, some of us don't know this aspect because it's something
*  we consider predatory or something that is wrong or negative or bad.
*  And some of these aspects are actually, you know, they're pretty useful.
*  Um, I learned most of my trade craft and skill craft from panhandlers and street
*  performers.
*  And when I had some training related to social engineering, those were the people
*  that I learned from.
*  Uh, I remember we were doing surveillance and there was a guy there that showed us
*  how to do surveillance, you know, on the street.
*  And he said, if you can find a way for somebody to smell you before they see you,
*  you're becoming visible.
*  And I was like, that's bullshit.
*  If you can find a way of somebody smelling you before they see you become
*  invisible, I didn't understand what that meant.
*  So we went on a three day bender.
*  Didn't take a shower, smell like shit, no deodorant.
*  You know, he smelled like a homeless person.
*  You look like a homeless person and you approach somebody asking for the time and
*  they smell you before they see you.
*  And you are not there.
*  You're not a human.
*  You don't exist.
*  So that was a pretty valuable lesson that I got there.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's interesting.
*  But like I have this belief.
*  It has to do with the way I operate in this world, I suppose.
*  But if you come off as a person legitimately, I guess you could fake it, but I
*  think it, it just feels like you can be extremely good, possibly the best in the
*  world.
*  If you practice it your whole life at being you, you being authentic, at
*  being, at showing like you have nothing to hide and that true believer is what
*  I true believe.
*  So like, yes, you can come up with a fake narrative, but then what I mean is like
*  live that narrative of your whole life then would be like, yeah, I understand.
*  And then never falter from that.
*  Like you are this person.
*  That's what I'm trying to have nothing to hide.
*  I consider, I consider that a true believer and yeah, that is a unique person
*  when you meet them and they are out there.
*  There are people that will fucking walk into places.
*  This is who I am.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  This is who I am.
*  If you don't trust me, well, shoot me.
*  Fuck it.
*  This is my honesty.
*  And if you don't trust me, well, look at all these people that I've interacted
*  with in the past and you can ask them about it, or you can see my effects on
*  other people.
*  That's going to be my presentation card.
*  And so the way you said it now is using words and it's blunt.
*  Usually somebody is blunt like that.
*  Like I'm a no bullshit person.
*  That means they're not.
*  That means they're a full of shit actually.
*  But you do that through, I mean, I'm saying I'm verbalizing your behavior, you
*  know, just walking somewhere.
*  Uh, you know, let's say you're going to interview somebody very dangerous down
*  there and you walk into a room without worry.
*  That is, that is a presentation to you.
*  I know that's a pretty, pretty interesting introduction.
*  Um, you know, you're not a threat because you don't consider yourself a
*  threat and you're walking in there with the confidence that you don't consider
*  yourself as a threat, which is an interesting way of going about it.
*  Uh, my life experiences has been different.
*  Um, I was in program that way from an early age and, uh, it's hard for me to
*  go into that line, although more and more as I get older and as I learn more about
*  the world and I've failed a few more times, I can understand or more cognizant
*  of the fact that you don't really have to try that much if you, if you believe
*  in your, in yourself and who you are, if you know yourself, that's, I think that
*  is at the core of it, if you know yourself enough to, to be able to, to
*  kind of communicate that to people around you.
*  And you're not hiding from yourself or from the world, your flaws too.
*  That was the other thing you spoke to that is probably inspiring to others is
*  being honest about your flaws, about your weaknesses as a human being.
*  You can't pickpocket a naked man.
*  And if you, if you, if you can, if you know how to be naked and again, I'm not
*  fair, I think I'm, I'm working towards that just by, you know, hopefully going
*  through shit and, uh, showing people, not telling them is a show me, don't tell
*  me is another valuable lesson that I got long ago.
*  Um, I, I travel across the country and I don't not only get to show people what I
*  know how to do, but I, I give examples of it through things that I do out there.
*  And, uh, I say this a lot, you know, when I travel out there, I'm never alone.
*  You know, there's couches out there waiting for me, you know, there's, uh,
*  there's homes that I can go and stay at and friends that I have out there that
*  I have never even met, but that's been about me, not only worrying some of those
*  mistakes and past failures on my sleeve, but also turning them into lessons for
*  people and just telling people the fact that, you know, I know how to do all this
*  weird stuff, you know, and I show people how to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  But here's a bunch of weird memes that are very humorous about my culture and
*  about being it through going through therapy and this is me doing something
*  goofy and this is me being an idiot in front of all you guys as well.
*  You know, this is me being the fool.
*  I think that, uh, it's another aspect of it.
*  I love that as part of that journey, you made enemies with the rodeo
*  clown and made up with them afterwards.
*  We're still, we're in a very toxic relationship.
*  You know, he knows who he is.
*  He's probably out there listening.
*  He's loving hate.
*  We, we, we, we, we stopped talking to each other for months and then, you know,
*  just send a dick message of some sort and just, you know, we're back at it, you know,
*  back love expressed through anger.
*  I love it.
*  It's therapeutic.
*  You have both very interesting career paths.
*  If we can just jump back to a really interesting topic that I wanted to mention,
*  um, on narco cultism, what are narco cults?
*  What's the relationship between you kind of mentioned religion a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the relationship between religious culture and drug culture?
*  First off, Mexico is one of the most Catholic countries on the planet.
*  If not the most Catholic country on the planet, not only that it is a country
*  that has a root in a spirituality through its in ethnic culture that.
*  Yeah.
*  Other, other parts of the world got most of that taken away and or
*  suppressed or killed or taken away.
*  Um, when the, uh, Spanish came to Mexico, they were a product of a recently
*  liberated group of people.
*  They just got done being invaded by the Morris basically.
*  And they brought with them the image of a la Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin
*  Guadalupe and her non Cortez's vision of that, her version of that was a lady
*  holding a crystal scepter, baby Jesus and standing on a crescent moon.
*  That's what she, that's what he brought with him to the Americas.
*  And, uh, when the conquest happened, you know, a lot of people say,
*  yeah, the Spanish came in conquest of the, the, the, the Aztec empire.
*  Uh, the enemies of the Aztec allied themselves with the Spanish
*  and they took them down.
*  That's what happened.
*  And then the rest was famine and sickness.
*  That's what killed most of them.
*  They realized that it was kind of be hard to suppress some of the
*  spiritual practices in Mexico.
*  So they decided to mill them with Catholic iconography.
*  So you see these, uh, this cult to, uh, to not seen, which is like a fertility
*  variant of a mother goddess and that culture.
*  And they turned her into La Virgen de Guadalupe, which is the icon that a lot
*  of Mexicans venerate as the La Virgen, the Virgin.
*  Um, but in her, she conceals cultural elements from the past.
*  She has a black sash across her stomach, which means she's pregnant.
*  Something common in the Aztec culture and the Mejica culture.
*  She's standing on a chair that has eagle wings.
*  That is a war God.
*  That's the symbol of the war God down there.
*  She has stars on her, which is a veil of certain stars that are related to some
*  of the spiritual practice from before.
*  Basically they hid these things in, in, in that, in that setting.
*  Now you skip forward hundreds of years and you start seeing things like, uh,
*  Malverde, who was a bandit that lived in Sinaloa way back in the day.
*  He would rob rich farmers that would go through the, uh, the countryside.
*  One time he was almost caught and he was shot and injured and he
*  was wanted by the government.
*  So he told one of his friends to tell them where he was and to give the
*  money, the reward money to the townspeople.
*  So we did that.
*  Uh, the, he was hung from a tree and the, the order was not to bury him
*  just to let his body rot and his body rot, rotted away until it fell
*  onto the ground bones and each of the townspeople would go over and put a
*  rock on top of his corpse until it became a pile of rocks and then he
*  started granting miracles.
*  So again, this whole aspect of these criminals become in saints, uh, and
*  also the middle finger from the downward local populace to the, uh, the
*  church in a way, because he's not a recognized saint, but he has a, uh,
*  an altar and people venerate that.
*  Then you have cartels that have a spiritual practice or spirituality
*  behind what they do, which is part of their culture, but it's also like a
*  tool they use to ingratiate themselves with the local populace or the, or
*  the population around them.
*  Uh, there are icons, icons of power and sometimes of, uh, almost a symbol of
*  rebellion, uh, you see El Chapo's son when he was arrested had a Santo
*  Niño de Atocha on his chest, which is a, it's a holy kid of Atocha.
*  The Spanish legend during the Morris conquest, uh, they said that a statue
*  of that saint would go around and feed some of the hungry, you know, that was
*  the legend and he's a, he's a saint of the persecuted.
*  So the fact that when he was arrested, he was, you see him with that wearing,
*  wearing that, and then he was liberated is a miracle in and of itself.
*  So it's proof that that works.
*  You see that that was, you can find one of those scapularios anywhere in Mexico.
*  That was the most highly sold one.
*  Um, so you see them utilizing some of these aspects, uh, in, in their own
*  belief system to as a similar as iconography, basically for some of the
*  things they do, then you go into some of the other aspects of it that are out
*  there like Santa Muerte, which is actually a faith that I grew up in.
*  Mexico has a weird relationship to death.
*  We have parties at the cemetery on day of the dead.
*  And we just went through one, you know, recently this is a
*  November, November the second.
*  Um, so we celebrate our dead and we celebrate death in a way that I don't
*  think a lot of cultures out there do.
*  So it's a joyful occasion.
*  It is a celebration.
*  Yeah.
*  My eight year old put two beers on an altar, one for my mom, one for my brother.
*  She bought a Snickers bar for my mom and a bag of pops for my brother.
*  Uh, flower petals and marigolds and pictures of them on an altar.
*  That's amazing.
*  What kind of beer?
*  I think I got the, the cut the roja for my mother because she's, you know, she
*  was hardcore and they got the light from my brother, you know, he was a more
*  of a endurance drinker, um, and it's also for me, the relationship to death down
*  there is different, uh, so there's an icon in Mexico, it's actually one of the
*  fastest growing, uh, alternative spiritual practices in Mexico.
*  And not, not only in Mexico, but here in the U S I've been to Santa Marta
*  temples across the country.
*  I found one in Connecticut out of all places.
*  How I grew up with it, where I saw it is, uh, we would, we, my family was
*  on Guadalupe, we were, we were, uh, Catholic and we venerate the Virgin of
*  Guadalupe specifically, the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, but every now and
*  then there are winks and nods to a skeletal saint and, and, and family
*  practices.
*  And even when I went to work, uh, they, the, the, the older guys that were, I
*  was working with would tell me like, Hey, we've got to go ask, uh, ask for
*  protection.
*  So they would drive me over to the church and I thought it was going to the
*  cathedral and then we made a left turn and it wasn't the cathedral, it was the
*  market next to the cathedral in Tijuana.
*  And in the little corner, there was a big, uh, Santa Marta reaper
*  refugee.
*  And then I knew why I had to bring a bottle of tequila.
*  I was like, why am I bringing a bottle of tequila to the church?
*  It was for her, for death, la muerte.
*  It was partly hazing and also they did believe that they were basically imbued
*  with the being agents of death in a way.
*  So it was like a cultural thing as well.
*  Something that they, they wore on them as not only protection, but as also like a
*  sample, like a samurai would wear this death iconography on them or how, uh, the
*  Maury would do, uh, haka dances, you know, to some of these guys in their kind of
*  warrior culture that they were growing up with or trying to in view on us, the
*  young guys, uh, they would, um, take us there and they would in view us with
*  iconography of Santa Marta to be like a psychological thing.
*  That gives you strength and meaning in a face of struggle, like in the, in the
*  face of difficulties in life.
*  I think, uh, you know, if you're close to death and having a relationship to death
*  in the form of a symbolic representation of it, like a Santa Marta or an icon like
*  that makes it not as scary, I guess, or not, not only that, but it's also something
*  that the other side, the enemy, the cartels groups, they would venerate it as
*  well.
*  So when they would see it on you, it was almost debilitating to them.
*  They were like, Oh, are you guys cops?
*  Are you guys worried?
*  Why are you wearing that?
*  Uh, so there was an aspect of that to it.
*  Um, a memento, more, more type thing where, you know, remember death, you
*  know, type thing.
*  There's some aspect in which you don't want to mess with a person who meditates
*  on death.
*  There was some of that.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a saying, I think they probably took it from a movie or something like
*  that, but I don't know where they got it.
*  Uh, may I, may I earn your need and be your wrath?
*  Oh man.
*  It's a good line.
*  They would say that to the statue of the Santa, you know, another thing people,
*  it's not a cartel specific saint though.
*  It's like everybody, like at all levels from the lady that sells tortillas to the,
*  um, to the cops, to the military.
*  There's some people in the military that venerate it.
*  Uh, there's a, there's a very specific symbol of how this is like a weird
*  relationship in the specifically in Santa Marta in Mexico.
*  There's a, there's a shrine outside of Tijuana right across the, uh, La Presa.
*  It's like a water reservoir right at South Tijuana.
*  And there was a big Santa Marta, uh, altar there, like on the roadside.
*  And my former boss, Lisa Ola ordered that thing destroyed.
*  So they, he ordered a truck to destroy it.
*  It was a famous thing and it was rebuilt the next night.
*  And I know for a fact that some of the people that rebuilt that were some of
*  the same guys that, you know, were destroying it.
*  Oh man.
*  That's pretty symbolic.
*  So it's just, it's not something that can be killed.
*  It's a part of the, the spirit of the people.
*  It keeps getting destroyed by ultra Christian groups or Catholic groups,
*  and it keeps getting rebuilt.
*  Personally, for me as a, you know, I don't believe that there's a, a reaper
*  skeleton in the sky protecting me.
*  Uh, but I do believe in the aspect of an ending, you know, and how it's important
*  to, you know, the ending is important in all things and death should be present
*  in life.
*  And if it's not, then you're delusional about things.
*  So the, to you, it's a mechanism to meditate on death once again.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, having, uh, my daughter who's eight, uh, view it as a benevolent
*  thing, you know, she's a kid and she sees a skeleton that represents death.
*  And she's, it's like, I think, uh, in a way, Mexicans have taken some of those
*  aspects, be it day of the dead, some of these practices related to some
*  occultism, uh, aspects, uh, around, uh, you know, St.
*  Judas, you know, San Judas, St.
*  Judas is the, the patron state of lost causes.
*  And it's one of the most venerated saints in Mexico, you know, Jesus is probably
*  the fourth or fifth he prayed to, which is pretty funny, ridiculous.
*  But the reason why, and this is something I heard from somebody that, uh, was
*  actually, we found him with a gun and on his gun, he had a St.
*  Judas effigy.
*  And, uh, he said, Oh, like why San Judas?
*  And he's like, well, he's the last Saint you pray to.
*  What, what do you mean?
*  Well, on the list of saints you pray to, he's the last one because when you pray
*  to Judas, you might get the other Judas on the line.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the last one you pray to.
*  That's why he's like the lost cause of Saint.
*  How I remember like even how we try and bribe or like maneuver our way
*  even in spirituality, it's spiritual practices.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, such a fascinating culture.
*  That's unlike anything else.
*  And it's right next door and it's here too.
*  Like, again, uh, I, I found an altar in Connecticut, which was pretty fascinating.
*  There's one in Arizona.
*  Again, it's one of the fastest growing spiritual practices in the, in not only
*  in the U S but like across the, there's, uh, somebody from Russia reached out.
*  There's an altar out there and there's a group of people praying to Santa
*  Marta and I've been posting and writing a lot about it recently, just from my
*  own experience and some of the stuff that I gathered for myself and all the way out
*  there, you know, people are fascinated by some of those aspects.
*  So I got to ask you about the dark turn of, of that spirituality, or maybe
*  you will place this elsewhere, but who was Adolfo Costanza Alpadrino?
*  He's just a guy that comes up in a, in a period.
*  I think he's, he's at the, at the initial period of cartels.
*  This is before my time.
*  And I've, I've talked to some of the people that were there for some of that.
*  I mean, he kills a lot of people.
*  He was exposed and learned, uh, through his family ties about some of the
*  Afro Caribbean spiritualities that are now also exploding as far as influences
*  across the world, uh, Latin America and, and in the U S when I talk about that,
*  I mean, Santeria, uh, Palo Mayombe, uh, basically some old spiritual practices
*  coming out of Africa that, uh, utilize things like in gangas, which are basically
*  spiritual vessels that have to be loaded with human remains in some cases.
*  He was basically a spiritual practitioner that certain cartel groups would hire
*  for them to curse the other side, to in view them with invisibility, to be able
*  to transport their drugs or protection spells and stuff like that.
*  He was very successful at it apparently, or at least that is the experience of
*  the people paying for some of these practices as his spells and his work kept
*  getting bigger and bigger and more and more and complicated the ingredients he
*  needed for these in gangas or these spells, these cauldrons that he would fill
*  with certain elements grew in complexity.
*  So finally he said he needed the brain of a highly educated American of some
*  sort, which led to his eventual downfall.
*  Uh, he was basically responsible for abducting and murdering a young American
*  who was a university, a college student, I think.
*  Do you think he believed the, so this guy's murdering people to create what?
*  Magical potions?
*  Uh, vessels.
*  Yeah.
*  Vessels.
*  I think, yeah, I think, I think he truly believed that he was capable of doing
*  what he was doing, I guess.
*  And there was a culture that spiritually inclined that kind of was on the
*  same wavelength as him.
*  Yeah.
*  It jived.
*  I mean, some of these spiritual practices, again, there's, there's a ritualist of
*  cannibalism done by some of these cartel groups out there.
*  Was he involved in cannibalism as well?
*  He wasn't involved in cannibalism that I know of, but most of the things that he
*  was kind of known for was basically requesting human body parts for some of
*  the spell works he was doing.
*  And then going to such a level where he needed a specific brain or head of
*  somebody that was educated and American.
*  So that kind of, again, led to his eventual downfalls.
*  His ranch was raided.
*  They found the body parts inside of these cauldrons that he was preparing.
*  That's an interesting example of somebody.
*  There's a cartel head somewhere in central Mexico as well.
*  El Mas Loco was his nickname.
*  And he basically forced the citizenship around him to turn him into a saint.
*  So he like, he made a statue of himself.
*  He was very big into Christianity, specifically kind of like the Crusader,
*  you know, mentality and all of that kind of imbued himself and some of the people
*  that were around him with that.
*  And there's still alters to his death, to him after he died.
*  He died two times.
*  One time the government declared him that he was killing a shootout and
*  turns out he wasn't dead.
*  So that was his first miracle, you know?
*  And then when he was really dead, some of his people and his loyal followers
*  were gunpoint kind of still forced to go and, you know, give flowers and
*  venerate these effigies and statues of him as a saint.
*  It's a powerful weapon.
*  Spirituality in Mexico is a powerful weapon.
*  And, you know, the church, Catholic Church in Mexico was a pretty bad track
*  record, but as far as that being used to control populace and stuff like that.
*  And I think it's just another aspect that is being exploited in Mexico in some
*  communities as far as the spirituality and the desperate need for people to
*  believe in something and how that leads for some people to go into some horrible
*  predatory behavior around it.
*  There's a fascinating dynamic at play here.
*  So it's not just the United States and Mexico.
*  It's also China that you talk about.
*  China is the primary source of fentanyl in the world.
*  So fentanyl is an opioid that leads to 70,000 plus or minus overdose deaths
*  in the U.S. every year.
*  So reading from Wikipedia, quote, compared with heroin, it is more potent,
*  has higher profit margins, and because it is compact, has simpler logistics.
*  It can be cut into or even replaced entirely the supply of heroin and other
*  opiates.
*  What do you think is important to understand about fentanyl?
*  There was a prescription opioid epidemic in the United States that kind of went
*  down or stopped.
*  Well, it's still out there, but the epidemic specific around it kind of
*  petered out.
*  And there was also marijuana legalization happening at kind of the same time
*  period, which people talking about marijuana legalization thought it was
*  going to hit the cartels and the drug dealers.
*  And people talking about marijuana legalization thought it was going to hit
*  the cartels in their pockets, and it was going to be like a, you know, a death
*  blow to these criminal groups.
*  Well, now there's illegal pot grows in the United States being run by cartels
*  in federal lands.
*  There's the legal pot grows that are in some way, shape or form influenced and
*  or run or owned by some criminal groups.
*  And they're kind of utilizing that.
*  The, the marijuana fields in Mexico turned into poppy fields once again.
*  The problem is that some of these lands were leached of all the nutrients and
*  you know, they're not as good as something you would find somewhere in Afghanistan.
*  So the, the, the yield and the quality of it wasn't as strong as it could be.
*  So somebody thought about the right idea of putting fentanyl into the mix.
*  And not only that, but also figuring out a get fentanyl into Mexico.
*  Mexico has a giant pharmaceutical industry that people kind of also don't kind of
*  know or factor into this equation, which leads into the free ability of chemicals
*  going in and out of the country and legal means of it happening.
*  Right.
*  So not only the precursors to make it, but also the chemists and the industry to
*  create it in Mexico as well.
*  Some clandestine factories of fentanyl have been found in Mexico, but realistically
*  it's not needed with the, with the ways that the ports and the borders are down
*  in Mexico, you started seeing an influx and a flood of fentanyl into Mexico,
*  specifically related to infusing it into heroin.
*  And not only using that to feed local drug markets, but send it up into the
*  United States, which started off this process that we're kind of going through.
*  Still, are these like similar highs and drug wise?
*  Why do you infuse?
*  I mean, probably you're not the right person to have this biochemical discussion
*  of how I don't know about the biochemical aspect of it, but like speaking to guys
*  that do Chiva down there, that's what's what we call heroin down there.
*  It's like a nickname for it.
*  Having them describe some of the older, stinkier, darker heroin they used to get
*  before this whole fentanyl thing and the highs they would get and how much they
*  would have to take versus some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl that they have to.
*  You know, so there's more higher potency.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a higher potency to it.
*  And also there's a, you know, more money to be made easier to transport.
*  Yeah.
*  But then is this how China starts becoming part of the picture?
*  One aspect to it that people kind of miss is that, you know, there's no Chinese
*  cartel, you know, there's no criminal Chinese organization working unseen,
*  getting around government oversight in China.
*  I don't know of any, any such organization.
*  Anything that could be labeled as a criminal organization is, is, uh,
*  deeply integrated with the government.
*  So it's, I mean, I've never heard of a giant criminal enterprise in China operating.
*  So we have to assume then, independent of the state, I would have, I would have to
*  assume that some of these things are happening with the know-how and inaction
*  of the government out there.
*  Um, when COVID hit, there was a shortage of fentanyl on the Northern side of
*  Mexico, specifically related to the Xinaloa cartel.
*  These guys were actually trafficking fentanyl from the U S down to Mexico
*  to infuse their product, but not the new generation cartel, which operates out of
*  a, the central part of Mexico, the Colima area, which have access to the seaside
*  ports.
*  So even during the shutdown, they were getting supplied, which means to me, at
*  least for anybody observing it, that the supply chain was not cut and whatever
*  was coming out of China was being let out of China by, by whatever official
*  channels would be able to shut down or stop it.
*  And I would love to know the organizational structure, the governmental
*  structure of China, how they enable it.
*  Because I can't imagine at the very top, there's like a portfolio of things we're
*  doing and one of them is most right.
*  I think it's more inaction or just the know-how that is happening, but just like
*  hands off, just let this fly.
*  I don't know.
*  If I were to understand how large bureaucracies work, it's looking the other way.
*  Yeah.
*  You are now seeing, um, pill presses brought to Mexico, industrial level pill
*  presses found in clandestine laboratories where they're not only infusing the, the,
*  the, the yields that they're doing with fentanyl, but also making fake pain
*  medication that is flooding U S markets everywhere as far as, is that pain
*  medication or is that fentanyl, you know, who knows, and that's how you see a lot
*  of people dying from ODs that are supposedly taking pain pills and that's
*  not what they're doing.
*  Uh, so the evolution right now you're seeing is making something look legit as
*  far as a pain medication that it isn't.
*  And I mean, fentanyl is everywhere.
*  They're infusing cocaine with it.
*  I've been getting stories from the U S of people buying it through Alibaba or
*  just weird online sources and it coming in different packages and just infusing
*  it into, into whatever is out there.
*  It is killing off a whole generation of people.
*  Um, and it comes from one place or it's manufactured somewhere where it's being
*  manufactured with the precursors and the elements and know how that comes from one
*  place.
*  Well, are we talking about China?
*  I'm not China because Mexico seems to have, what's the role of this is such a
*  complicated and how do you start to talk about the drug war when more and more
*  and more China is the source of the drug?
*  Is there a drug war going on with China?
*  There's probably an economic war while you talk about this.
*  Another side to China.
*  Uh, most, and this is something that's come out recently, a few years back, I
*  think, but basically the ways you would move money back into Mexico after you
*  have a load up here is that you would give it to a Chinese money broker.
*  They would put it into the Chinese banking system and it immediately would just
*  disappear from American eyes.
*  And then another money broker in Mexico would receive it through a money transfer
*  from China.
*  So China is incredibly good at money laundering.
*  That's another aspect to that.
*  I mean, their banking system is invisible to the U S basically, which allows,
*  which allows the money to move from one point to another.
*  So money brokers and people moving money for, for, for the groups down there are
*  Chinese.
*  So that's another aspect there element of China as far as its presence.
*  What's the role of intelligence in all of this FBI CIA, the Chinese intelligence.
*  Uh, agencies right now, Mexico is going through, uh, a nationalistic resurgence
*  and left this presidency, which is not friendly to us interest in a lot of ways.
*  The U S has had a pretty bad track record when it's with its foreign policy in
*  Mexico with a lot of damage being done by the last president, as far as his
*  rhetoric, uh, Donald Trump, which has been weaponized and utilized by the, by
*  the left down, down in Mexico.
*  So America is not seen positively.
*  No, every now and then I post something about Mexico, some horrible thing
*  happening down there.
*  It's like, why doesn't us send people down there?
*  Like, are Mexicans looking for like us intervention?
*  It's like, no, that is beyond what anybody in Mexico would want.
*  As specifically, you see that the sentiment out there, they don't view the
*  U S as a, as somebody that's going to come in and fix anything or somebody
*  that's going to help or as a friend.
*  Uh, with the, when the Ukrainian conflict happened, uh, Mexico basically
*  abstained from saying anything, which is a winking and not to Russia.
*  It has openly been pro Maduro and openly celebrated some of these, uh, regimes
*  be popping up, uh, across Latin America.
*  You know, which is, that is what people voted for.
*  That is a sentiment down there.
*  They're going towards the left of the political spectrum because of they've
*  been basically violated over and over again by all these different presidencies
*  that have promised change brought corruption with them and they are choices.
*  So this is, this is the best we have right now.
*  Uh, and all of the enemies of the United States are taking full advantage of that.
*  You know, we recently had a general kind of address the Senate committee hearing.
*  I think he was talking about the prevalence of foreign intelligence
*  services in Mexico, you know, and why that is well, you know, it has Mexico
*  has a lot of the mind of a lithium on the planet underneath the parts of it,
*  specifically in the North.
*  And, uh, it is going through a process.
*  Uh, they call it the fourth transformation.
*  The fourth, the fourth transformation is what the president of Mexico calls it,
*  which is, uh, in a way it's basically we're here to stay type thing.
*  You know, they just, uh, nationalized mining lithium and taking control of
*  that and using that as leverage.
*  If the United States ever wants to go to Mexico, it's probably not going to be
*  related to cartel issues.
*  It's going to probably relate to energy.
*  I think, you know, they're kind of thinking ahead, I guess.
*  Well, what about also just imagine a world where India and China doing
*  fentanyl trade with Mexico or whatever transport imagine Chinese military moves,
*  makes an agreement, a NATO type of agreement with Mexico.
*  That's pretty possible.
*  Uh, again, we're seeing a militarized Mexico.
*  It's another aspect of Mexico that I can't, I haven't seen talked
*  about a lot here in the U S.
*  The main promise that the current president had was he was going to make
*  the police, the federal police and the, the, the, the security issues in
*  Mexico, civil civilian, he was going to do exactly the opposite as his main
*  rival, Philippe Calderon, the guy that started off the drug war officially.
*  And what does he do?
*  He dissolves the civilian leadership of the federal police, dissolves
*  the federal police, creates the national guard, which is a military unit.
*  And he puts the military in charge of that.
*  Now the military has a full monopoly over all federal policing.
*  There, when you cross into Mexico, you'll see them wearing
*  these white camouflage uniforms.
*  Those are, those are national guard people, but they're, they're, they're the military.
*  So you're now you're seeing a militarized Mexico with some of these
*  leaks that happened during the Wacamaya, the Wacamaya leaks.
*  You're now seeing that Mexico has been hosting members of the Haitian military.
*  Then they've been training them up to go back to police their country.
*  That's not something that Mexico has been known for to hosting other
*  nations and, and, and training them in such a way.
*  So it's like, it's a, it's a, it's an interesting maneuver.
*  Like Mexico has been historically neutral about getting involved in foreign
*  conflicts, about voting and resolutions as far as invading or not invading or
*  doing all of these things.
*  Mexico has been historically kind of neutral when it comes to some of these
*  things, and now we're training foreign military forces to go and do that role
*  somewhere else.
*  Um, we have the military building airports and building infrastructure in
*  Mexico and a lot of their higher ups getting very wealthy around it, you know?
*  And they basically have a monopoly over, you know, who gets to have guns down there.
*  You know, there's one gun store in all Mexico and it's run by the military.
*  And the only way you can buy a gun there is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly
*  there and have enough money to sustain that, uh, that right or that privilege.
*  So you, you're, you're seeing the military not being in its traditional role of
*  just being the security force.
*  Now it's policing.
*  It's involved in, it's, it's, it's getting involved in politics in a big way.
*  You know, it's, um, legislation has passed to keep it on the streets and the
*  policing role for more years now.
*  So that should be looked at closer by anybody observing it, uh, from afar,
*  the, how the militarization of Mexico and where it's going.
*  Because if you move towards a world where a world war three happens, it feels
*  like Mexico will be the center because a hot war would be fought on the ground.
*  And so you have a very difficult parallel between Mexico and Ukraine.
*  Both don't have nuclear weapons.
*  Both have relationships.
*  So Ukraine has a relationship or a pull towards it, the European Union and NATO.
*  Mexico, at least currently has a kind of slow pull towards China, India, potentially
*  and Russia, and you have this divide between power centers in the world.
*  And in terms of just imagine hundreds of thousands of Mexican troops, hundreds of
*  thousands of Chinese troops on the border, on the U S border.
*  Yeah.
*  On the Mexican side.
*  And also the fact that that border doesn't mean anything to any sort of conflict that
*  would happen regionally because that that's a very easy to cross border.
*  It doesn't matter how many walls you put across it.
*  People are already here.
*  Uh, this is not going to be a war fought off in some overseas place.
*  Like you're not going to, this is something if, if it happens, if
*  destabilization is utilized in Mexico to cause a conflict there and it turns
*  into a Vietnam or a proxy war down there of a sort, which I think in a way you're
*  already kind of seeing some of that through some of the conflicts going on down there.
*  You have a, a new generation cartel that is being fed fentanyl from the Pacific side
*  ports and, and it's suspiciously, you know, you, you want to think that maybe it's
*  favored by a foreign government of some sort in some way, shape or form.
*  Uh, who knows?
*  And then you have a historically in control Sinaloa cartel that, uh,
*  Mirren may not be favored by the U S in some way, shape or form.
*  You can imagine a further conflict down there and people fostering it and seeing
*  the effects of basically setting a fire on the feet of the United States.
*  Its second largest consumer of U S products is Mexico.
*  Um, the massive wave of immigration that is going to be basically weaponized.
*  Uh, you know, you saw the collapse of the border security structure with a
*  contingent of 3000 Honduran, Guatemalan immigrants in that first wave of, uh,
*  caravans coming to Tijuana.
*  You saw it was, it was pretty bad.
*  You know, it was pretty bad and it could have gotten worse.
*  Now what is going to happen when that wave is no, not no longer 3000, but you
*  know, a million people being displaced by violence or being in fear of whatever
*  conflict might originate down there and just that massive wave of migration and
*  move. I think that that's an, that's an interesting thing that people should look
*  at and, you know, how can you affect change to try and stop some of the,
*  there's these things that happen.
*  Well, let me ask you at a philosophical, at a human level, what do you think
*  about immigration, illegal and legal immigration from the direction of Mexico
*  to the United States?
*  So we have an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States
*  and, uh, estimated 45 million legal immigrants in the United States.
*  A few things about that.
*  When COVID hit, there was no shortages of, uh, produce and the, in the
*  supermarkets, which means that, I mean, illegal immigration is pretty much the
*  backbone of all, uh, produce and some of the farming industries out there.
*  You know, most of it.
*  So illegal immigration and illegal, illegal workers in those fields are
*  essential workers in a way.
*  I think there's a weird relationship in the United States with some of these
*  workers and how they're demonized and how they're called criminals.
*  I think there's, there was a state out there that passed, uh, anti illegal
*  immigrant, uh, worker, uh, legislation.
*  The farmers had to look elsewhere for, for, uh, people to show up to work in
*  some of these fields, which basically caused millions of dollars worth of
*  losses for some of these, uh, farms.
*  Um, anywhere you go out there in the United States, you go into the kitchens
*  and there's going to be paisanos there, you know, French, uh, high level
*  French restaurants.
*  You'll see people from Puebla there that, uh, made their way illegally and
*  might have legalized or regularized, regularized their way into the country
*  or, or in a sanctuary city.
*  Uh, you go to the service industry hotels, you know, those are the people
*  changing the blankets, uh, those are the people in the washrooms.
*  Um, you have them doing jobs that no American wants to do realistically, and
*  they're everywhere in this country.
*  And they are the backbone of some of these industries that are
*  essential in this country.
*  Do you think there's a deep sense in which they are American?
*  I think they're indispensable.
*  And anybody that says they aren't is delusional.
*  If you take every single legal worker out of the industry in the
*  United States and send them back, like there's a movie out there called
*  like that, yes, he kind of a day without Mexicans, you know,
*  everything would stop.
*  So the relationship is there.
*  Uh, people talk about the history of slavery in this country.
*  Like it's a thing that is in the past.
*  Uh, there's endangered, endangered slaves in the country right now.
*  People that are paying off their, their people smugglers because they brought
*  them into this country and they haven't been able to pay that fine or that fee
*  yet and are basically being held hostage by that here in the United States.
*  So they're slaves right now in the United States.
*  You know, people are talking about it's a historical context.
*  What do we do about it?
*  How are we supposed to think about it?
*  We're going to have to rethink how we look at immigration illegal or illegal
*  or illegal or legal immigration from Mexico and how we view Mexico as a,
*  as a foreign country.
*  Um, your relationship to Canada is one thing.
*  Your relationship to Mexico is another.
*  Um, the foreign policy towards Mexico has been pretty nefarious in the, as
*  far as the United States in a lot of ways, you know, you can go back.
*  There was a student massacre during the Olympics.
*  And the president in turn at that time was a C on the CIA payroll.
*  And it was a counter communist type maneuver that we're doing down there.
*  But, uh, there's some bloody hands on, on, on the U S side of some of the things
*  that have been happening in Mexico, as far as the stabilization and influencing
*  and meddling in foreign policy out there.
*  Most of the guns that are used down there come from the U S you know, and that's a,
*  that's another interesting aspect and responsibility that people should
*  kind of think about up here.
*  So there is on the drug war side, a machine that's fueling the drug war.
*  I mean, there's a giant drug habit up here, you know,
*  but also a governmental intelligence and military support through the sale of weapons.
*  I don't know about the sale of weapons, but you know, there's some very, you
*  talk about poorest borders, uh, coming up.
*  There's poorest borders also going down, you know, there's, there's a flow of
*  guns going down and munitions.
*  Which I can gun, they don't kill anybody by themselves.
*  You know, they put the, get put in the hands of the desperate that are trying to
*  feed a giant drug market to the South, to the North, you know, Mexico has a saying.
*  Uh, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, far from God, but close to the United States.
*  And, uh, there's a, there's definitely a responsibility on both sides.
*  This is no longer a Mexico problem, a U S problem.
*  This is a regional problem.
*  And if we don't think of that as a regional problem with our brothers on
*  the Southern side of it and with family, we are, we're related in blood.
*  There's like, we are, we are Mexico and the United States are like this, but it's
*  become popular in politics.
*  They just throw a line.
*  Right.
*  And I think we need to get to a place where we can figure out how to make those
*  connections and repair some of the damage done by like just years and years of a
*  bad policy on both sides of the border.
*  Policy and rhetoric, the way we talk about it, the way we think about it, not
*  just the actual policy, but, uh, seeing the humanity and the people that are here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's an easy thing.
*  They're coming to take our jobs is something you hear.
*  Uh, there was a state out there that passed some, uh, anti, um, anti-legislation
*  as far as, uh, illegal workers on fields.
*  And it led to massive losses.
*  Nobody wanted to show up for those jobs.
*  Basically.
*  They, the people would show up one day and they wouldn't come back and they were
*  doing jobs that people just don't want to do.
*  Are they taking that from the locals or are they filling an essential role
*  that we feel guilty about?
*  And, uh, the rhetoric around it is more about guilt than anything.
*  Um, I, I am an immigrant myself, you know, I, I gone through the
*  experience of doing it legally.
*  And I've seen people not do it legally and are in way better places than I am
*  basically, uh, by going around some of the system, um, the system itself, the
*  immigration system here in the U S is, is there's something wrong, you know,
*  it's kind of broken.
*  Um, and people coming here illegally are not only, you know, they're looking for
*  a better life for themselves, a better life for people, this whole aspect of
*  vilifying them and they're like, ah, there's a, there's this immigrant did this
*  horrible thing, this immigrant did that horrible thing.
*  And, uh, people's saying, you know, go back to your country at the same time, they
*  go to a hotel where they're all the service staff is from that part of the world and
*  they're here irregularly, or they go to the, you know, the whole foods and they
*  get some produce there and it's picked by some of the same people that are
*  vilifying.
*  And again, we need to kind of like, think about that and analyze that for ourselves.
*  Yeah.
*  The idea of go back to your country and finding the other and having a disdain
*  and a hate towards the other.
*  Ever since I had a recent conversation with yay, formerly known as Kanye West, I
*  got to hear a few things from, let's say unfriendly messages from white
*  nationalists.
*  And I got to learn about this world.
*  Um, I continue on the journey of learning, which is the idea that the
*  United States, this country should look a certain way, should have a certain skin
*  color, should have a certain religion.
*  And everything else is a pollution, is a poison to this.
*  I made it sound hateful right now, but they usually frame it in a positive way.
*  Uh, like the purity.
*  I'm sure Hitler also phrased everything in a positive way, especially in the
*  1930s about the purity of Germany.
*  But the reality of the United States, and one of the things that makes it, uh, at
*  least the ideal of the United States is the soup, the mix.
*  Unlike so many nations I've traveled to there's the diversity, the good kind of
*  diversity is what makes this country great.
*  And, uh, there's, so I think it's, it needs to be based on the accepting the
*  different subgroups that make up the United States versus trying to purify.
*  And I think Mexican immigrants is just another flavor of saying, this is the
*  other, let's reject the other.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw that interview by the way.
*  That was, that you showed a basic restraint and then an interview.
*  My experience and I came up here again, Trump was elected when I was, when I came
*  up here, so it was a weird time for me as far as being an immigrant and the
*  immigrant experience for myself, um, by both being, you know, basically the, the
*  bad, the, the, the ones that were, you know, talked about in that way.
*  And also having a bunch of my friends who were very conservative and, you
*  know, wearing some of those MAGA hats around me and like, Hey Ed, like, like,
*  well, I mean, you know, you know, I'm a guest here, so I have to, you know, but,
*  uh, it's a balancing act is what I've been looking at it as, you know, on one
*  side, there's the woke side of it, which everything goes and then the other side
*  is like, let's hold onto some of these things that make us who we are on my end.
*  You know, I want to get to a place where I can smoke a joint, uh, concealed
*  carrier firearm, be at my gay best friend's wedding.
*  And I want the government not to say anything about it.
*  And I think there's parts in the United States here that kind of feel the same
*  way, but there's extremes on both sides that are pulling you to one side or the
*  other.
*  And I've seen more of the United States than most Americans.
*  I'm in a different state every weekend.
*  So I get to go to, I'm going to Tampa in a bit, uh, tomorrow.
*  Then I'm going to back to California.
*  Then I'm going to Tennessee later.
*  And Kentucky.
*  So I get to see all types of people and all types of mentalities and ways that
*  people live in this country is more diverse than most would think.
*  You know, if you only see it through the lens of television or media, what I keep
*  seeing out there that for me is like, uh, the reason I came here, I guess, and a
*  lot of, and a lot of the reasons that I feel a vested interest in this country,
*  not just because of my kids American.
*  So I have a very, very big interest in this country doing well.
*  But I think I see is the, there's still the opportunity and the ability to do
*  something with yourself and, and, and opportunities out there for people like
*  me that come here with nothing.
*  I came here with an experience space, a truck and some demons and a bunch of
*  demons in a bag.
*  And I'm here with you talking right now about some of those experiences.
*  Another immigrant.
*  To another immigrant.
*  And both of us are reaching people out there that, uh, you know, might not,
*  might haven't heard a voice of people like us that come, that come here with
*  our own bag of demons, but where else in the world can two people like us have a
*  conversation with a, with an audience like us and not be a shot outside of, of
*  this because of the stuff we're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen to with, uh, with, with love and respect, not, not a division.
*  Um, let me ask you for advice.
*  What, what would you say to young folks?
*  Wherever they come from.
*  So in high school and college, they're thinking of how to live a life, have a
*  career they can, uh, they can be proud of.
*  And, uh, especially if they're struggling, especially if they're at a low
*  point like you were when you came here.
*  A travel, travel is one of the biggest things in the world that I would ask
*  people to kind of go out to, uh, see how other people live.
*  Don't go there with your own preconceived notions or trying to make people act
*  like you act, go out there and travel and actually experience the world.
*  It doesn't have to be another country going from Tennessee to Seattle.
*  I know it's a pretty interesting change of a scenery.
*  Who's better at knife fighting?
*  Just kidding.
*  You don't have to answer that.
*  Uh,
*  Tennessee.
*  But, uh, the, uh, uh, traveling is one and knowing how other people live, uh,
*  is one aspect of it that would tell people, uh, it's risky, it's dangerous,
*  but that is part of the journey is one of the things I would ask people, uh,
*  young people to kind of consider.
*  Service is essential and it should be at the basis of all of our lives.
*  Service, start there, start with service in any industry.
*  You're going to go start your own restaurant.
*  You have to work in the kitchen for service.
*  If you're going to be a part of productive member of this country service.
*  And I'm not talking just about the military because the military it's,
*  it's a process and it's a lifestyle and it's a thing for some people out there.
*  It's not even a choice for other people if they want an education.
*  And I get that community service of any kind is an essential thing.
*  The ability to go out there and interact with the people that you would normally
*  not interact with a homeless population that, you know, that there is in this
*  country. Uh, the older population that, uh,
*  in Mexico are old die in our homes, you know, uh, you know,
*  but here you send them off somewhere else to die,
*  which is an interesting weird detachment that I've seen in the U S as far as how
*  the elders are, are cast aside. Uh,
*  if I can say anything to the young people is to start figuring out our lives of
*  service. And that's gonna,
*  that's gonna expose you to a bunch of experiences to bunch of people out there
*  that you might not regularly kind of meet and see and realities.
*  Education is out there.
*  It is expensive,
*  but I've sat through a bunch of really expensive classes that I've managed to
*  see on YouTube and learned a lot from them. Uh,
*  so education is out there, but it doesn't have to be as expensive as they,
*  as they make it. It's all about the individual and what he does with that
*  education. The dream is free and the hustle is sold separately.
*  Something else I would watch somewhere online,
*  but the ability to take a, take information process and use it,
*  uh, we're expecting everything to be safe process and given to us in a platter
*  and taking that and digesting and thinking that's going to make us somebody
*  that's going to be productive or valuable in society. What's up to us.
*  The U S talks a lot about freedoms, but doesn't talk a lot about responsibilities.
*  I think that's a big part of, you know, take responsibility for like,
*  I came here without anything.
*  And the first thing I thought was I have a responsibility for the people that I
*  work with and the people that are going through the same problems and I am,
*  how can I figure out a way to help?
*  Yeah.
*  The dark side of thinking a lot about freedom is thinking too
*  individualistically, meaning thinking about me,
*  how to optimize my situation for getting that the deepest growth you can do
*  as an individual is by taking care of others, by helping others,
*  by being of service, by being useful to your community locally,
*  and then hopefully also a scale. And that's how you grow.
*  And that's responsibility of like helping those around you.
*  There's an isolationist aspect to culture now. It's like we,
*  we were separate. There's a,
*  there's almost like a spiritual or cultural amputation in a way where,
*  you know, when, when I was a kid,
*  the house where all the bikes outside of it,
*  that was where all the kids were hanging out.
*  And now everybody's on their phone, you know,
*  and the separate houses chatting on whatever.
*  There's a detachment to there. That's a, that's a weird aspect to it.
*  And also the, the, the aspect of I'm, I need to be safe. I can't be offended.
*  Don't hurt me. Say spaces. This is my right. This is my, this is my right.
*  This is my reality. You need to respect it. You know,
*  respect is earned. And my, when, where I come from, respect is earned.
*  There's freedoms, but there's dangerous freedoms. Those are those,
*  any freedom that you have in Mexico is a dangerous freedom in a way, you know,
*  you can drive home drunk in Mexico. You can,
*  if you bribe a cop on your way there and if you don't die or crash into somebody
*  else, that's a dangerous aspect of freedom.
*  But there's a responsibility to all of it.
*  It is a twisted responsibility in a stress twisted way,
*  kind of talk about it and describe it.
*  But I think the,
*  the aspect of people screaming for freedom up here or their rights or their
*  privilege without the responsibility, you know, you know,
*  what are you doing for your community? You know, you're complaining about this.
*  What are you doing about it? You know,
*  another thing I've noticed in traveling around,
*  it's scary is the whole people,
*  people getting shouted down or canceled because of what they express or say.
*  Some of the creepiest experiences I've had in the U S has been through
*  universities or just seeing young people that have an opinion that is completely
*  outside of reality, you know,
*  people telling me how things are in Mexico because they learned it through a
*  college course and seeing sons of immigrants,
*  you know,
*  criticizing me because of my opinion of Mexico or what I have to say about it.
*  And you know,
*  if you want to encounter the worst enemy of a Mexican is usually a second,
*  third generation Mexican up here that shouts you down for what you're saying.
*  I mean, in general entitlement, all of those kinds of things.
*  Some of that comes with just being young in general, but yes, humility,
*  humility at a societal scale would benefit significantly,
*  especially the young.
*  So I would say some of the service that you're speaking to is comes with being
*  humbled.
*  Yeah.
*  And that is one of the best things you can do as a young person whilst
*  maintaining the dream and the ambition, humble yourself to the reality of the
*  world.
*  Yeah. One small example, a micro example of this, uh,
*  my kid,
*  there was a homeless guy, uh,
*  she was out with some, with family members, this homeless guy,
*  homeless guy showed up. He was erratic, mental, mentally disturbed,
*  created a scene. She was upset. There was a little bit of trauma there.
*  She was like, Oh, now all homeless people are bad.
*  So with her,
*  she does art pieces sometimes for me and helps me make designs for the clothing
*  brand that I have.
*  And we take some of that money and we buy socks and underwear, you know,
*  and I, sometimes I have them in the car or sometimes I drive around and see
*  somebody that needs something and I give it to her and says,
*  you helped me earn this money. That's going to help these people.
*  So you should just give them these. And she's like,
*  you know, and the guy, Oh, thank you. And she's like, Hey, cool.
*  Roll up the window. Uh, she used to roll up the window really quick.
*  Now she doesn't. They, they cease to be scary because now some of them have
*  names. Now some of them know her name, you know, when, when they,
*  when she crosses by there, so she's, there's contact there.
*  She's more connected than I am in some of these places. Now, you know,
*  she has friends in low places and in high places that comes later,
*  I guess, but she is learning about service.
*  She's learning about not every, not, not everybody out there is an enemy or
*  bad or scary. She's learning about service.
*  And she's basically learning that lesson that I got from my mom long ago.
*  You know, nobody's against you. They're for themselves.
*  Don't take anything personal.
*  And if you're not doing something for other people while you're working,
*  then you're not doing anything.
*  So when you were young, you were pretty sure you're going to die before you're 30.
*  Yeah. What's your relationship with death today?
*  Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it?
*  I'm not afraid of it. If anything, I'm afraid of, uh,
*  uh, meaningless death, or at least a mean, uh,
*  a meaningless, uh, walk towards it.
*  I'm afraid of losing use of my legs, I guess.
*  I'm afraid of not being able to go out there and do things anymore.
*  I'm afraid that I'm not physically capable of doing the job that I used to do.
*  Uh, so if anything, I'm afraid of stillness, you know,
*  something I always quote a lot in my writings, stillness is death.
*  So you always want to be challenging yourself, moving, growing,
*  like you're traveling.
*  So you get all these experiences and filling your life with all these experiences.
*  And if it ends, when it ends, like ready for it.
*  Yeah. I'm not afraid of the end. The ending is important in all things.
*  First time I got a promotion, I got two silver coins handed to me.
*  Here's a silver coin and this is another silver coin.
*  And he said, I'll give you the other one when your job ends. Yeah.
*  It depends on you if you wanted to have it over your eyes or in your pocket.
*  Right. And, uh, the lesson there is that, uh, you know,
*  this job you're getting, it's pretty cool.
*  And you're going to be in charge of all these people and it's pretty important,
*  but it's going to end. So you always have to,
*  the ending is important in all things. Um, if we don't keep that in mind,
*  then if you think we're immortal and nothing's going to end, I think that's a,
*  there's an atrophy, a spiritual atrophy in that.
*  For the sake of spiritual flourishing,
*  this conversation too must come to an end.
*  So I think a beautiful way to end it. And I'm a huge fan of yours.
*  Thank you for being a man with a life well lived and for talking with me today is
*  an honor, man. It was an awesome conversation.
*  Thank you for having me on.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ed Calderon to support this
*  podcast. Please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Al Pacino's book,
*  Al Pacino's character and Scarface Tony Montana.
*  You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.
*  You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say,
*  that's the bad guy. Thanks for listening.
*  I hope to see you next time.
