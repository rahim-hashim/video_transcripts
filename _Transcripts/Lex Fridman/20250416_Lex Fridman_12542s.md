# Robert Rodriguez: Sin City, Desperado, El Mariachi, Alita, and Filmmaking | Lex Fridman Podcast #465
**Lex Fridman:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA)
*  I write the script in December, January, Josh Arnett, Marlee Shelton come down, fly Frank [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=0.0s)]
*  in. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5.04s)]
*  We're shooting for 10 hours on my green screen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6.04s)]
*  We shoot that opening sequence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7.2s)]
*  Incredible opening sequence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9.88s)]
*  And the visual look, we've never seen that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10.88s)]
*  I want to just take this and make it move. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I just want the comic to move. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=14.48s)]
*  Any other studio would just go make it look like any gritty crime movie and they would [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=15.82s)]
*  miss the point that the visual is half of it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=20.52s)]
*  I want it to look just like this because it would be the boldest movie anyone's seen [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=23.16s)]
*  because that's how it reads when I read the book. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=26.16s)]
*  It's like if this was moving, it would be the most phenomenal movie. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=28.28s)]
*  Just by being around him and working with him, you get by osmosis, you learn stuff and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  it just ups your game because they're just swing way beyond you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=37.56s)]
*  Jim Cameron was like that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=41.6s)]
*  So like when I first met him, I was trying to impress the hell out of him, you know, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=42.6s)]
*  because I was such a big fan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=45.6s)]
*  I was about to go do the sporado and I went, hey, I just took a three day Steadicam course [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=46.6s)]
*  because I can't afford a Steadicam operator. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=50.56s)]
*  So I'm going to operate Steadicam myself on this sporado. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=52.52s)]
*  Now if he was just my peer, he'd say, oh, I did the same thing and I'm going to do [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=55.8s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=59.08s)]
*  That would be like hanging out with somebody if you're ill, but you don't want somebody [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=60.08s)]
*  who's above that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=63.0s)]
*  You know what he said? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=64.0s)]
*  He goes, I bought a Steadicam, but not to operate it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm going to take it apart and design a better one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Us mere mortals trying to learn how to operate the camera. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=72.4s)]
*  He's designing all new systems. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=75.88s)]
*  That's the guy you want to hang out with, not someone who's doing what you're doing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  We put so much of the world around them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  When you see the city, we put a blue screen way in the back to just make the city keep [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=82.92s)]
*  going. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=86.36s)]
*  But we built the sets there, the town, we built the real sets, so everything was very [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  tangible and real. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  And that way she had to fit into that world and be as real as that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=92.92s)]
*  Because if it was all done in CG, well then now you can fudge everything. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=97.9s)]
*  But if you put her in a real environment, that's a real challenge. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=104.34s)]
*  You watch this thing blow up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=106.64s)]
*  You watch this thing not work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=107.76s)]
*  Everything just falls apart in front of your face. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=109.7s)]
*  And that's when you roll up your sleeves and creatively figure out a way around it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=112.42s)]
*  And by the end, you have a result that's better than what you sought out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=116.34s)]
*  Sift through the ashes of your failure and you'll find the key to your next success is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=119.9s)]
*  in there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=123.66s)]
*  But if you're not looking for it, you don't find it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=124.66s)]
*  The following is a conversation with Robert Rodriguez, a legendary filmmaker and creator [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=128.02s)]
*  of Sin City, Al Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids, Machete from Dustal Dawn, Alita, Battle Angel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=133.28s)]
*  The Faculty, and many more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  Robert inspired a generation of independent filmmakers with his first film, Al Mariachi, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  that he famously made for just $7,000. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  On that film and many since, he was not only the director, he was also the writer, producer, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=153.7s)]
*  cinematographer, editor, visual effects supervisor, sound designer, composer, basically the full [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=160.54s)]
*  stack of filmmaking. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=166.66s)]
*  He has shown incredible versatility across genres including action, horror, family films, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=169.26s)]
*  and sci-fi, with some epic collaborations with Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron, and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=175.26s)]
*  many other legendary actors and filmmakers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  He has often operated at the technological cutting edge, pioneering using HD filmmaking, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  digital backlots, and 3D tech, and always. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=190.98s)]
*  Through all of that, he's been a champion of independent filmmaking, running his own [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  studio here in Austin, Texas, which in many ways is very far away from Hollywood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=198.34s)]
*  He's building a new thing now called Brass Knuckle Films, where he's opening up the filmmaking [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=205.22s)]
*  process so that fans can be a part of it, as he creates his next four action films. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=211.58s)]
*  I'll probably go hang out at his film studio a bunch, as this is all coming to life. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=218.3s)]
*  His work has inspired a very large number of people, including me, to be more creative [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=223.54s)]
*  in whatever pursuit you take on in life, and have fun doing it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=230.01999999999998s)]

*  And now, dear friends, here's Robert Rodriguez. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=240.94s)]
*  Has there been a time when there was like one take and you only have one take to get [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=246.82s)]
*  it right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=251.42s)]
*  All the time where you're just like, or just you know how long it'll take to reset, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=252.42s)]
*  and you're just, but then you know what you, you, you gotta just work with what you got. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=256.46s)]
*  You know, you gotta work with your results. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  You get nervous or no? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=262.46s)]
*  In that moment? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=263.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're, you're nervous going like, just, I hope it goes off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=264.82s)]
*  Cause then to fix it, I'll have to go do a bunch of other steps, which we don't have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=268.06s)]
*  time for. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  But a lot of times, you know, I've just learned that if something happens, it's just meant [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  to be that way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=276.34s)]
*  And, and I got used to doing things in one take and just living with it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=277.86s)]
*  It didn't bother me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=281.06s)]
*  One movie, it was even a low budget movie. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=282.22s)]
*  They had rigged a car to implode because I was going to throw a guy at it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=284.06s)]
*  So we needed a car to implode and then we're going to throw them and marry it together. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=289.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=292.66s)]
*  And the stunt and the car guy goes, yeah, we're going to have three cars rigged, three [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=293.66s)]
*  cars waiting at one case. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=298.74s)]
*  One doesn't work. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=301.22s)]
*  And then we have a second one after we said, we don't have all night to go shoot take [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=302.22s)]
*  after take. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=304.82s)]
*  We're doing just, just get one car. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=305.82s)]
*  And if it doesn't work, we'll figure it out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=306.82s)]
*  If you don't have time to do it again, sometimes it's such a long set. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=308.58s)]
*  So I go, no, I'm good with just go with it and a grindhouse movie. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  They only had one take, so that'll make it more authentic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  When it all goes to shit, when it fails, you just, what's the next thought? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  So I'll tell you two things happened on just till done. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=323.7s)]
*  First was, okay, you know how those explosions when somebody walks away in slow motion from [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=326.62s)]
*  an explosion, it's become kind of, you know, that started with Desperado. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  Desperado is the first. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  If you look at all the montages, Desperado is first. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=336.09999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=338.06s)]
*  That is the meme. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=339.06s)]
*  And it was just supposed to be, it's just two grenades, not a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=340.1s)]
*  It throws them over the side. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=343.1s)]
*  I just want to like some body parts or something to fly up some shrapnel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=344.1s)]
*  It literally says shrapnel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=347.34s)]
*  My effects guy was so ragged, running so ragged. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=349.18s)]
*  We get to there and I go, do you have any body parts that we can throw up or something [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=351.62s)]
*  you can shoot up? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=356.22s)]
*  Pat, I didn't realize it's so high to get past that second floor. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=357.22s)]
*  He's like, no, I don't. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=360.14s)]
*  I can give you a fireball. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=361.14s)]
*  I can give you a nice, you know, fireball with propane, but it burns away really quick. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=362.14s)]
*  Like how fast? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=367.1s)]
*  Like that, but it'll be big and orange. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  We'll shoot it in slow motion so it lasts a little longer because it just goes poof. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  So I told the actors, I know how big this fireball is going to be, but just walk really [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  fast and just look real determined and then just keep walking. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=378.66s)]
*  Don't stop and turn around because you might get your eyebrows singed. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=382.38s)]
*  So they take off and boom, it goes and in slow motion. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=385.54s)]
*  It looks great, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=388.94s)]
*  I remember showing it to Jim Cameron before it came out and his hand went up like, you've [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=389.94s)]
*  never seen that before, you know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=394.22s)]
*  Six months later, Dust Till Dawn came out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=395.86s)]
*  So I liked how much it looked so much that in Dust Till Dawn, I did it again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=397.54s)]
*  So those movies came out within six months of each other. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=402.22s)]
*  That's why it turned into a thing because people saw it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  And so I thought, how about for the opening of George Clooney and Quentin walking out [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  of the gas station that we have the whole place just blowing up and they just keep talking [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=413.1s)]
*  like it's not happening. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=418.5s)]
*  You know, like take it another step further so I'm not just doing the same thing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=419.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=422.66s)]
*  That one is like, okay, you're going to walk out and it's all in one take. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=423.66s)]
*  So we're only going to do one take. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=427.1s)]
*  We're going to blow the thing up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  We're going to start with just, you know, some smaller explosions. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=430.5s)]
*  Then when they're further away and it's safer, then we'll do the big fireballs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=432.62s)]
*  So we're going and you're nervous because like if one of them trips up a line and you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  know, the pressure's on them, it's not just you that's nervous. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=440.98s)]
*  You're nervous for them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=443.06s)]
*  They're the ones who got to walk out, do that whole speech, get in the car and drive away. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=444.06s)]
*  What if the car doesn't start? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=449.1s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=450.1s)]
*  There's a lot of things that could happen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=451.1s)]
*  Well, guess what happens? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=452.1s)]
*  The thing you would not expect. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=454.06s)]
*  They go in, they come out, they start talking, shoot it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=457.3s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=461.42s)]
*  Great. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=462.42s)]
*  We can move on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=463.42s)]
*  And the camera guy comes, I don't know what happened, but just like you had a little snafu [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=464.42s)]
*  here goes, yeah, we have, we have an auto focus on the steady cam. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we have a focus thing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=471.38s)]
*  It just went like this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=473.46s)]
*  I felt it go whack all the way out of focus and whack for a second back. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=475.14s)]
*  Like it just reset itself. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=480.02s)]
*  I don't know why it did that, you know, cause it's radio controlled. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=481.02s)]
*  We can't tell because we're shooting film, you know, sort of like, oh shit, let's watch [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=484.04s)]
*  the dailies. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=487.44s)]
*  Sure enough. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=488.44s)]
*  Let's see if we can get, maybe I can scratch the film right there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=489.44s)]
*  No, it goes completely out of focus and back in focus within a second. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=491.72s)]
*  Now we got to reshoot it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=495.82s)]
*  So we had to wait till we're back in that location. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=498.12s)]
*  We rigged it for two more takes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=500.70000000000005s)]
*  So that thing that was supposed to be the one take is three takes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=503.0s)]
*  The other thing that happened was the front of the Dust Till Dawn bar. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=506.62s)]
*  That same guy that did those explosions, he packed a bunch of explosives behind the actors. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  When the actors come running out of the bar at the end of the movie and there's an explosion [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=517.7199999999999s)]
*  through the door because all the vampires are blowing up. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=524.16s)]
*  He didn't just, he put like 10 times. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=526.5s)]
*  It blew out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  You see it in the movie. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  You see this huge fireball going up and if you watch closely, you see it already start [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  to catch the whole place on fire. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=535.68s)]
*  The whole front of that, which is foam, catching on fire. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  I cut just before you see that it's on fire. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=541.56s)]
*  That was the first shot at that bar because we weren't going to start shooting the other [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=544.06s)]
*  stuff till night. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=549.3s)]
*  So the first shot is that and the set's ruined, burned to a crisp. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=550.9799999999999s)]
*  The neon lights blew up so we couldn't even shoot. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  Cheech goes, well, I guess I'm not doing my speech tonight. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=560.78s)]
*  But right away, this is what happens. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=564.0999999999999s)]
*  Doug Arnikowski comes over to me and I go over to him. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=568.3s)]
*  Guys came out with the fire hoses. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=573.42s)]
*  The fire hoses weren't even adding any water. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=574.66s)]
*  Like the thing was just scorching. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=576.8s)]
*  The whole production design team was in tears because they had just spent weeks building [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=578.16s)]
*  this thing and it was up in smoke and charred. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=582.5s)]
*  I said, let's just keep shooting. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=585.3399999999999s)]
*  Let's just keep shooting because it looks really kind of cool like this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=587.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to have to come repair it and we'll have to come back. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=591.78s)]
*  But it's all black and charred. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=594.76s)]
*  That's why the whole scene with George Clooney and Cheech and the buildings black, we didn't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=596.1s)]
*  go over there and touch that up. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=599.9s)]
*  That's real flame that burned. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=601.1s)]
*  And it ended up looking great. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=603.14s)]
*  So then the next week when we came back to shoot that other shot that didn't work, we [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=604.9s)]
*  came back and they had repaired it and we shot all the night stuff, which is the majority [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=608.34s)]
*  of the stuff in front of it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=612.98s)]
*  So sometimes you got to roll with it and look to get the blessing you get because of this [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=614.88s)]
*  mistake. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=619.02s)]
*  You probably actually got a better take by doing it later with them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=620.02s)]
*  And then you had this incredible look for the end of the movie that looked apocalyptic. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=623.24s)]
*  If it had looked just clean, you would have actually seen that it was kind of a foam set. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=626.76s)]
*  This made it look better. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=631.12s)]
*  So I kind of let the universe push you where you're supposed to go. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=632.2s)]
*  You got to roll with it because you don't know what the grand plan is. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=635.88s)]
*  You have your plan. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=638.44s)]
*  Just know it's probably all going to fall apart. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  It's just like the movies. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=641.88s)]
*  You come up with your plan of what you want to accomplish. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=643.26s)]
*  That's like your script. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=644.92s)]
*  Then you go scout your location and figure out what your project's going to be. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=646.9s)]
*  And you go try to make it as bulletproof as possible. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=650.28s)]
*  Then you go to do your project. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=652.92s)]
*  And just like with our movies, you watch it all fall apart. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=654.38s)]
*  You watch this thing blow up. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=656.68s)]
*  You watch this thing not work. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=657.8199999999999s)]
*  Everything just falls apart in front of your face. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=659.74s)]
*  Then that's when you roll up your sleeves and creatively figure out a way around it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  You turn chicken shit into chicken salad. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=666.28s)]
*  And by the end, you have a result that's better than what you sought out. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  But that's the process and that's life. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=672.18s)]
*  And that's wash, rinse, repeat. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=674.06s)]
*  The rest of your life, that's what everything's going to be like. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=675.06s)]
*  It's just like a movie. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=677.62s)]
*  Because when you think about it, you're writing a story for a film. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=678.62s)]
*  And you're also writing the story of your life at the same time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  How are you going to react to things? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=686.44s)]
*  Well, how do you make your character react to things? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=687.6s)]
*  You make him kind of superhuman. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=689.38s)]
*  Why don't you just make yourself that way? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=690.38s)]
*  You're writing your own story. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=692.12s)]
*  And you start really seeing the more you get into storytelling, that life imitates art [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=693.86s)]
*  and art imitates life. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=697.9s)]
*  But the process is also the same. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=699.1s)]
*  So you write the story, the script, and then you have it collide with the chaos of reality. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=701.44s)]
*  And in that moment, you said you see the chicken shit like you have to be able to keep your [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=706.74s)]
*  eyes open. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  You have to notice. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=712.9399999999999s)]
*  You have to do that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=713.9399999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  Stuff change discipline. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  Where's the not to be cliche about it, but where's the silver lining of this? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  Where's the path to actually make something good out of this? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=720.98s)]
*  That's a skill, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=723.78s)]
*  I call it and it's one of my favorite stories. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=724.78s)]
*  I was doing one of these talks and they said, come talk about creativity. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=727.18s)]
*  I go, I understand. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=730.4599999999999s)]
*  Because a lot of people read my book. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=731.4599999999999s)]
*  Rebels had a crew and told me, oh, it made me be a filmmaker. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=732.74s)]
*  But a lot of people said it helped me start my own business because they just see how [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=735.1s)]
*  you can go be entrepreneurial like that and go where no one else is going. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=738.54s)]
*  And I'm giving all this talk about this kind of positive stuff. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=742.5s)]
*  And this one woman goes, you're real positive. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=744.98s)]
*  But what do I tell myself when I just wasted a year and a half of my life doing something [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=747.58s)]
*  that didn't work? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=750.98s)]
*  That's like, that's a real negative way to ask that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=751.98s)]
*  Can you just rephrase the question a little more positively before I even attempt to answer [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=754.94s)]
*  it? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  Because already her point of view is exactly what you're saying. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=759.1800000000001s)]
*  She's not looking at all. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=761.46s)]
*  She's just concentrating on what didn't follow her plan and not seeing the gift of everything [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=763.06s)]
*  else that's there. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=768.78s)]
*  So she goes, very reluctant. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=770.3s)]
*  It's so perfect. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=772.26s)]
*  I wish we had filmed it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=773.26s)]
*  She goes, I learned a good lesson the hard way. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=774.26s)]
*  And I said, that still sucks. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=777.3s)]
*  And I say, when you follow your instinct, like if you follow your own instinct to go [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=779.42s)]
*  start a business or go make this movie or whatever, it wasn't someone saying, go over [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=783.6199999999999s)]
*  there and you'll make a million dollars. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=787.26s)]
*  You know, it was your instinct and you fail. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=788.4599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes the only way across the river is to slip on the first two rocks. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  You fail. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=794.5s)]
*  You have to really sift through, it's like the silver lining, but I call it, sift through [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=795.68s)]
*  the ashes of your failure and you'll find the key to your next success is in there. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=800.14s)]
*  But if you're not looking for it, you don't find it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=804.38s)]
*  I'm going to tell you one, and I tell them the four room story. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=805.38s)]
*  I said, I made a movie called Four Rooms. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=808.38s)]
*  I didn't make any money, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=811.62s)]
*  When Quentin asked me, hey, would you want to make a movie with me and two other filmmakers? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=814.9s)]
*  It's an anthology. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=819.14s)]
*  It's on New Year's Eve. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=820.54s)]
*  It's in a hotel. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=821.54s)]
*  You have to use the Bill Hopp. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=822.54s)]
*  We're not going to know what each other's making and we make it, we put it together. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=823.54s)]
*  My hand went up right away, just instinctually. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=826.9s)]
*  Hey, that sounds, yeah, I'll do that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=828.38s)]
*  I'll go make that with you. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  Now, should I ask the audience? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=832.06s)]
*  I like to throw it to the audience and her. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=833.6999999999999s)]
*  Should I have not raised my hand that quick? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=837.3s)]
*  Shouldn't I have done a little studying first or should I just go blind instinct? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=838.9399999999999s)]
*  Or should you do instinct with some studying? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=842.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=846.3s)]
*  I could have gone and studied and I would have found that anthologies never work. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=847.54s)]
*  Like even when it's Coppola, Scorsese, Woody Allen, they bomb because people can't quite [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=851.3s)]
*  rip the hand. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=855.5s)]
*  What is this? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=856.5s)]
*  Twilight Zone? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=857.5s)]
*  I don't want to go see that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=858.5s)]
*  But that's not, I still said, yeah, I think I should just still go by instinct. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=859.5s)]
*  So my instinct was to raise my hand. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=862.4599999999999s)]
*  Will you go make that movie? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=863.6999999999999s)]
*  Because I love short films. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=864.9s)]
*  I made like Bedhead and short films and I thought, oh, here's a way. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=867.66s)]
*  If this works, I can make short films in anthologies and I can have the best of both worlds. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=870.26s)]
*  And by the way, anthologies is when there's multiple... [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=874.5s)]
*  More than multiple one story. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=876.5s)]
*  In one movie. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=877.5s)]
*  Yeah, one movie. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=878.5s)]
*  So if you did the research, you would know that very few people ever got that to work. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=879.5s)]
*  Yeah, the audience can't quite rip their end and it feels like the movie's starting three [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=884.3s)]
*  times, you know? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=887.82s)]
*  So I make that movie. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=889.4s)]
*  It bombs. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=891.66s)]
*  Now I could feel real bad about that, but if you really think about it, you go, well, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=893.58s)]
*  why did I sign up for it? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=898.4s)]
*  Did I raise my hand because I thought it was going to go be this big financial success? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=899.66s)]
*  No, I did it to work with my friends, to do something creative, to try something. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=902.78s)]
*  But that's still not good enough. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=906.78s)]
*  I need to really sift through the ashes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=907.78s)]
*  And if I look through the ashes of that failure, I find two keys to my biggest successes in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=909.1s)]
*  there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=914.74s)]
*  While I was on the set, they said it has to be New Year's. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=915.74s)]
*  So I thought, I'm just going to do like Bedhead. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=919.28s)]
*  I'm going to have two little kids that are running around in this room and we have to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=921.18s)]
*  use the bellhop as a babysitter. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=925.02s)]
*  Well, it's New Year's. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=926.18s)]
*  Let's dress everybody in tuxedos because it's New Year's. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=927.18s)]
*  They're all going to go out, but the parents leave without them. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=929.38s)]
*  When I saw Antonio and his wife, I thought, wow, they look like a really cool international [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=931.46s)]
*  spy couple. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=936.82s)]
*  What if they were spies and these two little kids, one of them keeps falling asleep on [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=938.14s)]
*  the set. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=941.4200000000001s)]
*  He's so young. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  He can barely tie their shoes. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=943.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't know parents are spies. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=944.4200000000001s)]
*  They have to go save them. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=945.4200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  There's five of those movies now, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=947.4200000000001s)]
*  The other one was, I really love making short films. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  I really want this anthology thing to work. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=952.94s)]
*  What if it's three stories, like a three actor structure, not four, same director, not four [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=954.94s)]
*  different directors. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=959.74s)]
*  I'm going to try it again. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=960.74s)]
*  Why on earth would I try it again? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=962.58s)]
*  Well, because I had already done one and figure out how I could do it better in that sin city. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=964.62s)]
*  Those are by far two of my biggest successes that came directly from that failure. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=969.22s)]
*  I always say follow your instinct. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=973.54s)]
*  If it doesn't work, just go. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=976.02s)]
*  Sometimes the only way across the river is to slip on the first two rocks. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=978.78s)]
*  Where's the key in the ashes of the failure? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=981.78s)]
*  Because if I had an instinct, that means I was on the right track. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=985.02s)]
*  I didn't get the result I want. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=987.42s)]
*  That's because the result might be something way bigger that I don't have the vision for [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=989.38s)]
*  and the universe is pushing me that way. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=993.14s)]
*  By the way, a lot of people that look back to Four Rooms see a lot of creative genius [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=994.8599999999999s)]
*  in there. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=998.5s)]
*  You say it flopped. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=999.5s)]
*  It flopped financially. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1000.5s)]
*  Financially. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1001.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1002.5s)]
*  There's so many ways to measure success. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1003.5s)]
*  Totally. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1006.02s)]
*  Like I said, like I would say, well, it was successful because even Roger Ubert said, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1007.02s)]
*  hey, you furnished my favorite room. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1011.2199999999999s)]
*  I was like, hey, I could take that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1012.8199999999999s)]
*  I think there's something else still there. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1014.9s)]
*  I keep sifting on this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1016.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1017.7s)]
*  Two big successes came from that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1018.7s)]
*  It's an amazing lesson to have because it makes you feel better about failure. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1020.1s)]
*  Think of like The Thing by John Carpenter. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1025.42s)]
*  He put that movie out the same weekend as ET. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1027.22s)]
*  I think bombed. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1029.82s)]
*  Critics were calling it pornography because of all the weird special effects and audiences [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1030.82s)]
*  didn't go either. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1036.9s)]
*  And he thought he made a great movie. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1038.14s)]
*  So it makes you question your instincts. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1040.18s)]
*  Well, 10 years later turns out, oh, it's a classic. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1042.3s)]
*  So sometimes it takes the audience a while. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1046.24s)]
*  So if you have some kind of failure on something, don't let it knock you down. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1048.0s)]
*  Just go, maybe in 10 years they'll think it's great. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1052.96s)]
*  I'm just going to commit to making a body of work. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1055.4s)]
*  A body of work. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1058.76s)]
*  Some will succeed. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1060.72s)]
*  Some will overperform. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1061.72s)]
*  Some will underperform. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1062.84s)]
*  It's not your job. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1063.84s)]
*  You just want to be a creative person. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1064.84s)]
*  Just create. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1067.28s)]
*  I tell you, just create. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1068.28s)]
*  Stop thinking about movie per movie and worrying so much about each one or project to project [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1069.58s)]
*  if you're a business person. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1074.0s)]
*  Commit to making a body of work like an artist would do. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1075.04s)]
*  And you don't know what the masterpieces are going to be or which, you know, someone's [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1078.0s)]
*  going to come and say, oh, that one that bombed, there is some really creative stuff in there. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1082.52s)]
*  And it's not for you to decide. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1087.4s)]
*  You just go and do it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1088.84s)]
*  Sometimes I think it takes some time to process the failure to make sense of it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1090.4s)]
*  Like at least for me, don't rush making sense of what didn't work. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1094.64s)]
*  What lessons do I take from it? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1100.72s)]
*  How do I sift through the ashes, as you said? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1103.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1105.9s)]
*  Like it takes time. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1106.9s)]
*  You have to sleep on it a bunch of nights. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1107.9s)]
*  Sometimes it's right there. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1108.9s)]
*  And then sometimes you come back, revisit it later. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1109.9s)]
*  Because you might not have had some information you have now that makes you look at it a lot [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1113.8600000000001s)]
*  differently. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1117.26s)]
*  Like when I did, I just did the audiobook for Rebel Without a Crew. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1118.5s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for that, by the way. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1122.3s)]
*  I hadn't read it since I wrote it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1123.3s)]
*  So I didn't remember a lot of the details. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1125.74s)]
*  And you actually, it's voiced by you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1127.26s)]
*  I voiced it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1129.7s)]
*  So I was reading it real time. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1130.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1131.7s)]
*  I recommend people because you comment, you add additional comments to it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1132.7s)]
*  It's great. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1135.74s)]
*  Most of the time I'm laughing. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1136.74s)]
*  I can't believe how crazy that story is. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1137.74s)]
*  I forgot a lot of details. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1139.5800000000002s)]
*  And when you're younger, you know, when you're 21, 22, six months feels like six years. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1140.6200000000001s)]
*  I didn't realize how short that window was until I reread it and how impossible most [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1144.9s)]
*  that is. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1149.46s)]
*  But you see some places where a setup falls in my lap and then pays off immediately in [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1150.46s)]
*  a big way like magic over and over again. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1154.7s)]
*  It's clear. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1156.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know what I'm doing. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1157.8600000000001s)]
*  It's clear the universe is just pushing you places. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1158.8600000000001s)]
*  So you can't fight it because I remember I was really disappointed. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1161.02s)]
*  And it says in the diary, I'm really bummed that I go home that Christmas, not having [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1164.3s)]
*  sold it to the Spanish home video market, which was my goal. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1168.24s)]
*  I walked home penniless and I was like, Merry Christmas. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1171.54s)]
*  I feel like a freaking failure. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1175.58s)]
*  Good thing I didn't sell it then. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1178.02s)]
*  You know, with time you look back and you go, wow, I got an agent the next month. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1179.82s)]
*  He wasn't even going to help me sell it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1184.58s)]
*  He said, Oh, if you can get 20,000 for it, take it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1185.58s)]
*  I chased those people down for those contracts, the Spanish market for months and they never [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1188.1799999999998s)]
*  answered me back. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1194.82s)]
*  And then Columbia ended up buying it for like 10 times as much and we made it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1196.6599999999999s)]
*  We released it and did a sequel and then another sequel. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1199.82s)]
*  If you look back in time, good thing I didn't get my way. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1203.9399999999998s)]
*  My way had had this for a vision and it needed to do that, which you would never know. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1207.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, you don't know that going through. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1213.2199999999998s)]
*  So just if you don't have the answer right away or even in 10 years, go, maybe it's coming [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1214.82s)]
*  in 20 years. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1218.54s)]
*  Don't let anything slow you down. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1219.54s)]
*  Just keep plowing forward, committing to making your thing happen. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1221.26s)]
*  Don't get shook up by something that you might not have an answer for. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1225.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1229.14s)]
*  Every aspect of your journey is super inspiring. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1230.14s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1231.42s)]
*  Let's go to the beginning. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1232.42s)]
*  There's a few technical things that are fascinating about your beginning. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1233.42s)]
*  So you started making films when you were very young with an old super eight camera [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1236.7s)]
*  and you were editing on a VCR. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1241.66s)]
*  You see, I've met a lot of filmmakers who, you know, they start a certain way, but then [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1244.06s)]
*  they finish another way. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1247.7s)]
*  They get to be big filmmakers and all that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1249.22s)]
*  I still do it that way. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1250.98s)]
*  Like I still, I like doing things that way. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1252.74s)]
*  I have a new company called Brass Knuckle Films where the audience can actually participate [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1254.94s)]
*  by investing in this movie and investors in these movies that are done the same way. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1260.1s)]
*  They're action films like we did with Mariachi, but 10 to 30 million. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1263.8999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't take a lot of money to start a billion dollar franchise. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1267.1s)]
*  You know, like John Wick only cost 20 million, the first one. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1271.1s)]
*  Second one was 40. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1274.4199999999998s)]
*  Third one was 80. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1275.4199999999998s)]
*  Fourth one was 100 because the audience kept growing and growing. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1276.4199999999998s)]
*  By the way, you say, you know, 20 million, like it's not a lot of money. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1279.4199999999998s)]
*  We should mention for an action film. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1282.8999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1284.58s)]
*  But also we should say that El Mariachi, the film on which to book Rebel Without a Crew [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1285.58s)]
*  is $7,000 movie. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1291.4199999999998s)]
*  So let's put it all in context. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1292.58s)]
*  But you know, you're going to hire a bigger actor. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1293.58s)]
*  You can get a big actor like Keanu Reeves for a 20 million dollar movie. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1295.98s)]
*  I asked Jim, I said, Jim Cameron, I said, you know, like Terminator costs 5 million. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1299.74s)]
*  He goes, I wish we had that much. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1304.34s)]
*  He had less than 5 million for that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1305.82s)]
*  So you can start a billion dollar franchise using these methods. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1307.42s)]
*  And with the audience investing, they get to make money on them. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1311.5s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to say now about how I started. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1315.66s)]
*  You see that DNA of how I give out, you know, I want people to know how I did things with [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1318.74s)]
*  Rebel Without a Crew or with these methods that I started with. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1323.42s)]
*  You see, that's how we kept going. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1326.42s)]
*  Hollywood spends way too much. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1328.02s)]
*  And when you can make stuff for less, your profit margin is much better. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1329.9s)]
*  So when I first started, I didn't have any money. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1333.8600000000001s)]
*  So I still play like I don't have money. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1336.74s)]
*  So I had Super 8. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1339.14s)]
*  My dad had a Super 8 camera, but I couldn't afford it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1340.26s)]
*  I shot two rolls that you had to get to buy the film. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1343.02s)]
*  Shoot two minutes. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1348.14s)]
*  I shot two rolls of that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1349.5s)]
*  It's another same amount of money that it cost to buy it, whatever that was, 12 bucks [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1350.78s)]
*  or whatever to develop it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1354.54s)]
*  You get it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1356.26s)]
*  There's no sound. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1356.82s)]
*  Most of the shit's out of focus, you know. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1358.78s)]
*  But then my dad, who sold cookware, had a VCR, one of the first home VCRs for the market, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1360.6599999999999s)]
*  that he would play his sales tapes to his salesman. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1366.54s)]
*  And it came with a camera attached, like this cable you got coming out. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1369.4199999999998s)]
*  Imagine if that had to go into your VCR for you to even see what it's shooting. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1373.06s)]
*  This is old camera, manual focus, manual iris, and 12 foot cable. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1378.26s)]
*  And I would start making movies with that instead. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1383.06s)]
*  Now I have for $8, I have a two hour erasable tape of sound and picture. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1384.98s)]
*  So I got into digital, basically, really early. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1390.14s)]
*  I was doing, which was really frowned upon back then, and continued to be all the way [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1392.8600000000001s)]
*  to when I was using it for real in the early 2000s before everyone realized, oh, that's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1398.54s)]
*  the future. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1402.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's fascinating because you were rebel in that way too, using digital. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1403.38s)]
*  Well, because of the means and the democratizing of that. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1406.78s)]
*  The elite didn't like that. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1411.14s)]
*  You could just go make a movie like that. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1412.3400000000001s)]
*  But I started practicing and it's much easier to practice when it doesn't cost any money. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1414.82s)]
*  Like if you want to be a rock star, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1420.3799999999999s)]
*  If you want to learn how to play guitar really well, you're not going to just jump on stage [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1421.86s)]
*  and suddenly be able to play. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1424.86s)]
*  You have to practice to your fingers bleed. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1425.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, the same with movies. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1427.62s)]
*  You got to keep telling stories and cutting them together. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1428.5s)]
*  And you just can't afford that on film. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1430.62s)]
*  Nobody can with two minute roll costing as much as a two hour tape. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1431.9399999999998s)]
*  So I was moving all these, doing all these movies. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1435.98s)]
*  First, I would cut in camera and that VCR, that old VCR had a really great pause button [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1438.06s)]
*  that they stopped making that when you hit pause, it stopped right there and it stopped with a clean cut. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1442.98s)]
*  It didn't have all this color bars like the later ones had. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1447.9s)]
*  So I that was my and it had an audio dub feature where you could add another second soundtrack to it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1451.54s)]
*  So if I have people talking, I could hit audio dub and add sound effects so I could have two tracks on the same one. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  So that was my filmmaking kit for a while until I needed to start doing real editing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1464.14s)]
*  And my dad bought a second VCR for his business because I stole his other one. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1470.3799999999999s)]
*  And I found that if I hooked them together, I could play on one and use that pause button on the second. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1475.46s)]
*  And this was the limitation. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1482.46s)]
*  This is what taught me how to edit in my head is that if I shot a bunch of footage, I needed to shoot very little footage so I could find it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1483.5s)]
*  Sometimes you shoot out of order. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1490.78s)]
*  So when I cut it, I have to cut in linear order because if you push pause, it's a nice clean cut, but only it only holds for five minutes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1492.22s)]
*  You have five minutes before the machine shuts off. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1499.06s)]
*  So you got to find your next shot within five minutes and do that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1501.78s)]
*  Otherwise, if you have to start the machine over it, we're at all these color bars and it would be all screwed up. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1505.06s)]
*  So I have to sit there and not move for like all day while I cut knowing what the next shot was. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  And once I had it cut, I would then add some sound effects to it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1516.94s)]
*  Remember, because I have the audio dub function. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1521.7s)]
*  But now if I want to add music, I take that tape, which has two tracks now into the first deck and put it into the VCR again, one generation of loss. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1523.5s)]
*  But I have a little cassette tape player with the music and I do a Y splitter so I can add the music and the right. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1533.06s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1539.9s)]
*  That's like being resourceful with what you have. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1540.62s)]
*  And I made a word winning short films that way on video. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1544.66s)]
*  There were some festivals that would allow video, not many, but they would always win. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1547.3799999999999s)]
*  And they were always funny as I stumbled upon spy kids that way. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1551.78s)]
*  Like I wanted to make these action movies in my backyard. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1557.5s)]
*  But when you're a teenager, you don't know anybody who can come be your action star. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1560.22s)]
*  And if you just bring your high school buddies, well, they just look like high school kids. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1564.02s)]
*  So I use my little brothers and sisters, I'm one of 10, they're oldest. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1567.82s)]
*  They're just sitting around watching cartoons anyway. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1572.42s)]
*  And I made them the action stars just to like learn. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1574.22s)]
*  And I found those things would be a winning formula. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1577.42s)]
*  They'd win every festival I'd send them to. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1579.7s)]
*  So bedhead was my first time using a film camera. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1582.18s)]
*  It was a windup film camera. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1586.1399999999999s)]
*  I got in film school, went to film school for one semester and realized I already knew [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1587.42s)]
*  more than the film students because they, they taught you a whole other outdated way of doing it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1591.58s)]
*  So I thought I'm just going to use that film camera to make a low budget movie, a [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1596.34s)]
*  definitive film version that I can send to all film festivals of these action kids, which [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1601.7s)]
*  is a precursor to spy kids, but it's a precursor to spy kids. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1606.3799999999999s)]
*  And we should say that bedhead was an award winning short film. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1609.58s)]
*  That was probably a big sort of leap for you that probably opened the door to you [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1612.5s)]
*  to then make Almeria. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1616.94s)]
*  I opened up your brain, especially because those video festivals, I would win like a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1618.14s)]
*  trip to New York and a director's chair with a video of shorts that I would put in festivals. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1623.46s)]
*  But I knew the film festival, if I could get into film festivals, I could send it all over the world. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1627.58s)]
*  So I made that little short film, sent it and was winning all the festivals. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1632.26s)]
*  And I thought, wow, I made that with a wind up camera, film camera, filming just one take each [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1636.46s)]
*  shot, just no slates because I'm the editor and that costs 800 bucks. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1644.06s)]
*  And it was eight minutes. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1652.02s)]
*  I bet I can make 80 minute movie for $8,000 if I'd use the same method. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1653.6200000000001s)]
*  So that movie I did six months later, I was making Mariachi because it opened up my mind [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1658.82s)]
*  to that I could try it in a feature. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1663.94s)]
*  Can we actually pause on that because I think Badhead has a really great, really unique [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1665.6599999999999s)]
*  story shot in a really unique way. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1670.1s)]
*  I think what I'm trying to say is like, it's very important to write, write the right [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1672.3s)]
*  script, write the right story. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1676.5s)]
*  So let me tell you the trick to that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1680.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1681.54s)]
*  And Mariachi is the same way. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1681.86s)]
*  And this really helped people. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1684.34s)]
*  Like even Kevin Smith from Clerks said, wow, Robert said when Mariachi was success, I talked [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1685.4199999999998s)]
*  about how I did it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1691.1s)]
*  I said, I looked at everything I had. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1691.86s)]
*  What do I have? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1694.58s)]
*  We have a pit bull. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1695.58s)]
*  We have a turtle. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1696.5s)]
*  We've got a bus that Carlos' cousin owns. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1697.98s)]
*  His cousin is a brother has a brother in law has a bar and he owns a ranch. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1700.54s)]
*  So the bad guy lives at the ranch. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1705.34s)]
*  Fight scene is going to be in the bar. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1707.2199999999998s)]
*  He's going to hit a bus at one point. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1708.78s)]
*  He's going to, the girl's going to have a dog and a turtle is going to cross the road. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1710.54s)]
*  It gives you all this production value. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1714.1799999999998s)]
*  So you write backwards. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1715.3799999999999s)]
*  So for Badhead, Avin did that with a camera. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1717.34s)]
*  So I've been shooting video all this time. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1719.58s)]
*  And one thing I wished I could do on video and never could was slow motion. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1721.2199999999998s)]
*  Or stop motion even. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1724.6999999999998s)]
*  So when I got that crappy world war II camera, they gave us in film school. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1726.06s)]
*  I mean, I was so pissed. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1730.2199999999998s)]
*  Like this is the camera I've been trying to get my hands on. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1731.54s)]
*  I could have bought this for 50 bucks at a bond shop. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1733.5s)]
*  Old Bill and Hal wind up. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1735.5s)]
*  You couldn't even see through the lens. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1737.06s)]
*  You were seeing through an approximation of the lens, but you could shoot slow motion. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1738.8999999999999s)]
*  I could do reverse photography. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1744.86s)]
*  If I filmed upside down, I could do, cause if I do a fast push into her, I'll [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1746.26s)]
*  never get the focus in right. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1751.4199999999998s)]
*  So I started with it in focus, went back, pulled backwards on a chair and then [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1752.94s)]
*  reversed it, flipped it, and that looks like it stops on a diamond focus. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1758.98s)]
*  The number of times I've seen you shoot backwards is incredible. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1763.06s)]
*  Like to achieve a certain feeling, a certain experience, a certain, uh, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1765.94s)]
*  certain effect, sometimes shooting in reverse, plus the sound effect layer. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1770.7s)]
*  You can create this reality that's surreal that then results in the story [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1777.42s)]
*  that you wanted, like you have, you have to be functioning in some kind [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1782.86s)]
*  of different space time continuum. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1786.3s)]
*  Start putting it together. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1789.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1791.1s)]
*  So I've got this different camera. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1791.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, what, and now I go like, I don't want to shoot the same kind of movie. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1792.6999999999998s)]
*  If I got a camera now that can do that, I can do stop motion. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1796.02s)]
*  So that's why there's an animated title sequence at the beginning is I go, wow, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1798.62s)]
*  I, I'm a cartoonist. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1801.82s)]
*  If I set the camera up here, I can slow it down enough. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1803.4599999999998s)]
*  It's not, it's not a frame by frame, but if I get it down like two frames a second, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1807.3s)]
*  I can just tap it and it'll maybe get one frame off. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1811.54s)]
*  So I did 300 drawings by hand for that opening title sequence. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1814.82s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1818.74s)]
*  That was, that was you doing it by hand. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1819.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1821.7s)]
*  So you watch that and this is a throwaway title sequence, but I really want [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1822.5s)]
*  to just thing to win awards. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1827.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1828.46s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1828.62s)]
*  How long did that take to draw that? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1829.1s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1830.94s)]
*  That's a lot of work. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1831.62s)]
*  I drew it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1832.62s)]
*  I drew it over. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1833.34s)]
*  Well, I was a daily cartoonist by then, so I was pretty fast, but still it's, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1834.42s)]
*  that's why it's only penciled. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1837.58s)]
*  It's not inked, but it looks great. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1838.7s)]
*  I mean, it's the cameras going around and all kinds of crazy stuff, but it's [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1840.26s)]
*  just all fake by paper. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1843.74s)]
*  I took me all night to shoot it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1845.9s)]
*  Cause I remember I walked into the film school the next day, you know, like all [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1847.82s)]
*  sleepy and I told one of the fellow students, you know, wow, I was up all night [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1852.3s)]
*  doing this animated title sequence. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1855.62s)]
*  And he went, why are you putting so much work in this? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1856.98s)]
*  They're not going to, they're not going to grade you any differently. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1859.14s)]
*  And I was like, grades, get an A walking in here. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1861.18s)]
*  I'm trying to get out of this town. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1864.62s)]
*  I'm not doing this for fucking grades. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1866.3799999999999s)]
*  I got, I want people to see what I can do now. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1868.78s)]
*  And I want to see what I can do now with this. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1871.66s)]
*  So a lot of the, the story came from the limitations or actually [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1873.8600000000001s)]
*  the freedoms of that camera. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1878.14s)]
*  I couldn't have done that story on video. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1879.42s)]
*  So when I saw, wow, okay, I can do reverse photography. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1881.54s)]
*  I can do stop motion. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1884.6200000000001s)]
*  She has to have special powers. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1886.94s)]
*  Cause if she has special powers, then I can utilize, I can really [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1888.66s)]
*  milk this camera for all it can get. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1891.6200000000001s)]
*  There's one of my shots. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1893.5800000000002s)]
*  I love the most is where she's standing there and the, and the chair. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1894.26s)]
*  She makes a chair come all the way up to her and it goes all the way up to her face. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1900.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, if I did it normally, where would I even put the strings for that? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1904.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1909.26s)]
*  To pull a chair. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1909.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1910.02s)]
*  So let's start here with the camera upside down. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1910.22s)]
*  I have the strings in the back. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1913.1000000000001s)]
*  Cause you're not going to be looking at the back and as it goes back, you pull it [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1914.14s)]
*  back and then when you reverse it, it goes, and it looks so good. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1917.78s)]
*  You can't spot the street. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1921.98s)]
*  If you look close, you see the strings are in the back, but your eyes. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1922.98s)]
*  So I did stuff like that. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1926.22s)]
*  And then just her like getting the hose. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1927.54s)]
*  And then I just do stop motion for the host turning on, you know, the faucet. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1929.9s)]
*  That's why I gave her special powers so that, and it made the story better. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1933.34s)]
*  So sometimes the limitations you have with equipment or location, you can use [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1936.7s)]
*  it to make, you know, take chicken, shit, turn in a chicken salad, take this [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1941.8600000000001s)]
*  camera that everyone was like, what's this? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1945.22s)]
*  And I go, I can do so much with this. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1947.46s)]
*  But I tell you today, I look at that camera. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1950.78s)]
*  I can't believe I ever made a movie. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1952.78s)]
*  It's so ridiculously primitive. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1954.8999999999999s)]
*  I was like, how did I even think I could get anything done with this? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1957.02s)]
*  And it even exposed and Mariachi the same way. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1960.34s)]
*  You have to think about it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1962.9399999999998s)]
*  I shot Mariachi on film and with a bar of 16 millimeter camera, I [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1964.2199999999998s)]
*  didn't know how to use it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1968.4599999999998s)]
*  I called up a place in Dallas that rented that kind of equipment. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1969.62s)]
*  And I said, I have an Ari 16 S here. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1972.2199999999998s)]
*  Two motor looking things. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1977.54s)]
*  One has a 24 and one has a bunch of numbers. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1979.22s)]
*  Oh, that's a variable speed motor. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1982.7s)]
*  That means you can do different speed. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1984.54s)]
*  I can shoot slow motion with this. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1985.7s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1987.14s)]
*  Do you have a torque motor? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1987.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1989.42s)]
*  What is that? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1989.7s)]
*  Is there something on the side of the magazine? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1990.54s)]
*  Like it does. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1992.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1992.82s)]
*  Now you can just look up on YouTube and it shows you how to use it. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1994.14s)]
*  I was doing it by phone that way. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1996.78s)]
*  And then I went and shot the movie right then. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=1998.66s)]
*  And I didn't know if any of it was exposing or if the film camera was [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2001.18s)]
*  working until I finished the whole movie. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2005.98s)]
*  So imagine you have to go down to Mexico, shoot for two weeks, come back, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2008.14s)]
*  send it off to a lab. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2012.1000000000001s)]
*  You want to talk about being nervous. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2013.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2014.5800000000002s)]
*  Just hoping something exposed. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2016.22s)]
*  And when I saw it come back and the tape, you know, they transferred it to a tape [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2018.94s)]
*  so I could edit it deck to deck again. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2022.98s)]
*  I was so relieved. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2026.42s)]
*  Some things didn't come out, but I can cut around that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2027.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh yeah, cause I'm doing everything like right here. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2029.42s)]
*  You're doing everything. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2031.5800000000002s)]
*  Imagine if you forgot to stop down and it's open all the way and one shot is [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2032.18s)]
*  blown out, you know, I'd have stuff like that. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2035.5s)]
*  Because I'm moving fast and I'm doing it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2037.7s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2039.0200000000002s)]
*  You shot the whole thing without knowing if some of the footage is damaged wrong. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2039.7s)]
*  Without any of it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2045.6200000000001s)]
*  That's why I only did one take. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2047.18s)]
*  So my idea was this. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2048.94s)]
*  How gangster is that? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2050.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2052.1s)]
*  It is a test film. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2052.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2054.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2054.62s)]
*  I thought it was, I thought it was going to be a test film. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2055.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2057.42s)]
*  It's the only movie in history ever made where the filmmaker did not think anyone [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2057.86s)]
*  would see it and expect it and even set it up that way. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2063.86s)]
*  I mean, why would I make an action movie for the Spanish market called basically [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2066.62s)]
*  the guitar player promises no action. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2070.02s)]
*  No one's going to watch it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2071.98s)]
*  But I thought if someone actually picks it up and has the balls to watch this [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2073.18s)]
*  thing, they're going to be surprised. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2076.42s)]
*  I put a lot of action. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2077.38s)]
*  It was just to learn from, I just needed to make it for as little as possible. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2078.42s)]
*  See how much I could sell it for. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2081.98s)]
*  If I could double my money. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2084.06s)]
*  Great. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2085.14s)]
*  I can make another one and just get more practice. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2085.46s)]
*  It was just, I just so intrigued by this idea. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2087.38s)]
*  Cause you've heard advice about screen writing. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2090.62s)]
*  I heard a revise back then that I thought was ridiculous. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2093.5s)]
*  It said, it's going to take you a long time to be a good screenwriter. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2095.58s)]
*  So write three scripts and throw them away. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2098.66s)]
*  The fourth script will be the good one. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2101.2599999999998s)]
*  I was like, it's so hard to write a script. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2102.66s)]
*  Who's going to write three full scripts knowing they throw them away. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2104.7799999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if you write three scripts and then shoot each one and be [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2107.62s)]
*  the cameraman, be the sound guy, be everything. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2112.22s)]
*  Cause that way you're learning, not just writing, you're [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  learning how to make a movie. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2116.38s)]
*  So that was my idea. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2118.02s)]
*  I'm going to make three of these. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2119.14s)]
*  Hide it on Spanish video, but make money back. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2121.2999999999997s)]
*  That's like my own film school paying me, paying me to learn. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2123.5s)]
*  So the first one I thought, let me just shoot it one take each because [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2127.34s)]
*  my friend Carlos lives in Mexico. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2132.2200000000003s)]
*  If we shoot two takes, most of the cost is to film. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2134.2200000000003s)]
*  I've just doubled my budget. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2137.1s)]
*  So let me just shoot one take. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2138.9s)]
*  Some of it's going to not come out, but I'm not going to know what I'm not [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2140.42s)]
*  going to shoot a safety one that doubles my, let me, let me see. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2142.78s)]
*  Some things might come out. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2145.94s)]
*  I expected like 70% of it to maybe be okay, but 30% of them I have to come [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2147.18s)]
*  reshoot, which is fine. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2151.74s)]
*  I just drive back there and then I just reshoot just those shots. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2153.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2155.54s)]
*  So I just went, let's shoot. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2156.58s)]
*  We stop, we come back. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2159.3799999999997s)]
*  Then I send it off to develop. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2160.8199999999997s)]
*  Cause we're shooting two weeks consecutively to get film shipped back and [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2162.9799999999996s)]
*  forth from Mexico to see if it came out. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2166.06s)]
*  You just couldn't do it. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2168.54s)]
*  I just had to, you know, double down on it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2169.3399999999997s)]
*  Do it one take every day. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2171.8999999999996s)]
*  Every one time I was still an actor and I told you to run through that shot [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2173.7s)]
*  and you, and you go, Oh, let me do it again. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2176.9399999999996s)]
*  No one day, dude, just think about next time. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2178.2999999999997s)]
*  Do what I say. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2180.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't think anyone was going to see it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2182.1s)]
*  So you, and because you don't think anyone's going to see it, you end [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2183.2599999999998s)]
*  up doing something remarkable, which is, well, I'm just going to make something [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2186.18s)]
*  for myself because if I was making a movie that was going to go to Sundance, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2188.62s)]
*  I wouldn't have made that movie. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2192.62s)]
*  I would have thought, okay, I got to get serious. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2193.74s)]
*  But because I made this movie that was just entertaining myself, like [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2195.8999999999996s)]
*  bedhead, it entertained audiences. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2198.7s)]
*  So that naivety is really important when you're starting out or at any point in [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2201.4199999999996s)]
*  your life, be naive about what things gonna and just do something for yourself. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2206.54s)]
*  That taught me a very valuable lesson because I didn't want anybody to see it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2210.6200000000003s)]
*  I just thought one take one take when I got back home, a bunch of stuff didn't [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2213.6200000000003s)]
*  come out, but I'm like, I'm not going back to Mexico, I'll figure out a way to edit [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2218.1400000000003s)]
*  around it and make the movie shorter. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2222.34s)]
*  And that's just going to be the movie. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2225.54s)]
*  And then that's the one that went one Sundance. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2227.1800000000003s)]
*  That was your first feature film. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2229.3s)]
*  That's the one you made for seventh. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2230.6200000000003s)]
*  I'll just mention your friend Carlos as the star of the movie, everything one [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2231.6600000000003s)]
*  take. And, you know, I highly recommend people go back and watch that movie. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2236.06s)]
*  It's just an incredible movie. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2240.7s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2242.1s)]
*  And it's, it's an action film moves really fast. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2242.94s)]
*  The story is really interesting. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2246.2599999999998s)]
*  So the script is really interesting. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2247.86s)]
*  All the actors you could tell they all kind of stepped up and played their own. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2249.42s)]
*  They weren't actors. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2254.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2255.34s)]
*  Friends of ours, which is why, and because, um, and this was the magic of not having [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2255.82s)]
*  a crew, they didn't feel like they were making a movie. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2261.66s)]
*  It's like this, you know, we're, we're just here. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2264.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2267.18s)]
*  Me with my one camera. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2268.14s)]
*  In fact, the gal, uh, Carlos said, I had this one girl, I forgot she's in town. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2270.14s)]
*  Maybe she would work. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2275.22s)]
*  Cause we tried to get a soap star and she backed out. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2276.02s)]
*  So we got this gal over and she was, I don't know how to act. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2278.58s)]
*  And I said, here, let's watch. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2280.8199999999997s)]
*  I want to show you some on Mexican TV. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2281.7s)]
*  A telenovela was on and you see someone, uh, you know, all over overact. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2283.8199999999997s)]
*  I said, that's acting. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2287.62s)]
*  I don't want you to do that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2289.2999999999997s)]
*  I want you to just talk like you're [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2290.98s)]
*  talking about that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2292.9s)]
*  The love interest, the woman in that that's what you're talking about. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2293.9s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2297.14s)]
*  She's amazing. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2298.1s)]
*  She's amazing. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2298.8199999999997s)]
*  But cause I got a video of her. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2299.46s)]
*  I said, I want you to just do this one line. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2301.2599999999998s)]
*  Pretend like you're just talking to your boyfriend. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2303.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2305.38s)]
*  And I showed her, I showed her the video. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2305.98s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2308.34s)]
*  Cause I couldn't show her the film because we'd have to develop it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2308.9s)]
*  But I showed her a video test of herself doing it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2311.66s)]
*  And she saw herself doing it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2314.02s)]
*  She suddenly had the confidence. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2315.42s)]
*  We went through her closet. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2316.9s)]
*  This red dress you can wear in that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2318.1s)]
*  And everyone just brought their own clothes. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2319.34s)]
*  She really had like a sexuality attention, like a romantic tension that was real. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2320.98s)]
*  Those isn't it was a, it was in part a great love story that, I mean, as, as [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2325.2999999999997s)]
*  ridiculous as it is to say, and like a dramatic love story. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2329.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2333.9s)]
*  The idea was that, you know, I thought a guitar player, you know, the real [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2334.1s)]
*  thing, what I wanted to do was like road warrior. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2338.74s)]
*  I said, I want a guy with a guitar case full of weapons going from town to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2340.5s)]
*  town, like road warrior, but that don't have enough money for the first one to [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2343.42s)]
*  do that. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2346.42s)]
*  That'll be the second movie I do. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2347.1s)]
*  How will we do a Genesis story? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2349.38s)]
*  How he became that guy. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2350.7400000000002s)]
*  So let's do Mad Max basically how he becomes that guy. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2352.26s)]
*  So maybe he is a guitar player. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2355.38s)]
*  So then you start writing it out. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2357.66s)]
*  I'm going to show you my writing method. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2359.2200000000003s)]
*  I write on, on index cards and I carry one of these, a little packet of index [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2361.14s)]
*  cards. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2366.1800000000003s)]
*  I keep one always in my bag and I smile when I run across it. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2366.46s)]
*  Cause I go, I've made a million dollars before, you know, it's like, this is the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2370.1800000000003s)]
*  key to your next success cards. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2376.02s)]
*  Cause you know, when you go see a therapist, you're not going to them for [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2379.18s)]
*  the answers, you're going to them for the questions. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2381.3s)]
*  You've got the answers inside, but you don't have the questions. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2384.26s)]
*  A lot of times we ask ourselves very unempowering questions. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2386.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, why am I such a loser? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2389.3s)]
*  You know, I can think of 10 answers right now, but if you, but if you go, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2391.06s)]
*  what three things can I do today that will not just change my life, but everyone [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2394.7s)]
*  around me take steps to that, take out your cards and start writing them down. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2397.98s)]
*  You won't come up with three. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2402.7s)]
*  You'll come up with 15. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2404.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, well, how, cause you're asking yourself and you'll see him. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2406.22s)]
*  So when I was doing that movie, I thought, okay, he's a guitar player for real. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2408.98s)]
*  And he gets mixed up with the guy with a case. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2414.2999999999997s)]
*  So how about he walks into a bar. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2417.1s)]
*  So right then, then he walks into a bar bar trying to get work. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2419.46s)]
*  Bartender looks at him. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2424.8199999999997s)]
*  We don't hire him. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2425.8199999999997s)]
*  I actually just get the hell out of here. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2426.3399999999997s)]
*  So he leaves after that whole scene explaining who he is and what his story [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2427.8999999999996s)]
*  is, then the shooter comes in with a guitar case full of weapons. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2432.3s)]
*  He's also dressed in black and he shoots the place up. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2435.7400000000002s)]
*  Now that was a short film. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2439.38s)]
*  That's how you start a short film, but this is a feature movie. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2440.38s)]
*  So shit, I gotta figure out how to tell a feature. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2443.38s)]
*  I'm going to need a few more cards before that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2445.86s)]
*  So I'm going to need, well, who's this bad guy? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2448.34s)]
*  How about he's in jail? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2452.34s)]
*  I'd read a story. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2453.26s)]
*  It's a crazy story about a guy who was in jail in Mexico and he was running [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2454.86s)]
*  his drug business from the jail as protection and he can walk out anytime. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2458.26s)]
*  But it was to have the cops be as enforcers basically. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2461.18s)]
*  So introduce that guy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2464.74s)]
*  He's in jail making phone calls and someone puts a hit on him. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2466.2999999999997s)]
*  So we have action right away. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2470.66s)]
*  There's a hit on him. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2471.98s)]
*  He kills those guys cause it's his operation. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2473.66s)]
*  He's not in jail. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2476.7s)]
*  All the cops are working for him. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2478.02s)]
*  And he tells that guy on the phone, the main bad guy, I'm going to come to town. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2480.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to kill all your guys. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2484.62s)]
*  And I'm going to come kill you. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2485.62s)]
*  So then he gets in his truck and you see them bring him a [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2487.26s)]
*  guitar case full of weapons. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2491.1s)]
*  He passes the Mariachi on the way to town. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2493.38s)]
*  And now it's his story. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2498.42s)]
*  The baton gets turned to Mariachi. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2499.26s)]
*  Mariachi is doing a voiceover. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2501.06s)]
*  Easy to shoot. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2502.86s)]
*  We can do the voice later. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2503.62s)]
*  You don't have to do sync sound. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2505.26s)]
*  There was even a scene when he walks into town where we saw these coconuts, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2507.78s)]
*  a guy cutting coconuts and we go, let's go film over there. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2510.86s)]
*  So we filmed the guy giving him a coconut with a straw in it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2513.46s)]
*  And he walks out and I'm like, shit, man, you forgot to pay the guy. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2516.54s)]
*  Well, let's shoot that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2519.94s)]
*  No, there's one take. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2520.54s)]
*  I'll just put in the voiceover that they give away free coconuts in this town. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2522.22s)]
*  And for years, people in other countries would go, they really give away free [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2525.34s)]
*  coconuts and no, it's cause we forgot to show him pain, you know, little happy [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2528.42s)]
*  accidents. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2531.74s)]
*  So now look, you're already building a movie. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2532.34s)]
*  So it's like, now he goes in the bar. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2534.3s)]
*  Now he's mixed up and the bad guy says, find the guy with a guitar [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2536.06s)]
*  case full of weapons. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2539.54s)]
*  Then he goes and meets the girl. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2541.22s)]
*  So you just start your movie. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2543.2599999999998s)]
*  Visually, you can start seeing your movie. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2544.98s)]
*  And I've used this for business things. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2547.46s)]
*  I've used this for ideas, for manifesting stuff. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2549.22s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2552.06s)]
*  Are you doing this alone usually? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2552.54s)]
*  Are you bringing it? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2554.42s)]
*  It's coming and it comes so fast. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2554.94s)]
*  It's like free association. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2556.7s)]
*  Maybe I have the ending. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2557.74s)]
*  Oh, I know I want his hand shot. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2558.46s)]
*  He's going to get his hand shot because he's a musician and those [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2560.62s)]
*  ballads are always really tragic. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2564.14s)]
*  So the girl has to die. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2566.66s)]
*  The girl has to die. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2568.74s)]
*  Because if it's going to be a tragic song for a songbook, each movie [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2569.7s)]
*  should be like a tragedy. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2573.58s)]
*  That's going to be over here. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2576.02s)]
*  You know, you know, you got the ending and then your brain starts [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2577.8599999999997s)]
*  filling in the rest because you're asking yourself these prompt questions [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2580.22s)]
*  that you already have answers for from a past life, from a vision you had [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2584.3399999999997s)]
*  that you don't even know are there. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2587.7799999999997s)]
*  This prompts it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2589.3399999999997s)]
*  It's kind of a puzzle that you're figuring out what happens if you get [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2590.38s)]
*  stuck. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2593.2999999999997s)]
*  Like this doesn't make sense. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2593.62s)]
*  Like some aspect of the structure doesn't make sense. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2594.7s)]
*  You live all there. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  You won't. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2598.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2599.2200000000003s)]
*  You just start, you just start writing in the ones you do know. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2599.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2601.82s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2602.26s)]
*  I know, I know at some point she's going to betray him or he's going to think [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2602.78s)]
*  she does keep tracing. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2607.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2610.58s)]
*  That's in the middle somewhere. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2610.78s)]
*  Uh, the other ones will come. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2612.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2613.94s)]
*  Those are all like crossroads to the story. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2614.14s)]
*  Doesn't that like, how do you know she has to die? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2615.98s)]
*  Can I, can you change your mind about that? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2618.46s)]
*  I can. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2620.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2620.7400000000002s)]
*  But for now I felt like if I really went, the story's telling me now what it is. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2621.02s)]
*  I didn't know I was going to make a Genesis story. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2626.1s)]
*  I wanted to do the road warrior guy, but the road warrior, he lost his family. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2627.9s)]
*  So really to propel him to become a guy who has a guitar case full of weapons, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2632.54s)]
*  he has to lose everything. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2635.98s)]
*  So that he needs a ghost. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2637.78s)]
*  So this is a Genesis story of a character. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2640.62s)]
*  Well, look, Bruce Wayne lost his parents. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2642.5s)]
*  You can say, well, does the parents have to die? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2643.9s)]
*  Well, no, but it's not going to propel him. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2645.3s)]
*  Like, it's not going to, it's not going to drive him like that thing. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2647.02s)]
*  So it just kept, it's just coming to me. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2650.34s)]
*  So this is my other trick. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2652.98s)]
*  And this is the main thing you got to learn about. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2654.86s)]
*  If you take any way, this isn't me doing it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2656.54s)]
*  I totally believe that because when you start doing this, you go, where [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2660.14s)]
*  are these answers coming from? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2663.9s)]
*  I'm asking the right question, but why, how come the answers just [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2665.82s)]
*  keep coming like this? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2668.22s)]
*  I believe, cause I do so many different jobs. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2670.34s)]
*  I've learned this over the years at Merrick Quinn. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2673.34s)]
*  It was in 2002. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2674.98s)]
*  I was like, how is it that I'm the production designer, the composer, which [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2677.3s)]
*  I don't even know how to read or write music and I'm writing orchestral score. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2682.26s)]
*  And I'm doing the editing and I'm doing the cinematography. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2685.82s)]
*  I haven't been trained for any of these. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2689.34s)]
*  I never went to school for these specifically. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2690.7000000000003s)]
*  Must be something about creativity. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2693.42s)]
*  So I went on Amazon, it's 2002. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2695.42s)]
*  I look up creative books, anything that has a creativity in the title. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2697.6600000000003s)]
*  I just ordered it and I've got a bunch of books on creativity. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2703.06s)]
*  And I was reading them through, one of them was like really speaking to me. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2707.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's, that's it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2710.54s)]
*  That's the process. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2711.54s)]
*  Does that, and then it says gels and mediums. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2712.26s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh, this is a book specifically about painting, but it applies to music, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2714.26s)]
*  editing, cinematography, writing. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2720.6600000000003s)]
*  It's all the same. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2723.0200000000004s)]
*  So that's when I realized that creativity is 90% of any of those jobs. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2724.42s)]
*  The technical part of setting up the cameras, of writing a script in format [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2730.3s)]
*  or reading or writing music, that's 10% of that. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2736.1000000000004s)]
*  How many musicians, you know, don't read or write music and they're fantastic. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2738.82s)]
*  Cause 90% what they do is creative. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2741.94s)]
*  Now I believe that that same person, even if they only do music, could literally jump [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2744.5400000000004s)]
*  from job to job creatively and do a superior job than most technicians. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2750.1400000000003s)]
*  And there's also something to say there about the learning, the technical aspects of an art. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2755.26s)]
*  You, you collide with the, uh, uh, with the experts. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2760.82s)]
*  What happens is I've experienced this a lot with like, with, with using cameras and so on. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2766.46s)]
*  I don't know shit about cameras and that you roll in and then there's all the experts almost talking [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2770.94s)]
*  down to you and telling you how things are supposed to be. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2775.82s)]
*  Everything is wrong. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2778.78s)]
*  I talked to somebody about like soundproofing a room and they said, they gave me prices. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2780.1400000000003s)]
*  They're insane. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2785.42s)]
*  And like the amount of effort is insane. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2786.46s)]
*  And this, the, the, the dynamics of this room are all wrong. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2788.34s)]
*  I'm like, why can't I just fucking hang up some curtains? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2792.54s)]
*  Like what it seems like that kills most of the echo. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2795.1s)]
*  Like I don't, I don't understand. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2797.46s)]
*  And they're like, no, this is all wrong. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2799.2200000000003s)]
*  There's corn, the corners are going to have some, and I'm like, fuck it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2801.06s)]
*  I'm just going to try and I see what it sounds like a and B. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2804.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2807.02s)]
*  Here's audio with curtains. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2807.18s)]
*  Here's audio without curtains. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2808.66s)]
*  Seems like this is fine. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2809.8199999999997s)]
*  As a move on to the next thing. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2811.14s)]
*  I think that when you say creativity, some of that is being a rebel, like [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2813.2599999999998s)]
*  not listening to the experts. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2818.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2820.74s)]
*  Well, you're going on your creativity, which is, what is that? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2820.98s)]
*  That's like an M do you consider yourself a creative person? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2823.22s)]
*  I think you play guitar. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2825.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2826.8199999999997s)]
*  Guitar piano. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2827.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2827.86s)]
*  I play piano. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2828.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2828.7799999999997s)]
*  But do you could, but would you call yourself a creative person? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2828.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2832.46s)]
*  Good. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2833.54s)]
*  You should. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2834.18s)]
*  I think that's a positive way to anybody is just own it, own it, and just say, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2834.46s)]
*  I like when I do so many different jobs, it sounds crazy when they would [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2839.5s)]
*  introduce me, Robert, he does this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2843.74s)]
*  And I was like, I get tired just hearing that list. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2846.5s)]
*  But when I think about it, there's really only one thing I do. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2848.62s)]
*  And I live a creative life. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2850.42s)]
*  And when you live a creative life, that means anything that has to do with [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2851.66s)]
*  creativity, whether it's filming or piano and guitar or sculpting, or you [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2854.46s)]
*  can just, you can do it, you can take it on and do it because it teaches [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2857.86s)]
*  you more about your main job. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2861.3s)]
*  I become a better director by doing all those jobs. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2862.5s)]
*  Because when somebody just does one job, they barely know that job. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2865.1800000000003s)]
*  You have to do more to learn about creativity. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2868.2200000000003s)]
*  And this is the main thing I learned was that I'm writing music, you know, for [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2871.38s)]
*  an orchestra, I'm like, how did I, I don't even know what I'm doing. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2876.26s)]
*  How's that coming up? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2878.86s)]
*  I don't feel like I'm doing it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2879.7000000000003s)]
*  I feel like I picked up the pen. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2881.7400000000002s)]
*  I feel like I had the idea to do the cards. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2883.94s)]
*  But then when everything just starts coming out so quickly, like that's [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2886.8599999999997s)]
*  how fast I wrote that movie. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2889.58s)]
*  I go, I really feel like something else has taken over. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2892.22s)]
*  So this is what my belief is. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2895.2599999999998s)]
*  And cause I hear it in different realms. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2897.3399999999997s)]
*  Like you asked Keith Richards, how do you come up with these riffs? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2899.22s)]
*  He goes, I don't, I don't, they're floating around the sky. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2901.02s)]
*  And I pull them out first. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2903.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, yes. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2904.74s)]
*  I asked, you know, Jimmy Vaughn, how do you play guitar? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2905.3399999999997s)]
*  The solos. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2907.2599999999998s)]
*  He goes, it's like a radio, you know, once you get a tune, just right, you [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2907.8199999999997s)]
*  can't even believe what's coming through. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2910.62s)]
*  So I believe I call it the creative spirit. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2912.4199999999996s)]
*  There's a spirit assigned to all of us. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2914.86s)]
*  It's creative. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2916.42s)]
*  That doesn't have hands. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2917.82s)]
*  It needs you to pick up the pen, pull out the cards. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2919.46s)]
*  And then when you start getting in the flow and you're like, whoa, it's writing. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2922.7400000000002s)]
*  It's that's that. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2926.06s)]
*  And if you can have that mindset, you take your ego out of it and go, all I [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2927.98s)]
*  need to do is to be a good conduit for this thing, be a good pipe. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2932.1800000000003s)]
*  And it's going to come through. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2935.6600000000003s)]
*  So you don't ever have to get hung up on that question you had. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2937.02s)]
*  Well, well, what happens when you can't come up? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2939.6200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't me to begin with. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2941.5800000000004s)]
*  If it's not coming out, it's because I'm blocking it. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2943.46s)]
*  And if I were to do this and I'm flowing, and if I were to say, wow, I just wrote [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2946.3799999999997s)]
*  10 cards, I don't know if I can write more. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2951.8999999999996s)]
*  How did I do that? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2954.06s)]
*  You just shut the pipe. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  Cause your ego got in the way. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2956.54s)]
*  You just clogged it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2957.54s)]
*  Cause it gets pissed off that you think it's you. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2958.54s)]
*  It's not you. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2960.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like, dude, just open up, let me through, pick up the fucking pen. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2961.3399999999997s)]
*  And I learned this in, uh, when I was 19, when I had a daily cartoon strip, I had [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2964.7799999999997s)]
*  to draw a comic strip every day. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2970.3399999999997s)]
*  To get paid. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2972.5800000000004s)]
*  And I would be like, I'd have to draw like one drawing, draw another drawing. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2974.0600000000004s)]
*  Then it's like, okay, these kind of go together. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2977.78s)]
*  It was a process, you know? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2979.82s)]
*  And sometimes I just felt like I wish I could just envision it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2981.6200000000003s)]
*  Sit back. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2985.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to try that method. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2985.86s)]
*  I went home and I would sit back and just try to get in my sofa, try the sofa method. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2986.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm just going to try to picture the comic strip. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2991.2200000000003s)]
*  And then as soon as I got one, I think it's funny. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2992.82s)]
*  Then I'll just go draw that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2994.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2995.6600000000003s)]
*  Doesn't be done in half hour. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2996.0600000000004s)]
*  Why, why, why it's three hours. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2997.5800000000004s)]
*  I'd sit there and sit there and sit there. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=2999.74s)]
*  My deadline would be coming up. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3000.94s)]
*  Got like 30 minutes. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3001.94s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3002.94s)]
*  Got to go sit and draw it out. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3003.86s)]
*  It's like, oh, okay. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3005.2599999999998s)]
*  I got this drawing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3006.06s)]
*  It's kind of, oh, this kind of goes with that. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3006.58s)]
*  If I make another drawing, I have my strip. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3008.38s)]
*  That's the only way to do it. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3011.06s)]
*  If you don't get up, the creative spirit ain't going to come visit you. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3012.14s)]
*  If you're doing this, it needs your hands and it's not going to reward you for [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3015.3399999999997s)]
*  sitting there waiting for you have to jump in and do it. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3020.9s)]
*  And people, when they say, oh, well, I'm not ready. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3024.3399999999997s)]
*  How pissed off is that? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3027.02s)]
*  It's waiting for you to feel like you're ready. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3029.14s)]
*  It's not you just start doing the action and it's going to come through and the [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3031.46s)]
*  ideas will come and the answers will come because it's not even if you can take [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3036.02s)]
*  your ego out of like, you'll be blessed with this never ending flow of ideas [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3038.86s)]
*  because don't take ownership for it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3043.3399999999997s)]
*  And know that you're, if it's not coming out, it's cause you're just clogging it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3045.66s)]
*  Cause this thing's got endless ideas. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3048.2599999999998s)]
*  And you give that same advice for, for making films, which is, you know, don't [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  plan if you want to be a filmmaker, don't plan like the movie, don't think [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3054.62s)]
*  about making them would just go in and start. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3058.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3060.3s)]
*  I would meet a lot of people who introduce themselves as aspiring. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3060.62s)]
*  I'm an aspiring filmmaker. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3064.18s)]
*  And I wonder how, what would you tell an aspiring filmmaker? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3065.2200000000003s)]
*  I said, stop aspiring. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3067.62s)]
*  Cause if you, if you call yourself that you are that, and you're always going [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3069.66s)]

*  You don't feel like you're ready till I didn't feel like I was ready to do [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3077.5s)]
*  mariachi till I was probably in my last few days of filming, you became ready as [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3080.1s)]
*  you went, you didn't know all that stuff. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3083.94s)]
*  I couldn't have figured all that out in advance. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3085.3s)]
*  When my kids worked with me on a project that we did similar by the end, they [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3087.58s)]
*  realized they did an interview with my son who after just two weeks of doing one [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3091.6200000000003s)]
*  of those projects, you're a different person. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3095.42s)]
*  He suddenly waxing philosophical about the creative process and going, I never [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3097.7000000000003s)]
*  knew how my dad did mariachi until we did this project together. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3101.34s)]
*  And I realized he didn't know either. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3104.3s)]
*  He didn't know I was going to do it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3105.9s)]
*  He figured it out day by day. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3107.1400000000003s)]
*  Every challenge that got thrown at him, he had to figure it out. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3108.9s)]
*  And that's the biggest lesson. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3112.7000000000003s)]
*  Most people never start. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3114.54s)]
*  And that's the biggest thing. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3116.62s)]
*  Don't wait till you're ready or they'll be on your tombstone. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3117.46s)]
*  Here lies so-and-so. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3119.7799999999997s)]
*  He was never ready and you don't want to be that guy. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3120.66s)]
*  Jump in. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3123.2599999999998s)]
*  No, it's not you. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3123.74s)]
*  You just got to be the hands and that, that, that relieves a lot of pressure [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3125.42s)]
*  from you because then you don't have to ever have to do anything really. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3128.7s)]
*  You just have to be the hands. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3132.22s)]
*  Can you talk through some of the hats, some of the many hats you [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3133.66s)]
*  wore with the El Mariachi? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3136.06s)]
*  That's an interesting case study. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3138.34s)]
*  And you've done the same thing over and over in completely different [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3139.62s)]
*  innovative ways in all the films, but El Mariachi is such a radical leap for you. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3142.66s)]
*  I was crazy. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3148.1s)]
*  I was, that thing's held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3148.94s)]
*  because of the camera I borrowed. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3152.02s)]
*  You directed, you did cinematography. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  You did the sound. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3157.06s)]
*  It's better to just say what I didn't do. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3159.06s)]
*  I didn't act in front of the camera. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3160.3799999999997s)]
*  Everything else I did. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3162.22s)]
*  Everything else, I was the whole crew. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3163.46s)]
*  It's just like you're doing here, except you've got sound recording [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3165.54s)]
*  right onto the cameras, right? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3170.18s)]
*  Or do you have it to system? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3172.06s)]
*  Separately, but it's synced. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3173.58s)]
*  I mean, all the modern technology. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3175.06s)]
*  I didn't have sync camera. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3176.22s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3177.42s)]
*  So I had a camera that it was not, it was not a sync camera. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3178.18s)]
*  And the thing was, it was so loud. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3182.14s)]
*  I would have had to blimp the shit out of it, which I didn't have a blimp. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3184.02s)]
*  And then I would have needed a sound guy. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3187.06s)]
*  Just to be clear. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3188.5s)]
*  So if people don't understand this, you're shooting basically no sound. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3189.22s)]
*  Cause the camera sounds like this. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3193.06s)]
*  It's like, it's like, I'm not sure. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3197.22s)]
*  It's like, it sounds like all your money's going away. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3199.14s)]
*  First of all. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3201.1s)]
*  So I would go like this action. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3201.58s)]
*  You'd start running. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3203.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3204.9s)]
*  And I shoot my edit. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3205.8599999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3210.94s)]
*  You know, they're still running, you know, like I'm only using this part. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3211.18s)]
*  And there's no slates. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3213.8599999999997s)]
*  There's no, no, there's, there's guys holding up their fingers at the [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3215.46s)]
*  beginning of rolling. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3217.9s)]
*  This is a real seven for just a few frames. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3218.58s)]
*  So I know which real it is. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3220.54s)]
*  And then the 10 minutes of film is just one shot after another. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3222.06s)]
*  And I use almost every frame of those shots. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3227.34s)]
*  Cause I was cutting in the camera. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3229.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, after I shoot, like, let's say, you know, tell me your name. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3231.7000000000003s)]
*  Lex. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3235.5400000000004s)]
*  What's your last name? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3236.5800000000004s)]
*  Friedman. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3237.5800000000004s)]
*  Where do you live? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3238.5800000000004s)]
*  Austin, Texas. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3240.0200000000004s)]
*  I would do the whole scene. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3241.86s)]
*  Then I'll get the sound, bring the mic and close like that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3242.7000000000003s)]
*  Say it again. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3244.86s)]
*  Lex. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3245.5400000000004s)]
*  Friedman. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3246.9s)]
*  Austin, Texas. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3248.26s)]
*  That'll probably sink. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3249.2200000000003s)]
*  Now, if you were going on and on, there's a place where it'd go out of sync. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3250.6200000000003s)]
*  I hate rubbery lips. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3255.38s)]
*  So I would cut away to the dog or knife or to the girl. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3256.86s)]
*  And then I cut back when you're back in sync. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3261.7s)]
*  And since these were non-actors, they say everything the same way each time. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3263.42s)]
*  I would say their line, just like they weren't, they weren't performing it to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3267.58s)]
*  where they didn't remember how they performed to take before they were just [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3270.7400000000002s)]
*  talking in their own rhythm. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3272.58s)]
*  So a lot of the times it's the anytime you see anyone on camera talking, they're [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3274.02s)]
*  in sync with themselves and as soon as it cuts away, they're out of sync. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3278.3s)]
*  And it created this really fast cutting style that I probably wouldn't have had [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3281.66s)]
*  on such a low budget movie, but it was the only way to keep things in sync. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3285.1400000000003s)]
*  So when I would shoot two people talking, I would make sure I'd film a couple [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3287.94s)]
*  shots of like the dog or a stuffed cat or something, just so I'd have something [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3291.0600000000004s)]
*  to cut away to, to get them back in sync. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3295.46s)]
*  That's so brilliant. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3296.94s)]
*  It's, if I call it, it's just resourceful. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3297.82s)]
*  It's just being very resourceful. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3300.38s)]
*  You allow it to get maybe a little bit out of sync sometimes. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3301.94s)]
*  I didn't allow it, but I, oh yeah, I would let it, if I just didn't have a way to [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3304.6200000000003s)]
*  cut away and I would try to sync it as best I could. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3307.7000000000003s)]
*  But we, as the audience, like, do you understand where the threshold is? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3310.5400000000004s)]
*  Where we notice something. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3314.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3316.02s)]
*  It seems like you can get away with a lot. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3316.42s)]
*  You can get away with, I just don't, I'm just particular about that. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3318.1s)]
*  I just don't like seeing a dub movie where it just feels canned. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3321.86s)]
*  It makes you not believe in it anymore. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3325.6600000000003s)]
*  So I just cut away where the lips are just way off. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3327.82s)]
*  I just didn't want any of that. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3331.02s)]
*  I just felt like I wanted it to just be believable and they're, they could be [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3332.98s)]
*  really believable if they were in sync, but I didn't shoot two takes of film or [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3337.6600000000003s)]
*  even two takes of audio, but just one take, we just went to the end. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3341.1800000000003s)]
*  And what's cool is that because I just had them go through the whole scene again. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3344.22s)]
*  So I would go ahead and record them, like grabbing the bottle or any [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3349.18s)]
*  action they did, opening the suitcase. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3352.02s)]
*  I have all the sound effects too. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3353.3799999999997s)]
*  I just had to sync it by hand. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3354.66s)]
*  That's a lot of work for me, but I got great sound that way. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3356.18s)]
*  Cause if I had had a sync camera, the mic would have been so far, we wouldn't have, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3359.62s)]
*  we would have had to go get new sound effects, but because the camera is off, I [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3364.1s)]
*  could record everything close up. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3368.7s)]
*  So there was some blessing to that. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3370.5s)]
*  You, uh, and Quentin Tarantino had a great conversation about a lot of topics, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3372.46s)]
*  but one of them is how to bring out the best in the actors. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3376.02s)]
*  Like what in that El Mariachi, how do you bring out the best in these non-actors? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3378.7000000000003s)]
*  And then maybe what's the thread that connects to your future work too? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3383.54s)]
*  What really helped for those non-actors was that they just look across and, and [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3387.9s)]
*  it's me filming, they didn't feel like they're so they're being so natural. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3392.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think I, who played the bad guy, I met him in the research hospital where [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3396.1000000000004s)]
*  I was sold my body to science. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3399.02s)]
*  He was my bunk mate. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3400.74s)]
*  And I said, dude, you look kind of like Rudger Hauer. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3402.2999999999997s)]
*  And then it's like, we saw another movie, man, you look like James Spader. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3404.14s)]
*  Shit, you should be the bad guy in my movie. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3406.7s)]
*  And it'd be cool to have you as the bad guy. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3408.62s)]
*  He goes, but I don't speak Spanish. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3410.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's okay. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3411.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3411.7s)]
*  And I'll teach you phonetically and you're going to wear sunglasses. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3412.42s)]
*  And if you look close, he's holding the, he's holding the lines here and he's [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3415.8199999999997s)]
*  looking at the lines like that and just smiling so can't believe he's getting [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3419.5s)]
*  away with this, he's smiling and he's got the sunglasses on. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3423.8199999999997s)]
*  I read that somewhere in the pool. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3426.8599999999997s)]
*  There's like a scene in the pool. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3428.06s)]
*  He's like this. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3429.3799999999997s)]
*  With the sunglasses on with an, oh man. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3430.58s)]
*  But he was doing it phonetically. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3432.86s)]
*  And I tell you what, he was so great. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3435.1s)]
*  That guy, right? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3436.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3437.62s)]
*  When we do Desperado, I brought him back. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3438.02s)]
*  Didn't even have to do any dialogue. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3440.42s)]
*  Watch that movie when he shows up in the opening scene, Desperado, he's playing [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3442.34s)]
*  the guitar and the opening with the credits to tie it into the first movie. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3446.78s)]
*  He shows up again and all he has to do is light a cigarette and you see this. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3450.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3455.6600000000003s)]
*  Cause he's so nervous. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3456.2200000000003s)]
*  Cause now there's a crew behind me. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3457.3s)]
*  Now it's real. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3458.46s)]
*  Before it was just me and him and it didn't feel like a real movie. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3459.9s)]
*  So everyone gave a great performance. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3463.1s)]
*  So how do you recreate that later on? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3465.38s)]
*  A big movie is just building a report, making a safe zone for your actors. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3466.98s)]
*  Quentin once told me sometimes being, you know, we're talking about directing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3472.34s)]
*  You say, yeah, sometimes being a great director is just being a great audience. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3474.54s)]
*  You know, being a great audience for the, cause you're, you're the, you're taking [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3477.2200000000003s)]
*  the place of the audience for the actor. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3480.14s)]
*  They try something and if you're enjoying it, they know that the [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3481.86s)]
*  audience is going to enjoy it. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3484.34s)]
*  Or if you're, you know, makes you cry, you know, so sometimes you just, you [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3485.78s)]
*  don't have to tell them a lot sometimes. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3489.5s)]
*  And if you do have something very specific to tell them, they usually, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3491.54s)]
*  you know, go with it, but I always just like to see what they do. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3494.86s)]
*  And a lot of times they just are in the zone. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3498.34s)]
*  Cause again, they're, they're getting that flow too. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3500.54s)]
*  You create the right environment. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3502.62s)]
*  Everyone's getting this inspiration. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3503.82s)]
*  That's all tied together that you never could have directed. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3505.7s)]
*  It's just like, you just create that space where we're all going to be open to it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3509.06s)]
*  And it's going to drop in our lap. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3513.06s)]
*  And I'm going to point it out when it does, because you may not feel like [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3514.26s)]
*  you know how to play this role yet. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3517.94s)]
*  But I say not knowing is the other half of the battle and the more important part. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3520.38s)]
*  And part that's the part we're going to discover. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3523.94s)]
*  And when it happens, I'm going to point it out and it's going to be like magic. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3525.78s)]
*  And we're just going to go, okay, we're accepting it and we do it. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3528.34s)]
*  And it gets people in that kind of head space. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3530.54s)]
*  And then we're all open to it, to where the character is supposed to go with the, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3532.7s)]
*  what it's supposed to sound like instead of me being very, you know, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3536.58s)]
*  manipulated to get a certain thing. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3539.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3541.14s)]
*  It's, it's just whenever it feels good. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3541.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3543.18s)]
*  There's such an intimate connection between the actor and the director. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3543.46s)]
*  I've seen some of the behind the scenes footage with you. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3545.9s)]
*  You are just a fan enjoying the scene when it's done well. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3548.62s)]
*  But I think there's an aspect of our work to put myself in the headspace of the [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3551.82s)]
*  actor, they want you as the audience, like to earn that happiness, you know? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3554.86s)]
*  Cause when a director approves. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3559.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3561.38s)]
*  Well, you're a performer and you want, and there's no other, you know, it's [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3561.66s)]
*  not like a live show where you get the approval of the audience and you're like, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3564.38s)]
*  oh wow, they, they like that joke. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3566.98s)]
*  Let me do more. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3568.38s)]
*  You know, really the director is it. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3569.26s)]
*  And a lot of times the director's way behind a monitor somewhere. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3570.78s)]
*  That's why I still like to operate the camera. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3573.5s)]
*  Cause when I'm operating the camera, it's like this. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3575.06s)]
*  We can have a hundred people here. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3577.54s)]
*  We wouldn't know because they go away. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3578.7s)]
*  It's just us. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3580.5s)]
*  They just disappear when it's the camera guy is the director. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3581.8599999999997s)]
*  And we're going to do that again. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3585.58s)]
*  It's a shot in a, I'm lighting, since any of myself, there's a bad, my crew [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3586.46s)]
*  setting lights and I have a great shot of Clive Owen where he's holding down [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3590.94s)]
*  Benicio's head in the toilet, you know, but he's just not there. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3595.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just the closeup of him at this point. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3597.42s)]
*  And I'm practicing my shot. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3599.7s)]
*  I'm zooming and slow in his face and people are still walking behind him on [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3600.9s)]
*  the green screen, setting lights. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3604.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm rolling. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3605.34s)]
*  We're ready to go. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3606.46s)]
*  We're getting this. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3607.1000000000004s)]
*  I can already tell we're already in the moment. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3607.78s)]
*  What you're doing right now. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3609.7400000000002s)]
*  Just keep holding that look now. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3610.54s)]
*  One jolt like you're like, he's starting to fight back, but you don't even flinch. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3612.54s)]
*  Cut. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3616.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3616.46s)]
*  Nevermind. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3617.1000000000004s)]
*  You guys can stop moving. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3617.38s)]
*  That's true. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3618.2200000000003s)]
*  We already got, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3618.46s)]
*  that's a great scene by the way. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3623.02s)]
*  Great. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3624.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3624.82s)]
*  And it was, if I wait for these guys, this moment will be gone. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3625.1400000000003s)]
*  And then another one was Mickey work. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3629.54s)]
*  You know, he had so much freaking dialogue. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3631.02s)]
*  He had just done this whole big dialogue scene. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3633.2200000000003s)]
*  He had another one that said, let's go ahead and start with a wide shot. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3635.1s)]
*  Where the two actor, if I'm the camera, you know, Mickey and Elijah are here. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3639.5s)]
*  Let's get a two shot and we'll come around on Mickey closeup. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3643.54s)]
*  We don't, we'll turn Mickey around for the closeup. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's start with the wide thing. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3648.86s)]
*  Get used to the lines and most of it's going to be sold in a closeup. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3649.74s)]
*  We sit down. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3652.7799999999997s)]
*  Mickey starts delivering the take. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3653.18s)]
*  I'm like, hold on, hold on a second. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3655.42s)]
*  I brought my camera over zoom in. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3656.5s)]
*  Just suggest that light real quick. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3658.54s)]
*  Cause I'm the DP. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3659.66s)]
*  Cause if I had another director of photography, they'd be like, oh no, no, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3660.42s)]
*  we have to relight and all this stuff. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3662.74s)]
*  It's like, no, no, let's just do this. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3664.3s)]
*  This let's go. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3665.38s)]
*  He's doing it right now. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3666.2200000000003s)]
*  And I go and that performance is just right then. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3668.06s)]
*  And so you can feel that when you're also you're operating and you're the [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3670.9s)]
*  camera guy and you're the DP. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3676.1s)]
*  It's like high tech guerrilla filmmaking. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3677.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3679.9s)]
*  We're on a green screen, but it's like all the crew needs are, you know, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3680.06s)]
*  marching orders, just put a light back there, hitting them harder. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3684.34s)]
*  Like that's a, this is a five K make that a 10 K it's gotta be stronger. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3688.1800000000003s)]
*  They don't need to know that I'm going to make that a lamp post later. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3691.5s)]
*  They just need it marching orders for the moment. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3693.5s)]
*  So I can just kind of tell people do this, do this, do that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3695.5s)]
*  And then I know what I can accomplish with the actor and then everything else [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3698.18s)]
*  falls into place later, cause I'm going to put all that in later, you know, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3701.26s)]
*  things, once you know how to do a lot of jobs like that, you can just move at [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3703.82s)]
*  the speed of thought, which is where the actors love being creatively. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3707.54s)]
*  Cause they, nobody knew what green screen was back then. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3712.14s)]
*  They're like, what is this again? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3714.14s)]
*  So I explained it as well. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3715.78s)]
*  It's kind of like doing theater, but instead of a black curtain behind you [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3716.9s)]
*  with a prop, it'll be a green curtain and you might just have a cup or just [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3720.34s)]
*  a steering wheel, but it's just you and the other actors just like this. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3724.9s)]
*  And everything else will be painted in later. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3728.7400000000002s)]
*  We're just talking, we're locked in. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3731.1400000000003s)]
*  If we stay locked in, we'll look great when there's rain coming down [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3732.6600000000003s)]
*  and we're on a ship later, but it comes down to this, right. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3735.38s)]
*  And the more it was so fun to do those kinds of movies. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3739.1800000000003s)]
*  To this day, you try to be close to the action connected with the [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3741.86s)]
*  actor that's because it's like a dance. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3745.7400000000002s)]
*  You end up. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3747.58s)]
*  That's so like here. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3748.7000000000003s)]
*  I remember on dust till dawn, Michael parks in the opening scene. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3749.8199999999997s)]
*  He's talking about the two guys that are running around killing people [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3753.3399999999997s)]
*  just before he gets shot. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3758.06s)]
*  And there's a, I just start doing this slow zoom. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3759.4599999999996s)]
*  I remember this take eight, start doing the slow zoom on him. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3761.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, I hope I get all the way up to where it stopped zooming. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3765.02s)]
*  When he finishes that speech, cause there's no set way. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3769.5s)]
*  And I don't know how he's going to say it, but you're just locked almost [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3772.74s)]
*  telepathically and has these delivered. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3775.3799999999997s)]
*  There's no edits. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3777.7s)]
*  He's just going, yeah, they killed four Rangers, two hostages. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3778.34s)]
*  And you're just so pulled in. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3784.98s)]
*  I'm just like, oh my God. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3786.42s)]
*  And then it stopped. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3787.42s)]
*  It's like, I ran out of zoom, right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3788.2200000000003s)]
*  As he finished that speech. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3789.46s)]
*  So how can a director, cause there's a lot of great directors that stay in the. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3790.86s)]
*  In the bag. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3795.26s)]
*  I know it's hard. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3795.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, they just trust that whatever they get from their crew, they just, you [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3796.7400000000002s)]
*  just accept it just like, you know, you would get a take to there's so much. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3799.42s)]
*  But I like, I like that intimate connection because I could not be behind [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3801.94s)]
*  a monitor, even if I had communication with my cameraman, okay, now start [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3806.9s)]
*  zooming in, you're not going to know. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3810.58s)]
*  You have to feel it. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3812.46s)]
*  You have to be in there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3813.38s)]
*  It's like a dance. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3814.06s)]
*  It's like trying to do a dance with a partner and you're across the room. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3814.82s)]
*  You know, it's like, no, you got to be there up close feeling the energy. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3817.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's the creative spirits whispering to your both, you know, it's not your [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3821.62s)]
*  own idea, it's you're capturing a moment that's magic and there's true magic [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3825.6600000000003s)]
*  that happens on a set and that's what brings you back. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3829.54s)]
*  Cause you know, I didn't direct that and they didn't enact that. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3832.06s)]
*  That came through us and we just had the cameras rolling and we captured a ghost. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3836.5s)]
*  Just like you said, don't you have the pen in hand and you were there. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3841.06s)]
*  It's like that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3843.94s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3844.86s)]
*  All right. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3846.78s)]
*  Your friendship with Tarantino is just fascinating and just the whole timeline [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3847.06s)]
*  that the history of movies and the two of you collided and met is just a [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3850.54s)]
*  fascinating part of the story. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3854.62s)]
*  You first met them in 1992 at the Toronto film festival. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3856.06s)]
*  Can you, can you just talk about meeting Tarantino? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3860.34s)]
*  We both had films at the same time with first films, guys in black action violence. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3862.54s)]
*  In fact, I had seen his movie already. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3870.34s)]
*  My first film festival was a few months before that, the Telluride film festival [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3872.2200000000003s)]
*  and Reservoir Dogs was there, but Quentin couldn't be there. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3875.5s)]
*  He was at Sundance earlier that year and the guy who became my agent, he saw it [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3877.42s)]
*  and said, Hey, you're going to like this guy, Quentin Tarantino. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3881.82s)]
*  I told him about you. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3883.46s)]
*  You're going to meet him. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3884.1s)]
*  He's going to be in Toronto. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3884.98s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3885.86s)]
*  Cool. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3886.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3886.5s)]
*  And so I went ahead and saw his movie and Telluride and I was like, Holy [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3886.98s)]
*  shit, this guy's in black again, just like the Mariachis dressed in black and action. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3889.78s)]
*  And I said, Oh, we're going to like each other. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3894.9s)]
*  And he's going to like my movie. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3895.98s)]
*  So then in Toronto, we met and we met first on it because I knew I was going to be [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3897.82s)]
*  doing a panel discussion with him. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3901.46s)]
*  They asked us to do a panel discussion about violence and movies in the [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3903.5800000000004s)]
*  nineties, even though it was only 92. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3907.1400000000003s)]
*  So we're on a panel together and that's where I met him and he's like, Hey, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3910.38s)]
*  you're a virgin, you're Asian, tell me about you. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3913.5400000000004s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I saw your movie Reservoir Dogs and he goes, Oh, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3915.5400000000004s)]
*  well, you got to come to my screening. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3917.94s)]
*  And I'm going to come see yours. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3919.94s)]
*  So he came to Mariachi and I videotaped the audience reactions because they were [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3920.86s)]
*  insane, insane reactions to it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3924.82s)]
*  But I have the first screening. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3928.1400000000003s)]
*  He saw Mariachi sitting next to me laughing. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3930.42s)]
*  He's laughing and everything. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3933.6200000000003s)]
*  He was just the best audience. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3934.7400000000002s)]
*  I have his recording of the first time we saw Mariachi. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3936.42s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3938.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3939.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3939.6200000000003s)]
*  Cause I taped it. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3939.9s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3940.5800000000004s)]
*  He's so loud because he's right next to me. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3941.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, just like you, but even probably even more than you, he's a fan. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3943.1400000000003s)]
*  He watches, he just loves movies. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3947.34s)]
*  He loves movies. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3950.1000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the next time I heard him laugh that way was at his own premiere for [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3950.58s)]
*  Kill Bill. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3955.86s)]
*  We're watching Kill Bill and he's laughing like it's somebody else's movie. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3956.5s)]
*  He still enjoys the movie. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3959.82s)]
*  So he loves what all the actors did. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3961.3s)]
*  And it's like, that's the kind of energy you really love. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3964.06s)]
*  But I'll tell you what happened. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3966.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm not a very shy person, you know, very shy. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3968.78s)]
*  I'd have to go talk. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3971.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you probably feel like you're not an orator or anything. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3971.94s)]
*  You know, just have to go do it. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3975.3399999999997s)]
*  I thought, well, man, I'm going to have to introduce my film and talk about it [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3977.58s)]
*  afterwards. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3980.1s)]
*  I'm afraid of that. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3980.86s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3981.58s)]
*  I don't remember talking in front of more than five people before. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3982.22s)]
*  So I went to see this other movie and it was good. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3985.5s)]
*  And I was watching and then the director comes up at the end and he goes, yeah, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3989.02s)]
*  well, that was my movie. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3993.42s)]
*  And then, you know, here's the writer and it's like, oh man, I don't like the [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3994.42s)]
*  movie anymore. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3998.66s)]
*  This guy's kind of a dick. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=3999.06s)]
*  So I cannot do that. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4000.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to have to go be who they imagine made that movie. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4002.7s)]
*  So I wrote out my whole intro. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4007.2999999999997s)]
*  It was like a 20 minute intro because no one had ever heard of anybody making a [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4009.66s)]
*  movie for no money, much less about a crew, much less. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4013.22s)]
*  You know, the way I did it was just very new. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4017.7s)]
*  Nobody knew it was possible. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4020.66s)]
*  So my whole intro is like, you'll see the Columbia logo slapped in front. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4022.7799999999997s)]
*  It's probably cost more than the whole movie. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4027.2599999999998s)]
*  And then I go through, this is how I made it with a wheelchair for a dolly, a [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4029.5s)]
*  turtle, you know, I wrote around things I had. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4032.9799999999996s)]
*  I mentioned the turtle, the pit bull, the bus, the ranch, all that stuff. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4035.3399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4039.02s)]
*  So then when they see the movie, in fact, I think my wife was in the audience. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4039.58s)]
*  She said at Sundance, people were laughing so much at your intro. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4042.9399999999996s)]
*  They just wanted to hear a story like this. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4046.3799999999997s)]
*  So badly, I heard someone next to me say, I'm going to vote for his movie. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4048.1s)]
*  They hadn't even seen the movie just because the story was so good. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4051.06s)]
*  They wanted that movie to be great. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4054.2999999999997s)]
*  And when they see the turtle, big cheers. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4056.14s)]
*  When they see the pit bull, big cheers. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4060.18s)]
*  When they see the school bus, cheers. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4062.18s)]
*  But then when they see how we use it and he slams into it and falls in it, they [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4064.54s)]
*  fricking lose their minds because they know how I put it together. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4068.02s)]
*  They know that the rubber bands and the popsicle sticks, I already set it up. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4071.1s)]
*  And so that's why that audience, I just hate the reaction. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4075.7s)]
*  They're so with it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4078.8199999999997s)]
*  The context is so key. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4080.66s)]
*  Like you can watch Mariachi and go, Hey, yeah, this looks like a $7,000 movie. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4082.34s)]
*  But when you know the story behind it, suddenly I was curious. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4087.0200000000004s)]
*  I hadn't seen it in a long time. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4090.26s)]
*  I was watching it for the 20th anniversary. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4091.1000000000004s)]
*  We did a screening and the first few shots come up and I'm like, Oh yeah, well, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4093.2200000000003s)]
*  it looks like a $7,000 movie. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4097.26s)]
*  And then it keeps going. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4099.18s)]
*  And it's in the, once we're in the jail cell and the shooting's happening and I [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4100.14s)]
*  realized, Oh my God, we had these blanks that only fired one shot and it would jam. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4103.58s)]
*  So I had to show it going, use the sound effect, cut to the other guy, cut back [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4109.9400000000005s)]
*  to have another one go. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4115.14s)]
*  I had to do these editing tricks to make it look like, and then repeat a few [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4116.34s)]
*  frames so it goes, so it looks like a machine gun, all these stuff that I'm [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4119.1s)]
*  start sweating as I'm watching it going. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4123.02s)]
*  I can't believe I made this movie with that freaking camera. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4125.14s)]
*  I don't know how I did. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4127.9400000000005s)]
*  I couldn't even see I'm there with this long lens, pulling my own focus. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4128.900000000001s)]
*  When I finally had to do a real movie, I was operating the camera on my first [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4133.1s)]
*  real movie with a crew. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4137.3s)]
*  I get the camera and a guy comes over and he focuses for you. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4138.62s)]
*  That's your job. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4143.9400000000005s)]
*  You focus. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4144.54s)]
*  Shit. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4145.06s)]
*  I had to do my own focusing on the last movie. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4145.26s)]
*  I didn't have so hard. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4147.54s)]
*  You're trying to focus on a guy while you're filming. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4149.02s)]
*  You don't know where you are. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4151.900000000001s)]
*  And it's just, I was, couldn't believe how much easier it is when you have a [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4153.46s)]
*  crew. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4156.9400000000005s)]
*  It's extremely valuable to know that the pain of that, the spectrum of creativity [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4157.34s)]
*  that's allowed within that, even just the focusing, like how focusing fucks up. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4163.1s)]
*  I know all the cameras and your cameras. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4167.74s)]
*  What, what are the different artifacts that come up just to know the battlefield? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4169.38s)]
*  In order to be a great general, you have to know how to be a soldier on the [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4173.900000000001s)]
*  battlefield. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4176.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4176.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4177.06s)]
*  It's good to know all that stuff, but you know, it's like the end of the day, you [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4177.3s)]
*  could shoot something on a phone. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4181.14s)]
*  And if you have a great story, no one's going to even notice somebody. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4182.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, we shot that on a phone. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4185.06s)]
*  And I noticed, you know, so sometimes people get caught up on what kind of [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4186.1s)]
*  camera should I have this? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4189.06s)]
*  It's not the camera. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4189.820000000001s)]
*  That's just the tool. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4191.1s)]
*  That's just the pen. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4192.02s)]
*  That's just like, yeah, you can have different paint brushes, but you can go, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4193.22s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to limit my palette. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4196.58s)]
*  I'm only going to use a fan brush and a detail brush, and I'm going to make a [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4198.58s)]
*  painting. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4202.02s)]
*  Do you think that painting is going to suffer? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4202.9s)]
*  No, it's going to take on an identity that you wouldn't have had if you had [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4204.1s)]
*  all the other tools. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4206.74s)]
*  So sometimes the limitations help you because when you can do anything, you [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4207.86s)]
*  come, that can be crippling. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4211.86s)]
*  When I knew I could only use those things for mariachi, it's like, all right, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4213.5s)]
*  well, it's very, it's very simple now. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4216.54s)]
*  Let me show you how cheap skater I was. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4218.38s)]
*  Like I did not spend on anything. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4219.78s)]
*  So when you see him walking around with a guitar case, it's a shitty cardboard [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4221.9400000000005s)]
*  one, you know, like I got from home. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4225.62s)]
*  I had to get a heavier one to put the guns in. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4228.0199999999995s)]
*  So we borrowed one, but it had this material ripped off the top. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4230.5s)]
*  So you could see the wood. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4235.86s)]
*  It was just the wood on top. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4237.26s)]
*  So it didn't match the other one because it wasn't all black and I was too cheap [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4238.22s)]
*  to paint it black. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4241.34s)]
*  I didn't want to spend money on paint. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4242.5s)]
*  So you see that cardboard case, he puts it down and when he goes to open it, I [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4244.3s)]
*  cut to the other one. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4249.3s)]
*  Once the wood is, is watch the edits. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4250.74s)]
*  You'll see it open. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4254.14s)]
*  Now it's a completely different case with the guns. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4254.900000000001s)]
*  And when he goes to cut it, it wouldn't close it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4256.780000000001s)]
*  It cuts to the other one. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4259.02s)]
*  And he goes up. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4260.620000000001s)]
*  That's how I did that whole movie. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4261.1s)]
*  Again, it was a practice. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4262.660000000001s)]
*  So I don't want to waste any money on it. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4263.58s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be able to, I won't be able to make five bucks from [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4265.780000000001s)]
*  it. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4268.3s)]
*  Yeah, but you're one of the, one of the few great directors where both the [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4268.860000000001s)]
*  movies genius and the process of making it as creative genius. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4274.38s)]
*  It's like fun to watch both, to know of both. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4278.38s)]
*  You know what I believe, right? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4280.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's from somewhere else. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4282.700000000001s)]
*  I have to say that thing is freaking, I didn't get in its way. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4284.1s)]
*  This is basically what helps. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4288.9400000000005s)]
*  And people say that, you know, don't get in your own way. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4290.660000000001s)]
*  This is a little bit easier to understand. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4293.58s)]
*  It's like, keep the pipe clear. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4295.34s)]
*  Don't block it with your ego. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4297.26s)]
*  Don't say you're going to be shocked, but don't ever say, Oh shit, how do I do [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4298.780000000001s)]
*  that? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4302.740000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I can do that. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4302.900000000001s)]
*  You didn't do it to begin with, except that it just came through you and try to [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4303.660000000001s)]
*  get back into that head space, especially when you go to make a second film or a [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4307.18s)]
*  third film or follow up a success. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4310.3s)]
*  That's when artists get really crippled. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4312.82s)]
*  Cause sometimes they start tiptoeing around as an artist going like, Oh shit, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4315.179999999999s)]
*  now it's my second film. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4318.099999999999s)]
*  My first one did really well. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4319.219999999999s)]
*  They might not like my second one so much. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4321.0599999999995s)]
*  That's not the head space you were in when you made the first one. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4323.94s)]
*  You weren't hesitant like that. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4326.299999999999s)]
*  You were just, so try to keep that very naive. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4327.94s)]
*  And that's why I say commit to a body of work. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4330.86s)]
*  Cause I know a lot of filmmakers get stuck on their second one and then go [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4333.099999999999s)]
*  further because they get crippled by the success of the first one. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4335.62s)]
*  And they start asking, Oh shit, how did I do that? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4338.78s)]
*  How can I do that again? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4340.9s)]
*  And you get deeper and deeper in a hole you can't get out of. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4341.98s)]
*  I think you've spoken about that filmmakers, especially early on in their [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4344.98s)]
*  journey, critics and the audience can destroy them, meaning like it creates [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4347.98s)]
*  too much of a burden, too much. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4353.5s)]
*  Uh, just wear them down to where they're almost scared to be creative. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4356.099999999999s)]
*  Can you just speak to that? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4360.0599999999995s)]
*  How to ignore the critic? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4360.9s)]
*  I'll tell you something that I, my best advice ever got early on. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4362.0599999999995s)]
*  I was so fortunate from an unlikely place. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4365.66s)]
*  Um, because he's such a, he sounded like Clint Eastwood when he said, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4369.5s)]
*  it was funny when you said that. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4372.74s)]
*  But I got, uh, I did Desperado and had Antonio Bandera's, I brought [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4375.14s)]
*  Antonio to be in it from Europe, big action movie. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4379.3s)]
*  And so Spielberg saw it and he said, um, Hey, I want you to do Zorro with Antonio. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4383.54s)]
*  So we're working on it for a while. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4389.26s)]
*  I did, I was working on the pre-production. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4390.54s)]
*  Got to work with Spielberg doing that. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4392.3s)]
*  It ended up stalling me as the, there was like two studios involved in [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4393.5s)]
*  Amblin was moving or it was some weird thing. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4396.82s)]
*  But I got to work with him for about five months. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4398.7s)]
*  And I started getting really nervous because it's like, Oh shit. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4401.099999999999s)]
*  You start thinking about even movies of his that people would say, Oh, you know, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4404.58s)]
*  temple of doom is not as good as Raiders. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4407.9s)]
*  Have you seen temple of doom? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4409.22s)]
*  I'd be killed if I can do that movie. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4410.82s)]
*  If I can make Zorro as good as that one, the one that people said, it's like, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4413.099999999999s)]
*  people don't know how good they had it with that guy. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4417.0199999999995s)]
*  But I started thinking, I even said, man, I just rewatched temple of doom last night. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4419.58s)]
*  I don't know how I'm going to do this Zorro movie. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4423.78s)]
*  Like I'm just never going to do it. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4425.66s)]
*  I'm going to do the Zorro movie. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4426.9s)]
*  Like, I'm just never done anything like that. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4428.0599999999995s)]
*  You start getting, you know, afraid because you go the second thing he said, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4430.179999999999s)]
*  all right, just, just, just, you're going to do fine. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4435.099999999999s)]
*  But then I started thinking, God, this guy at that time, you know, know the era, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4438.0599999999995s)]
*  but this was like midnighties. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4442.66s)]
*  He was making the biggest, best movies of all. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4445.74s)]
*  And people would shit all over this guy. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4448.58s)]
*  They would throw so much. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4450.299999999999s)]
*  They were so jealous. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4451.259999999999s)]
*  Press audience. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4453.0599999999995s)]
*  Everyone was just like hits at him. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4454.46s)]
*  Just throwing rocks at him for everything. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4455.9800000000005s)]
*  Spielberg. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4457.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4458.62s)]
*  You can't imagine it now. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4458.9800000000005s)]
*  You had to been at that time. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4460.26s)]
*  Now everyone has respect for him, but they made him run a fucking gauntlet. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4462.66s)]
*  And they were like drastic power. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4467.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4468.78s)]
*  There's the, you can't even imagine it now, but you should have seen the climate. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4469.1s)]
*  It freaked me out. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4472.5s)]
*  Cause I'm like, maybe I should just stay under the radar where I've been, you [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4473.38s)]
*  know, not poke my head out so much. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4477.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4479.7s)]
*  Cause this guy has a head out and they're unwarranted. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4480.1s)]
*  So you can't even fathom it now. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4484.219999999999s)]
*  Cause you weren't here at that time. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4485.78s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4487.099999999999s)]
*  You would never even think of him that way. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4487.9s)]
*  I I'm glad it changed because back then it was just, it made people [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4489.7s)]
*  not want to be successful. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4492.86s)]
*  And I made me be worried. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4495.219999999999s)]
*  Like maybe I shouldn't be go making a movie that has his name on it. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4496.86s)]
*  That's going to put my head out in a whole different realm of [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4499.9s)]
*  filmmaking at a studio level. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4501.94s)]
*  Cause if I make it, even if I make a good movie, if I make a great movie, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4505.0199999999995s)]
*  he's making great movies. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4508.179999999999s)]
*  He's getting this dog shit. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4509.259999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I could take it, you know? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4511.099999999999s)]
*  So I asked him, cause you don't know how resilient you can be. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4513.099999999999s)]
*  So I said, damn it, pan, how do you do it? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4516.94s)]
*  How do you, how do you, what do you do when people just throw [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4519.86s)]
*  rocks at you all day long? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4523.58s)]
*  He goes, Oh Robert, you just don't blink. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4527.139999999999s)]
*  And I was like, Whoa, now I see how he got through it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4530.139999999999s)]
*  Just don't blink. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4535.099999999999s)]
*  Just like, you know, it's coming. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4535.94s)]
*  Don't blink. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4539.46s)]
*  And to him say it's like a Clint Eastwood line, right? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4540.0199999999995s)]
*  But it was like, you could see he was telling the truth and you [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4542.26s)]
*  could see that's how he did it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4546.38s)]
*  He just avoided all criticism by just not blinking. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4548.34s)]
*  It's like, it's designed to make you blink and you're just not going to [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4552.700000000001s)]
*  blink because you're committing to a body of work. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4555.5s)]
*  He just keeps cranking out movies, whatever he feels like doing, he does. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4557.34s)]
*  And that was like the most, and it never bothered me again. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4561.620000000001s)]
*  I just like always kept that in mind. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4564.26s)]
*  I tell that to my actors. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4565.580000000001s)]
*  I tell that people that story has traveled. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4566.740000000001s)]
*  I even had some little actors who were like starting to get up and I said, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4569.860000000001s)]
*  remember, tell you a couple of things. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4572.9800000000005s)]
*  Some people have told me you're never as good as people say you are. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4575.26s)]
*  And it never is bad either. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4578.660000000001s)]
*  So I remember that. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4581.540000000001s)]
*  And then the second one, Spielberg don't blink. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4582.26s)]
*  Don't blink. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4586.3s)]
*  But there has to be a kind of vision for yourself of what, what, what you're [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4587.860000000001s)]
*  reaching for, what you're trying to do. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4592.660000000001s)]
*  Again. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4595.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4596.38s)]
*  So sort of, sort of like, I think if you told me what would be my vision for the [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4597.0199999999995s)]
*  future, just committing to a body of work, which I've just kept doing, like [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4601.5s)]
*  that's, that's about as far as you can see. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4604.5s)]
*  Do you have a sense, do you have a vision of the body of work you'll [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4606.299999999999s)]
*  make in the next 20 years? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4610.179999999999s)]
*  Like, or is it just this fog? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4611.299999999999s)]
*  Like I wasn't sure because you don't always know what the view might not have [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4613.139999999999s)]
*  the vision yet, because you don't have the information yet. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4616.0599999999995s)]
*  So if you just commit to a body of work, you'll start figuring out more [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4618.099999999999s)]
*  reasons to keep doing that body of work. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4621.0199999999995s)]
*  So when I turned 50, I was like, I guess I could just keep making movies. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4622.98s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's been good for me. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4628.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4630.46s)]
*  I guess I could just make more. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4631.22s)]
*  I kind of done that already, but it's always fun and it's always new. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4632.3s)]
*  And I guess I could make, but it wasn't a lot of drive, right? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4636.3s)]
*  It's not, it's like, well, I guess I could just keep doing the body. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4639.58s)]
*  You know, that's not as much as I can't wait to keep doing another season. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4642.58s)]
*  But I didn't know how to get to that point. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4646.42s)]
*  So I thought, you know what? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4648.54s)]
*  I got to this job so early. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4650.139999999999s)]
*  I was in the early twenties. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4651.86s)]
*  I bet there's some other job out there that exists that I don't even know about. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4654.179999999999s)]
*  Cause I don't know other jobs. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4657.259999999999s)]
*  So I looked up, you know, and believe it, but I literally bought jobs for dummies. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4658.82s)]
*  Nice. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4662.9s)]
*  It was just like, I don't even know what I do for basic jobs. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4663.5s)]
*  We went out there turning the page. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4666.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4667.5s)]
*  Don't want that job. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4667.9s)]
*  Don't want that job. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4668.62s)]
*  Don't want that job. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4669.219999999999s)]
*  I was just going through and it gets to filmmaker and there's [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4669.74s)]
*  a little icon, but tight each job. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4672.74s)]
*  This icon is a guy like this. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4674.62s)]
*  Literally you're looking up and it says, this is the best job ever. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4677.259999999999s)]
*  You get to just be creative with your friends, sit back and watch the [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4681.18s)]
*  money roll in across the desk. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4684.74s)]
*  And I said, but 99% of film students don't get this job. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4687.1s)]
*  So give up that dream. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4691.1s)]
*  I guess I got the best job. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4693.22s)]
*  But then I started working with my kids when we did, uh, I had a TV show [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4694.94s)]
*  called rebel without a crew based on that, right? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4699.9s)]
*  I found filmmakers that only made a short film. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4702.38s)]
*  They hadn't made a feature. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4704.06s)]
*  I picked this diverse group of filmmakers, gave them $7,000 and we documented [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4704.94s)]
*  them making a feature two weeks. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4709.86s)]
*  Like I did, you can bring one person, like I had Carlos guy out of the producer [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4711.86s)]
*  and star of mariachi bring one person to be your cameraman, we can be your sound [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4715.42s)]
*  guy, whatever, but it's only that for the shoot and you'd have to do the whole thing. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4718.82s)]
*  And I saw those guys by the time they're, they're like, I don't know how [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4722.94s)]
*  we're going to make this movie by the first week of shooting. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4726.339999999999s)]
*  They're already talking about their next feature. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4728.42s)]
*  And they became so confident because their idea of what impossible is drops [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4730.099999999999s)]
*  really quick when you take anyone interested in unlocking their [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4734.38s)]
*  creativities, not even just filmmaking. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4737.86s)]
*  I highly recommend that show. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4739.78s)]
*  And I highly recommend this to kind of the follow on show, which is where you make red. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4741.5s)]
*  11. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4746.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4747.339999999999s)]
*  So that's the one I did. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4747.54s)]
*  So then it came time for me to do one. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4748.38s)]
*  So I made a movie called red 11 based on my experiences in the medical hospital, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4750.259999999999s)]
*  but I'll turn it into a sci-fi thriller just to use that as, so then I can use [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4754.98s)]
*  like somebody getting stabbed in the eye. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4758.66s)]
*  So I can still gonna have more elements to show how you can do camera tricks and [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4760.139999999999s)]
*  stuff with no money. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4763.78s)]
*  And the old days make it for less than $7,000, which I think we're like $5,000. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4764.82s)]
*  Um, mainly because we had a lot of actors I wanted to pay. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4769.5s)]
*  Um, but the movies itself can make it for nothing. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4772.38s)]
*  But I brought my son aboard as my number one, who hadn't been working with me in [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4775.18s)]
*  a while, I mean, he wrote shark point, Lavargo and he was seven, but then he [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4779.3s)]
*  hadn't really been working on my crew. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4782.22s)]
*  So he didn't know how to operate the sound equipment, the separate sound [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4784.26s)]
*  system and all that I didn't show them until the day of filming. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4787.06s)]
*  Cause I knew we're documenting it. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4789.46s)]
*  It would make a better tutorial. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4790.9800000000005s)]
*  So by getting them working on the movies together, they came to be super [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4792.900000000001s)]
*  excited by the end of the day. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4797.54s)]
*  I thought for sure, Oh, they're going to hate this. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4798.54s)]
*  Even though it's only two weeks, they've got other interests. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4800.06s)]
*  They don't want to be filmmakers. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4802.7s)]
*  I thought they were going to be like, all right, I'm out of here after one day. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4804.74s)]
*  But instead he came to me and his brother who acted in it. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4808.46s)]
*  And he went, dad, the actor didn't show up after the first day. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4811.78s)]
*  The location didn't match the script at all. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4816.66s)]
*  We asked you how we were going to solve the problems. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4819.46s)]
*  And you're like, I don't know, figure it out. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4821.34s)]
*  We thought that stumped for once. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4823.06s)]
*  He's he's stumped finally, but then by the end of the day, his eyes were all wide. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4825.26s)]
*  We figured it out. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4830.46s)]
*  They went, Oh, they don't realize this is the creative process. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4831.38s)]
*  Every day is like that. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4833.66s)]
*  And in life too, every day, you don't know your machine's going to not work [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4835.18s)]
*  or you're going to get a flat tire or you get fired that day. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4839.42s)]
*  So life is very unpredictable, just like a movie set. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4842.42s)]
*  So I realized I'm going to make them all work on my movies now because it's [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4846.3s)]
*  teaching them about life. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4850.66s)]
*  I'm teaching them very little about the film. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4851.7s)]
*  It's about life lessons, about how you take on something impossible, turn chicken [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4855.18s)]
*  shit to chicken salad and make it work. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4858.82s)]
*  And that's the strong, that's life. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4861.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the process of life. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4862.66s)]
*  So many people say, well, I'm not ready to make my projects. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4864.26s)]
*  Like you're not ready for life either. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4866.86s)]
*  You're like this all day. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4868.22s)]
*  You're you're dodging shit that's going on. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4869.82s)]
*  How come art has to be perfect? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4871.98s)]
*  It's like, it should be the same life and art should be the same. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4873.78s)]
*  And I think filmmaking in general is full of unpredictable things. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4876.18s)]
*  And in a short little microcosm too, within one project, you've got a whole [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4881.22s)]
*  blueprint for how you're going to solve life because you've just done it on a [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4885.06s)]
*  creative level. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4888.42s)]
*  I think of all the art forms of all the art mediums like that, it just has so [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4889.3s)]
*  many different components. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4892.820000000001s)]
*  A lot of components to it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4893.740000000001s)]
*  And so like there's so many ways to fuck things up to learn from. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4895.1s)]
*  But any of the disciplines, if you add those to it, like I teach my actors to [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4898.42s)]
*  paint in between takes, we'll go and we'll, I'll take a picture of them in [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4903.14s)]
*  character. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4908.38s)]
*  I show them a canvas. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4909.34s)]
*  I show them paint. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4910.3s)]
*  You don't need to know how to paint. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4910.9400000000005s)]
*  This is to show you the brush is going to know where to go. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4912.700000000001s)]
*  You just got to pick it up, pick the colors you want. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4914.9800000000005s)]
*  Doesn't matter how crazy they are, whatever's speaking to you. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4917.26s)]
*  You lay it down. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4919.860000000001s)]
*  I'll show you some of the pictures. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4920.42s)]
*  You're not going to believe the masterworks these actors did like in a [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4921.620000000001s)]
*  day, they just start doing it. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4924.18s)]
*  Lady Gaga had her fingernails in there. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4926.620000000001s)]
*  You know, Josh Brolin's doing his thing. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4928.34s)]
*  Then I take a picture of them in character, do a line drawing of it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4930.18s)]
*  We projected on top and mostly it's the painting coming through their line [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4932.62s)]
*  drawing with a little bit of their eyes painted in. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4935.46s)]
*  You're not going to believe these things. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4937.0199999999995s)]
*  They couldn't believe it, but it teaches them that that thing about that, the [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4938.54s)]
*  creative duties going to come through. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4942.74s)]
*  So even though they're already acting, they're already being creative. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4944.26s)]
*  We're already making a movie. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4946.82s)]
*  Like you said, that's already a really great creative endeavor. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4947.7s)]
*  When we would sneak off and paint, you could tell it's firing a whole [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4950.18s)]
*  other part of their brain. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4954.38s)]
*  Um, it was funny. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4956.74s)]
*  I think, uh, Josh Brolin's girlfriend said, Josh said, Hey, my [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4957.62s)]
*  girlfriend just said, she said his wife now, but time, are you guys doing drugs? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4962.34s)]
*  You'd leave the set and you come back and you're all like, no, we're painting. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4968.82s)]
*  We're painting. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4973.58s)]
*  But that makes sense. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4974.06s)]
*  Did you say that? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4974.74s)]
*  Cause it creates, when you get your creativity firing, it's more powerful [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4975.22s)]
*  than any drug and we would come back and he'd be on the set going, is it bad [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4978.38s)]
*  that I'm still thinking about the painting? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4983.66s)]
*  They know, I think it's good. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4985.14s)]
*  I think it's all good, but it's, you can tell us opening a whole other [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4986.02s)]
*  part of their creative brain. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4989.06s)]
*  So you can be doing acting in a movie and the painting is still going to [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4990.42s)]
*  tap, it shows how much untapped potential your creative brain has. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4994.14s)]
*  So the more you can do, the more you're firing off and it was so cool. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=4997.700000000001s)]
*  Like I remember we did one with Joseph Gore Levitt was painting. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5001.740000000001s)]
*  We came in and the table was like this. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5004.660000000001s)]
*  And they said, we have a problem. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5006.54s)]
*  You want them to throw the cards out, the playing cards out, but it's so [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5008.1s)]
*  slick, they go sliding off the table. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5011.700000000001s)]
*  And we both look at it and we both got the solution at the same time. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5014.06s)]
*  Oh, we just, just, just, uh, haven't just haven't thrown them. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5016.660000000001s)]
*  Wherever they go and then we'll place them. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5020.38s)]
*  And then digitally it's even better that he looks like he gets them all perfectly [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5023.34s)]
*  laid out to show what a card shark is. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5027.9800000000005s)]
*  That's, but that's what we have to do. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5029.860000000001s)]
*  They've been, I'm going to, we can't be here all day. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5031.22s)]
*  We're trying to get, if we're going to worry about where they go, just go bump, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5033.780000000001s)]
*  bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5037.06s)]
*  And then we'll place the cards down and everyone will pick them up. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5038.22s)]
*  And then we'll marry the two and post, you know, you just, you just come up [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5042.06s)]
*  with creative solutions better, easier because you were just solving crazy, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5045.740000000001s)]
*  creative solutions in the other one. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5049.9s)]
*  Like what paint medium do I use? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5051.139999999999s)]
*  What kind of gel am I going to use? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5052.78s)]
*  So when you come back to your main job, which is filmmaking, you're like, Oh, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5054.66s)]
*  I can figure this out in two seconds. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5057.86s)]
*  You know, so it helps you create a problem solve. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5059.86s)]
*  So that's basically working with my kids made me realize, Oh, now I know exactly [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5061.7s)]
*  what I want to do for the next 10 years. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5065.259999999999s)]
*  I only want to make movies with my kids because I'm mentoring them, but they're [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5066.94s)]
*  teaching me shit because they're the age I was when I made Mariachi and Desperado. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5069.78s)]
*  And their, their ideas are really sharp. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5074.58s)]
*  So the mentoring goes both ways. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5076.42s)]
*  And it's like the greatest parenting you can do because you're building a project [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5078.0199999999995s)]
*  together and in the same boat together, figuring it out and it's family time. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5082.099999999999s)]
*  You're like checking all the boxes. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5086.5s)]
*  So I thought my filmmaking going forward is going to be checking all the boxes in [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5087.7s)]
*  life. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5091.58s)]
*  So I'm not, not spending time with my family. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5091.82s)]
*  We're actually giving them lessons that they can go do anything they want in the [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5093.98s)]
*  life, because they're going to have different interests. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5097.62s)]
*  But now it's kind of like going to college and this college is like the best [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5099.7s)]
*  college because it pays you to learn. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5102.9s)]
*  You get to do these crazy skills. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5105.0199999999995s)]
*  Like my son is, you know, conducting the orchestra, the James Bond orchestra in [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5106.66s)]
*  London for the spy kids score and a score he wrote, because I can't write at his [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5111.5s)]
*  level because he was always our best piano player and they get, you get the [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5115.74s)]
*  charge out of working with them. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5120.34s)]
*  And then, and by making a label, there's a, there's a weird phenomenon that happens. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5122.42s)]
*  If you guys want to take your game to another level, I stumbled upon this idea. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5127.7s)]
*  My son, that was my counterpart on that movie racer. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5132.219999999999s)]
*  He was my sound guy. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5136.38s)]
*  Like I said, came up with shark, my lava girl on these little, he became my writer, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5137.66s)]
*  co-writer, co-producer. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5141.74s)]
*  He had come to me and said, I want to do VR type movie. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5143.34s)]
*  And I said, Oh, well, let me show you as an example of creativity and manifesting. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5149.139999999999s)]
*  I said, let me show you how it works. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5152.98s)]
*  Let's, let's make a company. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5154.54s)]
*  We'll make a company called double R double R productions. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5156.179999999999s)]
*  Cause we all have a double our names, all the kids. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5159.5s)]
*  So if anyone ever wants to do anything, we can use our company. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5161.58s)]
*  So let's make a logo and I'll make t-shirts and notepads and stuff. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5164.14s)]
*  Cause once you have a company, you have now have to make things for that company. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5168.3s)]
*  Just like the advice I gave to people, stop aspiring, make a business card that [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5172.82s)]
*  says writer, director, cinematographer. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5175.78s)]
*  I did editor. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5178.22s)]
*  Cause then now you have to conform to that identity. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5179.14s)]
*  So now if I create a label like double R, we're going to come up with ideas. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5181.42s)]
*  We'll call up VR companies and say, Hey, we have a company, a VR company. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5185.42s)]
*  Would you like us to make you a film for your, sell your headsets? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5189.219999999999s)]
*  So yeah, they gave us a budget. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5192.62s)]
*  They they they're dying for content. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5194.0199999999995s)]
*  They gave us a budget. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5196.299999999999s)]
*  We shot a 20 minute action movie called the limit with Michelle Rodriguez and Norman [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5197.0599999999995s)]
*  Reedus where you're in an action movie with them and it was killer. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5201.0199999999995s)]
*  We, they made us a big double R logo, animated logo. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5203.9s)]
*  Later that year we did red 11, same logo. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5208.139999999999s)]
*  That movie went to directors, fortnight and can festivals were paying us to come [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5211.78s)]
*  talk about how we made that movie. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5217.339999999999s)]
*  That's when we're doing the cards, throwing the cards out because they [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5218.66s)]
*  wanted their audiences. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5222.26s)]
*  They knew they would love that. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5223.34s)]
*  So we could have had a whole gig just continuing to get paid to go to the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5224.82s)]
*  fed usually paid if I'd go to the fed, you don't get paid. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5228.099999999999s)]
*  That's how, what a success that was. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5230.78s)]
*  But then we had to make, we can be heroes. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5233.26s)]
*  So we had to stop, but we can be heroes was a Netflix movie where they asked me [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5235.7s)]
*  to make a spy kids type thing. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5239.98s)]
*  And so I thought, Oh, okay, I'll just do it with superheroes. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5241.98s)]
*  That's their, I wrote it with my kids. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5244.94s)]
*  Based it on some of their personalities. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5247.0199999999995s)]
*  It's the most watched and rewatched movie in Netflix history. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5249.62s)]
*  Like nothing in touch it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5253.38s)]
*  Cause kids just keep watching it over. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5254.58s)]
*  Cause this kids with superpowers, no one's ever done that before. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5256.26s)]
*  And they can't, they couldn't believe it. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5259.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I'd heard anecdotally, that's how the spy kids, people said, Oh, that kids [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5260.62s)]
*  watch it over and over on video, but you can't keep track of that. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5264.42s)]
*  You can't on Netflix. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5267.0199999999995s)]
*  Cause their biggest thing is people completing the movie. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5268.38s)]
*  A lot of people don't complete a movie and it still counts as a view. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5270.82s)]
*  They may watch five minutes and change the channel. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5273.26s)]
*  So do you complete a movie? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5275.42s)]
*  That's really where they, you know, really value, not only [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5277.1s)]
*  do they complete, but rewatched, rewatched, rewatched per household. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5280.3s)]
*  So many times that that one has a double R logo as well. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5283.620000000001s)]
*  And my kids are like, dad, it really worked. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5288.34s)]
*  I was like, I know better than I thought. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5291.860000000001s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5293.22s)]
*  I didn't know that me manifesting that company was going to turn into that. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5294.1s)]
*  And we've just keep making stuff. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5298.46s)]
*  So I want to do that with brass knuckle films now with the audience. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5299.780000000001s)]
*  Cause it works. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5302.820000000001s)]
*  So I said, as soon as you have a logo and a company, your brain starts [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5304.139999999999s)]
*  coming up with all kinds of ideas and it's a filter. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5309.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, like I said, sometimes the freedom of limitations is all freeing. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5312.54s)]
*  When I had to do four rooms and it's like, we have to use one hotel room. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5317.98s)]
*  Oh, well then there's going to be a dead body. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5321.0599999999995s)]
*  There's going to be, you can do a lot with limitations. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5322.46s)]
*  If they said you could use the whole city, it would have been harder [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5325.099999999999s)]
*  to come up with something. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5326.86s)]
*  Well, brass knuckle films has a filter only action action movies. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5328.5s)]
*  Cause that's the stuff that there's always an appetite for. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5332.78s)]
*  If you ask Netflix right now, what do you need more of? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5335.78s)]
*  They'll say action, action, action. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5338.38s)]
*  We don't have enough action. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5339.78s)]
*  The last regime didn't leave us enough action. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5340.94s)]
*  We need action. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5342.62s)]
*  They'll pay a premium for an action film that we can make at a lower cost. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5343.34s)]
*  A $20 million action film is very cheap. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5346.78s)]
*  Studios don't know how to make them that cheap. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5350.0599999999995s)]
*  That's why they'll pay for an independent to go do it. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5352.099999999999s)]
*  And right now that's the key is to be independent. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5354.66s)]
*  Cause a lot of studios, I can't even greenlight anything. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5356.58s)]
*  Cause things are so expensive. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5358.5s)]
*  They don't want to lose their ass, but they need action films. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5359.82s)]
*  So let's make something that everybody needs and let's make it at a price. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5362.58s)]
*  And we'll make it in my studio because I got my own studio and I can keep all the [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5366.62s)]
*  costs down because we have all the costumes and props and sets from 25 years of [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5369.1s)]
*  filmmaking to keep the costs down and we'll have the audience gets to invest. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5374.66s)]
*  It's not crowdfunding or Kickstarter. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5379.900000000001s)]
*  You're actually an investor. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5382.18s)]
*  Anyone who puts money in can pitch their idea for an action film to me. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5383.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to make one of the four films in that slate from one of those ideas. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5389.02s)]
*  Cause I want the audience to win. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5394.1s)]
*  I want the audience to win and be a part of it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5395.7s)]
*  Cause the audience is an afterthought in Hollywood. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5397.3s)]
*  They make a movie, they show the audience the movie, go tell your friends now. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5399.46s)]
*  So y'all spend money on our movie. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5403.06s)]
*  Well, where's your cut of that? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5404.26s)]
*  So I want them to be successful. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5405.62s)]
*  So if any of the movies in the slate do well, they make money off that one [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5407.18s)]
*  and then sequels or anything, but they're all going to do well because everyone [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5411.14s)]
*  needs an action movie or we're going to keep the costs down. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5415.26s)]
*  Can I actually ask you just to focus in on action? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5417.58s)]
*  You've created a lot of Epic action films. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5420.900000000001s)]
*  What makes for a great action film? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5423.660000000001s)]
*  It comes down to the character. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5426.5s)]
*  You know, like if you think about what are the best action films, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5428.38s)]
*  one of your favorite films, like die hard. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5431.38s)]
*  He's a cop, so he's still capable, but he's not Superman. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5434.42s)]
*  The fact that he's like in over his head and you're rooting for him. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5437.46s)]
*  That's a great character. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5441.06s)]
*  You know, John Wick, he is Superman, but he's retired. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5443.06s)]
*  And now he's pissed off and he's going back into a job. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5447.02s)]
*  You know, so the care is comes down to the character really being very important [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5449.78s)]
*  because the action will then have a character to it. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5453.3s)]
*  I think Leon the professional doesn't, what's the character? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5456.62s)]
*  I mean, that's all about. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5460.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know that when I say we're going to do action movies, I mean, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5460.9400000000005s)]
*  movies that are really action first. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5463.7s)]
*  Like there's some movies that are more dramas that have action. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5465.66s)]
*  Where's the boundary? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5467.9400000000005s)]
*  So John Wick is action. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5468.9400000000005s)]
*  That's more action, but it has character in it, but it's action driven. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5470.900000000001s)]
*  What about like Predator? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5474.26s)]
*  Predator is the sci fi action film. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5476.099999999999s)]
*  So that's kind of a hybrid, which I like. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5478.179999999999s)]
*  But sometimes it's hard for the audience to know what they're buying into. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5480.46s)]
*  Like they focused a lot on the action in the trailer, you know, and then they felt [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5483.94s)]
*  there was some other worldly thing, which you didn't really know. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5487.219999999999s)]
*  But it's a great movie. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5488.94s)]
*  So Die Hard is a good example. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5490.0599999999995s)]
*  It was a good example, right? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5492.139999999999s)]
*  I can think of right off where there's a character that really made the difference. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5492.94s)]
*  And then everyone repeated that, you know, for a while there was like under siege. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5495.9s)]
*  I was like a regular guy who's really actually has some training on a ship now. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5499.54s)]
*  And then on the bus, you got a cop. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5504.82s)]
*  He's a cop, but he's not super cop. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5506.66s)]
*  So that's why you root for him. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5508.46s)]
*  You know, that became an element that people repeated a lot. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5509.5s)]
*  What about Taken? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5512.26s)]
*  That's a great one. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5513.38s)]
*  That's a great character who is superhuman, who's also retired. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5514.34s)]
*  You know, so there's like a superhero type character in an extraordinary [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5517.82s)]
*  circumstance, like that's now his daughter's Taken, right? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5523.1s)]
*  And then there's ordinary people like the Terminator. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5526.78s)]
*  That's a great character. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5529.0199999999995s)]
*  Not the Terminator. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5529.86s)]
*  He's a villain, but Sarah Connor, who is a waitress. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5530.46s)]
*  Doesn't think her life's going anywhere. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5534.299999999999s)]
*  And she finds out she's the mother of the guy who's going to save the human race. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5535.58s)]
*  And she's got to train him. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5540.139999999999s)]
*  You know, suddenly she has to become someone else. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5541.62s)]
*  Those are cool movies because it's a Genesis of a character. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5543.46s)]
*  And you see a character go from waitress to revolutionary. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5546.98s)]
*  They step up. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5550.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5551.42s)]
*  What about mob movies? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5552.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, some of them are like Godfather is really not about, it's not an action [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5553.54s)]
*  movie, a drama that has some action. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5556.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5558.5s)]
*  I mean, John Wick is a mob film in some sense. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5558.9s)]
*  Goodfellas. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5561.42s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of dynamic action. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5562.0599999999995s)]
*  But there's really not action first. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5563.82s)]
*  That's really a character type piece. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5565.66s)]
*  Great. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5567.74s)]
*  Freaking amazing. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5568.42s)]
*  And it feels like action, by the way, he does it. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5569.38s)]
*  It's just like that. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5571.1s)]
*  It's like fast pace, fast talking, fast moving. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5571.98s)]
*  Like Escape from New York is one of my favorites since I was a kid. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5575.26s)]
*  Because every movie you'll notice this now that I tell you, even like a romantic [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5578.78s)]
*  comedy, there's a timeline. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5582.46s)]
*  Every movie has to have like a ticking clock. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5584.82s)]
*  So the audience knows the stories and not just going to take over a period of years. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5586.98s)]
*  So suddenly someone in the movie around 20 or 30 minutes in will say, we've got to [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5590.14s)]
*  go find the groom before the wedding this weekend. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5595.1s)]
*  You know, it'll be just like that. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5598.860000000001s)]
*  Escape from New York has the best example of a ticking time clock because he's [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5600.5s)]
*  literally got bombs in his neck and he's got a watch that shows him. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5603.740000000001s)]
*  He's constantly clocking it, how little time he has. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5607.58s)]
*  And he gets you so like, oh my God, is he going to make it? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5610.42s)]
*  That's like the best use of that. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5614.18s)]
*  No one's ever topped that ticking time clock. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5616.06s)]
*  All the other ones seem artificial in comparison. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5619.34s)]
*  You know, aliens, you know, we got to get off this planet now because this whole [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5622.14s)]
*  thing's going to blow up. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5626.22s)]
*  You know, there's a timeline. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5628.42s)]
*  It's already urgent, but now there's an extra timeline on it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5630.1s)]
*  You know, this is what happens. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5633.02s)]
*  You mean, as you're talking, you're just making me fall in love more and more with [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5634.58s)]
*  action films. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5638.22s)]
*  I sometimes you forget how much you love action films. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5639.06s)]
*  A really good action film. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5642.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5643.46s)]
*  In fact, like The Terminator, the original Terminator just came out in 4K. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5644.14s)]
*  I've been watching it again. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5647.9400000000005s)]
*  It looks like better than most movies look today. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5648.74s)]
*  And that's a $4 million movie. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5650.46s)]
*  It looks incredible. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5651.86s)]
*  You can see every bead of sweat in this movie. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5653.46s)]
*  I was watching it again with somebody, a female, and it is always a point when [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5656.58s)]
*  you're watching that movie where she'll turn and say, I love this movie. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5660.54s)]
*  You know, a point that is, it's a point where Michael Bean tells her, I came [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5666.58s)]
*  across time for you, Sarah. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5670.86s)]
*  I love you. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5672.34s)]
*  Which is, you know, I always have. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5672.9s)]
*  And you're just like, oh my God, there's like a real emotional love story there [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5674.82s)]
*  that he put into Titanic, that he put into Avatar. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5678.98s)]
*  He figured out that thing that makes those movies work. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5682.58s)]
*  By the way, I should say that, I mean, there is an aspect of El Mirage that is [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5686.34s)]
*  a love story to me. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5691.78s)]
*  I don't know if you see it that way, but I got, when I just rewatched it, I was [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5693.9s)]
*  like, tragic love story, but I was like heartbroken that she's dead. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5697.82s)]
*  I got heartbroken twice. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5701.34s)]
*  Let me tell you the second time. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5702.62s)]
*  One, you're making that and you go, okay, this is how it has to go. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5704.42s)]
*  But then now you're invested in this person. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5706.66s)]
*  You go, oh my, she has to die. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5708.18s)]
*  It's going to be really sad. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5709.14s)]
*  In fact, the studio even, when they said they were going to remake it, a good [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5710.38s)]
*  thing I put that ending on, that's the only reason they showed it to an audience. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5714.78s)]
*  We were going to remake it. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5718.74s)]
*  They weren't going to put that movie out. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5719.66s)]
*  They showed it and said, we need to show this movie to an audience. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5722.34s)]
*  Cause they might not like the fact that we killed a girl before we remake it. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5725.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5728.9s)]
*  They showed it to an audience. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5729.5s)]
*  The audience liked it the way it was. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5730.18s)]
*  So they said, we're going to take this movie to some film festivals. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5732.3s)]
*  And I was like, no, not this movie. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5734.9s)]
*  This is my practice movie. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5737.62s)]
*  No one's supposed to see this movie. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5738.98s)]
*  And they go, no, no, you got something. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5741.179999999999s)]
*  No, no, dude, if I knew anyone was going to see this, I would've shot it completely. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5742.7s)]
*  Give me $2,000. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5746.099999999999s)]
*  I'll go reshoot half of it. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5747.42s)]
*  Just knowing people are going to see it. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5748.94s)]
*  I want something. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5750.0599999999995s)]
*  And the head of the studio was really smart. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5750.98s)]
*  He said, you don't know what you have here. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5752.46s)]
*  It's very, something real special. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5754.46s)]
*  Let's take it and tell you right. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5755.46s)]
*  See what happened. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5756.54s)]
*  Tell you right. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5757.38s)]
*  Toronto did great. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5757.94s)]
*  Like I said, in one Sundance. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5758.86s)]
*  So now we had to put it out, but I was like, I would have said, don't show that movie. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5760.66s)]
*  But they also questioned the ending and didn't come into play because we [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5765.74s)]
*  ended up making Desperado and the girl in Desperado doesn't die. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5769.3s)]
*  You know, we didn't do that. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5771.58s)]
*  We didn't kill Salma, but that's what needed to happen in Mariachi. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5772.7s)]
*  I'm quitting calling me one time. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5776.18s)]
*  People would always say like, Oh, the rest of our dogs. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5777.9400000000005s)]
*  He, he borrowed from this movie, Hong Kong action film called a city on fire. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5780.62s)]
*  It's about these guys. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5784.5s)]
*  They're all criminals and they kill each other. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5785.22s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5786.7s)]
*  And he said, Hey, they're showing a double feature called East looks [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5787.66s)]
*  West and West looks East. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5790.94s)]
*  They're showing reservoir dogs with city on fire. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5792.379999999999s)]
*  The one they say I borrowed from. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5794.9s)]
*  And they're showing Mariachi with a Hong Kong film called run where [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5796.379999999999s)]
*  they ripped off Mariachi. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5800.5s)]
*  Like they just took the whole story. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5801.58s)]
*  It had two Chinese actors in Mexico with a guitar cases ones that they [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5803.379999999999s)]
*  just followed it beat by beat. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5807.66s)]
*  So we're watching it and it was like scene by scene. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5809.62s)]
*  They just, they just rebate it without even getting the rights or anything. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5811.98s)]
*  It was so fun to watch. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5815.179999999999s)]
*  We saw Mariachi first. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5816.22s)]
*  Then we watched that one. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5817.18s)]
*  And I'm like, what's this big brothel scene though? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5818.46s)]
*  This isn't my movie. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5821.06s)]
*  This is the, Oh, the back. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5822.02s)]
*  Oh, there's a scene in my movie where the bad guy has two girls in bed with him. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5823.62s)]
*  And they figured that was a whorehouse, but it was just this apartment. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5827.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5829.900000000001s)]
*  So they got this whorehouse. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5830.18s)]
*  They're reinterpreted. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5831.860000000001s)]
*  And they have helicopter shots and all kinds of big thing. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5832.9400000000005s)]
*  And the action was awesome. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5835.9400000000005s)]
*  But then, and the girl's really good. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5837.9800000000005s)]
*  And then midway through the movie, I'm like, Oh shit, she's going to die. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5839.900000000001s)]
*  Cause I killed her in mine. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5843.1s)]
*  I don't want her to die. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5844.5s)]
*  I like this actress is really great. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5845.860000000001s)]
*  And they have a really great love story. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5847.54s)]
*  I go, well, I hope they change that part. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5849.06s)]
*  No, they kill her. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5850.38s)]
*  So I felt bad twice because I sealed, I feel, I sealed her fate. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5851.5s)]
*  I sealed her fate because I have a line in spike kids too. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5856.820000000001s)]
*  Cause I started thinking when you create stuff, you start thinking, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5860.54s)]
*  I wonder if that's how our creator is. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5866.02s)]
*  He's like, Oh shit, I just kind of threw that in a memo and now that [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5868.34s)]
*  whole town's going to get wiped out. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5871.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5873.54s)]
*  You know, I didn't even think about the implications of that. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5874.34s)]
*  Um, cause, uh, there's a line. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5876.94s)]
*  I was making a character that Steve was semi plays and spy kids too. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5879.46s)]
*  And he's a creator. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5882.98s)]
*  He just wanted to make a little miniature zoo for kids. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5883.98s)]
*  And then he saw it. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5887.5s)]
*  Well, what if I put some together like a lizard with a snake and it's a slizzard [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5888.179999999999s)]
*  or you have a spider monkey, which is like literally spider legs and a monkey top. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5893.98s)]
*  So he makes that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5898.5s)]
*  And then he thought, Hey, why don't I make, make them a little bit bigger [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5899.74s)]
*  for kids that have big hands and it got out of control and they turn [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5902.58s)]
*  into these huge creatures and now they're trying to eat them. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5906.46s)]
*  So he's hiding the kids find them hiding. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5909.14s)]
*  And he says this one line that people keep coming. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5911.74s)]
*  It's on the internet. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5914.38s)]
*  You lot does meme about this. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5915.14s)]
*  Why is this blind this movie? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5916.78s)]
*  It's so wild. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5919.42s)]
*  I thought I wanted Steve to come up to the camera and like, he's just, he's [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5920.3s)]
*  lost in his own creative world. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5924.62s)]
*  And he says, I can't even go outside because my own creations are going to eat me. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5927.0199999999995s)]
*  Then he comes up to the camera and he goes, do you think God hides in heaven [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5932.14s)]
*  because he too lives in fear of what he created here on earth? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5935.74s)]
*  It's like really just for a moment, this thing. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5940.78s)]
*  And it's like, cause you feel like that way when you're, when you're creating [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5942.78s)]
*  stuff, like you're creating something and then now it's taking on a life on its own. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5946.14s)]
*  And it's like, Oh no, now this character has to die. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5949.26s)]
*  I didn't want that. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5950.7s)]
*  You know, this, this domino effect of creation and you start thinking, well, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5951.42s)]
*  that's must be what creation that maybe he is hiding up there because look at, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5956.3s)]
*  he didn't expect all this shit to happen. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5960.14s)]
*  Giving us free will and all that. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5961.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, this particular context that you are the creator of the story. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5964.54s)]
*  And for some reason it makes me feel good to know that you feel the [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5968.700000000001s)]
*  pain of this character dying. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5971.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5973.26s)]
*  Cause like if I'm, I'm writing it, but if it's not coming from me, I'm as surprised [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5974.3s)]
*  sometimes. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5981.18s)]
*  And Quentin would say that, you know, he'd say, you just get two characters talking [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5981.740000000001s)]
*  when I'm writing my script. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5984.860000000001s)]
*  And then suddenly they're just talking to each other. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5985.900000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what does that mean? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5987.580000000001s)]
*  Now I know what that means. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5989.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, he just gave them life and now, now the dialogue's coming through him. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5989.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5994.78s)]
*  Let me just ask you, you're the perfect person to ask about the genius of Quentin [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5995.259999999999s)]
*  Tarantino. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5998.78s)]
*  What makes him special as a director, as a creative mind? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=5999.42s)]
*  What do you see in him? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6002.86s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6004.78s)]
*  That's brilliant. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6005.66s)]
*  Since I met him, he was just like this brilliant ball of energy. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6008.62s)]
*  And, you know, like if you see him, I walk around his house and I'll see like a few [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6015.34s)]
*  sheets of paper all handwritten out. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6022.14s)]
*  I'm like, what's that? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6024.14s)]
*  He goes, oh, that was something I was starting to write. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6024.9400000000005s)]
*  And I, you know, not going to finish. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6026.62s)]
*  I'm like, can I take these and go turn it into like all trilogy of films? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6027.900000000001s)]
*  You know, like what he throws away, all this mortal men would kill for. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6033.9800000000005s)]
*  You meet people like that. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6037.74s)]
*  I tell people, you know, your parents say, watch out who your peers are. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6038.86s)]
*  When you're younger, that means one thing, but once you get older, surround yourself [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6043.66s)]
*  around people who swing much farther than you, you know, that's just like, but that's [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6047.5s)]
*  really true. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6052.7s)]
*  I mean, just by being around him and working with him, you get by osmosis, you learn stuff. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6053.42s)]
*  And it just ups your game because they're just swing way beyond you. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6061.42s)]
*  Jim Cameron was like that. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6065.66s)]
*  So like when I first met him, I was trying to impress the hell out of him, you know, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6066.62s)]
*  because I was such a big fan. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6069.66s)]
*  I was about to go do the Spirato and I went, hey, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6070.7s)]
*  I just took a three day Steadicam course because I can't afford a Steadicam operator. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6072.9400000000005s)]
*  So I'm going to operate Steadicam myself on this. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6076.54s)]
*  Now, if he was just my peer, he'd say, oh, I did the same thing. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6079.74s)]
*  And I'm going to do the same thing that that would be like hanging out with somebody of [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6082.38s)]
*  your real, but you don't want somebody who's above that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6085.42s)]
*  You know what he said? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6087.9800000000005s)]
*  He goes, I bought a Steadicam, but not to operate it. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6088.62s)]
*  I'm going to take it apart and design a better one. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6092.86s)]
*  Us mere mortals trying to learn how to operate the camera. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6096.3s)]
*  He's designing all new systems. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6099.74s)]
*  That's the guy you want to hang out with, not someone who's doing what you're doing. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6101.5s)]
*  So surround yourself by those kinds of people. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6105.42s)]
*  And that's when you learn things like don't blink, you know, like somebody who's like [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6107.42s)]
*  really swinging for the fences and accomplishing so much. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6111.34s)]
*  And Quentin was like that. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6115.18s)]
*  So I met him at the festivals. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6116.3s)]
*  He saw Mariachi. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6118.62s)]
*  He loved it. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6119.5s)]
*  We came up, we talked and he said, you know, like my next film I'm writing right now, Pulp Fiction. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6120.46s)]
*  So I thought, man, I'm going to put this guy. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6124.78s)]
*  He's so, he's so fun. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6126.94s)]
*  I'm going to put him in. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6128.14s)]
*  I'm going to write him in my Desperado script, which I was writing. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6128.78s)]
*  So that was before Pulp Fiction and all that when I had cast him. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6131.18s)]
*  I didn't know he was going to go become such a household name. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6133.900000000001s)]
*  I just was drawn to his energy and I'd already written him in and I met Steve Buscemi there. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6136.54s)]
*  And I was like, I'm writing a character for Steve Buscemi. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6141.820000000001s)]
*  But then I went back to the Sony lot where I was working on Desperado and Quentin and I ended up [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6144.14s)]
*  having offices right next to each other on the Sony lot. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6148.38s)]
*  By accident, I didn't even know that. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6151.02s)]
*  I just met him and I go back and he was, because originally Pulp Fiction was for TriStar [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6152.14s)]
*  because Danny DeVito was a producer and he was going to make it for TriStar. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6157.34s)]
*  So he was there writing Pulp Fiction and I was writing Desperado. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6160.38s)]
*  So I'd go show him like storyboards from Desperado. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6163.5s)]
*  He'd come act out scenes of Pulp Fiction. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6165.5s)]
*  And we got to be really good friends that way. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6167.5s)]
*  We'd go eat lunch at Versailles across the street, the Sony lot. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6169.74s)]
*  And then Sony passed on Pulp Fiction. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6173.74s)]
*  It's too weird, too long, $8 million movie or $7 million. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6177.5s)]
*  They're like, ah, we're going to go make the next Polly Short movie instead. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6182.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, like, we don't understand this thing. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6185.58s)]
*  And Miramax got it and they had just been bought by Disney. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6187.26s)]
*  They produced their first film was Pulp Fiction. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6189.74s)]
*  And then that thing went to Cannes and it was a whole thing. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6192.86s)]
*  But what I loved about his story is that when he made Pulp Fiction, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6195.98s)]
*  he had a director screening. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6201.74s)]
*  He showed it to some directors and I wasn't able to go. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6203.42s)]
*  But anyway, I had dinner with him once and it was in my journal because I keep a journal. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6205.66s)]
*  At 2 40 a.m. when after I dropped him off at his house, I said, oh, wait, how did your movie come out? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6209.179999999999s)]
*  Pulp Fiction, he had just finished it and he went, that's dumb. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6216.7s)]
*  Still feels like a movie Quentin would make. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6220.3s)]
*  Doesn't feel like a real movie. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6222.0599999999995s)]
*  And I was like, that's fine. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6223.98s)]
*  What does it mean? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6226.139999999999s)]
*  It feels like one of those movies I would make like Reservoir Dogs. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6226.94s)]
*  It doesn't feel like a real movie. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6229.74s)]
*  And I was trying to be the supportive friend going, oh, man, he was so excited about this movie. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6231.74s)]
*  Now he's bummed about it. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6235.58s)]
*  And I was like, well, it should be different. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6237.179999999999s)]
*  Should be like he's like, I wouldn't have it drove off. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6239.0199999999995s)]
*  So I guess that wasn't the one. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6243.099999999999s)]
*  So I went home and I called some of the directors that were at the screening. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6244.54s)]
*  And they go, yeah, this isn't the one for him. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6248.38s)]
*  It's not. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6249.9s)]
*  None of them saw it. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6251.34s)]
*  None of them saw it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6253.1s)]
*  But that, you're like surprised. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6253.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6255.5s)]
*  But that happened with George Lucas too, with Star Wars. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6256.06s)]
*  Everybody saw that movie and was like, poor George. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6258.38s)]
*  They showed it to all his director friends. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6261.26s)]
*  Poor George, what he's wasting all this time with this for. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6262.86s)]
*  Only Spielberg was the one who said, it's naive and it's going to do really good [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6264.86s)]
*  because it's naive and kids will like it. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6268.7s)]
*  But everyone else was like, what's he doing? [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6270.9400000000005s)]
*  We're artists. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6273.18s)]
*  We're making art films. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6273.9s)]
*  What's he doing this garbage for? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6274.7s)]
*  Because nobody knows. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6276.54s)]
*  It shows no one knows anything. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6277.34s)]
*  Not even the filmmaker. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6278.7s)]
*  When you're being groundbreaking, you don't know what groundbreaking is. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6280.06s)]
*  Not you or anyone around you, except maybe one or two people. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6282.38s)]
*  So he said, there was one person like, oh yeah, who is your Spielberg goes. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6285.5s)]
*  Catherine Bigelow without a doubt. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6288.54s)]
*  She's the only one who said there's something here. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6289.9s)]
*  No one else was seeing the same that he said. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6292.3s)]
*  In fact, because he remembered suddenly he'd forgotten the story, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6295.0199999999995s)]
*  but it wasn't in my journal. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6298.14s)]
*  I would have forgot it too. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6299.34s)]
*  He was in fact, one of my friends, Simon said, I want to sit you down [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6300.46s)]
*  and tell you all the things that are wrong with your movie. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6304.46s)]
*  But I'll wait till you get back from the Cannes Film Festival. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6307.0199999999995s)]
*  And he goes and he wins the Palme d'Or. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6309.58s)]
*  And then his friend's like, oh, well, I know. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6310.86s)]
*  I've only made one movie myself. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6312.7s)]
*  So I never mind. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6313.9s)]
*  I guess we're all wrong. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6314.94s)]
*  So even he didn't expect that at all. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6316.46s)]
*  So that was a shock even to him. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6319.18s)]
*  So think about that. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6322.06s)]
*  That means, what do you do? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6324.22s)]
*  Commit to a body of work. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6326.06s)]
*  Just do that. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6327.18s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6327.98s)]
*  You don't know what's going to be a Pulp Fiction, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6328.46s)]
*  and what's going to be a Jackie Brown. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6329.82s)]
*  What's going to be? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6331.74s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6332.46s)]
*  And you'd like to think they know, but they don't know either. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6333.5s)]
*  Like I asked Jim Cameron, I said, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6337.02s)]
*  do you see your movie really clearly? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6338.780000000001s)]
*  Like, can you see it with hyper-focus? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6341.02s)]
*  Because it seems like that. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6343.18s)]
*  And he goes, it's like really far. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6343.9800000000005s)]
*  It's out of focus. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6346.9400000000005s)]
*  And you work on it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6347.740000000001s)]
*  You work on it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6348.54s)]
*  It starts coming. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6348.9400000000005s)]
*  I said, OK, good. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6349.900000000001s)]
*  So that's normal. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6350.780000000001s)]
*  I thought maybe he had laser vision or something. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6352.7s)]
*  But no, even him, he doesn't really know. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6355.02s)]
*  But he feels it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6357.02s)]
*  He can make decisions. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6357.66s)]
*  And he understands what a creative drive is [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6358.780000000001s)]
*  and how to just keep being relentless about it. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6361.9800000000005s)]
*  But it's not like they have all the... [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6365.1s)]
*  Proximity is huge. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6367.9800000000005s)]
*  Proximity will change your life. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6370.46s)]
*  Did for me. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6373.5s)]
*  Just being around those guys. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6374.14s)]
*  They didn't teach me, hey, I'm going to teach you how to make a movie. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6376.3s)]
*  Just being next to them, being in their world just ups your game. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6379.1s)]
*  And you're able to do things you weren't able to do before. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6384.7s)]
*  You get ideas you didn't get to do before. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6386.9400000000005s)]
*  I did. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6388.62s)]
*  I'll show you one of my painting things. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6389.02s)]
*  You're not going to believe this freaking thing. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6392.46s)]
*  I had a painter friend in Germany, Sebastian Kruger. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6394.62s)]
*  He gives a workshop once a year. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6397.82s)]
*  I'm going to go there and I'll learn more about directing [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6399.82s)]
*  by watching this guy paint than I will by watching another director. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6402.46s)]
*  Because that's just now I know how creativity works. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6405.900000000001s)]
*  You're going to learn lessons outside of the box by doing that. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6408.62s)]
*  And I tried to practice before going out there. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6412.9400000000005s)]
*  I was doing a Danny Trejo. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6414.7s)]
*  I'll show you the before and after. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6415.74s)]
*  You're not going to freaking believe what you see. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6417.02s)]
*  But it really tells the story of how important proximity is. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6419.1s)]
*  So I do this painting. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6424.62s)]
*  It's like, ah, it fucking looks garbage. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6425.900000000001s)]
*  I'll show you. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6427.66s)]
*  It looks like garbage. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6428.14s)]
*  I can't do paintings that are just like... [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6430.3s)]
*  See, you never should say I can't because you just cut your leg off. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6433.66s)]
*  But I couldn't at the time paint, just paintbrush into paint [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6436.46s)]
*  and then write on the canvas like that without using some kind of medium. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6439.900000000001s)]
*  Which this guy, Sebastian Kruger, would do. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6444.06s)]
*  So first I did a digital painting of Danny Trejo just to get the framing and all that. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6446.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6450.38s)]
*  How's that created? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6450.86s)]
*  That's just like on a Wacom tablet. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6451.74s)]
*  But then I did it with paint and it's like, ah, it's all cruddy. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6453.5s)]
*  And it's too thick, the paint. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6455.98s)]
*  And it just looks... [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6458.22s)]
*  It looks... [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6458.94s)]
*  And I just gave up right away. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6459.82s)]
*  I was trying to pre-practice so I wouldn't be a total buffoon there [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6461.02s)]
*  because I was going the next week. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6464.94s)]
*  And I thought he's using a different brush, obviously. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6466.14s)]
*  He's using a better paint. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6468.78s)]
*  This stuff just is clogging up and it's crap. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6469.9s)]
*  I'm sure when I get there. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6472.86s)]
*  So I get there and he's doing a Mick Jagger. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6474.78s)]
*  And he starts with a mid-tone. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6478.14s)]
*  He starts blocking in the face with a little tiny drawing of where the face goes. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6480.14s)]
*  He starts doing that. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6484.06s)]
*  He starts adding some highlights. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6485.74s)]
*  There's the photo, his reference. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6487.58s)]
*  And I'm like, why are you concentrating so much on the cheek first? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6490.06s)]
*  And he's like, it's different every time. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6495.34s)]
*  And I go, why do you... [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6498.38s)]
*  What paints are you using? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6500.62s)]
*  And he's like, it was regular acrylic paint. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6501.9800000000005s)]
*  What brushes do you have? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6504.14s)]
*  Regular brushes. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6505.18s)]
*  I'm like, how come mine doesn't look like yours? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6505.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, let me try what he's doing. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6509.18s)]
*  I mean, you start with a mid-tone. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6510.22s)]
*  I'm going to do that Danny again. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6511.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6512.54s)]
*  Start with a mid-tone. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6513.26s)]
*  I'll start adding some highlights. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6513.9800000000005s)]
*  And I did that. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6517.18s)]
*  And everybody kept coming over going like, did you just do that? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6518.14s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I don't know how, but it's very cartoony still. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6520.780000000001s)]
*  He's doing a very realistic Mick Jagger. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6523.74s)]
*  Look how real that is. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6528.46s)]
*  And you just watch it and he doesn't teach you anything. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6530.62s)]
*  So he just starts painting. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6533.42s)]
*  So this is the photo he had as a reference, but then this is his painting. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6535.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6540.14s)]
*  And because I'm there, he's not teaching you how to paint. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6540.94s)]
*  Through osmosis, you're like learning some of... [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6543.9s)]
*  You're seeing that there isn't a trick. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6545.9s)]
*  I thought he had a trick and that's why I couldn't get any further. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6548.379999999999s)]
*  He's using the same brush and the same paint. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6551.58s)]
*  Well, how come I can't do that? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6554.299999999999s)]
*  And you go, you do it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6555.82s)]
*  I go, I'm going to try and do something realistic. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6556.62s)]
*  I've never done realistic before because I'm a cartoonist and everything. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6558.219999999999s)]
*  I was cartoony and that was just easier for me because I thought I would need too much training. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6561.419999999999s)]
*  I did another Trejo. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6567.0199999999995s)]
*  I started doing a realistic. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6568.379999999999s)]
*  I finished out just one section of his face and put the pen down because I did that. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6569.66s)]
*  The same day. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6575.099999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6576.46s)]
*  I got out of my way because seeing him get out of his own way, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6577.34s)]
*  I think that's why sometimes people need to go to school for stuff like that. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6582.46s)]
*  Because then now, well, I just did four years of school. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6585.42s)]
*  So now I must know. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6588.54s)]
*  Now you're giving yourself permission, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6589.58s)]
*  but you could give yourself permission right away and it's going to come through. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6590.94s)]
*  And drawing Danny Trejo of all people is like, there's so much going on there. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6594.3s)]
*  It's like he's so expressive. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6597.58s)]
*  So expressive. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6599.0199999999995s)]
*  You've worked with him a lot and he's one of those bad-ass humans on the screen. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6600.54s)]
*  You've created that. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6606.219999999999s)]
*  Can you just talk about what it's like creating those characters? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6607.82s)]
*  What was exciting about Desperado is I went to go make it and there were no [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6612.219999999999s)]
*  Latin actors working in Hollywood because no one was creating roles for them. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6615.179999999999s)]
*  So I thought, wow, I got to go create my own stars. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6619.0199999999995s)]
*  We'll bring Antonio from Europe because they kind of know his name from the Motivar movies. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6621.82s)]
*  And I saw him in Time Me Up, Time Me Down when I was in the hospital writing Mariachi. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6626.78s)]
*  We were watching TV while I was a patient. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6631.5s)]
*  There's a scene where he like headbutts Victoria Abril. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6634.219999999999s)]
*  He just gives her a headbutt and goes like that. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6637.66s)]
*  I was like, whoa, I bet that guy would want to be in an action movie. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6640.219999999999s)]
*  He's got something inside. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6643.66s)]
*  So I called him when we were doing Desperado and I said, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6644.86s)]
*  would you ever consider doing an action? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6647.42s)]
*  Oh man, I'd love to do action movies. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6649.099999999999s)]
*  So I said, I got a movie for you. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6651.5s)]
*  I got a movie for you. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6652.78s)]
*  It was a sequel to Mariachi. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6653.5s)]
*  And so Salma I found in Mexico television, you know, doing, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6655.5s)]
*  she couldn't get work in the US because of the roles. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6661.58s)]
*  How did you find her? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6664.54s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the greatest actors in the world. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6665.1s)]
*  It was one of the best stories. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6667.34s)]
*  I was really determined to hire a real Latin, especially Hispanic, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6668.14s)]
*  and then she's Mexican actress to be the Mexican character. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6671.98s)]
*  That's like as authentic as you can get. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6676.3s)]
*  And there was no one who was getting any jobs because no one was creating any. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6678.38s)]
*  So there was no one that had any movies under their name because there was no one, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6681.42s)]
*  it was a whole systemic problem, right? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6684.86s)]
*  This was 94, 93. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6686.78s)]
*  So I was watching a Paul Rodriguez show on Univision because he, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6690.0599999999995s)]
*  I was trying to practice my Spanish because I was having to do all these Spanish interviews [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6695.82s)]
*  because Mariachi was in Spanish. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6699.179999999999s)]
*  That was the other part I didn't tell you. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6700.46s)]
*  I didn't speak Spanish when I made that movie. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6702.139999999999s)]
*  We didn't grow up with it. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6703.98s)]
*  So I never, I left that part out of the Mariachi story because I thought [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6705.339999999999s)]
*  people already didn't believe I made the movie by myself. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6708.94s)]
*  They knew I made it in a language. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6710.86s)]
*  I didn't speak. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6712.139999999999s)]
*  I should have said it because it'd be even more inspiring. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6712.94s)]
*  Now you have no excuse. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6715.82s)]
*  I would wrote the English subtitles basically. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6718.379999999999s)]
*  I wrote the titles, what became the subtitles. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6721.0199999999995s)]
*  And then we take it to the actors and the actor would translate it for me. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6724.379999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I'd be like, I would try to speak Spanish and say, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6728.139999999999s)]
*  vamos a recordar. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6733.099999999999s)]
*  Like, let's record. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6734.379999999999s)]
*  And they'd be looking at me like, that means let's remember. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6735.339999999999s)]
*  The record doesn't mean record. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6738.46s)]
*  That means grabar. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6740.379999999999s)]
*  Now I know back then. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6741.900000000001s)]
*  So I'm watching Univision and then there's Salma as a guest. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6743.34s)]
*  And she's a big soap star down there in Mexico. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6748.06s)]
*  And she comes out, she's beautiful. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6750.7s)]
*  She's funny. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6751.9800000000005s)]
*  Everyone's laughing. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6752.54s)]
*  She's Salma, everyone that we know now. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6753.5s)]
*  And she starts talking about what I gather from what she's saying, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6756.06s)]
*  that she's having trouble finding any work in the US because of her accent. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6759.74s)]
*  And then Parvati says, well, say something in English. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6763.02s)]
*  And then she says, then she sounds just like she does now. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6766.38s)]
*  And he goes, that's great. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6769.1s)]
*  She goes, I know, I know. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6769.82s)]
*  And I went, I think this is the girl. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6772.0599999999995s)]
*  So I called her in my office and I videotaped our first meeting together. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6773.74s)]
*  So I have that somewhere. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6777.82s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6778.86s)]
*  Telling me about it. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6779.82s)]
*  It's Salma. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6780.62s)]
*  It's Salma. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6781.42s)]
*  It's her with her energy, with her passion and funny. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6782.0599999999995s)]
*  She became instant friends with my wife, you know, before they walked over, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6785.74s)]
*  your wife and I are best friends. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6788.62s)]
*  She already was like part of the family. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6790.0599999999995s)]
*  She's godmother to my kids. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6791.66s)]
*  And I thought, I'm going to help you. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6795.179999999999s)]
*  You're going to help me. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6796.94s)]
*  I need to have a Mexican actress in this. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6797.66s)]
*  And you're going to be phenomenal. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6799.74s)]
*  The studio didn't see it. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6801.34s)]
*  They were like, what? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6802.86s)]
*  She hasn't done anything. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6804.3s)]
*  Why don't you just hire somebody else who already has a name? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6805.0199999999995s)]
*  So if we just give her one movie, then she'll be someone who's in a movie. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6810.139999999999s)]
*  And then you can keep casting. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6812.94s)]
*  So I made a whole movie with her in English called Road Racer. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6814.139999999999s)]
*  It was my second film for Showtime. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6817.099999999999s)]
*  Really cool little rebel without a cause type movie. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6818.7s)]
*  And she's, and I gave her a role in that. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6822.54s)]
*  So we'd have an example of her doing English. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6823.98s)]
*  And they still were like, we need a screen test. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6826.54s)]
*  We need to have a screen test with a bunch of other actresses. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6829.82s)]
*  So I said, sure, let's do that. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6834.38s)]
*  So I went over to her house the night before the screen test. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6835.74s)]
*  And we worked on the scene, which is the best scene where she's operating on his arm. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6840.219999999999s)]
*  And they've got all this chemistry. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6845.5s)]
*  I was just directing her through it, like completely down to when you pick up the water, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6846.62s)]
*  you hand him the water. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6851.099999999999s)]
*  Don't scream, oh, hot water. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6852.7s)]
*  Just be like hot water. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6853.9s)]
*  And while he's spitting it out, and it's going to be a big dramatic action with like a [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6855.099999999999s)]
*  very light delivery. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6858.7s)]
*  And so we got it down to a science. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6860.0599999999995s)]
*  The next day we show up, Antonio does a scene with all the girls come in. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6862.139999999999s)]
*  He does it with her. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6867.099999999999s)]
*  Clearly they've got amazing chemistry. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6869.26s)]
*  She just nails it. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6872.7s)]
*  He's great. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6874.139999999999s)]
*  He loves her too. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6875.0199999999995s)]
*  Studio's like, okay, you can hire her. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6877.099999999999s)]
*  Reluctantly like that, right? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6879.34s)]
*  But once they saw the footage come as we were shooting, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6881.34s)]
*  and they saw it on the big screen when they're watching the dailies, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6884.86s)]
*  then they were like, oh my God. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6887.58s)]
*  And then they saw it. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6889.42s)]
*  Then they saw what I saw when I met her. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6890.38s)]
*  But sometimes like you say, what do you do when people are like, hey, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6892.46s)]
*  why come here using these? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6896.38s)]
*  Just know that not everyone's going to see it. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6897.82s)]
*  You may have the only vision. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6899.98s)]
*  Just keep going. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6902.22s)]
*  There's an instinct that tells you to keep going that way. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6903.0199999999995s)]
*  You'll get proved right or wrong, or maybe you're just slipping on the first two rocks [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6905.66s)]
*  or whatever, but follow your instinct because everyone's going to have an opinion. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6908.94s)]
*  And it's not necessarily the right one. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6913.98s)]
*  And when you're an independent filmmaker, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6915.34s)]
*  you can make those decisions that change people's career, that changes the world. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6917.34s)]
*  And that's why you want to remain independent. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6922.22s)]
*  That's why what's happening now in the industry is great [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6924.22s)]
*  because I have to make movies like the way I started, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6926.46s)]
*  which is what I've always liked to do, which is just doing it [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6929.82s)]
*  where we create our own destiny. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6932.62s)]
*  We go, hey, we're going to make a movie. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6933.900000000001s)]
*  We're going to make it for this budget so we can make it. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6935.1s)]
*  And the story is going to be so character-driven and cool. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6937.26s)]
*  We're going to be able to get big actors to be in it [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6939.42s)]
*  because they're going to want to be in it. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6940.9400000000005s)]
*  So Danny Trejo, you asked me about Danny Trejo. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6942.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6943.98s)]
*  Okay, Danny Trejo. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6945.259999999999s)]
*  We're doing Desperado now. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6947.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm casting all kinds of people. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6948.0599999999995s)]
*  Now I have this character that I want to have a bunch of knives. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6949.339999999999s)]
*  He opens up his vest and there's a bunch of knives. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6951.98s)]
*  So bring me all the coolest looking, you know, Latin actors we can find. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6954.139999999999s)]
*  And before he even walked in, there's a picture of him. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6959.339999999999s)]
*  He already looked like the guy, but he was younger. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6962.139999999999s)]
*  He always just played prison inmates. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6964.7s)]
*  It was a picture of him as an inmate in a prison. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6966.78s)]
*  I want to give him a cool role, you know, just wherever this actor is. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6969.419999999999s)]
*  He walks in and I see him, it's Danny Trejo. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6972.46s)]
*  He sits down and I had the prop knife already made. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6974.54s)]
*  And I say, you need to have this in your hand and look like you sleep with it. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6978.62s)]
*  Like just practice flipping it around your hand. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6982.06s)]
*  I gave it to him. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6984.86s)]
*  You got the role, just start practicing with that. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6986.14s)]
*  He gets up and walks out. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6987.82s)]
*  You don't have to say anything because there's no dialogue. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6988.86s)]
*  He walks out. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6990.94s)]
*  We get to the set and he kept saying, put me in coach, give me a line, give me a line. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6992.7s)]
*  I said, no, no, you're such a nice guy. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6996.22s)]
*  You're going to blow the whole mystique. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6997.82s)]
*  I want this guy to feel like the most evil, scary guy of all. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=6998.86s)]
*  And you're such a nice guy. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7001.98s)]
*  I didn't let him talk till dusk till dawn. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7003.66s)]
*  But one thing I noticed was that the town we're shot in, the Mexican town, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7005.66s)]
*  which is the same town I shot Mariachi, we went back there because I wanted to pay back the city. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7010.62s)]
*  So we had this big movie there and they didn't really know Antonio because he was in European [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7015.179999999999s)]
*  movies. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7020.379999999999s)]
*  Salma hadn't come to the set yet, but they saw Danny Trejo there in his vest [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7021.259999999999s)]
*  looking like a Mexican icon. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7025.58s)]
*  They would go like this. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7027.58s)]
*  Everyone thought he was the star. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7029.66s)]
*  And I just know magnetism when I see it. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7031.98s)]
*  And I went, this guy's got something. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7035.5s)]
*  So I went to him and I said, I got a movie we're going to do someday. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7038.299999999999s)]
*  This was 94. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7040.86s)]
*  We didn't make this movie for 15 years. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7042.139999999999s)]
*  Machete. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7044.86s)]
*  You're going to be machete. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7045.74s)]
*  I had, I had an idea for machete then it wasn't the same story. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7047.82s)]
*  I'd seen a story. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7051.099999999999s)]
*  Actually, Mariachi, the guy from March sent me this funny story. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7053.419999999999s)]
*  He said, Hey, look at this story that the USDA and FBI sometimes would hire [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7056.219999999999s)]
*  Mexican federally to come do a job for 25 grand that they didn't want to get their [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7061.98s)]
*  own guys killed on. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7065.98s)]
*  I said, that's machete, the guy that they pay, but he's not doing it for the money. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7067.5s)]
*  It turns out he has to get this guy that escaped Mexico and that's the twist. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7072.7s)]
*  So that was the original story I had. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7076.78s)]
*  I said, we're going to do this someday. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7077.98s)]
*  And we talked about it for years and never did it. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7079.339999999999s)]
*  Never had it got around to doing it. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7082.0599999999995s)]
*  So when I did spy kids, I put him in spy kids and I said, Hey, let's pay [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7083.58s)]
*  tribute to that character. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7087.74s)]
*  We never got to make and you'll be uncle machete. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7088.62s)]
*  He's a gadget guy, but he's got a mysterious past. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7090.86s)]
*  But then a few years later, Quentin and I were doing grind house. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7094.38s)]
*  And he'd already done dustle dom. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7097.9s)]
*  You know, I was building my own Latin star system. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7099.42s)]
*  Salma showed up in a bunch of my movies. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7101.9s)]
*  Cheech shows up in every movie. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7103.339999999999s)]
*  Danny shows up. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7104.94s)]
*  I brought Cheech out of retirement, put him in my movie. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7105.9s)]
*  I needed to create my own Latin star system because all my scripts, because when you write [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7108.38s)]
*  in your own voice, you're going to write probably somebody that's Latin. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7111.66s)]
*  So you need to have a star system that matches that so that you don't have trouble casting. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7115.0199999999995s)]
*  People are like, well, you can't hire this person. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7119.26s)]
*  So I built up my own star system. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7120.860000000001s)]
*  So Danny was one of my stars. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7122.54s)]
*  So after we're doing grind house, we had to do fake trailers for grind house. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7124.46s)]
*  And I told Quentin, I know what trailer I'm going to do for the movie. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7129.42s)]
*  I never had to make with Danny called machete. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7133.74s)]
*  That'll be so fun. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7136.14s)]
*  Finally get that out of her system and doing a trailer is so fun. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7137.02s)]
*  It's two days of shooting. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7139.5s)]
*  Just still being that resourceful guy. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7141.42s)]
*  We asked this company that had a digital camera we wanted to use. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7143.900000000001s)]
*  Can you let us send it to us for a couple of days screen test? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7147.1s)]
*  I mean, camera test. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7149.58s)]
*  Instead of shooting a camera test, we shot the trailer. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7151.1s)]
*  We got a free camera, shot the trailer with him. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7153.18s)]
*  It's just the money shots. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7155.820000000001s)]
*  Him opening his vest full of machetes, him aiming that gun, him in a waterfall with two gals. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7156.780000000001s)]
*  And I just came up with this really funny trailer and we shot it. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7162.700000000001s)]
*  People were screaming at the premiere. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7167.34s)]
*  You couldn't even hear it. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7168.9400000000005s)]
*  They just wanted that movie so badly because there was black exploitation in the 70s. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7169.900000000001s)]
*  There was never mech exploitation. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7175.18s)]
*  It felt like this should have existed, but it didn't. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7176.54s)]
*  It's Mexican superhero. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7179.1s)]
*  They just never seen anything like that. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7180.3s)]
*  Now you know. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7181.98s)]
*  But even his mom calls him machete. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7182.7s)]
*  He just became this guy. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7185.26s)]
*  And I've got 250 movies that he's been in. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7187.1s)]
*  Machete is his most famous one. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7189.5s)]
*  So for five years, five years, people would come up to us and say, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7192.14s)]
*  where's machete? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7199.34s)]
*  When's that movie coming out? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7201.0199999999995s)]
*  We're like, it's not a real movie. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7202.14s)]
*  When it looks real, we want to see that movie. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7204.06s)]
*  So we finally made the movie because people just asked for it. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7206.06s)]
*  And I used, I wanted to, I was adamant about being resourceful again. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7209.740000000001s)]
*  All the shots that are in the trailer are really great. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7213.580000000001s)]
*  I got to reverse engineer the trailer into a movie so that I can use that shot that's in the trailer. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7216.22s)]
*  Like this girl in the waterfall. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7221.820000000001s)]
*  Why would this girl be in the waterfall? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7223.02s)]
*  Don't have a really clever way that he gets the bad guy. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7224.22s)]
*  Her hair's kind of, her face is kind of covered by this hair. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7226.22s)]
*  We'll cast Lindsay Lohan there or the senator will switch it out for Robert De Niro. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7228.54s)]
*  Well, I just reversed engineer it. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7233.42s)]
*  So every time there's a shot in the trailer, it's in the movie, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7235.02s)]
*  but I shot all the footage around to lead up to it. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7238.46s)]
*  That's another fun creative exercise is to reverse engineer something. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7240.700000000001s)]
*  You just did like this on the day. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7244.06s)]
*  You just threw a bunch of cards out basically with that trailer. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7246.06s)]
*  And now you got to go make a movie using all those carts. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7248.620000000001s)]
*  That's like a creative exercise that I thought so satisfying, so fun. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7251.02s)]
*  Yeah, that was beautiful. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7256.22s)]
*  You're actually known in part, maybe you can correct me, but [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7257.42s)]
*  to do pretty unexpected, surprising kind of interesting casting. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7260.46s)]
*  So Robert De Niro is an example of that. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7264.06s)]
*  And that's just a great role. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7265.900000000001s)]
*  The second aspect of that, I heard the story that [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7268.06s)]
*  you can just get an actor in and out in just a few days, really fast. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7270.860000000001s)]
*  The Robert Rodriguez experiences they call it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7275.18s)]
*  How do you make that happen? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7277.26s)]
*  Can you just tell the story of Robert De Niro? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7278.620000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm the editor, I'm the cameraman, I'm the DP. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7279.580000000001s)]
*  And so when I call him and say, I've got you as the villain in this whole movie, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7283.660000000001s)]
*  but I'm going to, I swear I'm going to shoot you out in four days. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7289.9800000000005s)]
*  You come down four days. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7293.1s)]
*  There's a scene where he's in the hospital. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7294.06s)]
*  He's just smiling. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7295.9800000000005s)]
*  He's having such a good time because he couldn't believe it. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7296.780000000001s)]
*  I said, guess what? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7298.3s)]
*  When you wake up from your hotel room at the Stephen F. Austin, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7299.42s)]
*  you just crossed the hallway. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7302.22s)]
*  That's the set. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7303.18s)]
*  The room next to yours, we turned into the hospital set. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7304.54s)]
*  So you're just going to come laying there in your pajamas. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7307.5s)]
*  Really? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7309.660000000001s)]
*  That's what you did? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7309.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we had to save time. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7310.62s)]
*  We only have four days. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7311.740000000001s)]
*  So everything had to be very thought out to be like, boom, boom, boom, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7313.1s)]
*  let's shoot the money, get them out of this. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7315.9800000000005s)]
*  We don't have to spend a lot of money on them. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7317.1s)]
*  Book a room in a hotel, set up to look like a hospital room. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7318.62s)]
*  That's our set. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7321.9s)]
*  It's real. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7322.78s)]
*  You don't have to dress it. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7323.26s)]
*  And it's just right there. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7323.98s)]
*  All you do is put a little tube there for his IV. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7325.26s)]
*  And then you have a couple of nurses. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7328.94s)]
*  And it looks like a hospital. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7330.38s)]
*  You're genius. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7331.42s)]
*  It was a Rappagenero. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7332.38s)]
*  Resortsful. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7333.34s)]
*  Resortsful. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7333.98s)]
*  Next door. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7334.78s)]
*  But I said, you're going to think about me when you're on your next [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7335.42s)]
*  Meet the Fockers movie. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7338.14s)]
*  And you're on there for six months before they have you sitting in a trailer. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7339.5s)]
*  I don't like to do that. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7342.14s)]
*  So I gave Lady Gaga her first two movies. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7343.82s)]
*  Because after Machete, she said publicly, she said, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7347.34s)]
*  I saw Machete and my song Americano should have been in Machete. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7351.58s)]
*  I thought, she saw Machete. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7354.62s)]
*  So I called her up and I said, hey, I'm making a sequel. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7356.54s)]
*  And I would certainly use your music. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7359.1s)]
*  But have you ever thought about acting? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7360.78s)]
*  Because you're an amazing performer. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7361.82s)]
*  I've worked with a lot of actors who are also musicians. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7363.26s)]
*  And they're always great. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7365.58s)]
*  Because I already know how to be a persona, be on stage, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7366.22s)]
*  be in front of a bunch of people, which most actors can't do. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7368.38s)]
*  And she said, actually, I studied acting before I became a singer. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7371.34s)]
*  So well, you'll never be able to be in a movie. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7373.74s)]
*  Because you know what? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7375.9s)]
*  They don't know how to shoot people out. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7376.54s)]
*  They want six months of your time. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7379.34s)]
*  And you're always on tour. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7381.42s)]
*  But if you come be here, I have a part for you. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7383.02s)]
*  I can shoot you out in half a day. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7385.660000000001s)]
*  This whole section of a movie. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7387.660000000001s)]
*  And I'll shoot your movie poster. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7388.780000000001s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7389.9800000000005s)]
*  She's like, OK. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7390.860000000001s)]
*  So she shows up. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7391.5s)]
*  I had all the sets like a conveyor belt right next to each other. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7392.3s)]
*  Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7395.42s)]
*  She's in the car. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7396.3s)]
*  That's why she had me do her music video for Rain on Me later. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7397.1s)]
*  She said, she's just going to Austin. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7399.820000000001s)]
*  Robert, put me on a grease. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7401.5s)]
*  I was throughout that whole movie. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7402.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know how we did that. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7404.46s)]
*  It was half a day. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7405.740000000001s)]
*  She was there half a day. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7406.620000000001s)]
*  I did the same for Sin City 2. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7407.740000000001s)]
*  I was like, I have a set here waiting for you. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7409.74s)]
*  If you're on tour in Houston, just drive in to Austin. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7412.139999999999s)]
*  I'll shoot you out in half a day. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7414.46s)]
*  You could be in a scene with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7415.5s)]
*  Sure. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7417.26s)]
*  She came down. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7417.5s)]
*  So wait, how do you take Robert in here? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7417.98s)]
*  How do you take Lady Gaga and solve the puzzle of all the scenes [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7419.42s)]
*  that have to be in? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7423.98s)]
*  How do we shoot them quickly, efficiently, conveniently? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7425.0199999999995s)]
*  You have to edit your own movie. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7429.099999999999s)]
*  I have this analogy, a food analogy that works really well. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7430.46s)]
*  Script is like your grocery list. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7434.78s)]
*  Filming is like grocery shopping. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7437.66s)]
*  Getting the best performances, getting the best beat, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7439.98s)]
*  getting the best ingredients. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7441.98s)]
*  Editing is like the cooking. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7445.9s)]
*  Too much of this and not enough of that. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7448.0599999999995s)]
*  You fucked the whole thing up. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7449.58s)]
*  So there's so many filmmakers do not edit. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7450.7s)]
*  And they give it to some other guy who might look at all your ingredients [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7453.42s)]
*  and go, this is all great, but I'm going to go make a fucking souffle. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7456.94s)]
*  And he makes something else. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7460.139999999999s)]
*  So by doing that job, I've worked on some big stuff. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7461.9s)]
*  And I realized finally, after many years, because I've always edited, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7466.22s)]
*  I realized this is why movies cost so much. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7468.62s)]
*  There could be 150, 200 people on the crew. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7472.06s)]
*  And I swear not one of them knows how to edit, not one. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7474.9400000000005s)]
*  So they're getting the wrong stuff. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7478.14s)]
*  They're having to reshoot shit. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7479.58s)]
*  The editor is in a room somewhere useless calling after the fact. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7481.26s)]
*  We still need to get this close up. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7485.18s)]
*  Or you got to reshoot that because it doesn't match. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7486.62s)]
*  Because no one knows editing. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7488.7s)]
*  So if you just know that you're already miles ahead of 99% of Hollywood. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7490.94s)]
*  But that's just how I learned by accident. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7497.339999999999s)]
*  So I kind of stumbled upon it. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7499.099999999999s)]
*  And I realized that's what the problem is. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7501.9s)]
*  Because across the board, I'm watching them going, that's not going to match. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7503.66s)]
*  You guys are just spending money, sending crews out, shooting stuff for this. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7507.339999999999s)]
*  It's just, it's a clusterfuck. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7511.099999999999s)]
*  Let me show you. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7512.78s)]
*  And that's how it's in city, Bruce Willis, nine days. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7514.219999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7517.58s)]
*  Brittany Murphy's in all three stories, one day. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7517.9s)]
*  Benicio Latorre, three days. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7520.46s)]
*  It's just like, you're just shooting this stuff. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7522.86s)]
*  Mickey Rourke is in a sequence with Redger Hauer. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7524.54s)]
*  We shot eight months apart. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7527.5s)]
*  I didn't have Redger Hauer until I was doing Sharkbone Lava Girl. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7529.58s)]
*  So I just shot Mickey acting with me and then I shot Redger acting with me. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7532.54s)]
*  And I just cut them together. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7535.099999999999s)]
*  What's weird is like editing exercises are like, I used to do these editing exercises [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7536.78s)]
*  where I would do my VCRs together and I would cut my movies. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7540.62s)]
*  But sometimes I would just cut a music video. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7543.259999999999s)]
*  And I cut a music video once because I was a big fan of Redger Hauer and a big fan of Mickey Rourke. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7545.0199999999995s)]
*  So I said, I want to make it look like they're in a movie together. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7549.5s)]
*  So I cut this music video together. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7551.419999999999s)]
*  But in the socials, like lightning on Redger in The Hitcher and then lightning on Mickey [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7553.58s)]
*  from Rumblefish. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7559.0199999999995s)]
*  But Rumblefish is black and white. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7559.66s)]
*  So I made the whole thing black and white. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7561.5s)]
*  I was like 19. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7563.099999999999s)]
*  I was 19 years old when I did that. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7564.0599999999995s)]
*  And then years later, I'm making Sin City. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7566.139999999999s)]
*  I shot Mickey not knowing who the other actor was going to be until I cast him eight months later. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7568.379999999999s)]
*  And it was Redger. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7571.98s)]
*  I'm cutting them together to look like they're in the same movie. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7573.02s)]
*  It's in black and white. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7575.26s)]
*  I'm like, I've done this before. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7576.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7580.780000000001s)]
*  I found that all of his like, oh my God, I already made a movie of them in black and white. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7581.26s)]
*  That's more shit, right? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7584.38s)]
*  That's the magic of creativity. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7586.06s)]
*  It's like sometimes when you have a vision, it's not clear, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7587.9800000000005s)]
*  but it's coming to you from the future. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7591.42s)]
*  So you got to just follow the voice. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7593.660000000001s)]
*  No matter what anyone says about your curtains, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7595.660000000001s)]
*  just follow the voice you got in your head because you don't know [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7598.22s)]
*  and you're not smart enough to know. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7601.82s)]
*  And you don't need to know. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7604.7s)]
*  You just need to do. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7605.82s)]
*  You just need to be the hands. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7606.7s)]
*  So this is like what you can do with no time or money when you know all those jobs. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7608.3s)]
*  It's the benefit of knowing those jobs. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7613.98s)]
*  Like I said, the more you know those jobs, the more you know your main job, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7615.26s)]
*  which is being creative, but on the day thinking on your feet. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7619.98s)]
*  So I'm going to show you this test. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7623.34s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7626.54s)]
*  So for DUSTLED on the TV series, I would always shoot the first episode and the last episode. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7626.78s)]
*  It's like a seven or eight episode season. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7631.5s)]
*  There's three seasons. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7633.580000000001s)]
*  By the time we got to the third season, I was doing a lead us. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7635.660000000001s)]
*  I couldn't do the big finale episode. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7638.700000000001s)]
*  My actor who plays the George Clooney character, DJ Katrina, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7641.42s)]
*  he's somebody who fucking wanted to be a writer was writing. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7644.540000000001s)]
*  He's wrote FIGHT AND FLY. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7647.580000000001s)]
*  This is a movie that's going to come out with Josh Arnett. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7648.9400000000005s)]
*  That's his. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7651.02s)]
*  He wrote it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7651.5s)]
*  After doing this, he was like, man, hearing you talk, you know what I got? [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7652.22s)]
*  This is what I love about you inspire people. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7656.22s)]
*  The feedback loop inspires you back. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7658.38s)]
*  Man, hearing your talk for Red 11 and the cards and I've got a script that's partially written. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7660.62s)]
*  I'm just going to go crank it out in 3D. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7665.66s)]
*  I'm going to cut off the phone in three days. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7668.62s)]
*  I'm going to finish that thing in three fucking days. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7670.22s)]
*  And he came back and he said, I finished the script and I read it. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7672.38s)]
*  And I go, you read it in three days? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7675.42s)]
*  And go, well, I wrote something before, but I just kept thinking I wasn't ready. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7677.18s)]
*  And then you told me the thing about not being ready and you said that really resonated. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7681.26s)]
*  I went and I finished it in three days. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7684.22s)]
*  I go, man, I'm going to do that. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7685.66s)]
*  I'm going to go do the DJ method. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7687.02s)]
*  I called the DJ method. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7688.38s)]
*  I have a bunch of half-baked ideas that I'm just going to go turn off the phone [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7689.42s)]
*  and finish the thing in three days. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7692.86s)]
*  I'll fix it later, but those three days, it's going to be pure pipe. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7694.86s)]
*  It's just going to be coming through because you're just going to be picking up the pen. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7698.9400000000005s)]
*  So anyway, he came to me with this idea. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7701.66s)]
*  He said, oh man, I was hoping you'd do the last episode of Dust Till Dawn [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7703.9s)]
*  because I had this great idea for a scene. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7707.34s)]
*  We're in a zombie town, western town. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7708.9400000000005s)]
*  We have those guns where you have to pull the trigger, you know, the hammer back before you [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7711.1s)]
*  can fire. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7715.34s)]
*  So I thought, what if I have a gun that's empty and I got bullets in the other hand? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7716.06s)]
*  And I bump into a zombie, the bullets go flying. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7719.82s)]
*  I jump and I catch all the bullets and shoot the guy before I hit the ground. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7722.46s)]
*  Okay. That's kind of a real cool like desperado type thing, but dude, it's just a [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7726.22s)]
*  seven day shoot for these episodes. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7730.06s)]
*  Every one of the crew will have a different idea on how to do that. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7734.38s)]
*  Stunt guy will put you on wires because you have to do all that action or [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7737.1s)]
*  the DP isn't even operating the camera. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7742.54s)]
*  It's a camera guy. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7744.62s)]
*  The director doesn't know how to shoot. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7745.5s)]
*  He's not operating the camera. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7747.26s)]
*  Your editor is in a room somewhere. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7749.74s)]
*  VFX guys aren't there. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7752.3s)]
*  She's not going to be able to ask them how to do it. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7754.06s)]
*  But I am my own VFX. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7756.3s)]
*  I came up with how we did all the shots in Sin City and all the spiking movies. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7757.74s)]
*  We need one guy to come do it. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7762.38s)]
*  I'll come do it for you. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7764.14s)]
*  I'll come do it because I'm already going to be there because I have to shoot a second unit fight [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7765.34s)]
*  scene for the other actor who wanted a cool fight scene. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7769.1s)]
*  So I was already doing that. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7770.9400000000005s)]
*  When it comes to your scene, we'll switch places because it's got to be done quick [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7772.38s)]
*  because you've got to shoot it in 20 minutes because you got a ton of other shit you got [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7775.66s)]
*  to shoot and you'll just never get it. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7779.1s)]
*  You won't even get it in a film schedule, in a regular movie schedule. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7781.34s)]
*  It's just too crazy. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7784.38s)]
*  You need somebody with a vision to do the whole thing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7785.42s)]
*  So this is what it would look like if you're on the set. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7789.18s)]
*  I'm going to show you the footage and I'm going to show you the scene. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7791.740000000001s)]
*  I have to show it to you a couple of times because you're not going to believe what you're about to [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7794.14s)]
*  see. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7796.54s)]
*  So if you were on the set, this is what it would look like. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7798.22s)]
*  So I get there. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7800.9400000000005s)]
*  They said we're ready for that scene. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7802.22s)]
*  So I get over there to the set and I go, okay, where are you coming out of? [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7803.34s)]
*  This building, where are you getting the bullets from? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7807.18s)]
*  That body. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7810.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7811.18s)]
*  Bring that body closer. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7811.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7813.18s)]
*  Stunt guy, bring a pad over. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7813.5s)]
*  I want to see you just jump and start to twist as if you're turning. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7815.26s)]
*  I just want to see how much air time you can get to get any action before you hit the pad. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7818.62s)]
*  He starts to jump. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7823.0199999999995s)]
*  He's barely starts jumping. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7823.74s)]
*  He's already hitting the pad. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7824.62s)]
*  So I was like, okay, that ain't going to work. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7825.42s)]
*  You get out of here. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7826.46s)]
*  DJ, you're going to do it. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7827.0199999999995s)]
*  I have no idea how I'm going to do this. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7829.42s)]
*  I hadn't thought about it before, but now you're there. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7830.46s)]
*  This is so awesome. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7831.98s)]
*  And now the options are very limited. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7832.7s)]
*  You're very limited. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7834.86s)]
*  Look at this sun. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7835.42s)]
*  You're going to see the sun not move. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7835.9s)]
*  You see, that's the point where the sun starts getting lost. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7837.0199999999995s)]
*  I have to shoot this in 20 minutes. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7839.259999999999s)]
*  You're going to do three jumps and I'm going to cut it to look like one jump. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7841.82s)]
*  All the bullets are going to miss. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7845.5s)]
*  The only one's going to go in. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7846.46s)]
*  So here, just follow what I'm saying. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7848.139999999999s)]
*  We don't have time. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7850.62s)]
*  What cameras do we have? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7851.099999999999s)]
*  What's on the A camera? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7852.46s)]
*  A long lens. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7853.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's my camera. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7854.139999999999s)]
*  I'll operate that. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7854.94s)]
*  What's on the B camera? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7855.5s)]
*  Steady cam. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7857.099999999999s)]
*  Leave it on steady cam. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7857.66s)]
*  No chance, no time to convert it. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7858.46s)]
*  At one point I wanted to lower it. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7860.54s)]
*  So just flip it upside down. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7863.339999999999s)]
*  We'll flop it later. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7864.46s)]
*  Give me the main camera. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7865.82s)]
*  Okay, DJ, start running towards that bullets and grab it and pretend like you get shot [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7866.54s)]
*  out of your hand. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7871.0199999999995s)]
*  I shoot it in slow motion, but I'm showing you how it would look on the set. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7871.58s)]
*  Okay, now the bullets are flying. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7874.38s)]
*  I'm going to add those digitally and I'm going to hold the bullets up to the light [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7875.82s)]
*  in each angle so that they know what it's supposed to look like so they can match that. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7879.42s)]
*  Otherwise it'll look phony. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7882.139999999999s)]
*  Now, first jump. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7884.139999999999s)]
*  I just want you to commit to just jumping out and just look at the barrel. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7885.259999999999s)]
*  Just look at the barrel on your hands when you're jumping [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7891.179999999999s)]
*  because that'll look like you're looking at the bullets. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7893.9s)]
*  And just don't even think about that you're going to catch a bullet. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7896.94s)]
*  Don't think about that you're going to start turning. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7899.339999999999s)]
*  Just stretch your body out. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7901.179999999999s)]
*  Get a really graphic look. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7902.78s)]
*  How cool that looks. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7904.94s)]
*  And then the side view, it's shot this at the same time. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7906.139999999999s)]
*  You can already tell it's going to look like bullets are missing, right? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7909.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, now I need this part though. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7914.54s)]
*  I need the part where he's catching the bullet. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7917.0199999999995s)]
*  This little window there. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7920.299999999999s)]
*  How am I going to do that? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7922.379999999999s)]
*  With a lens that long, it's going to be all out of focus. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7924.62s)]
*  It's not going to be slow motion enough. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7927.099999999999s)]
*  He even knows me and he's like, what the hell am I doing? [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7929.0199999999995s)]
*  Just lay on the pad and rock up and down. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7930.78s)]
*  And as you're coming down, that'll look like you're falling as I'm zooming in [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7933.74s)]
*  because I'm operating the camera and I'm cutting this in my head. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7937.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7940.86s)]
*  And I'm saying, just do it again. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7941.42s)]
*  He's like, what is it? [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7942.46s)]
*  Rock up and as you go down, it's going to look like you're falling. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7944.0599999999995s)]
*  Well done. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7946.7s)]
*  The bullets. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7947.58s)]
*  Okay, well done. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7947.98s)]
*  You've caught a bullet. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7949.0199999999995s)]
*  One went in. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7949.82s)]
*  Now, second jump. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7951.0199999999995s)]
*  When you do the next jump, as if we just passed those other moments, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7952.22s)]
*  you've caught a bullet already. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7956.46s)]
*  So now you're going to snap it closed and start your turn. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7957.5s)]
*  It's all you'll get before you hit the pad. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7960.62s)]
*  Snap turn. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7963.18s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7964.46s)]
*  So like, okay, I want the cameras to feel like they're dropping with them. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7964.780000000001s)]
*  That'll give you more of the sensation. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7969.18s)]
*  So let's actually lower that steady cam shot, flip it upside down and get a low angle. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7970.780000000001s)]
*  See, I look at the sun's right there. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7975.5s)]
*  Hasn't gone behind the building yet. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7976.62s)]
*  That and then my camera, I lowered my camera down and I got that. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7978.46s)]
*  Good angle. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7981.34s)]
*  Right? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7983.02s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7983.42s)]
*  Now, last jump. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7983.900000000001s)]
*  I bury a thin. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7985.820000000001s)]
*  I said, just bear me, bring me a thin mattress because I want him to do all the stunts. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7987.26s)]
*  I don't want a stunt guy because he does this himself. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7990.780000000001s)]
*  He just did it in three jumps. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7994.22s)]
*  But the audience will know they'll just be like, we believe that this guy can do anything. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7995.18s)]
*  I want you just to finish by turning and cocking the hammer back and firing before you hit the [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=7999.900000000001s)]
*  ground. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8005.740000000001s)]
*  I'll give you two takes for that. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8006.14s)]
*  Almost gets it there. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8008.14s)]
*  Then we do a second take. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8010.3s)]
*  Boom. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8011.74s)]
*  Now, the other one was probably a little better, even though you don't really see it. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8012.0599999999995s)]
*  I've got to go do everything. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8015.9s)]
*  I got to cut it. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8017.0199999999995s)]
*  I got to add the sound effects myself. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8017.66s)]
*  I got to put the music in myself because music guys would just end up filling it with music [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8019.0199999999995s)]
*  and ruin it. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8021.98s)]
*  Sound effects guys would just fill it full of sound effects and ruin it. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8022.78s)]
*  I want all the sound to drop out. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8025.099999999999s)]
*  So as he's jumping, all you hear is the wind in his jacket, the clinking of the bullets [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8027.74s)]
*  as they're bouncing off. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8032.78s)]
*  So you have this breathless moment. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8034.3s)]
*  No music. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8035.74s)]
*  Cut the music. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8036.3s)]
*  And that moment you cut it so that you're like, I wonder if he's going to make it. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8037.98s)]
*  So I go home, I cut it. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8042.62s)]
*  Before I even have the visual effects in, I just cut it that night because I cut my own [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8044.38s)]
*  sound effects. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8048.86s)]
*  I cut my sound effects in. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8049.42s)]
*  You can already tell it's going to work. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8051.099999999999s)]
*  You can already see, even with the bullets not there, you can tell by the sound where [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8052.38s)]
*  they're going to be. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8056.46s)]
*  It's going to work. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8057.58s)]
*  I call them up and say, dude, this is going to work great. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8058.7s)]
*  So then I go to the effects guys and I go, okay, there's a bullet in this frame. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8060.38s)]
*  The next frame is here because I used to animate. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8064.54s)]
*  In the next frame, it's there. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8066.3s)]
*  Then it hits the barrel and then it starts bouncing this way. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8067.26s)]
*  I want it that clear so we can follow that a bullet was supposed to go in and that it [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8069.66s)]
*  bounced way over there. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8073.9s)]
*  And then this bullet bounced way over there. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8075.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they send it back and a bunch of bullets come down. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8077.42s)]
*  No guys, listen to what I say. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8079.58s)]
*  I'm going to show you again. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8080.7s)]
*  I'm going to draw it to you again. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8081.66s)]
*  Just the sound will play like there's multiple bullets flying. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8083.26s)]
*  I don't need to see all those bullets or the eye's not going to know where to go. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8087.0199999999995s)]
*  So then they got it right. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8090.139999999999s)]
*  Brilliant. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8091.82s)]
*  And then check this out. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8092.7s)]
*  I'm going to show you two twice because you're going to believe it. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8093.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8099.82s)]
*  Changes direction. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8111.9s)]
*  Wow. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8113.0199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8117.74s)]
*  Well done. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8119.34s)]
*  You didn't even see that in a feature film. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8120.0599999999995s)]
*  Just as a director. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8123.18s)]
*  Well done. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8124.46s)]
*  Here, just one more time and I'll show you something you didn't notice both times. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8125.74s)]
*  So. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8129.66s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8148.94s)]
*  Just those decisions coming together perfectly. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8149.98s)]
*  Coming together and like this, you got minutes. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8152.139999999999s)]
*  Just moving the camera like you decided to do. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8155.82s)]
*  Works really well. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8159.099999999999s)]
*  The balancing of the matches, whatever. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8159.74s)]
*  And it's not like you have this whole plan figured out ahead. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8161.259999999999s)]
*  You're literally in the moment. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8163.5s)]
*  You're it's coming through you. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8164.54s)]
*  But you're seeing it though, right? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8165.9s)]
*  I'm seeing it because I've done it enough. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8167.339999999999s)]
*  That's why you really want to learn all those jobs because it comes to a moment like this. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8168.7s)]
*  When the shit's fucking hitting the fan, you got to know how to pull it out. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8172.94s)]
*  You could have gotten all those people together and they never would have figured that out. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8176.54s)]
*  You had one person had to see it all the way through. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8179.259999999999s)]
*  You're seeing the bullet. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8181.179999999999s)]
*  How it's going to go in the result. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8182.219999999999s)]
*  I've done enough times to know that if you don't do it just right, you're going to lose the image. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8183.98s)]
*  You're not going to know where to follow and you'll miss the point. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8188.54s)]
*  And yeah, I love that you're thinking about where the eyes of the audience will go. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8190.94s)]
*  I feel like too many people might think about some more general concept of a scene versus [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8197.98s)]
*  like the audience wears their eyes. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8204.22s)]
*  Where's their eye? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8206.54s)]
*  Well, you're drawing it through sound, through picture. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8207.02s)]
*  I'm going to show you. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8209.66s)]
*  If you notice without the sound, you don't really see him click that thing back. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8210.86s)]
*  The sound is so sensual here. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8215.5s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8216.94s)]
*  I thought I saw it. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8219.58s)]
*  You think you saw it, but you hear it. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8220.86s)]
*  And so you feel like, see, but watch it. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8222.300000000001s)]
*  It's actually, he's already finished. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8223.58s)]
*  You don't really see him do it, but you swear you saw it in a close-up because the sound is in a close-up. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8225.980000000001s)]
*  I put the sound in a close-up. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8231.26s)]
*  Now here's another thing you didn't notice. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8232.54s)]
*  He hits this ground in the first shot. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8234.300000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8236.460000000001s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8237.900000000001s)]
*  You didn't notice it because I didn't play the sound there. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8241.74s)]
*  So if you don't hear it, you don't see it. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8244.62s)]
*  And if you don't see it, but you play a sound, you hear it and you see it in your mind. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8246.86s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8251.1s)]
*  So check that out now with the sound on and you'll see both those parts play completely different. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8251.58s)]
*  Now you hear it. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8265.58s)]
*  I know you can get away with that because I know editing and I like, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8268.54s)]
*  if I don't play a sound, I can go ahead and milk that shot as long as I want. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8271.26s)]
*  I'll make him be in the air longer, even though he's actually touching the ground by not playing [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8274.14s)]
*  the sound. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8278.14s)]
*  And that comes from, you said directing, but it's not directing. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8278.779999999999s)]
*  People can direct and say, this is what I want, but to actually execute it, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8282.14s)]
*  you need to be a craftsman. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8287.099999999999s)]
*  And to be a craftsman, you have to learn all those crafts. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8288.46s)]
*  And not just with the visuals, but with the sound. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8290.859999999999s)]
*  With the sound too. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8293.019999999999s)]
*  Sound is so important. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8294.06s)]
*  Sound is after picture. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8295.099999999999s)]
*  And if you cut sound, you realize how important sound is. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8297.82s)]
*  I would learn so much by doing those movies like Desperado action movies where you go, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8300.7s)]
*  wow, the sound, I can add an extra sound effect of an extra punch. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8305.02s)]
*  He didn't even throw. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8307.900000000001s)]
*  And it sounds like he's beating the shit out of this guy. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8308.94s)]
*  And you only need to see one or two hits and you can hear five. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8311.5s)]
*  You know where you can push your limits because you've done it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8314.54s)]
*  You've done it and you've got the experience. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8316.94s)]
*  It's so amazing that you can use sound to make a person believe they saw something [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8318.62s)]
*  that wasn't actually there on the screen. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8323.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8325.66s)]
*  Your brain fills it in. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8325.900000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8327.02s)]
*  And that's why that's so important because if you don't know that, you'll be on the [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8327.82s)]
*  set shooting 10 takes of that because you're like, no, I didn't see him click it back. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8331.02s)]
*  And then see him click it back. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8336.46s)]
*  That's really needed. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8337.66s)]
*  I can do that with sound. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8338.539999999999s)]
*  Let's just go. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8340.06s)]
*  Let's just keep moving. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8340.539999999999s)]
*  And when you say sound close up, was that... [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8341.26s)]
*  All the other sound dropped away and all you hear is like the sound, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8343.98s)]
*  like the mic's right on that thing so that you hear it so big in your ear [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8347.1s)]
*  that you swear it was in close up too, but just the sound was close up. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8352.86s)]
*  Sorry, just to give an insight into that process of sound design, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8356.779999999999s)]
*  are you listening to the sound and just experiencing the feeling that creates? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8361.26s)]
*  And then you're like, that's just right. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8368.3s)]
*  I'm playing in post a lot. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8369.5s)]
*  So I have a whole library of sound effects from all my movies. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8370.859999999999s)]
*  So I can pull up the gun sound we created for Bruce Willis in Sin City and use that [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8373.98s)]
*  and mix it with Antonio's gun from Desperado. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8378.14s)]
*  I remember in four rooms, there's a scene where the bellhop [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8381.82s)]
*  goes into the hotel room, jams his key into it and clicks it. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8385.019999999999s)]
*  I used all gun sounds for the sound of the key instead of key sounds because it wasn't [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8389.58s)]
*  sound close up enough. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8393.339999999998s)]
*  So if you listen to it, you hear all these sounds from gun to do the key. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8394.46s)]
*  It's like that conveys the sound better. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8399.98s)]
*  I'll use different kinds of sounds that just have impact and put it somewhere [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8401.98s)]
*  like when he hits the ground. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8405.58s)]
*  So I like playing with all that in post when I'm editing because it makes my editing job easier. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8407.339999999998s)]
*  Sometimes it's like, oh, the sound is covering me. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8413.02s)]
*  I don't need to keep trying to massage this. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8415.1s)]
*  The sound is actually selling it. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8417.66s)]
*  And so I keep those sound effects into the final movie. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8419.5s)]
*  So it's just all part of necessary. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8421.74s)]
*  It's like being a chef. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8423.58s)]
*  You're there cooking and you're going like, I know the recipe says this, but I think it [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8424.86s)]
*  really could use jalapenos and some extra pepper and maybe a little more salt. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8428.62s)]
*  And then it needs an acid of some kind. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8432.460000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to add some lemon juice. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8433.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8434.94s)]
*  You made me realize, I'm not sure where I saw that, but you were talking about making sort [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8435.18s)]
*  of almost like home films for fun. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8438.86s)]
*  And I think you mentioned how exciting you can make a very mundane scene by just adding [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8442.060000000001s)]
*  sound. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8447.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8448.060000000001s)]
*  I think there was like a little kid for this car. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8449.18s)]
*  You have one of those little and but I added a motor sound to it and it's like, wow. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8451.5s)]
*  And it sounds realistic somehow. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8455.900000000001s)]
*  Like I don't know what my brain is doing. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8457.58s)]
*  And then we're playing with these little cars, filming ourselves playing with the cars. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8459.5s)]
*  But then I replaced it with real car sounds. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8464.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8465.98s)]
*  And it just sounds, your brain links the reality of the real thing. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8467.98s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8471.5s)]
*  You realize how unimportant the visual is and how important the sound is actually. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8471.98s)]
*  Sound is everything. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8476.939999999999s)]
*  That's what I was really lucky in Mariachi that my camera didn't work for sound because [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8477.66s)]
*  then I got really good sound that I would have gotten with a shitty mic out of frame [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8481.42s)]
*  because that's the first telltale sign of a low budget movie is bad sound. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8485.58s)]
*  Bad sound right away. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8489.74s)]
*  You can already hear all this hiss and all this mic was too far. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8490.46s)]
*  And you're like low budget movie. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8493.42s)]
*  Before your eyes even tell you the sound gives it away. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8495.1s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8498.140000000001s)]
*  The audio is first. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8499.1s)]
*  Sound is first. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8500.300000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8501.66s)]
*  Even though it's a visual medium. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8502.380000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8504.140000000001s)]
*  Just on the what's the plan with the with the four action films? [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8506.300000000001s)]
*  Like what are the next steps? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8511.82s)]
*  I'll probably direct more than one because there's already several that I want to do, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8514.06s)]
*  but I was I'm going to direct at least one, but I'm producing all three or four there [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8516.86s)]
*  at my studio. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8520.380000000001s)]
*  It does draw you in. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8521.42s)]
*  It draws you in and it makes you go now think of ideas you never would have thought of for [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8522.62s)]
*  mainly because it has a filter. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8526.460000000001s)]
*  Well now I don't have to think of all these ideas. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8527.900000000001s)]
*  I actually have like that like me on that set. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8532.380000000001s)]
*  There's only very few things I can actually come up with that are just action driven first [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8534.62s)]
*  when they have a great character. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8538.220000000001s)]
*  You'll get to it a lot faster with a filter. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8539.5s)]
*  That's the beauty of a filter is that now you've just shrunk your your target [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8541.42s)]
*  and now you can hit that target and people are coming up with ideas [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8546.94s)]
*  because now they've got proximity and they've got a reason to come up with the idea. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8550.14s)]
*  They've got a deadline, which is the best thing you can do is have a deadline [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8554.06s)]
*  because when you have a deadline you can freaking move mountains. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8557.9s)]
*  You know I had a spy kids in the theater every year three years in a row not being pre-planned [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8560.859999999999s)]
*  every year. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8566.779999999999s)]
*  There was a spy kids. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8567.18s)]
*  Now the third one was the biggest one biggest cast mostly green screen video game [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8568.06s)]
*  and the first digital 3D movie ever. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8574.14s)]
*  So getting visual effects companies to make that we realized oh I shot it with two cameras. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8575.9s)]
*  That means each effect shot has to be done twice from a different angle. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8581.5s)]
*  So I went to the studio midway through that and said there's not going to be a movie in [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8585.1s)]
*  the theaters in time. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8589.98s)]
*  You're going to have to push the date back and they said okay we've never heard you panic. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8591.5s)]
*  We'll push the date back for you. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8596.539999999999s)]
*  They called back 10 minutes later. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8598.46s)]
*  I was like oh thank god because it's really complicated. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8599.9s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to be this complicated but I wanted a challenge [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8601.98s)]
*  and they said McDonald's will sue us for 20 million dollars if you move the date. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8605.5s)]
*  You have to have a movie in the theater. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8609.02s)]
*  We started shooting that movie in January of 2003. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8611.18s)]
*  It was in 3D in theaters by July. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8614.54s)]
*  That's the fastest any effects movie has ever been done. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8618.300000000001s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8623.26s)]
*  Because you had no choice. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8623.34s)]
*  So deadline makes you do things and make decisions really quickly and it was the biggest of the three. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8624.7s)]
*  Deadlines are good and it's hard for us to self-impose a deadline sometimes because we [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8631.179999999998s)]
*  know it's a bullshit deadline and your brain knows it's a bullshit. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8635.74s)]
*  But why do deadlines work? [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8638.779999999999s)]
*  Because when the deadline is coming up what do you do? [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8640.46s)]
*  You start to put the pen to the paper and it starts just flowing. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8645.259999999998s)]
*  You have no choice. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8649.66s)]
*  You have to get out of the way and open the pipe and it just comes out and you're shocked. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8651.42s)]
*  You're like oh my god I should do everything at the last minute. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8656.14s)]
*  Well no you don't have to but if you just learn how to open that pipe earlier [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8658.14s)]
*  you wouldn't be in a rush. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8662.539999999999s)]
*  But you had to get out of your way because your deadline was up and you had to come up with it. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8663.82s)]
*  So many people are going to come up with all these extra great ideas at the last minute. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8668.06s)]
*  Looks like everyone who's already signing on because they didn't know when the deadline is. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8673.42s)]
*  They keep writing in saying when is the deadline for this? [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8678.619999999999s)]
*  And we say well when we close the funding in May. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8680.859999999999s)]
*  But we didn't say when still. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8683.98s)]
*  I think that gives them a sense of a deadline like shit it might be May 1st or maybe May 2nd. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8686.38s)]
*  So we better get my idea going. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8691.02s)]
*  So I think it works in your favor because then you come up with stuff. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8692.3s)]
*  And you're going to feel so enriched by doing the idea [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8695.1s)]
*  that you're not going to care if it gets picked or not. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8698.06s)]
*  You're going to love this idea so much it could turn into 10 other things you never even thought [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8699.98s)]
*  about. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8704.14s)]
*  That's the beauty of doing a project. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8704.86s)]
*  Nothing ever goes to waste. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8706.539999999999s)]
*  So many ideas that were sitting around that I'd come up with and put a lot of time in [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8707.74s)]
*  are now like oh I can do these now. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8712.3s)]
*  I know how to finish it now. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8715.099999999999s)]
*  I have to ask you about Alita. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8717.179999999998s)]
*  So you've done so many incredibly innovative projects. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8718.619999999999s)]
*  This is one of them. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8721.5s)]
*  It turned out to be this visual masterpiece. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8722.3s)]
*  There's a bunch of complexity, beautiful complexity about it in that it started out [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8724.46s)]
*  as a film that James Cameron was supposed to make. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8729.58s)]
*  And then you started to collaborate with him on it. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8732.22s)]
*  And these two I would say brilliant directors but with different styles like you were talking [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8735.179999999998s)]
*  about. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8739.179999999998s)]
*  And so plus there's the complexity of for people who haven't seen it. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8739.9s)]
*  You're putting this artificial creation, this beautiful photorealistic artificial creation [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8743.9s)]
*  of a human being into a real world. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8752.14s)]
*  So you have to capture the performance, not just the motion but the performance of this [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8755.5s)]
*  actor. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8760.46s)]
*  Put them into this with the power of technology into the real world. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8761.26s)]
*  So convey all the emotion, the richness of the human face. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8765.02s)]
*  Can you just speak to the process of bringing that world to life? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8768.619999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8771.26s)]
*  I mean one I never would have attempted. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8771.5s)]
*  It wasn't Jim because Jim has figured a lot of this out. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8773.26s)]
*  So just to get you again, remember like I said, hey Jim, I'm operating a study can. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8776.7s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8780.54s)]
*  Well, I'm designing a new system. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8781.1s)]
*  That's always how it is between him and I. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8782.54s)]
*  So when I went to show him Desperado when it was done, he said, you might not want to [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8784.380000000001s)]
*  sit through. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8789.02s)]
*  If you don't want to sit through it while I'm watching it, it's fine. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8789.82s)]
*  Do you want to read any of my scriptments, my treatment scripts, you know, called scriptments? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8791.82s)]
*  I said, sure. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8796.460000000001s)]
*  He goes, I have Spider-Man and I got Avatar. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8797.02s)]
*  This was in 95. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8800.38s)]
*  He was showing me the scriptment for Avatar, which there was no technology for that. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8802.38s)]
*  He was already doing stuff that didn't exist. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8807.34s)]
*  And I was reading it going like, this is a great story. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8812.94s)]
*  And he was like, I don't know how the fuck he's going to do this. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8815.02s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8817.34s)]
*  This is not even, he'd just done Terminator 2 a few years before. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8817.98s)]
*  It's like that was the thing to the art. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8821.9s)]
*  So Alita was going to be the movie he did first to prepare for Avatar. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8824.3s)]
*  And so he had already done some prep work on it. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8829.9s)]
*  It was based on a manga. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8832.38s)]
*  But before they did that, they just started doing some tests for Avatar. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8835.26s)]
*  And then as they got deeper into the test for Avatar to prepare for Alita, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8838.539999999999s)]
*  they went, I guess we're making Avatar first. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8842.14s)]
*  So Alita got kind of pushed to the side and they ended up doing it, which ended up becoming [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8844.78s)]
*  such a journey to make that movie, to get the technology to build it, to make it. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8849.5s)]
*  So I remember visiting him on the set. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8853.58s)]
*  I mean, I've known him so long. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8855.26s)]
*  I was on the set of Titanic. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8856.3s)]
*  That's how long I've been around this guy. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8857.58s)]
*  I was on the set of Titanic. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8859.5s)]
*  I was on the set with Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Eddie Furlong for the 3D [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8860.62s)]
*  ride he made for Universal a few years later. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8866.06s)]
*  So I mean, I feel like I've been around him a lot of his career. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8868.300000000001s)]
*  And to be able to visit the set of Avatar and remember him showing me like artwork they did, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8873.42s)]
*  very photorealistic. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8881.02s)]
*  And he goes, curious to see how photoreal it'll be when we're finally done with this process. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8882.220000000001s)]
*  Because you don't get to see it till it's almost done. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8887.58s)]
*  And I was like, wow, he's just shooting blind. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8889.9s)]
*  He's really talk about me shooting Mariachi, not seeing the footage. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8892.38s)]
*  He's making this whole movie, not even knowing what the end result is going to look like at all. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8896.14s)]
*  Because you're not going to know till you get there. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8900.22s)]
*  And when you get there, if you don't like it, there's not a lot you can do. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8902.38s)]
*  So I just seen him do that and have that success really made it easier for me to do Alita. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8905.98s)]
*  Because then it's like, okay, we don't know. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8910.94s)]
*  Again, we don't need to know. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8913.5s)]
*  We know we'll get there. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8915.1s)]
*  We don't know how we're going to do it. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8916.46s)]
*  We're going to start. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8917.82s)]
*  And anything that I would come up with on this movie, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8919.259999999998s)]
*  and his team, because he had all his wedding people working on it. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8922.14s)]
*  He had them all working on it too. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8924.939999999999s)]
*  I do a fast version of his process because it's a lot of live action. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8926.46s)]
*  Avatar is mostly CG. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8931.259999999998s)]
*  I have live action sets. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8933.339999999998s)]
*  You have to come to my studio because I still have the whole Alita city in my back lot. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8934.859999999999s)]
*  Well, here the troublemaker studio? [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8938.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8940.3s)]
*  That's where it was? [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8940.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was shot here. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8941.66s)]
*  So when you go see my city, I built it very resourceful. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8943.34s)]
*  This is weird. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8946.86s)]
*  It looks just like the town from Mariachi. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8947.58s)]
*  It's in my backyard. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8949.660000000002s)]
*  I'm like, it looks better than the town from Mariachi. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8950.86s)]
*  The biggest, largest standing set in the country, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8954.140000000001s)]
*  because sets are always mowed down for the next movie, but I just kept it there. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8956.220000000001s)]
*  So we just shoot it all the time for Mexico or South America or Europe or whatever. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8959.820000000002s)]
*  It's seven streets and we added digitally above it. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8963.980000000001s)]
*  The ceilings are 20 feet high. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8967.34s)]
*  You got to come see. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8970.060000000001s)]
*  You don't believe that it's here. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8970.78s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8972.46s)]
*  Where is it? [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8973.26s)]
*  North of Austin. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8973.82s)]
*  It's where the old airport was. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8974.619999999999s)]
*  So it's like on 51st street. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8975.74s)]
*  You know, it's like really close to town. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8977.1s)]
*  I would love to visit. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8979.34s)]
*  You got to come see. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8980.06s)]
*  You're not going to believe it. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8980.78s)]
*  All my props, all my stuff from all my movies. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8982.06s)]
*  So people who are, you know, investing in Brass Knuckle, that's why I say it's like [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8984.22s)]
*  a Willy Wonka movie because they're going to get to come check out all that stuff and [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8988.3s)]
*  be in proximity and see, oh, like me with that painter. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8992.78s)]
*  It's not a trick. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8996.539999999999s)]
*  He's just doing it. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8997.42s)]
*  Then you realize you can do it too. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=8999.18s)]
*  But we thought let's shoot mostly live action and we'll just replace her. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9001.5s)]
*  But we still have to figure her out. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9006.220000000001s)]
*  You have to cast the right actress. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9007.42s)]
*  And when I saw Rosa Salazar, she was just amazing. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9009.42s)]
*  She made me cry in audition for the first time. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9011.980000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, this person has some. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9013.580000000002s)]
*  If we can capture even a fourth of her facial expression, it'll bring so much life. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9015.660000000002s)]
*  And they got it one to one. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9021.740000000002s)]
*  And it really helped Jim on The Next Avatar and Weta because they got to try out a bunch [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9023.900000000001s)]
*  of things. That's why Avatar, the second Avatar way of water looks so much more refined [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9030.38s)]
*  than the first Avatar because of that middle step of doing Alita. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9035.58s)]
*  It was training ground for them. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9038.779999999999s)]
*  Can you actually educate me on the Weta process? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9040.06s)]
*  Is this like a performance capture technology? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9042.06s)]
*  Yeah, we have her in a suit for capturing her body movements, but also facial capture. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9044.779999999999s)]
*  It's a performance capture of all her performance, all her emoting. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9050.539999999999s)]
*  And we have witness cameras around everywhere to pick up where she is. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9054.14s)]
*  And everything else is real and we're just replacing her, but with someone even smaller [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9057.66s)]
*  in size. So you have to erase everything behind her. It's like a bunch of technical things you [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9062.22s)]
*  do. But the idea is to whatever performance she gives, she's such a great actress, is to capture [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9066.06s)]
*  all of that because then this character that doesn't even exist will feel very emotional. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9071.26s)]
*  You have to be tied to it. You have to feel its heart. She was the heartbeat of it. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9077.5s)]
*  So she's acting with all this? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9081.34s)]
*  Acting with all that, but it just disappears. It's not even there. We don't notice this this year. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9082.62s)]
*  It's like that. She just performed through it. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9087.66s)]
*  What were some interesting, unique, challenging things about you directing [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9090.06s)]
*  her performance in this kind of world? [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9094.14s)]
*  I just knew she had to be her. It was going to be just so easy with her. She's just so great. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9097.66s)]
*  Everything was just so real and everything was like she's that character. She becomes that [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9102.78s)]
*  character who's seen this world for the first time. No special effects going to help you with [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9106.78s)]
*  that if the performance isn't there. So it was all about getting the performance and casting the [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9110.86s)]
*  right actors. That's why you get Christoph Waltz there and you get Jennifer Connelly. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9115.66s)]
*  These masters are all on the set. You've got an amazing cast of people and that's really the heart [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9120.14s)]
*  of it so that the technology goes away. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9130.3s)]
*  How hard is it to get the actors to act when the full world is not around you? [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9133.1s)]
*  We put so much of the world around them. When you see the city, we put a blue screen way in the back [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9140.38s)]
*  to just make the city keep going. But we built the sets there, the town, we built the real set, [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9145.1s)]
*  so everything was very tangible and real. That way she had to fit into that world and be as real as [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9150.300000000001s)]
*  that because if it was all done in CG, well, then now you can fudge everything. But if you put her [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9156.380000000001s)]
*  in a real environment, that's a real challenge. That really helps them in Avatar because that [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9161.66s)]
*  whole place is created in Avatar. You could get away with a lot, but they wanted to commit to that [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9165.5s)]
*  kind of detail. In the next Avatar, that's why it just feels like you're really there. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9169.42s)]
*  It's just stunning. You get there by having something to work on like this to take the [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9174.699999999999s)]
*  technology to the next level. It was cool to be able to help, knowing that you're being helpful [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9179.5s)]
*  to him in this process and not just distracting him. But then also he liked that his artist had [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9185.02s)]
*  something else to work on besides just Avatar to just work on something different to freshen up [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9189.18s)]
*  their perspective on things and methodology. That was a really exciting movie to work on. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9196.539999999999s)]
*  That we got to shoot it here, a Jim Cameron movie here in Austin. That was the best, [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9202.46s)]
*  having him here. My whole crew who's worked with me 25, 30 years, everyone had an extra spring in [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9205.42s)]
*  their step because they're like, wow, we're working on a Jim Cameron movie. That's just a high bar [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9211.18s)]
*  of achievement for everybody working on it. Since we talked about a few other directors, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9216.54s)]
*  can you speak to the genius of James Cameron? What makes him special? You talked about some of the [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9220.46s)]
*  difference in your approach and his. He's created some of the most special movies ever also. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9225.18s)]
*  What's behind that? What would you say is interesting about the way his creative mind works? [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9231.1s)]
*  I think any of those guys, George Lucas, him, John Lassiter running into Pixar, it's a mix of, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9236.220000000001s)]
*  I got really lucky. My first job was a Photoshop because my dad had a friend who owned a Photoshop. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9243.5s)]
*  He said, your summer job. And I was 16, go work for my friend Mario. So I go to Mario's Photoshop [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9249.02s)]
*  and I'm developing pictures or you develop photos from film. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9254.380000000001s)]
*  And he said, here, take this camera home. Give me one of those cameras. Take this camera home [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9258.54s)]
*  and some film. I need you to learn how to use the camera so you can help me sell the cameras. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9263.5s)]
*  So I went home and I have a bunch of siblings. So like, well, the stars are bedhead, [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9267.5s)]
*  taking all these pictures of everybody. I take it back and he looks at the pictures when he [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9270.94s)]
*  develops, he's like, whoa, these are really creative. You're a creative person. Sometimes [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9274.78s)]
*  people tell you something that you can't unhear. And he goes, that's a gift. What you need to know [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9281.26s)]
*  now, now you need to become technical because most creative people need technicians. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9288.22s)]
*  And technicians always need creative people because they're not usually the same. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9292.3s)]
*  You were born with creativity. It's against your nature to be technical, but you can learn if you [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9295.82s)]
*  apply yourself. And if you're both technical and creative, you'll be unstoppable. And I was like, [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9300.779999999999s)]
*  stop. Wow. So here, I want you to learn zone photography, I want you to learn this, [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9308.22s)]
*  the technical part of it. So that's why I didn't take a crew in Mariachi because I knew [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9312.939999999999s)]
*  if I'm just the creative person and I need a crew to go actually technically make the movie, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9317.74s)]
*  I'll always need something. And when you want to really change your life, you want to get your, [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9323.42s)]
*  I need list down to little as possible. Cause if you're like, well, I want to shoot my movie, [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9328.460000000001s)]
*  but I need a cameraman and I need somebody who knows how to lie to your, your, I need list keeps [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9335.5s)]
*  growing. That's further and further and further you will be from what you need to accomplish. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9339.82s)]
*  So I kind of went down there without any help. So that remember that script analogy where the [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9344.62s)]
*  guy said, throw away three scripts. I said, no, I'm going to write three scripts and then shoot [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9349.980000000001s)]
*  each one. So I get better at each one of those jobs so I can learn to be technical. My technical [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9354.300000000001s)]
*  compatibility was so little. Like I'm literally calling the guy on the phone. How do I use this [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9359.660000000002s)]
*  camera? You know, that's how little I knew about it, but I knew by doing the job I would learn [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9363.42s)]
*  by being both. That's really the key. So Jim Cameron is like that Jim Cameron, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9368.62s)]
*  when you think of those guys, George Lucas, very technical and very creative. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9373.5s)]
*  John Lassner, very technical, but very creative. Pixar, Jim Cameron, very technical, very creative. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9376.7s)]
*  Putting those two things together is really what sets you apart from other technicians and other [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9382.94s)]
*  creative people. And it's very, very powerful. And a lot of creative people, again, it's against [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9387.74s)]
*  their nature to be technical. They don't want to do it. Make yourself do it. Read the manuals, [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9391.66s)]
*  take the lessons. It frees you up because then you can go do like, you know, I just showed you in that [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9396.38s)]
*  demo, you're able to now be a technical person and creative, and then you're unstoppable. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9401.18s)]
*  He's one of the best at it. And he just knows how to craft a story. He's very analytical as well. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9405.74s)]
*  Like we bounce off each other in a funny way. He goes, man, he came down to visit my studio [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9412.06s)]
*  before he did Alita. And he went, you only surround yourself with people who are like you. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9418.14s)]
*  Like you exude creativity from every pore. And so does everyone at your studio. And I go, yeah, [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9424.220000000001s)]
*  I didn't hire them that way on purpose. But I think if you're not that way, you kind of [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9430.22s)]
*  belong there and you kind of leave. And then I went to his studio and there are a bunch of [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9433.5s)]
*  Jim Camerons there. They're like, oh my God, they're all very technical. You can't get all [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9438.22s)]
*  kind of fuzzy with the logic or the, you can't get really creative with the physics or anything. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9443.82s)]
*  They're like, no, that's not how it would work. It would be like, and they're just, wow, super [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9449.66s)]
*  great at what they do. Bar is sky high and they're all like that. Cause yeah, if you're not part of [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9455.26s)]
*  it, if you're not like that, you can't hang with those guys. You can't hang with him very long. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9461.34s)]
*  I heard a story where the guitar case being a rocket launcher, where to you, you create this [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9465.900000000001s)]
*  real world where everything is possible. The magic feels real. And for James Cameron, he has to know [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9471.02s)]
*  how a guitar case would work. That would actually be able to double as a rocket launcher. When I [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9476.060000000001s)]
*  showed him the trailer for greenhouse and he sees the machine gun laying and all that, he just goes, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9479.820000000002s)]
*  whoa, that's unbridled filmmaking from the ID. It makes sense only the second you're watching it, [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9483.1s)]
*  not a second after, but the second you're watching it and you believe it. But he's really [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9489.26s)]
*  interesting in that he's so prolific. I walked into his writing studio and it'd be like on one [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9494.06s)]
*  of the tables. Like, do you have those papers there? Imagine them that thick, that thick, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9501.18s)]
*  that thick, all script, script, script. What are these? He goes, this is a whole space opera [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9505.82s)]
*  version of this movie. We're not making that one. It's like, he's cranking out all this stuff. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9511.1s)]
*  Like again, can I take this and go make this, please? Yeah, we bounced off each other because [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9515.34s)]
*  I loved his analytical part of his brain. I'm not that analytical. I'm just kind of like, [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9520.78s)]
*  hey, I'm really creative feeling. I'm like, woo, I'll go this way and then woo, I'll go that way. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9524.86s)]
*  And he likes that about me. But I like, I want to because I think about things too much. Like, [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9528.300000000001s)]
*  you think about things like what makes a movie a billion dollar hit? What are the elements that [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9534.62s)]
*  you need? And I'm going to analyze that and I'm going to make sure my movie does that. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9540.78s)]
*  He engineers a submarine that can break the world record. He engineers a movie that can break the [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9546.060000000001s)]
*  world record. He has that engineering mind, but the creative part, that's very rare. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9552.220000000001s)]
*  So that's very rare and he's capitalized on both. He had this submarine model like this big on his [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9557.42s)]
*  desk, the one that he broke the world record for going and just seeing it and knowing he even [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9562.94s)]
*  have kids and stuff and wife. And I'm like, weren't you afraid going down there with, [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9568.14s)]
*  you know, something could happen? It's like, no, I wasn't afraid. Like, why not? And he was, [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9573.82s)]
*  because I designed the escape vehicle. Yeah, if it was any other bozo, I'd be afraid. But he designed [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9579.66s)]
*  the escape. That kind of confidence, that's him. He just knows if some other bozo had designed the [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9584.539999999999s)]
*  escape vehicle, I would be afraid. But total confidence, because he did it. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9589.82s)]
*  The confidence of extreme competence is brilliant. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9593.58s)]
*  Just to get you excited about how creative this stuff is. So Desperado was the only movie [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9596.94s)]
*  on the Sony lock being edited digitally. Not only was I editing on a computer, I was editing in my [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9602.46s)]
*  house, which in 1994 was just unheard of. So I'm there in my house and they made me cut in LA [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9609.34s)]
*  because at first I told the studio, I want to edit Desperado myself because it's important that [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9614.539999999999s)]
*  I edit it. They go, no, you can't. Why not? We've never had a director edit his own movie here. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9618.3s)]
*  So we don't want to set a precedent. Okay. So they thought it would give you too much power. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9625.9s)]
*  This is the power of precedent. I said, well, you bought Mariachi and I edited that. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9630.539999999999s)]
*  So I said, okay, but you're going to have to edit in LA so we can watch you because we don't [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9637.66s)]
*  think you know what you're doing. We saw the footage and the shots are really short. It's too [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9641.099999999999s)]
*  short. I was like, shots are too short. Oh, cause I was shooting my cuts. You know, like they're [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9644.94s)]
*  used to seeing footage of Antonio walks into the bar and he's going to be a dialogue scene. They [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9650.460000000001s)]
*  expect the whole thing done from a wide shot. I would shoot the wide shot. He walks in, cut, [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9653.980000000001s)]
*  move the camera. Let's get over here. Cause we went into it. So I'm not going to use it for the rest [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9657.9s)]
*  of the scene. I know we're going to get into coverage because I've already cut it. So I was [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9660.94s)]
*  like, huh, that's interesting. So I cut the first scene. If you've ever seen Desperado, the first [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9663.9s)]
*  scene is the best scene. Steve Buscemi is telling a story. He's talking about the myth of the [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9667.1s)]
*  Mariachi. He's doing it. It's crazy. It's crazy. So then they come over. I say, hey, come see my [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9669.980000000001s)]
*  first scene. So they come over to my house. They watch it. Okay. You know what you're doing. They [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9674.86s)]
*  leave, but I was cutting Desperado in my house that I rented there. And then we shot Dust till Dawn [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9679.5s)]
*  at the same time. So I was cutting Desperado four rooms and Dust till Dawn myself. I'm the editor. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9684.300000000001s)]
*  I don't have an editing team other than the ones who imported into the machine. So Del Toro came [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9688.060000000001s)]
*  over. Soderbergh came over. Can I borrow it for Schizophilus? No one had heard of somebody having [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9693.900000000001s)]
*  an avid in their living room. Jim comes over and he goes, I hear you have an avid in your living [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9698.460000000001s)]
*  room. And then I go, yeah, come check it out. I'm just like, I roll out of bed. It's like, [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9704.3s)]
*  sounds unremarkable because this is what you do right now. But back in 94, it was unheard of. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9709.74s)]
*  I'm cutting three movies at the same time myself. I roll out of bed. I come here. I can cut [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9715.179999999998s)]
*  Desperado. I can cut Dust till Dawn. He went, that's it. I hate working with editors. You know, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9719.34s)]
*  when I was doing Terminator 2, they wouldn't even let me put the Bad to the Bone song in Terminator [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9723.5s)]
*  2 because they didn't think it would work. And I had to sneak into the edit room at night on the [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9728.539999999999s)]
*  weekend to cut it in and show them the next day. It's like, that's your own movie. You can't give [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9732.46s)]
*  that kind of power to people. He said, I hate working with editors. I'm going to do this. I'm [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9737.099999999999s)]
*  going to tear down a wall in my house. I'm going to put it in an avid. I'm going to cut my next [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9741.5s)]
*  movie. And he did. He got an Oscar for editing Titanic. He had two other editors, but now no one [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9743.98s)]
*  ever took him for a ride like that again. He edits on every movie. He has other editors, [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9748.22s)]
*  but he can go do his own cuts. When he shows me footage, he's showing me himself on his own [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9752.539999999999s)]
*  machine. And it's like, again, it gives you all those tools to be able to really find your vision [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9757.42s)]
*  that you're looking for because you can't always explain it to somebody because you don't always [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9764.38s)]
*  know yourself. It's part of, you kind of come up with it as you do the process. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9767.58s)]
*  It's just a small tension about the different software and the technologies involved. So you [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9770.62s)]
*  mentioned avid as Premiere Pro. Premiere was still in its early stages then. I think Soderbergh [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9774.22s)]
*  looked at it and it said, yeah, I can't afford an avid for this movie. I'm going to go do it. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9779.26s)]
*  I think he started cutting on Premiere, but I'm sure it's all better now. I've always used an [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9783.26s)]
*  avid because I just always ran it back to the same production. I don't have to buy a new one, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9788.14s)]
*  but there's lots of good stuff. I've heard about all kinds of systems. I just use the same one. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9792.62s)]
*  That's the question I have for you. It's just interesting for people. It's very interesting [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9796.86s)]
*  to me just the details. Use avid. What do you like? Multiple monitors, one monitor? [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9800.22s)]
*  I have a couple of monitors and then one big monitor to watch it if I'm watching the scene [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9805.18s)]
*  back because the monitors are still a little wacky. If I were to design my own system, [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9809.5s)]
*  I'd probably design it differently. But I've worked on that thing since 94. I still don't [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9813.18s)]
*  know all the shortcuts and all that shit. I still use it like my tape deck. Play, rewind, pause, [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9818.86s)]
*  and I can cut so fast with that. I don't use the mouse for shortcuts. I'm just like, [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9823.9s)]
*  ba-dum. So you found your way, preferred way, the workflow of using it and now you can [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9827.66s)]
*  let go of the technical and then be creative. Yeah, just be creative. It's just a tool. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9835.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter what system it is. If you can get it to work for you, great. There's a lot of [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9839.58s)]
*  problems I have with it that I know are probably fixed on another system but that they'll have a [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9843.980000000001s)]
*  whole other set of problems. So it's like, well, why bother with that? There's limitations I think [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9848.060000000001s)]
*  that it has that would need to be fixed, but not for what I'm doing. I can still do what I need. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9852.86s)]
*  It feels like part of the artistry is every system has limitations and you learn how to work around [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9857.5s)]
*  those limitations. I mean, that's every single thing. Oh, yeah. Well, look at my first VCRs. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9862.46s)]
*  Those things were, I was always known for taking what little basic equipment and milking the shit [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9868.06s)]
*  out of it, pushing the boundaries of what it can do. And now it's flipped. Now you're working on a [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9873.74s)]
*  program and you can spend 10 years on this thing and you're scratching the surface of what it's [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9879.339999999998s)]
*  capable of. It's totally flipped the other way. I'm not milking anything anymore. I'm barely [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9883.339999999998s)]
*  getting the smallest capability of it because I would have to spend a lot of time to figure out [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9888.86s)]
*  all the stuff that it can possibly do. And I'm sure it's all great, fantastic stuff, [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9894.94s)]
*  but what a different world than when I grew up where it was like, okay, let me splice these two [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9898.54s)]
*  sound things together. And it was so hard to get it to do. People would be like, you got that movie [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9903.26s)]
*  out of that equipment? Where now it's the other way around. It's like all this equipment is great. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9908.86s)]
*  So when people come to me and say, I've only got this camera. I was like, that camera's 10 times [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9913.1s)]
*  better than anything I had for my first 15 years of filmmaking. So you have no complaints. This is [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9918.22s)]
*  like, you can just start now and just start making stuff. I have a lot of friends who are huge fans [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9924.22s)]
*  of your movies. So one of them asked me that I absolutely must ask you, do you know if there's [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9928.699999999999s)]
*  sequel of Alita coming? We're working on it. We're definitely working on it. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9933.42s)]
*  Jim and I both want to make it. That's usually when we meet, we talk about it. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9937.5s)]
*  I gave him something to read. He's a little busy with his Avatar movie, but I'm going to get, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9942.22s)]
*  I'm going to see him again soon and we'll see where it's at. But we would love to make another [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9947.74s)]
*  one. We have ideas on how to do it because it was always built to be a trilogy. And he sees that [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9951.26s)]
*  there's a lot of love for it. It was just weird because it was Fox movie and then got bought by [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9955.66s)]
*  Disney. And then they weren't really making Fox movies because they had enough work with their [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9960.86s)]
*  Disney movies. But now they're starting to make some Fox movies. Like they did Deadpool and [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9966.78s)]
*  some Fox movies are starting to get made. So time might be right for us to come back and do an Alita. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9970.78s)]
*  I hope you do soon. But it is, I mean, you do so many different kinds of movies. That's a whole [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9977.5s)]
*  different kind of puzzle, right? Yeah. No, but it's not a bad one. It's a good, it's a cool, [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9983.98s)]
*  it's one of the few, like usually I make kids, family kids movies or R rated action horror movies. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9987.9s)]
*  And that was the first time I got to do a PG-13 movie, which was kind of like it had a lot of [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9994.220000000001s)]
*  action, but it was for families could watch it too. And it's kind of like the best of all worlds. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=9997.9s)]
*  Have to ask you about Sin City. One of my favorite films of all time. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10001.98s)]
*  It was a visually stunning world. What are some maybe interesting detailed aspects about you [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10005.34s)]
*  creating that world? This is why you just got to follow your nose and you can do something. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10012.460000000001s)]
*  Jim and I were both into 3D early on. Like I visited his set for the Terminator 3D ride. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10017.42s)]
*  Dust till Dawn, I wanted to be 3D. Actually, when they got to the bar, [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10022.06s)]
*  if you watched from that point on, everything's kind of set up for three, everything was shooting [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10026.62s)]
*  into the camera and all this, but the cameras they had for 3D and film were still those old shitty [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10029.9s)]
*  ones that were so bad that I went, okay, we can't do it. But I really wanted people to have to put [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10034.54s)]
*  on glasses when they got into the bar and it was going to turn into a 3D different movie. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10038.86s)]
*  I got to do that on Spike It's 3D. So when I did Spike It's 3D, I thought, oh, if I get Jim's [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10044.060000000001s)]
*  cameras that he's done for these underwater 3D documentaries, I can make the first digital 3D [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10049.980000000001s)]
*  film for theaters. And so I did. And it seemed like the easiest way was to utilize that when [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10057.34s)]
*  you put on the glasses, when you go into a game world. So there's a green screen and we shot all [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10063.5s)]
*  the actors on green screen for all the game stuff. And we can do a lot of 3D stuff coming at kids' [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10067.58s)]
*  faces when they're reaching. My 3D is not like the kind they have in theaters where it's very [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10071.82s)]
*  polite. Mine's like theme park 3D where kids are doing like that, trying to grab. That's why it was [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10076.54s)]
*  such a big hit. Nobody does 3D like that. But I wanted that. I wanted shit following people's [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10081.5s)]
*  laps. So you remember, so you would go, okay, this is why I'm wearing the glasses. I'm wondering why. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10086.54s)]
*  And when I went to go make my next movie, so this is how crazy is what we shot [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10092.22s)]
*  Spike It's 3D. Remember actually how fast they came out. That was in the summer of 2003. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10096.539999999999s)]
*  Few months later, once upon a time, Mexico came out. Two number one movies, both were finishing [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10100.86s)]
*  trilogies of mine. And each one starred Antonio, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin. When I was editing [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10106.619999999999s)]
*  those at the same time, you'd be like, whoa, one movie they're killing people. The other ones are [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10113.98s)]
*  like with the kids going like, hey, family. So it was really, you know, fun. It was fun to, [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10117.1s)]
*  it's easier to do very different things than to do like two action movies or two family movies [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10121.5s)]
*  at the same time. But I was like, okay, what's my next movie going to be? Oh shit, how crazy is [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10125.18s)]
*  this? Okay. So Antonio is on the set. I'm going to shoot him out in half a day for Spike It's 3D [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10130.140000000001s)]
*  because he's only in the last scenes on the green screen. Shoot him till lunch. Okay. Now go away, [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10135.66s)]
*  put on your desperado outfit because we owed some shots for Once Upon a Time Mexico on the green [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10141.34s)]
*  screen. He finished two trilogies in the same day. That's gotta be a first if ever, no one's ever [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10144.7s)]
*  finished two trilogies in the same day. And it's just kismet, you know, it's just how it happened [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10150.300000000001s)]
*  to happen that day was just luck or the universe or whatever. But I needed to make something new [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10155.02s)]
*  now. So I was looking through my bookshelves of inspiration and I picked up my Sin City books, [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10160.86s)]
*  which I've had, I used to be a cartoonist and I always loved how he drew that. Every time I'd see [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10166.78s)]
*  a different edition, I'd buy it, go home and go, oh, I already have this. I got like three copies [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10171.18s)]
*  of this already. And he would just always grab me by the throat. And I liked that he was a writer [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10174.78s)]
*  director in a way, because he would not just wrote the comic, but he drew it too. A lot of times it's [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10179.1s)]
*  a different writer or different comic artists. He's like a real, like a kinship, you know, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10183.66s)]
*  this is someone who writes and directs his own thing. But I was looking at it and I went, oh [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10187.98s)]
*  shit, I know how to do this now. I just did it on the green screen. If I shoot this on green screen, [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10192.06s)]
*  the actors on green screen, I can make the backgrounds look just like this and I can contrast [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10195.74s)]
*  up the actors and I could get this very graphic look, which sometimes for a window, it's just a [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10200.46s)]
*  white box. So it's even got a sliding scale for budget. If I run out of money, just put the actors [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10205.339999999998s)]
*  in black and white, just put like a white dot behind them for street light. And that looks [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10211.58s)]
*  just like the book. So I'm going to bring the book to life. So I'll show you how fast we go from [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10214.859999999999s)]
*  development at Troublemaker. It was October. Once upon a time, Mexico had come out. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10221.099999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, I know how to do this now. Sin City. I'm going to do a test. I went to my [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10227.82s)]
*  green screen here in my studio. You'll see my green screen where I shot all these movies. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10233.42s)]
*  And I shot, you know, my sister, myself, put it black and white. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10237.66s)]
*  Looks just like the comic, but it's moving. So I call a comic book artist friend of mine, [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10243.1s)]
*  Mike Allred. And I said, do you have Frank Miller's number? And he goes, yeah, I do. Okay. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10249.02s)]
*  I'm going to call him up. So I called Frank Miller. Hey, this is Ron Rodriguez. I have a [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10252.86s)]
*  test I'm going to show you for Sin City. I'm going to be in New York tomorrow. He's like, [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10257.02s)]
*  tomorrow? Okay. Yeah, sure. Come by. Meet me at this bar. Okay. Book a flight for New York. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10260.460000000001s)]
*  I fly up there, have my laptop just like this. I go to the bar. I show him what looks like an [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10265.74s)]
*  image from his comic and it starts moving. And he's like, wow, how did you do that? I said, [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10272.86s)]
*  I got my own studio and all this. And I started telling him, man, let's make this movie because [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10278.460000000001s)]
*  no one had the rights to it. He never gave the rights to a studio. A lot of comics, [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10282.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, Warner Brothers bought this a while back, you know, or then you got to go through the studio. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10287.1s)]
*  He still owned his own rights. In fact, he'd gotten burned by Hollywood so many times as a screenwriter [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10291.1s)]
*  that he said, fuck it. I'm going to go back and draw a comic that's so raw that can never be made [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10296.3s)]
*  into a movie. So Chris, I call him, hey, let's make a great movie. I show him how we can do it. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10300.539999999999s)]
*  And I go, I know you don't know me and you're not going to, you're going to have to earn, [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10305.74s)]
*  I have to earn your trust for you to give me your baby. But we can make this right away. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10310.06s)]
*  And he's like, he's all excited for about two seconds. And then he goes, Oh no, then we got [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10315.82s)]
*  to write a script and the studio is going to have notes. All that shit he's been through before. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10321.66s)]
*  It's not like that. I have a whole different setup. I got my own studio in Austin. This is [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10325.74s)]
*  how it's going to be. If you like this idea, I'm going to, you're not going to have to take any [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10329.58s)]
*  risk. Let me take all the risk. I'm going to go write the script myself next month. It's going to [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10333.74s)]
*  be unremarkable because I'm going to write it right out of your book. I'm going to just go to, [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10339.34s)]
*  I'm going to edit through the stories down. I'm going to just take stuff out. Really. You might [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10341.98s)]
*  add a few things to connect it, but I'll write the script in December myself, no money involved. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10344.7s)]
*  Then we'll call some actor friends of mine. We'll have them come to my green screen. We'll shoot [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10349.98s)]
*  the opening scene as a test, but it's also the opening scene. I'll do the effects myself. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10353.26s)]
*  I'll do the sound, do the music. I'll do fake credits. We'll watch it together. If you like [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10360.22s)]
*  what you see, we'll make the movie. You gave me the rights then. If you don't like it, keep it. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10365.9s)]
*  It's a short film to show your friends. Let's be really cool. So he's like, all right. There's [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10370.46s)]
*  nothing on him to do. It's all on me. I write the script in December, January, Josh Arnett, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10375.74s)]
*  Marlee Shelton come down, fly Frank in. We're shooting for 10 hours on my green screen. We [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10381.02s)]
*  shoot that opening sequence. Incredible opening sequence. Record his voiceover right then in my [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10385.82s)]
*  little voiceover booth. Marlee Shelton comes up. Why did I hire him to kill me? I don't know. Let's [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10390.78s)]
*  go ask Frank. He's right here. Let's go ask Frank. I want to know myself. So he tells her, and he's [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10396.7s)]
*  like, I want to do this movie. He's already, I tell you Frank, I used to be a cartoonist. It's [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10401.34s)]
*  the same thing. You're already a director. You're just using a pen instead of a camera. The [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10406.300000000001s)]
*  performances you get out of your paper actors are phenomenal. The shots you do are beyond any DP's [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10411.18s)]
*  ever done. And the visual look, we've never seen that. I want to just take this and make it move. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10416.7s)]
*  I just want the comic to move. Any other studio would just go make it look like any gritty crime [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10421.34s)]
*  movie and they would miss the point that the visual is half of it. I want it to look just like this [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10426.300000000001s)]
*  because it would be the boldest movie anyone's seen because that's how it reads when I read the [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10431.34s)]
*  book. It's like if this was moving, it would be the most phenomenal movie. In fact, I asked him, [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10434.86s)]
*  do you ever feel like directing any of these short ones? I thought about directing the Big Fat Kill [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10439.42s)]
*  maybe as a short film. You should come direct that one. Shit, you should direct all of them with me [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10445.02s)]
*  because I'm really copying it right out of the book. You should direct it with me. All right, [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10448.220000000001s)]
*  let's go. So then January. Okay. So remember I met him in November. I wrote it in December. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10450.7s)]
*  January, we shoot the test. It took me a couple of weeks to do the effects. He loves it. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10457.5s)]
*  I make a meeting with Bruce Willis, show it to Bruce Willis. What's so cool about doing that opening [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10461.74s)]
*  scene is that any actor I show it to now, I show them the book, which is awesome. You'd be playing [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10466.380000000001s)]
*  this character, but look at this test. Let me show you the book, what it looked like before I [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10471.98s)]
*  turned this test into a test. He watches it, Josh Arnett, voiceover, music, titles come on, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10475.74s)]
*  first name on the screen, Bruce Willis. And he goes, hey, look, you're in the credits. You have [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10484.14s)]
*  to do it now, manifesting it. He's like, shit, man, this is great. I'm in. He's in. Go get everyone [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10487.98s)]
*  else from that was just easy to get. And we were filming the movie. So February, [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10495.26s)]
*  building the few little sets we had, like the bar. I told Frank, we don't need to build a bar, [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10503.82s)]
*  but I'm going to go ahead and build a bar so we have a place to go have script meetings. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10507.18s)]
*  Everything else will be green screen. We'll build fake steps and things out of green. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10510.06s)]
*  So we're doing that and I'm casting the first one. We're shooting the movie by March, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10513.42s)]
*  the beginning of March. And I remember because my son was born March 3rd. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10517.1s)]
*  And I was in LA for his birth because I was also recording the orchestra for the score. I wrote [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10521.34s)]
*  somehow in the past few months for Kill Bill 2. That's how much stuff was going on. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10529.820000000002s)]
*  That's like when you just let it flow, you're just riding the wave. You're not doing any of that. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10536.060000000001s)]
*  So that's what's by staying in that like urgent, there's always the deadlines are just pushing you [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10544.78s)]
*  to create stuff. And we shot the movie so fast in record time. Now, not only that, [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10550.06s)]
*  I shot a whole other movie that year. I shot the Adventures of Sharkboy Lava Girl with kids [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10554.06s)]
*  that came out two months after Sin City the next year. Within less than a year, Sin City was out. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10559.18s)]
*  You're shooting that in parallel with Sin City. That's hilarious. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10563.019999999999s)]
*  Is that correct? Yeah. Like sometimes we'd be shooting with the kids and then in the afternoon, [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10565.42s)]
*  Rudger Hauer would come and some of the Sin City girls to finish shooting stuff that we needed to [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10568.38s)]
*  film. It was just insane how fast we had to move. I was doing it. I was editing. I just edited it. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10572.22s)]
*  And then I would scan the artwork into the computer and I would edit the storyboards [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10578.86s)]
*  with the sound effects and I would do the voiceover. I would imitate Mickey and I would [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10586.300000000001s)]
*  imitate Bruce and lay out how fast it was going to move. And you were like, wow. So now we have a [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10589.900000000001s)]
*  template with the real drawings and the lighting on how we're going to do it. It was funny because I [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10595.18s)]
*  could do pretty good in Bruce Willis because I know his career is so long. If you're doing his [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10599.58s)]
*  voiceover and he would hear my guide voice for the timing and he'd be like, is that me? Is that you? [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10602.86s)]
*  I can't tell. That one was me. But just do that. It's like, man, it sounds like me. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10608.86s)]
*  First of all, why haven't films like that been made? [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10614.7s)]
*  Well, it's a very specific look because it went into that comic. The first piece of music I wrote [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10618.54s)]
*  for that was the main title and I called it Descent. I wanted the notes to descend because [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10622.78s)]
*  it felt like you were descending into this dark world and you don't come out to the end of the [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10626.380000000001s)]
*  movie. You're just like in this world where all these layers of unreality, like water doesn't [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10629.900000000001s)]
*  photograph that way, snow doesn't, but it's there and you're seeing it and you're seeing the actors. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10635.34s)]
*  So you're just really, it's like a dream world. So I was really into it and I did tests for the [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10639.26s)]
*  most difficult shots first. How do I get his tape to glow in the dark, like in the comic, [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10644.86s)]
*  so it's still in the shadow? And I realized, oh, use fluorescent tape and a fluorescent light. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10650.7s)]
*  That way I can keep it, we can still key it. I started just doing my own visual effects like that [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10654.7s)]
*  early on because I knew technology was changing so fast that I wouldn't need to just know how to do [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10660.78s)]
*  it like a magician. Shooting digital, nobody wanted to touch digital back then. DPs were all [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10666.220000000001s)]
*  afraid of digital. Did anyone have to learn something new? So I had to DP it. So me photographing [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10671.5s)]
*  it, I'm like, so funny, cut, because I mean to light, like you have to have that light out of [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10676.62s)]
*  frame right now, but I could bring the lights in right here as long as they're not crossing it. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10681.980000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to take it out of the green anyway. So I could have the coolest light on everybody, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10687.58s)]
*  cool edge lights. You could have an edge light back here, an edge light back here, [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10691.26s)]
*  a fill light here, and I didn't erase them. I just take him out. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10694.86s)]
*  Can you educate me and people curious about this? Like what is the power of light [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10697.66s)]
*  when you're telling a story, when you're creating a feeling and experience? Like [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10703.58s)]
*  what's the artistry of that? Well, if you look at the drawings too, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10707.1s)]
*  sometimes it's the absence of light. Like you would see this face, but then this would be completely [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10710.3s)]
*  black, but you would still see my eye, which is like impossible, right? But you believe it when [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10715.1s)]
*  you see it because it's there. So things like that were a lot of the tricks I tried first, [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10719.26s)]
*  because I liked that about it. It's like you have a guy completely backlit, so there's no light on [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10723.42s)]
*  his face, but yet his glasses are glowing white. So we'd put fluorescent tape in there, hit that [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10727.58s)]
*  with a light, then we could turn it white later. The black and white really helps. And then just [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10732.220000000001s)]
*  upping the contrast. But I mean, it's just something that you have a feeling for, but you're able to [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10735.98s)]
*  try it. In fact, when I took it to George Lucas, who George Lucas said this to me early on, [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10741.26s)]
*  because we're the only guys shooting digital. He said, man, it's so good you live in Austin. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10746.14s)]
*  That's why I'm in Marin County. Because when you live outside of this box of LA, [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10751.74s)]
*  Hollywood, you think outside of the box automatically. You're just going to stumble [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10756.54s)]
*  upon innovations. And he was right. It was like, yeah, why aren't we shooting digital? [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10759.9s)]
*  Let's shoot digital. Why are we shooting digital 3D? Let's do that. Why don't we just use green [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10763.98s)]
*  screen for the background? You just start innovating because you're away from anyone [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10766.78s)]
*  saying, hey, you can't do it that way, which they would say if I was in LA. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10770.7s)]
*  So we just came up with a whole other method. So I took him to Sin City to check out the first [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10774.54s)]
*  thing I was going to show at Comic-Con. He said, now this will really show people what [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10779.26s)]
*  digital is capable of. This really shows how along guard you can get with that shit, [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10783.980000000001s)]
*  that you could never have done that on film. And so by me versing myself in that technology early, [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10789.5s)]
*  I was able to make a movie like that. And then everyone had to play catch up. So you should [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10795.66s)]
*  always just follow your ‚Äì that's why people say, don't use those curtains as they're going to work. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10800.46s)]
*  Just blow past those guys. Go innovate your own thing because sometimes not knowing is better. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10804.7s)]
*  Being too naive to ‚Äì don't you know you shouldn't have been able to make that movie that way? [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10811.66s)]
*  People would say like, how did you make a movie at Marist for $7,000? It's impossible. Why do you [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10816.94s)]
*  keep using that word? Because it can't be impossible if I did it because I'm not that smart. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10822.62s)]
*  And it's like saying, how did you get to the top of Mount Everest? It's impossible. Well, [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10827.58s)]
*  I just kept walking. I didn't realize it was kind of at a slope. I didn't really realize it was going [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10831.26s)]
*  up that high. Yeah. You've talked about like a big part of your approach to filmmaking to life is [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10836.54s)]
*  manifesting. Manifesting the reality you want. In fact, I should sort of comment. I would love to [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10841.660000000002s)]
*  ask you about manifesting. You asked me at the beginning of this conversation, do you consider [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10847.98s)]
*  yourself a creative person? I should sort of reflect on that because I was very uncomfortable [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10853.26s)]
*  answering that. Yeah, I noticed a little bit. And I was like, I'm going to free you up so that you're [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10858.22s)]
*  never uncomfortable again. It's scary to say that about yourself. Because you think there's a lot of [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10862.38s)]
*  people who go, well, you're not an artist. You're not a creative person. But you're not saying I'm [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10867.98s)]
*  an artist. I'm saying I'm a creative person. But that's an artist too, isn't it? An artist [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10871.42s)]
*  isn't necessarily a guy with the French mustache and the funny hat. That's not necessarily an artist. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10874.86s)]
*  Artists are regular people. And regular people relate to art that's imperfect. If you can make [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10879.1s)]
*  art that's perfect, don't want to relate to it. So when you think about it like that, you go, [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10883.900000000001s)]
*  well, I can make imperfect art. So yeah, I'm an artist. And if you have doubt, you're an artist. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10887.980000000001s)]
*  That's an artist. Real artists always wonder if they're good enough. So you are an artist. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10893.34s)]
*  Just by the fact that you had uncomfortable saying it, you're a real artist. Yeah. And there's some [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10897.18s)]
*  degree, I don't know if you could speak to this, but there's a fear of creating [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10902.46s)]
*  shitty things. I've created a lot of really shitty things in my life. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10908.38s)]
*  And it always feels like that's really important to do. Okay. You're judging something that you [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10912.939999999999s)]
*  have no business judging. Right. I have so many people. That's why I like making movies [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10919.339999999998s)]
*  on purpose that have less money and less time. On purpose. The biggest movie I said all time [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10924.38s)]
*  on Netflix is we can be heroes. I told them, I don't want to spend more than $50 million. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10930.46s)]
*  I know you all want to give me 80, but I want to be a hero and come in at 50 because one, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10934.46s)]
*  it'll make it better. And then two, you'll make three of them instead of just one. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10938.46s)]
*  I don't want to just go spend the farm. And how many filmmakers will do that? Don't try to get as [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10941.98s)]
*  much money as they can. But when you're spending less, it's a win-win situation. And you have more [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10945.259999999998s)]
*  creative freedom. It's not going to leave you alone. You can do whatever you want. So I like [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10950.699999999999s)]
*  the creative limitations that come from less money. That's why I like brass knuckle films. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10954.619999999999s)]
*  We're going to make them for less so that they are better. Not to make them shitty. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10957.98s)]
*  So many people have come up to me and said, you know what part I love in your movie? Tell [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10963.9s)]
*  me some scene. I'm like, oh, well, that's because we ran out of sun. And we had to do that jump with [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10968.619999999999s)]
*  him jumping on a pad three times or whatever it is. It's something that you fumbled together. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10975.26s)]
*  And that's what they're drawn to. They're drawn to that imperfect thing. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10979.58s)]
*  And so I wouldn't judge it because somebody's, you know, if you called your movie shitty, [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10982.699999999999s)]
*  that's like John Carpenter saying, yeah, nobody liked the thing. And it's a shitty movie and [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10988.38s)]
*  everyone hated it. So it must not be good. And then 10 years later, it's a masterpiece. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10993.019999999999s)]
*  So don't judge it because if you words we use on ourselves are very powerful. So if you say, well, [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=10997.1s)]
*  you know, I'm kind of an artist sometimes and I make a lot of shitty stuff. Well, that's going to [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11004.779999999999s)]
*  be your lot in life. You know, I'm pretty good shape for a director. It's not because I'm [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11009.66s)]
*  operating the camera because I work out, right? But I always hated working out. I was not into [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11014.78s)]
*  sports. I was a filmmaker. I was a cartoonist in high school. I was really tall. They would say, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11020.06s)]
*  come work, come be in our team. We need a small school. We need you. I don't know how to play any [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11026.7s)]
*  of these things. I'm an artist. There's a line in the faculty that was my line to my coaches when [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11031.34s)]
*  they would say, you got to come run with everybody. I would say, I don't think a person should run [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11035.66s)]
*  unless he's being chased. I get that to the Elijah Wood character because that's the guy [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11038.78s)]
*  I identified with. He's there with this camera and that was me. So I hated it. And then because I [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11043.5s)]
*  had, I was a cartoonist, you know, drawing like this for hours, four hours, my back would go out [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11048.86s)]
*  like out for a month. It would just go out from being so tall and crunched over. And then when [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11053.02s)]
*  I started making movies, operating the camera and doing steady cam every year would go out to where [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11057.5s)]
*  I would need cortisone shots to get up again if I'm filming or just be out for a month. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11061.58s)]
*  And on Spy Kids 2, Ricardo Montalban had bad back surgery that went wrong and he was in a wheelchair. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11066.62s)]
*  So he's in a wheelchair and I'm in a walker. And he's like, I'm 84. What's your excuse? [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11074.62s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. I just was operating steady. He goes, you have to work out, [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11080.460000000001s)]
*  Robert. You have to work out. And I was like, yeah, okay. Yeah, I know. I know. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11084.94s)]
*  And so then I thought, okay, next year I'm working with Stallone. I'll ask Stallone. I'll ask Stallone. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11088.54s)]
*  How do you get in shape? Because I need to get in shape. My back's always going out. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11092.86s)]
*  Get the trainer. Anyone who ever saw in Hollywood got in shape, they had a trainer. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11096.86s)]
*  I say, even you? Anybody go, I need a trainer. He has a trainer. So I know I need a trainer. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11101.5s)]
*  I can't train. It's like, well, shit, if you can't even train on your own, then what do us mortal men [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11105.740000000002s)]
*  have? So I got a trainer and guess what happened? Hated it. I would feel sick when he's coming over [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11110.62s)]
*  because I hate working it. And then some years of doing that, I just can't stand it. But I know it's [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11115.34s)]
*  good for my health. So the desire is there. So if you can't accomplish something in your life, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11122.54s)]
*  it's not a lack of desire. Like if you want to be more creative, it's not a lack of desire. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11126.62s)]
*  It's a lack of identity. Like the fact that you went, you were comfortable about saying [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11130.300000000001s)]
*  creative. It's because there's a lack of identity there. You have lots of desire. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11135.820000000002s)]
*  You got to get the identity up and then suddenly you're making shit. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11140.460000000001s)]
*  So a friend of mine from Mexico, she comes over, I have to stop smoking. My doctor said I have to [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11144.62s)]
*  stop smoking for my health. So I have to, I'm not smoking right now. So I've been smoking since I [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11148.54s)]
*  was eight years old. So while you're going to go back to smoking, because you just told me your [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11153.5s)]
*  identity is a smoker. So right now you're a smoker who's not smoking. What's going to happen? [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11157.18s)]
*  Eventually you have to say, I'm a nonsmoker. You know, like just that lesson I've forgotten. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11162.460000000001s)]
*  You have to say, I'm a nonsmoker. I'm a nonsmoker. What does a nonsmoker do? [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11169.1s)]
*  If you believe you're a nonsmoker, you hate smoke. Start choking it to smell the smoke. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11172.380000000001s)]
*  Okay, I'll try that. She walks off and I go, shit, I forgot about my own. I wonder [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11176.78s)]
*  where in my life I could apply that. Working out. Of course. My God, I hate working out. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11181.18s)]
*  No wonder I am so miserable. I'll tell my trainer and anyone will listen. [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11186.7s)]
*  I can't stand working out. I don't understand sports. So that day I said, I'm an athlete. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11190.78s)]
*  I'm an athlete. That's the last thing I would ever call myself all through my entire life. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11197.18s)]
*  This was 2012. I'm an athlete. By the next day, not only did my life completely change, [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11202.54s)]
*  and it's easier if it's opposite day. Like if you're just doing it by degrees, that's bullshit. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11209.42s)]
*  You got to go complete opposite. Because if there's like a donut, you know, if you say, well, [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11215.02s)]
*  I'm going to only half of it, you got to go, no, I'm going to get an apple. Opposite day is much [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11219.34s)]
*  easier. Not only did I change my life working out, I didn't ever needed a trainer. I have not had a [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11224.54s)]
*  trainer since all those years. Because I'm an athlete. I'll just do it. What does an athlete do? [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11229.58s)]
*  An athlete loves working out. An athlete will make time to work out and they'll eat right. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11234.62s)]
*  I would never be the person that would call themselves an athlete, but that's how much [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11241.02s)]
*  it can change your life by changing your identity. So if you want to be more creative, [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11244.3s)]
*  you've already got that in your, that desire. You've got enough of that. You don't need more [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11250.38s)]
*  desire. You need more identity. So you got to say, I'm a creative person with a straight [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11253.82s)]
*  face. So when I say, Hey, are you going to be, are you a creative person? You go, yeah. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11259.5s)]
*  Because then if you say that, what do you do? You're going to do more creative stuff because [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11263.98s)]
*  that's what a creative person does. It doesn't make sense to me how manifesting works, but it [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11267.1s)]
*  does seem to work. Like basically visualizing, visualizing a path towards a certain kind of [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11270.78s)]
*  future. I guess everything around you, everything within you kind of makes way for that, makes way [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11276.460000000001s)]
*  for the possibility of that. It's weird. It's weird, but it kind of, it's a kind of a nice to [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11282.3s)]
*  know that you can do that, but you have to just have that conviction and just say, [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11287.02s)]
*  start with a label. Yeah. The double R or the label you just gave yourself. Like I changed my [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11291.42s)]
*  label. My label was, I hate working out. I'm an athlete. I'm an athlete. I'm not a non-last [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11297.42s)]
*  name anymore. I'm changing my label and you get so inspired because now you know what to do [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11302.26s)]
*  because you can't help, but conform to your identity. You're always going to conform your [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11306.54s)]
*  identity. So just change your identity and you'll change your life. But it's not that hard. I didn't [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11310.460000000001s)]
*  have to go get hypnotized or anything. It was literally, I just told myself if I could do that, [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11315.34s)]
*  go from a guy who doesn't want to work out, hates it, hates it. I had the desire. I was already [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11319.66s)]
*  hiring the guy. I lacked the identity. As soon as I changed my identity, boom. Well, one of the [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11324.86s)]
*  things for me like that is probably music, just playing guitar. Are you a musician? Yeah. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11329.74s)]
*  I would definitely not. I mean, I'm going along with it now, but if we're honestly, if we're just [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11337.42s)]
*  in the same culture, I wouldn't have said that. But I heard you rip on guitar. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11342.06s)]
*  And I've heard you play kind of amazing in all different kinds of contexts. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11345.66s)]
*  Oh, but I should be like freaking Santana by now because I've had a guitar in my hands since I was [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11349.1s)]
*  a kid. But since I'm not a full-time musician, I don't get to play it that often. So I'm not as [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11353.26s)]
*  good as I should be. But when you apply yourself to just rehearse for a couple of shows, you book [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11360.38s)]
*  some shows. Look at this. This is me just playing our first arena show opening for George Lopez. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11365.9s)]
*  That was crazy to be on the stages where you're heroes, that you saw them, and now you're seeing [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11372.699999999999s)]
*  what their point of view was. It blows your mind. You need to get on stage. You get on stage once, [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11377.5s)]
*  and you'll see that it's not as bad as you think. You're not terrified because you're playing pretty [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11381.5s)]
*  complicated things. I've seen you play live. Yeah. And I messed up a bunch of times. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11386.859999999999s)]
*  You don't want to focus on that. You just go like, okay, I got it through it. Because when [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11390.46s)]
*  you're up there, it's not that you're screaming nervous, but your hands just won't work anymore. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11393.42s)]
*  Something will happen. But that happens to everybody. If you really watch even the best [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11398.3s)]
*  in their live performances, watch really close. And you see they screw up a couple of things, [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11401.98s)]
*  but you just want to know because they just go right through it. It's about the live performance, [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11405.98s)]
*  and that's how you know it's real. So I think if you can really just lean into it more, [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11409.74s)]
*  really work on the identity part because you've got the desire. You want to play guitar. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11416.94s)]
*  But as soon as you say, yeah, but I can't play live, you just chopped off your leg at the start [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11421.099999999999s)]
*  of the race. You say, I don't know. You just chopped off your other leg. You're doing this [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11427.099999999999s)]
*  to yourself. You're literally doing this to yourself. I mean, just you. I mean, anybody who pauses, [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11432.619999999999s)]
*  who hesitates, you don't have to have doubts. Why would you have a doubt? Because you know the [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11438.46s)]
*  process now. It's like, if I don't know how to do something, I know how to figure it out. I didn't [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11442.939999999999s)]
*  know how I was going to do that scene with him jumping and flipping. I didn't know that, but [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11447.66s)]
*  do I have doubt that I'm going to go in there and be able to do it? If you say that you do, [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11451.98s)]
*  now you're a doubtful person. That's how powerful that is. But if you say, no, I don't have any [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11457.26s)]
*  doubt because I know I'm going to figure it out when I get there. Somehow it'll fall in my lap. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11461.82s)]
*  I trust the process. You don't have to know. So if you trust the process that you'll figure it out. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11466.38s)]
*  But here's the thing. Sometimes you fail and there's audience. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11472.46s)]
*  Yeah. Then you get four rooms. Yeah. And then what happens? [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11476.539999999999s)]
*  Don't blink. Don't blink and then you go sift through the failure. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11480.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11483.019999999999s)]
*  You go, wait a minute. What did I get out of that? [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11483.58s)]
*  Yeah. I've done that a bunch. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11485.58s)]
*  It is great. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11487.099999999999s)]
*  Look, what's the worst that can happen? You go on a stage and you bum. It's not going to be the [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11487.66s)]
*  first stage. It's one of those you can talk about so that when you do the next one and it all, [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11492.3s)]
*  sometimes they all go right. I've had a couple of shows. We did a couple of shows [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11496.939999999999s)]
*  where we had video cameras set up for the second day. Listen, let's not film the first day because [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11501.74s)]
*  we're going to be fine and just finding our feet. Let's film the second day. First day, [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11505.42s)]
*  fucking flawless. Flawless because no cameras. Second day, we weren't as into it as we had just [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11510.220000000001s)]
*  done it. It felt like the second take. It just didn't have the magic. And that's the one that's [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11518.380000000001s)]
*  recorded. And we're like, oh, kicking ourselves. We didn't film both nights. We should have filmed [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11523.34s)]
*  both nights. I love how much of a mess this human existence life is. You've talked about [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11528.54s)]
*  the importance of journaling because living is reliving. I love that phrase. I came up with that [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11535.660000000002s)]
*  because it's like, wow, I see so many people who get after you for filming a concert and they go, [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11541.980000000001s)]
*  live in the moment. I'm like, dude, it's counterintuitive. The moment goes by like this. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11547.5s)]
*  Yeah. We're not going to remember any of this. The fact that we taped it, thank God, because later [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11552.140000000001s)]
*  on it's going to be a file photo of me remembering you. Three pound me computer. All I'm going to [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11556.7s)]
*  have is a file photo of you maybe in a suit and you picturing me in maybe a black t-shirt. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11561.1s)]
*  And the metadata narrative is going to say, had a great talk about, if we remember, creativity. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11566.7s)]
*  Your brain doesn't remember. But when I pull up old home movies, I can show my kids that I just [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11573.740000000002s)]
*  found and they're like, they don't remember it. I don't remember filming it. And it's like new [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11578.78s)]
*  adventures of it becomes iconic and it sticks in her head. And all their jokes are based on [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11583.66s)]
*  old things that we used to do and say, so relive, living is reliving. So keeping a journal is very [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11588.7s)]
*  important because I found that anything that passed 15 years on, it's like I'm reading someone else's [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11593.66s)]
*  journal. I'm like, I didn't even know that's where I got that guitar. I thought I bought that guitar. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11597.34s)]
*  It was given to me. It's like a $10,000 Santana. It was given to me my birthday by the studio that [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11601.42s)]
*  I made that movie. How did I not remember that? It's like crazy what you don't remember. And it's [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11607.18s)]
*  the brain is very, it's not a very reliable computer. It's made out of fucking butter. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11611.5s)]
*  That's a really profound idea that so much of our life is lived through replaying our memories. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11617.5s)]
*  And then watching stuff is one of the ways to sort of refresh, give some more texture and details. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11624.06s)]
*  Makes it iconic. It makes it iconic in your life and part of your life. Otherwise it just went by. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11632.06s)]
*  It went by. I'll ask people, we just had a really, what did we do last week? What did we do last [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11636.779999999999s)]
*  Wednesday? And they're like, I can tell you because I wrote it down. When are we going to remember? [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11641.5s)]
*  And then when you see, when you go through your journal, I go back and I find, wow, life-changing [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11645.98s)]
*  thing happened Friday. Another life-changing thing I didn't know at the time until now I know that [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11653.26s)]
*  that really set me on, happened Saturday. And another big freaking thing happened on Sunday. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11657.9s)]
*  They come in threes sometimes. You start being able to predict the future a little bit because [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11663.26s)]
*  you see the patterns and it's pretty wild to do that. And I've talked to people, [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11667.9s)]
*  big group of people, 500 people. How many people hear journal? Two hands, three hands. I couldn't [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11674.300000000001s)]
*  believe it. It's like, man, you guys, if there's anything I'm going to part on you is journal. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11680.300000000001s)]
*  Your life is way more interesting than you think because it's not going to feel like anything while [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11684.300000000001s)]
*  it's going by. But in retrospect, you look back, I can just go through, I keep a journal [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11687.82s)]
*  one file per year. So I started a new one in 2025. If I'm going to look up, like I'm going to do a [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11693.66s)]
*  director's chair episode, I look up Michael Mann, Michael Mann, Michael Mann, all the conversations [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11699.58s)]
*  we had since 94 that I wrote down that I felt. And it's like, oh my God, I can't believe we said that. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11704.62s)]
*  That's how I knew about that thing with Quentin. I had forgotten about that story with Quentin [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11709.5s)]
*  and saying, ah, Pulp Fiction. I had forgotten that because from the moment I asked him that question [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11712.54s)]
*  to the success it can was very quick. So it was a lost moment in time where I had it recorded down [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11717.9s)]
*  to the time, down to the hour when I asked him that question, he thought it wasn't, he didn't [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11723.5s)]
*  think that was the one for him. Yeah. And there's a, I don't know when it, when it's private journaling, [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11728.22s)]
*  there's an honesty, there's an innocence that about like the dreams you have about the future, [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11734.22s)]
*  the conceptions you have about the future. I mean, that's what this thing is journal. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11738.94s)]
*  It's a journal. It's just a journal. It's like, but the profundity comes out of it. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11742.14s)]
*  Crazy. Yeah. You didn't. And so much I figured out then I was, [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11746.539999999999s)]
*  I'm talking like a professor by the end of that. Like people come up to me and they're asking me [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11749.5s)]
*  all these questions about stuff I wrote in there. And I'm like, I wrote that in that book. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11753.74s)]
*  Shit, I was smart back then. What happened? I don't remember half of that. But I think [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11758.22s)]
*  it's the same thing when you go to teach someone, your mouth opens and stuff comes out. I'm always [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11762.619999999999s)]
*  taping myself. Like when I go to give a talk, cause that's also the pipe working. Someone else [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11768.779999999999s)]
*  is talking through you sometimes. So the act of sharing, that's why I've always liked to share [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11774.62s)]
*  information because the feedback loop is insane. Like me inspiring DJ to go write. He writes the [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11779.5s)]
*  script in three days, comes back, tells me now I'm doing that method. And it's like, wow, [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11785.18s)]
*  people come back with their version. And I love telling my kids stuff that I learned that I wish [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11789.820000000002s)]
*  I could tell myself, but I can't take a time machine. The closest thing is telling your kid [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11795.42s)]
*  because then they can take that information and process. So many times they've come back and said, [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11799.58s)]
*  wow, dad, that lesson you taught us about this is really, it's really become big in our minds. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11803.66s)]
*  Yeah. What was that? And they tell me, I'm like, I never told you that. They said, yeah, you told [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11808.619999999999s)]
*  us. Well, I told you maybe 10% of that. All the rest you added. Oh yeah. Well, we embellished it. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11812.539999999999s)]
*  They turned it into something else. And it's like, wow, that's so cool. But yeah, that thing about [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11818.7s)]
*  reliving, like that was one of my favorite ones is just, yeah, my mom turning 75 and not wanting to [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11824.619999999999s)]
*  do anything for 75th birthday. I said, why not? She goes, the whole family's going to have 10 [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11829.82s)]
*  kids. They're all going to want to do something for your 75th birthday. Nothing can top my 65th. [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11835.26s)]
*  I was like, what are we doing your 65th? I didn't remember even. I'm the one who orchestrated it all. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11839.82s)]
*  She goes, oh, you flew everyone in from all over the country. You gave me a car. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11843.74s)]
*  I got to have a journal of that. So I'm sure I have video. I go back 10 years. I see what tape I [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11850.06s)]
*  had it on, find the tape, pop the tape in. Forgot about all this stuff. So I cut together a 10 [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11855.1s)]
*  minute version of it, showed it at her 75th birthday. Just watching the old one. Everybody [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11861.42s)]
*  was like, oh my God, look how young everybody was. Look how small the nieces and nephew were. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11867.26s)]
*  She starts bawling as soon as she gets the key, the gift of the key in the video, [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11872.62s)]
*  because she realizes now what it's going to mean that she's going to get this car. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11876.62s)]
*  And so it's like, wow, let's just play the old tapes. We don't even have to do anything anymore. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11880.22s)]
*  We banked so much amazing stuff that we've all forgotten that my kids just love watching [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11885.42s)]
*  their old home movies. They hardly remember any of it, but even a VHS to them is virtual reality [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11892.3s)]
*  because compared to our memories, it is virtual reality. They're leaning into the screen to see [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11901.34s)]
*  what's around the corner and they're remembering the place and the sounds. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11906.54s)]
*  And they say, oh, we left the living room. It's like we're there. It's like, wow. I was always [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11910.140000000001s)]
*  afraid they would see this old footage and go, ah, that dog shit. What kind of camera was that? [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11915.900000000001s)]
*  This is the limitations of it. You put up one of those files on your screen, it's like this big [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11920.78s)]
*  on your laptop now. That's how low res shit was back then. But that didn't matter. Compared to [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11924.78s)]
*  our memories, that stuff, living is reliving. Pull up that, shoot as much as you can, [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11929.740000000002s)]
*  take as many pictures, but write the journal because you'll have a picture. I swear you're [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11935.26s)]
*  not going to know what it's from. Even 10 years from now, you won't know what that picture's from. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11938.22s)]
*  You read the diary, you go, oh, that's what that is. Oh my God. You can piece together all these [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11941.26s)]
*  things that are important to you or that become more important with time actually. And you know [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11946.14s)]
*  what's important later compared to what's happening at the time. To add on top of that. So journaling [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11951.58s)]
*  is a kind of raw or like home films is a raw projection of what's going on in the moment. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11955.74s)]
*  I think it's also really powerful because I've done that. It's to do a high effort description [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11961.42s)]
*  of where your life is for you, just for yourself. So sometimes journaling is like low effort. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11967.1s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes I just want to mark that. We had this conversation, I had to go do something at [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11971.5s)]
*  five, I did that. Met somebody that I know last night I met somebody that's going to be life [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11975.66s)]
*  changing. I'm going to write a little bit more on that because now I know. But I'm going to just [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11979.74s)]
*  record it so later if I look it up. So one of the cool things you could do is, [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11984.22s)]
*  for example, somebody, Jamie Mr. Beast does these videos, which are great. I think it's a great [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11988.06s)]
*  exercise to do for yourself, which is a video he records for himself that he doesn't look at [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=11994.3s)]
*  to be published 20 years from now. This is a message to myself 20 years from now. Here's [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12000.06s)]
*  where I hope you end up. You're basically a younger version of yourself speaking to an older version. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12004.7s)]
*  Then you get, time flies and you get to a point where it's like, holy shit, it has been 10 years, [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12010.86s)]
*  it has been 20 years. You get to listen to a younger version of yourself. It would have been [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12016.14s)]
*  hilarious if you shot videos like that to yourself because of just the incredible journey your career [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12021.74s)]
*  has been on. Just to think about that, the delta, the difference between what your dreams were, [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12027.66s)]
*  where you ended up. Usually you outdo yourself in many ways. Sometimes your life goes in a totally [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12034.14s)]
*  different trajectory. The result is kind of funny. It's a nice illustration of the non-linearity of [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12040.3s)]
*  life. I would film stuff like that with my kids. I couldn't do it, but I would film my kid saying, [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12050.46s)]
*  hey, turn in the camera now and say, hey, Rebel, it's me, Rebel. I'm going to rebel in the future. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12054.859999999999s)]
*  So you have shots like that. Yeah. Then they show them like that 10 years later and they're like, [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12060.779999999999s)]
*  whoa. Just to see it talking to them and saying, and I would do this thing where I would film [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12065.58s)]
*  them watching it and then pan off so that 10 years later I could get, hey, Rebel, him reacting, [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12072.62s)]
*  pan off to the new Rebel watching it. It's just like, keeps going. I have one like that where it [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12081.74s)]
*  just keeps panning and they're watching themselves within the movie, within the movie, within the [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12085.34s)]
*  movie. It's like an ongoing project. It's just so fun to just play with memory and make you realize [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12088.78s)]
*  how fast time moves and to go, they go like, I kind of remember that, but I don't remember [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12094.78s)]
*  being that tiny when I had that memory. It's like wild how time moves and it makes them feel [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12102.7s)]
*  much more precious about how quick time moves and how important every little moment is because you [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12110.140000000001s)]
*  see the fragility of it too. Does it make you sad? Does it break your heart that the number of [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12115.5s)]
*  memories we get to create is finite, that this life ends, eventually the story is over? [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12121.58s)]
*  I had this theory, I'm going to put this in a movie. I don't think I've ever seen this before [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12127.98s)]
*  because I was woke up from a dream and it was like, trying to remember it. You're like, God, [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12132.14s)]
*  it's so real. If you don't write it down right away, it kind of fades away, but while you're [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12136.38s)]
*  dreaming it, it's really real. It's like, I almost see the walls. By the time I went to go tell [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12143.18s)]
*  somebody, it's like, shit, I forgot most of it. I wonder if that's what it's like when you wake up [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12149.58s)]
*  in your consciousness after you die. You wake up in your next consciousness, getting ready to move [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12153.5s)]
*  into whatever your next body is. You're like, wow, I was a filmmaker, had five kids. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12158.78s)]
*  Oh, well, I'm going to be a fish now. It's like a dream. It's like that gone that way. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12168.14s)]
*  That's what past lives are. They're like distant memories, like a dream that's faded away. That's [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12172.94s)]
*  why you barely feel remnants of it. Do I feel sad about that? When I tell people, they flip out when [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12177.74s)]
*  I tell them that. I want a character to be like that. He's dying. He's like, I don't want to [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12182.86s)]
*  forget this dream. Don't let me wake up. Don't let me wake up. But you forget, especially the [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12188.22s)]
*  moment you try to tell somebody. You tell the next fish. Yeah, the next fish. It's going to be a fish [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12193.5s)]
*  next. Yeah, yeah. It feels like I'm almost sad about it, but then it just makes you even more [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12197.58s)]
*  doubled down to be precious about the life you're in now. And recorded. What do you think is the [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12204.54s)]
*  meaning of this whole thing, of life? Why are we here? I mean, I really feel like my kids and I [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12209.660000000002s)]
*  were just talking about this last night. We were just blown away. We did this Asterian astrology [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12219.42s)]
*  thing. It was the oldest form of astrology. It just nails each person. And it's like, yeah, [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12224.140000000001s)]
*  because when you have a kid, you realize right away, this isn't my kid. This is not my, I'm just [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12231.02s)]
*  in charge of him. It's a completely different soul. He's a different soul that ended up in my hands. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12235.9s)]
*  There's physical characteristics that get passed on because of just how biology works. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12241.34s)]
*  Even sometimes posture and movement is the same, but the actual person is somebody else. And all [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12245.42s)]
*  the kids, I have five kids and I have nine brothers and sisters. They're all different. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12251.26s)]
*  And you realize we made a pact in the past life to gather together because every time it's like, [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12254.859999999999s)]
*  so good you were born in this family because you were given free reign to go find who you're really [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12263.66s)]
*  supposed to be. And you find out everyone is doing what they were supposed to be doing. [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12268.619999999999s)]
*  But what's cool, almost like this clarity you get by just saying it, they now know that they were [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12273.74s)]
*  always supposed to be like this creative person. And now they can double down on it because they [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12279.74s)]
*  know that's who they were supposed to be. They don't have to have any doubt anymore. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12283.5s)]
*  They don't have to wonder, well, am I supposed to be more business-minded or can I be creative? [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12286.38s)]
*  Isn't that some kind of frivolous? Is that a real job? Can I do that? [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12290.54s)]
*  Now they realize, no, you're supposed to be doing that for these, these, these, these reasons. And [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12294.7s)]
*  now they can double down. You can skip all that and just decide, I feel like I want to be that [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12298.14s)]
*  person. So I'm just going to declare I am that person. And as soon as you say it, you are that. [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12302.94s)]
*  And tomorrow your, your activities will conform to that. That's how powerful that decision is. So [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12309.74s)]
*  when you walk out of here, it's going to be with a complete commitment. I'm a technical and creative [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12316.94s)]
*  person. I'm my first boss. I'm unstoppable. Cause my boss told me that and he was right. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12323.02s)]
*  I became technical and creative and you're just unstoppable. You can just keep going and just go, [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12330.140000000001s)]
*  I'm unstoppable. That's me. You're going to do, you know, use your powers for bad, [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12334.140000000001s)]
*  but you've just changed your life by just declaring that. And I'm also a creative person [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12337.5s)]
*  who lives his life creatively. I'm going to find creative ways to use that technology. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12343.26s)]
*  If somebody says you're not the same kind of R as I was expecting, that's their own opinion. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12347.98s)]
*  Don't blink. Just keep going. You know, all these things that you've learned that people [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12352.86s)]
*  were supposed to tell you along the way, they're telling you for a reason. Anytime you got pushed, [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12357.74s)]
*  like if you go back to your life at your really critical moments in your life, [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12363.5s)]
*  where you went that way instead of that way, there was probably somebody there who said something to [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12367.42s)]
*  you. They kind of pushed you. There was one guy when I was in high school, it was like senior year, [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12372.54s)]
*  I wrote a paper and I wasn't a great writer at all. I wrote a paper for a Latin American [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12380.14s)]
*  studies class, gave it to the teacher. And he said, wow, you're going to be rich and famous in four [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12385.18s)]
*  years. It's based on what I read. Because I really flunked home like 17 or 18. Four years later, [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12392.54s)]
*  I did mariachi and I went to him later at a reunion and I said, you called it. You said, [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12400.380000000001s)]
*  I was going to be, why did you say that? And he's like, I said that. It looked like he would never [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12405.26s)]
*  say that to somebody. You'd think he would own it and say, oh yeah, I knew it. I told you, no, [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12410.140000000001s)]
*  he was like, he looked like he didn't even know who I was. I feel like he never would have said [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12413.5s)]
*  that in a million years. So again, sometimes things come out of our mouth that's not us, [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12418.62s)]
*  that comes through us. So if you think of it that way, why are we here? We're here for a reason. [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12422.380000000001s)]
*  We're going to get nudged along, listen to the signs, own who you're supposed to be because you [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12427.34s)]
*  are that person. Don't let your human doubt get in the way. That's like the guy closing the pipe. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12432.62s)]
*  I don't know if I'm really creative. I don't know if I'm really a businessman. And you're just closing [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12437.34s)]
*  the pipe. You're not going to let it flow. Just be a good pipe. Just say, I just want to be a good [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12441.58s)]
*  pipe, clean, open. And then that's when the magic happens. And no matter what, don't blink. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12446.54s)]
*  Don't blink. Don't matter how many, that dude was getting so much shit thrown at him. I wish you [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12452.54s)]
*  knew that time period because then you would go like, yeah, that's right. It was incredible. I [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12457.820000000002s)]
*  can't even convey. There was no internet and stuff back then. This was like literal press reviews, [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12462.7s)]
*  public. It was like, why are they targeting this guy? They just did not like, he just had [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12468.62s)]
*  unprecedented success and was a really great guy and was making amazing shit. So it was the [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12474.22s)]
*  triple threat of make people jealous. Well, he's one of the great artists of all time. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoT3bJyHuA&t=12480.939999999999s)]
