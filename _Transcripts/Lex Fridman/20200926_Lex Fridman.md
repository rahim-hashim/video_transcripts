# Joe Rogan: Fear, Love, Chaos, and the Joe Rogan Experience | Lex Fridman Podcast #127
**Lex Fridman:** [September 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCJWkPehdY)
*  The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan that we recorded after my recent appearance on
*  his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe has been an inspiration to me and I thank
*  to millions of people for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world and being
*  genuinely curious about wild ideas from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics and artificial
*  intelligence. Like many of you, I've been a fan of his podcast for over a decade and now, somehow,
*  miraculously, I'm humbled to be able to call him a friend. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on
*  YouTube, review it with 5 stars on Apple Podcasts, follow on Spotify, support on Patreon, or connect

*  Check out the first three of the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support
*  this podcast. I usually do full ad reads here and never ads in the middle, but this time,
*  let's go straight to the conversation with a bit of guitar first.
*  Do you ponder your mortality? Are you afraid of death?
*  I do think about it sometimes. I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes,
*  just the fact that I'm 53. So if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.
*  You know, if everything goes great, like no car accidents, no injuries.
*  But it could happen today. This could be your last day.
*  Could be.
*  That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death. There's a bunch of philosophers, Ernest Becker
*  and Sheldon Solomon. They believe that death is at the core of everything. Wrote this book,
*  Warm at the Core. So does that come into play in the way you see the world?
*  I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial and understanding that your time
*  is limited can aid you greatly. I think knowing that this is a temporary time, that we have finite
*  life spans, I think there's great power in that because it motivates you, it gets you going.
*  I think being an immortal living forever would be one of the most depressing things,
*  particularly if everybody else was dying around you. And I think one of the things that makes
*  life so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last. You really get a brief amount
*  of time here and really by the time you're just starting to kind of figure yourself out,
*  who you are and how not to screw things up so bad, time's up.
*  Time's over. What about from your daughter's perspective? Do you think about the world we're
*  in now and what kind of world you're going to leave them? Do you worry about it?
*  I do. Yeah, I do. I do when I see these protests and riots and chaos and so much
*  anger in the world today. And then particularly today, I think because of the pandemic and the
*  fact that so many folks are out of work and through no fault of their own and can't make ends meet and
*  just people feel so helpless and angry, it's a particularly divisive time. It's a particularly
*  turmoil filled time. And it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even,
*  just feels very chaotic and dangerous. And it's a small thing in terms of the possibilities of
*  things that could happen to the world, like a pandemic, like the one we've experienced,
*  it really just doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year. So it relatively speaking is a small
*  thing in comparison to super volcano eruptions, asteroid impact, a real horrific pandemic or
*  one that really wipes out millions and millions of people. It's stunning how fragile civility is.
*  It's stunning how fragile our society really is that something like this can come along,
*  some unprecedented thing, unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's
*  out of work for six months and then everybody's at each other's throats. And then politically,
*  everyone's at each other's throats. And then with the advent of social media and the images that
*  you can see with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions are at an all time high,
*  to a point where like if you asked me just five or six years ago, like have racial problems in this
*  country largely been alleviated, I'd probably say, yeah, it's way better than it's ever been before.
*  But now you could argue that it's not. Now you could argue it's no, it's way worse in just a
*  small amount of time. It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime while I'm aware of it.
*  Obviously when I was a young boy in the sixties, they were still going through the civil rights
*  movement, but now it just seems very fever pitched. And I think a lot of that is because
*  of the pandemic and is because of all the heightened just tension. The one I liken it to
*  is road rage, because people have road rage, not just because they're in the car and no one can get
*  to them, but also because you're at a heightened state because you're driving fast and you know
*  you're driving fast. You have to make split second movements. And so anybody doing something like,
*  what the people go crazy because they're already at an eight because they're in the car and they're
*  moving very quickly. That's what it feels like with today with the pandemic, it feels like everybody
*  is already at an eight. So anything that comes along, it's like light it all on fire, burn it
*  down. Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason for a lot of the looting and the riots
*  and all the chaos. It's not just the people out of work, but it's also that everyone feels so tense
*  already and everyone feels so helpless. And it's like, you know, doing something like that makes
*  people, it gives people a whole new motivation for chaos, a whole new motivation for doing
*  destructive things that I've never experienced in my life. And your better days when you see
*  a positive future, what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020? Like if you visualize
*  in 2025, that's a better world than today. What does that, how do we get there and what does that
*  look like? It's a good question. I can honestly say I don't know. And I wouldn't have said I don't
*  know a year ago. A year ago, I would have said we're going to be okay. As much as people hate
*  Trump, the economy is doing great. I think we're going to be fine. That's not how I feel today.
*  Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically, because I think if Trump wins,
*  people are going to be furious. And I think if Biden wins, people are going to be furious.
*  Particularly like if things get more woke, you know, if people continue to enforce this force
*  compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way, which seems to be a part
*  of what this whole woke thing is, that is the most disturbing for me is that I see what's going on.
*  I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this and they shove it in people's faces.
*  And it doesn't have to make sense. Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest that stopped this
*  woman at a restaurant. They were surrounding her outside a restaurant. They were forcing her to
*  raise her fist in compliance. This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives Matter multiple times.
*  And the people around her doing this were all white. It's all weird. My friend Coach T, he's
*  a wrestling coach, he's also on a podcast, my friend Brian Moses. His take on it is that,
*  and he's a black guy, he says Black Lives Matter is a white cult. And I'm like, when you see that
*  picture, it's hard to argue that he's got a point. I mean, it's clearly not all about that, but
*  there's a lot of people that have jumped on board that are very much like cult members.
*  Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement is you can't control who joins.
*  There's no entrance examination. So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this? What's your
*  perceptions on that? Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland, that guy who
*  murdered the Trump supporter and the cop shot him, that guy was walking around with his hand
*  on his gun looking for Trump supporters. I mean, he's a known violent guy who was walking around
*  looking for Trump supporters, found one and shot one. That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.
*  He's a white guy, he shot another white guy. It's just madness. And that kind of madness is
*  disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly. I mean, there's been riots in Portland every night,
*  demonstrations, for 101 days now. 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire,
*  breaking into federal buildings. It's like, who ever saw that coming? Nobody saw that coming. So
*  I don't know what the solution is, and I don't know what it looks like in five years. So 2025,
*  to answer your question. It could be anything. I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max, we could
*  be looking at the apocalypse. We could also be looking at an invasion from another country. We
*  could be looking at a war, like a real hot war. To put a little bit of responsibility on you,
*  for me, I've listened to you since the Red Band, Olive Garden days, from the very beginning. And
*  there was something in the way you communicated about the world, maybe there was others, but
*  you're the one I was aware of, is you're open-minded and loving towards the world,
*  especially as the podcast developed. You just demonstrated and lived this kind of kindness,
*  or maybe even lack of jealousy in your own little profession of comedy. It was clear that you didn't
*  succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature, and thereby inspire people like me, who I was
*  naturally, probably especially in the early 20s, kind of jealous of the success of others.
*  And you're really the primary person that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others.
*  And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this, of making a better 2025. You have
*  such a big megaphone. Is there something you think you can do on this podcast with the words,
*  the way you talk, the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?
*  I think if anything, I could help in leading by example, but that's only going to help the
*  people that are listening. I don't know what else I can do in terms of make the world a better place,
*  other than express my hopes and wishes for that, and just try to be as nice as I can to people
*  as often as I can. But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category, particularly
*  with the Spotify deal, where I'm one of them now. I'm not a regular person anymore. Now I'm like
*  some famous rich guy. So you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guy that's out
*  of touch. And that's a real issue whenever you're talking about the economy, about just real life
*  problems. It's interesting. It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say about Elon Musk. He's
*  just a billionaire. It's an interesting statement. But I think if you just continue being you and he
*  continue being him, I think people are just voicing their worry that you become some rich guy.
*  I don't even know if they're doing that. I think they're just finding the way he describes it,
*  an attack vector. Yeah, and I think he's right. I think they can dismiss you by just saying,
*  oh, you're just a that. You're easily definable.
*  Right. But there's truth to that. If you're not careful, you can become out of touch.
*  That's an interesting thing. Why haven't you become out of touch? As a human off the podcast,
*  you don't act like you talk to somebody like me. You don't talk like a famous person
*  or you don't act rich like you're better than others. There's a certain. Listen, I've talked
*  to quite a few you have to, but I've talked to especially kind of group of people that like
*  Nobel Prize winners, let's say they sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance. And you don't.
*  What's that about? Well, you got to know what that is, right? Like that air of arrogance comes from
*  drinking your own Kool-Aid. You start believing that somehow or another, just because you're
*  getting praise from all these people, that you really are something different. Usually it
*  exemplifies there's something there where there's a lack of struggle. And I think struggle is
*  probably one of the most important balancing tools that a person can have. And for me,
*  I struggle mentally and I struggle physically. I struggle mentally in that. We were talking about
*  on the podcast we did previously, you and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work.
*  I'm not a fan of what I do. I'm my harshest critic. So anytime anybody says something bad
*  about me, I'm like, listen, I said way worse about myself. I don't like anything I do.
*  I'm ruthlessly introspective and I will continue to be that way because that's the only way you
*  could be good as a comedian. There's no other way. You can't just think you're awesome and just go
*  out there. You have to be picking apart everything you do. But there's a balance to that too,
*  because you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform. You can't think,
*  oh my God, I suck. I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing. I'm not going to be
*  suck. I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing because I put in all that work.
*  One of the reasons why I put in all that work is I don't like the end result most of the time. So
*  I need to work at it all the time. Then there's physical struggle, which I think balances everything
*  out. Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a
*  battery, where if you have extra charge, it leaks out of the top and it becomes unmanageable and
*  messy. That's how my psyche is. If I have too much energy, if I'm not exerting myself in a violent
*  way, like an explosive way, like wearing myself out, I just don't like the way the world is.
*  I don't like the way I interface with the world. I'm too tense. I'm too quick to be upset about
*  things. But when I work out hard and I put in a brutal training session, everything's
*  fine. Well, the first time I talked to you on JRE, you were doing Sober October.
*  There's something in your eyes. I think you've talked about that you exercise the demons out,
*  essentially. So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like out.
*  There's a darkness in you there, like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.
*  That was a scary time in a lot of ways, that Sober October thing. My friends, we were all
*  talking shit because we're competing against each other in these fitness challenges. You had
*  you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate.
*  One day I got 1,100 points. I did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse
*  scene from John Wick where he murders all those people in the bathhouse. I watched it probably
*  50 times in a row. I went crazy. I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way where it brought me
*  back to my fighting days. It was like that person came out again. I didn't even know he was in there.
*  Like an assassin, like a killer. I felt like a different person.
*  Is it echoes of what Mike Tyson talked about essentially?
*  Maybe, but no orgasmic emotions.
*  That was the crazy shit that he was saying.
*  Is there a violent person in there?
*  Oh yeah. There's a lot of violence in me for sure. I don't know if it's genetic or learned or
*  it's because during my formative years from the time I was 15 until I was 22, all I did was fight.
*  That was all I did. That was all I did. All I did was train and compete.
*  That's all I did. That was my whole life.
*  Your mom and dad broke up early on. Is it connected to the dad at all?
*  I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be
*  around him. I also think it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my DNA.
*  I think there's a certain amount of... To be prejudiced against myself, I look like a violent
*  person. If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built, not even just the working out bar, just
*  the size of my hands and there's the width of my shoulders, there's most likely a lot of violence
*  in my history, in my past, in my ancestry. I think we minimize that with people.
*  So much of your behavior... When I see my daughter, I have one daughter that's obsessive
*  in terms of she wants to get really good at things and she'll practice things all day long.
*  It's 100% my personality. She's me in female form, but without the anger as much and without the
*  fear. She has a loving household and everything like that, but she has this intense obsession
*  with doing things and doing things really well and getting better. What's the point? We have to
*  tell her, stop doing handsprings in the house. Stop, stop. Come on, just sit down, have dinner.
*  One more, one more. She's psycho. I think there's a lot of behavior and personality and a lot of
*  these things are passed down through genetics. We don't really know. We don't know how much of
*  who you are genetically is learned behavior, nature and nurture. We don't know if it's
*  learned behavior or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part of you because of
*  who your parents were. I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me.
*  RG And then you channeled it. So you figured out basically your life is a productive exploration
*  of how to channel that. CB Yes. How to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down.
*  Calm down. There's another person in there. There's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person who just
*  wants to laugh and have fun. And then there's that dude who comes out when I did Sober October.
*  That guy's scary. I don't like that guy. That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.
*  When I was competing, it was necessary, but it makes me remember. I didn't really remember
*  what I used to be like until that. When I'm working out seven hours a day and I'm just
*  so obsessed and all I was thinking about was winning. That's all I was thinking about. If
*  they were working out five hours a day, I wanted them to know that I was going to work out an extra
*  three hours and I was going to get up early and I was going to text them all, hey, pussies,
*  I'm up already. Take pictures, send selfies. I was like, you're going to die. I kept telling them,
*  you're all going to die. You try to keep up with me. You're going to die.
*  You weren't fully joking.
*  No, I wasn't joking at all. That's what was fucked up about it.
*  It's the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins and what I saw in you during that time
*  is like this guy, like this is why I've been avoiding David Ganges recently
*  is like, cause he wants to meet, he wants to do the talk on this podcast, but he also wants
*  to run an ultra marathon with me. And I felt like this is a person, if I spend any time in this
*  realm, if I spend any time with a Joe Rogan of that sober October, like I might have to die to
*  get out. Like there's this kind of, uh, yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy.
*  I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today of Goggins draining his knee.
*  That would stop me from running ever again, because I would think in my head, okay,
*  I'm going to ruin my cartilage. I'm going to need a knee replacement. I would start thinking,
*  I would go down that line, but he is perpetually in this push it mindset, you know, what he
*  calls the dog in him, you know, he's got that dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog,
*  you know, and that's, um, that's who he is. That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and
*  he's fuel for millions and millions of people. I mean, he really is, he motivates people in a
*  way that is so powerful, but it can be very destructive. I just, I know, I know now,
*  especially after the sober October thing, that that thing's still in me. You know, I didn't know,
*  so really haven't done anything physically competitive except one time I was supposed
*  to fight Wesley Snipes. It came out then too. That came out too. That got creepy too, but luckily
*  that never happened, but that was many months of training, like training twice a day, every day,
*  kickboxing in the morning, jujitsu at night. I was just going and going and going and going,
*  and I was just thinking just all day long, but it, but it, but it with all the other aspects of your
*  life. It with your friendships, it with your, your, it with my comedy, it with everything,
*  because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist. It's a mindset of a conqueror.
*  The conqueror. Yeah. Destroyer. That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson make the switch.
*  It's clear that like, whatever that is, however that fight goes, he made us, there's a switch of
*  a diff, he stepped into a different dimension. Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon. And,
*  you know, Roy's going to be on before the fight. I'm, I'm so curious to see how it goes down,
*  but genuinely concerned because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight and Roy Jones at his best was 168
*  pounds. And, um, I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house of where Mike Tyson
*  goes. I don't know if he has that room. Mike doesn't have a room. He's, he's got an empire in
*  there. He opens up the door, he's opened up the door. There's, there's a whole empire in his head
*  and he's, he's in that firmly, you know, when he got out of the weed and, and started training
*  again, like you could see it in him. And by the way, physically in person, he looks spectacular.
*  He looks like a fucking Adonis. I mean, he looks ready to go. It's crazy. Yeah. Watching videos of
*  him. What about you? Have you ever considered competing in Jiu Jitsu? No, for that very reason.
*  I don't want to get obsessed. That's my, my number one concern. I had to quit video games.
*  When we were playing video games, the studio, I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day,
*  like out of nowhere. All of a sudden I was playing five hours a day. I was coming home late for
*  dinner. I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing. I get obsessed
*  with things and I have to recognize what that is. And these competitive things like competitive,
*  especially like really exciting competitive things like video games, they're very dangerous for me.
*  The ultimate competitive video game is like Jiu Jitsu. And if I was young, I most certainly
*  would have done it if I didn't have like a very clear career path. It was something that I enjoyed.
*  My concern would be that I would become a professional Jiu Jitsu fighter when I was young
*  and then I would not have the energy to do standup and do all the other things that I wound up doing
*  as a career. When I was 21, I quit my job teaching. I was teaching at Boston University.
*  I was teaching Taekwondo there and I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere. I knew I couldn't
*  do it right and also be doing standup comedy. I knew I couldn't do both of those things.
*  There was no way. You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force within you to make sure.
*  Yes. I have to know how to manage my mental illness. That's a very particular mental illness.
*  And I think that mental illness, again, my formative years from 15 till I was 21ish, 22,
*  those years were spent constantly obsessed with martial arts. That was my whole day. I trained
*  almost every day. The only time I would not train is if I was either injured or if I was exhausted,
*  if I needed a day off, but I was obsessed. That part of my personality that I haven't nurtured
*  is always going to be there under the surface. When it gets reignited by something, it's very
*  weird. It's a weird feeling and it can get reignited with a video game. It can get reignited
*  with anything that obsessive, whatever it is, that competitive demon. Yeah. The way you talk
*  about guitar, I know you would fall in love with playing guitar, but I think you're very wise to
*  not touch that thing. That's why I want golf. I have friends who want to golf. I'm like,
*  I ain't fucking with that thing. A lot of people ask me, what's Joe Rogan's jiu-jitsu game like?
*  Like assuming that I somehow spend hours rolling with you before and after we interact.
*  You should at some point show a technique or something. That would be fun.
*  Sure. I've got ... What's your game like? What's your game like?
*  I saw you doing I think head and arm, something online.
*  Yeah. I fucked my neck up doing head and arm chokes. I did them so much that I ... Because
*  you use your neck so much with head and arm chokes, I developed a real kink in my neck
*  and it turned out I had a bulging disc. So you do it on that, just one side?
*  Well, it was ... No, I could do it on the left side, but I definitely am better on the right side.
*  The right side was my best side. If you were to compete, let's say,
*  what's your A game? Where would you go from standing up? How would you go to submission?
*  Would you pull guard? Would you take down? How would you pass guard?
*  I don't have good takedowns. I was not a good wrestler. So I would most likely either pull
*  guard or I would pull half guard. Do you have a good guard?
*  Yes. Are you comfortable being on your butt, on your back?
*  Yes. I'm very flexible. So I have a good ... My rubber guard is pretty good.
*  You got a rubber guard. Yeah. I have good arm bars and good triangles
*  off my back. But I also have a very good half guard, but my top game is my best.
*  I have a very strong top game. Do you have a half guard? Do you have a
*  preference of what kind of guard and how to pass that guard? Is there a specific game plan?
*  Double underhooks from half guard is the game plan for me. If I can get double underhooks from
*  half guard, I could sweep a lot of people. Underhooks of what? Sorry, the arms or the legs?
*  Half guard, lockdown. Half guard, going to lockdown, double underhooks.
*  Got it. Clinch to the body. Suck the body
*  pressure. Massive pressure. And then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight.
*  And inch my way to a position where I could get the person on their back.
*  Yeah. That's what ... Because you did show me, I still disagree with you about the tie thing.
*  The tie. Oh, tie's wrong.
*  So wrong. So wrong. Well, it's not wrong with you. With you, it's wrong because you-
*  No, I think there's a system. I have this thing down here. We're going to figure it out. Okay.
*  Just have a little Velcro on the back.
*  Let's see. You're just not the game. You're cheating?
*  You're not the ... Yeah, exactly. That's cheating. Yeah, I did feel when you showed me,
*  I think you showed me the rubber guard because it's still a little bit foreign to me. I just felt
*  that you can immediately feel, not with the rubber guard, but the way you move your body is
*  you're like a Shangee type of guy who knows how to control another human being. So some people are
*  a little bit more, I would say, agile and playful and kind of-
*  Loose. Loose. They work on transition,
*  transition, transition. You're a control guy. You know how to control position and advance position.
*  Donahear is the same way. He's all about control. My game is smush. That's my game. Smush you.
*  Grab ahold of you. Once I have you, why would I let you go? That's my thought is why would I
*  let you go? I just want to incrementally move to a better position until I can strangle you.
*  But I'm much more into strangling people than anything else.
*  Yeah, which is a great MMA approach for Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms.
*  I'm not opposed to arm bars. I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.
*  And quit from pressure too. I mean, quit mentally. It's nothing like that.
*  You can't breathe. If you got a guy who's like a really good top game guy
*  and he mounts you. And I'm a big fan of mounting with my legs crossed,
*  like a guard, like a top guard. And so I can squeeze with both legs.
*  And I'm just looking for people to make mistakes and slowly incrementally bettering my position
*  until I can get something locked up. I love Jiu-Jitsu though, man. I just wish it didn't
*  injure you. Jiu-Jitsu is like if your joints were more durable, they could figure out a way to make
*  joints more durable. God, Jiu-Jitsu forever. So much fun.
*  Actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick. He's one of the world-class people
*  that builds humanoid robots. He was interested in Boston Dynamics,
*  one of the key people in that kind of robotics. So I asked him the stupidest question of like,
*  how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?
*  And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem. It's the same thing that
*  makes somebody like Danielle Comey on the wrestling side special because you have to
*  understand the movement of the human body in ways that are so difficult to teach. It's so subtle.
*  The timing, the pressure points, the leverage, all those kinds of things. That's just for the
*  clinch situation. And then the movement for the striking is very difficult as long as you're not
*  allowed as a robot to use your natural abilities of having a lot more power.
*  Right. A lot more power and then more durable.
*  Right. The human body, especially meniscus. You see the heel hook game, everybody's involved in
*  leg locks and heel hooks. All those guys wind up with torched knees. Everyone's got torched knees.
*  Everyone's knees are torn apart. And you don't grow new meniscus. That's one of those joints where,
*  man, when it goes, those guys are 28 years old, have blown out knees.
*  Let me ask the ridiculous question. We're talking about cops. What do you think,
*  is the best martial arts for self-defense?
*  For sure, jiu-jitsu. Yeah, for sure.
*  Wrestling?
*  I think grappling, I should say. Judo as well, especially in a cold climate. If you get someone
*  who's got a heavy winter jacket on, my God, Judo's an incredible martial art.
*  Plus concrete.
*  That's the worst place to be with a heavy winter jacket with a Judo specialist,
*  and you're standing up with them. Oh my God. But I think grappling, because in most self-defense
*  situations, it usually winds up with grappling. You're definitely better off, though, knowing
*  some striking, because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone
*  down. They actually have takedown skills, but they can fight. And so they have takedown defense,
*  and they know how to fight, and then you don't know how to stand up. The worst thing in the world is
*  seeing someone reaching who doesn't know how to do striking, and someone cracks you.
*  What about all that Krav Maga talk, which is the whole line of argument that says that jiu-jitsu
*  and wrestling and all of these sports, they fundamentally take you away from the nature
*  of violence. So they're just teaching you how to play versus the reality of violence that is
*  involved in a self-defense situation that is a totally different set of skills would be needed.
*  In general, the people that say that jiu-jitsu or other martial arts, it's more of a sport,
*  and they don't really understand violence. In general, the people that say that suck.
*  Anybody who thinks someone's like, hey, man, I'll just bite you. I'm like, are you going to bite me?
*  Okay. Do you think I'm going to bite you too? What do you think of that? What if I punch you
*  in your fucking face? You think you're still going to bite me when you can't even see,
*  when you barely even know you're alive and I choke you unconscious? If someone's really good
*  at jiu-jitsu, good luck stabbing them with your keys. You don't have a chance. If someone's much
*  better at you and they trip you and get you on your back and then they fucking elbow you in your
*  face and get a head and arm choke on you, all that crap magotia that's out the window, son,
*  you're way better off learning what works on trained killers. This whole idea that you're
*  going to poke someone in the eye and then you're going to kick them in the nuts. You're going
*  through these drills that, yeah, it's good to know what to do if you run into someone who doesn't
*  know how to fight. It's way better to know what to do to someone who knows how to fight.
*  That's the best thing. Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.
*  All that practice self-defense and they go, it's going to come at you with a knife. You're going
*  to grab the wrist and do that. It's good to know self-defense, but it's much more important to
*  understand martial arts comprehensively. When you understand martial arts comprehensively,
*  there's no Krav Maga guys, but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy and a mixed martial arts guy
*  had a fight and the mixed martial arts guy who's a trained killer all around didn't fuck that guy up.
*  That's what I would expect would happen. I would not think that some guy who has a little bit of
*  this and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets is going to be able to handle a person
*  who trains with killers on a day-to-day basis, who rolls with Jiu-Jitsu black belts, who trains with
*  Muay Thai champions. The best martial arts are the martial arts that work on martial artists,
*  not the martial arts that work on untrained people.
*  We're in Texas now. What about guns?
*  That's the best martial art.
*  No, but would you, in this crazy time, should people carry guns?
*  It's not a bad idea to have a gun because if you need a gun, you have a gun. If you don't need a
*  gun, if you're a person with self-control, you're not going to use it. You're not going to just
*  randomly use it, but you have something to protect you. This is the whole idea of the Second
*  Amendment. The whole idea of the Second Amendment gets distorted by mass shootings or by
*  terrible people who murder people and do terrible things. All those things are real,
*  but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy of having a firearm and defending your
*  family or defending your life. There are real live situations where people have had firearms
*  and it's protected them or their loved ones or they've stopped shooters. There's many of these
*  stories, but people don't like those stories because then it tends to lead to this gun culture
*  argument, this pro-gun culture argument that people find very uncomfortable.
*  Human beings are messy and we're messy in so many different ways. We're messy
*  emotionally. We're messy physically, but we're also messy in what's good or bad. We want things
*  to be binary. We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero, and they're not, but there is crime
*  in the world. There is violence in the world and you're better off knowing how to fight
*  and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself and you're better off having a gun.
*  I generally think that guns, I do like the idea that guns, Second Amendment helps protect the
*  First Amendment. There's a sense that puts me at ease knowing that so many people in this country
*  have guns that Alex Jones, I just listened to one episode of Infowars for the first time.
*  Boy, he reminds me when I drank some tequila, I felt like I'm going to some dark places today.
*  That's how I feel listening to him. He talks about that he worries about martial law,
*  so basically government overreach, which happened throughout history. There's something to worry
*  about there, but it puts me at ease knowing that so much of the population has guns that
*  government would think twice before instituting martial law in cities. I actually was asking
*  on the individual level. I maybe shouldn't say this, but I don't yet own a gun. I felt that if
*  I carry a gun, statistically, just for me as a human knowing my psychology, I feel like I'm more
*  likely to die. I feel like I would put myself in situations that I shouldn't. The way I will see
*  the world will change. My natural feeling is when I was in Philly, and I knew late at night
*  in West Philly, when some guy looks at you, you can immediately calculate that this is a dangerous
*  human being. It starts with a monkey look at first, like I'm a bigger monkey than you.
*  That's where I found, for example, I'll do the beta thing of just looking down and turning away
*  and just getting out of trouble very politely. Basically, that kind of approach, because if you
*  have, in terms of getting out of serious violence situations, serious something where you could die,
*  versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be that cowboy monkey thing where I would want
*  to put myself in situations where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself, and almost create
*  danger, the escalation of which I can no longer control.
*  Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere versus having a gun in your home.
*  Yes, yes. I mean carrying on me.
*  That's a different situation, and much harder to get a license for that.
*  Concealed carry licenses, especially in Massachusetts, they don't come easy.
*  Well, Massachusetts, yeah, that's a whole other thing.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're saying gun in the home makes sense.
*  Yeah, gun in the home, knowing how to use a gun. I know how to use a gun. I've trained many hours
*  learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places. There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on
*  Instagram. I practice, and I think it's good to understand how to be accurate.
*  So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time. You don't often talk about it,
*  because you're always kind of looking forward, but if you look at the old studio that you just left,
*  is there some epic memories that stand out to you that you almost look back,
*  I can't believe this happened?
*  Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.
*  Is there something that pops into mind now?
*  All of them. Elon Musk blowing that flamethrower in the middle of the hallway.
*  I got a video of that. Have you seen the video of it?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you posted on Instagram.
*  I think I did too. Yeah, he's a madman. Having Bernie Sanders in there,
*  you know, just all the fun fight companions we did and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz
*  and Duncan Trussell. There were so many. There were so many moments. Podcasts,
*  this is a weird art form, and it almost seems like, sounds silly, but it almost seems like
*  something that chose me rather than I chose it. I think of that all the time in some strange way.
*  I'm showing up as an antenna and I just plug in and twist on and then I take in the thing and
*  I put it together and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride.
*  You've talked about this before. I really like this idea
*  of that human beings are just carriers of these ideas. Ideas are the ones who are breeding.
*  In a sense, the idea found you as a useful brain to use to spread itself through the podcasting
*  medium. When I think about your podcast, I think about Joey Diaz. I think about all those
*  comedians you've had. I think you've had Joey on maybe close to 50 times, some crazy number.
*  He is over the top offensive. Just that's who he is to the core. Is there some sense where
*  you wondered whether it's right to have the Spotify episode number one with Duncan Dressel
*  for five hours? No. I wanted to do it that way. That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as
*  fuck. That's the whole idea behind it. Can you introspect that a little bit? What is that?
*  Because that's rare. It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed to talk to Duncan
*  Dressel with a huge platform that you have five hours. Why not? Because Donald Trump apparently
*  watches your podcast. Just the idea that there's these ... That's what I think about these CEOs
*  write to me that they listen to the podcast that I do. I have somebody like a David Fravor,
*  and I was nervous about it. I was nervous to have a conversation. For me, David Fravor is a Duncan
*  Dressel, which is like- Just because of his experiences with UFOs.
*  Yeah. Even just the way he sees the world because he is open. I don't know if he's always like this,
*  but he opened himself to the possibility of unconventional ideas. Most people in the
*  scientific community say, well, I don't really want to believe anything that doesn't have a lot
*  of hard evidence. That was to me a step. As the thing somehow becomes more popular, there becomes
*  this fear of, well, should I talk to this person or not? You're an inspiration in saying, do whatever
*  the hell you want. You have to. First of all, I have what you call fuck you money. If you have
*  fuck you money, you don't say fuck you. What's the point of having the fuck you money? You're
*  wasting it. You're wasting the position. Someone said to me, why do you like sports cars so much?
*  How many cars do you have? A bunch of cars. If I was a kid and I said, hey, if I was that
*  crazy rich famous guy, I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars.
*  I would do that because not everybody gets to do that. If you're the person that gets to do that,
*  you're supposed to do it if you want to, if that really does speak to you.
*  I've talked to you about this before, muscle cars, specifically ones for the 1960s and the early
*  70s. They speak to me in some weird way, man. I could just stare at them. I have a 65 Corvette.
*  I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around. I just stare at it.
*  What's your favorite muscle car? What's your most badass late 60s, the perfect car?
*  Probably that car, probably that 65 Corvette.
*  65 Corvette.
*  Yeah. I walk around it when no one's around.
*  I think I've driven the 69 Corvette. Is there a particular year that just-
*  65 is generation two, 69 is generation three, 69 is even more curvy. They're both awesome,
*  just awesome in different ways. I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.
*  The point is I like what I like. If I can do what I want to do, I should do what I want to do.
*  It's not hurting anybody. The thing is I would do the Duncan podcast if no one was listening.
*  If we were just starting to do a podcast together and no one cared and it got like 2,000 views,
*  which we did for years, I would do it with Duncan and we would get high and we'd talk crazy shit
*  about aliens and spaceships and maybe, dude, maybe ideas are living life forms and they're
*  inside your head and that's how things get made.
*  Man.
*  Yeah, man. I've just morphed me and him together in that because the life form,
*  ideal life form idea is mine that I really think about a lot.
*  I think about it on a technical side, by the way. When I heard you say that,
*  because I've been thinking, I was like, whoa, that's interesting.
*  They might be alive because I don't know what the fuck they are, but when someone has an idea for
*  whatever, an invention, a toaster, and then they think about this, all it needs is these heating
*  elements and a spring and then it pops when it's done, so you have a timer and then they build this
*  thing. Now, all of a sudden it's alive. It's like you manifested it in a physical form.
*  Toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane, you're thinking about a thing,
*  like an idea comes into your head and you can say, oh, well, it's just creativity. It's a part of
*  being a person. That's how we invented tools and how we became better hunters. All those things
*  are true. I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying, but there's also a possibility
*  that we're simplifying something by saying that it's just creativity, that it's just a natural
*  human inclination to invent things. Why? Is it possible that ideas, creativity, we are the only
*  animal, there's a few species that create things like bees, make beehives, but they're very uniform.
*  Some animals use tools, chimps will use sticks to get termites and things like that, but
*  there's something about what we do that makes you wonder because we look at this room that we're in,
*  look at all these electronics, look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented and
*  then built upon others' inventions and proved and innovated. These all came out of ideas.
*  It germinates in someone's head, it bounces around, they write it down, they share it with others,
*  the other people who have similar ideas or ideas that are complementary, they work together,
*  and they change the world. The new thing in that is the idea is not the people.
*  We think we found the ideas, but it's more like the ideas found us.
*  Find you. Yeah. They're literally in the air. They come to you. I always felt like that with bits.
*  When I come up with a bit, that's why I'm always telling people about the Steven Pressfield book,
*  The War of Art, because he talks about respecting the muse and the idea that your ideas come when
*  you sit down and you do the work or you sit down like a professional and you talk to the muse.
*  Like, come tell me what to do. If the muse was a real thing, as if the muse is some mystical creature
*  that comes and delivers you ideas. Even if that's not real, that's how it works. It does work like
*  that. If you do treat it like it's a muse and you treat it with the respect and you treat it like
*  a professional, the ideas do come to you. I never thought about what he's doing is just sitting there
*  waiting for the idea that's trying to breed to find him. That's a trippy thing. If you show up,
*  if you show up and put in the time and focus your energy on that, the ideas, they will arrive.
*  They will arrive. And that's the same with writing comedy. There's been many, many times where I'll
*  come home from the comedy store and I just sit down and I start writing and I just, I've got
*  nothing. There's nothing there. I'm just writing. It's all bullshit. Nothing's good. It's just like,
*  and then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea. And then all of a sudden I can't stop. And then,
*  you know, a couple of hours later and I'm like, whoa. And then the next night I'm on stage and
*  I'm like, how about that? Boom! It gets this big laugh. I'm like, holy shit. And I know that came
*  out of the discipline to sit down and call the muse. I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found
*  you to like, oh, I'm going to use this dude. Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular.
*  I'm going to breathe inside his brain and spread it to others. It's the same as,
*  or an inventor. You know, I'm going to use this guy who's like desperately seeking some sort of a
*  product to bring to market. Some guy who wants to invent things is thinking about inventing things
*  all the time. These ideas, they weasel their way into your head. And it seems to me also that
*  the frequency that your mind operates under has to be correct. Because one of the things
*  about creativity seems to be if you think about yourself a lot, if you're really into yourself
*  or your image or you're selfish, those ideas are not, they don't find you.
*  That's funny. It stifles the opportunity that the idea has for defining.
*  Yes. Which is one of the reasons why joke thieves, people that steal jokes are terrible writers.
*  There's never like really good writers who are also joke thieves. It's just joke thieves.
*  And then, you know, when they have to write on their own, if they get exposed, they become
*  terrible comedians. They're a shadow of what they were when they were stealing other people's ideas.
*  Because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea is that ego part,
*  the wanting to claim it for yourself, the wanting to be the man or the woman. You want to be the
*  person who gets out there and says it and everybody's going to love me for it. You can't think like that
*  and be creative. It requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to create.
*  When I'm writing, I'm blank. I'm just staring. The part of my mind that's active is not like me.
*  It's like this weird core function part where I'm not aware of my personality. I'm not aware of
*  anything. I'm just trying to put it together in a way that I know works.
*  Just being there, being present. As the press feels, I'm a big believer just sitting there,
*  staring at a blank page, putting in the time. Sometimes it's not that way. Sometimes it's an
*  inspiration. Sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner and I'll be like, I got an idea. My wife
*  is really cool about that. I have an idea and I have to just run out of the room real quick and
*  I write it down on my phone and then I can come back. Because those are like little gifts that
*  you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere. Some people rely only on those gifts.
*  You know, and I've talked to comics about it. They're like, oh, I can't come up with my best
*  ideas when I don't write. I'm like, no, I do too. I come up with great ideas when I don't write,
*  but I also write. You can do both of those things. They're not mutually exclusive.
*  You mentioned fuck you money. I feel like I have fuck you money now. A year ago, I was at zero. I
*  have fuck you money now because probably my standard is my ... I don't need much in this world,
*  because also probably because of you, but it's 300 to 400,000 people listen to every episode I do.
*  That's a lot.
*  And that is weird. It's definitely ...
*  That's a successful television show on cable.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  It's all you.
*  It's hilarious.
*  That's amazing.
*  But at this point, that also resulted in fuck you money in a sense that I don't need anything else
*  in this world. By way of asking, I've looked up ... You've inspired me for a long time.
*  Do you have advice? You've done this on the podcast side of life. Do you have advice
*  for somebody like ... For me and somebody like me going on this journey? Eric Weinstein is going
*  on this journey. Is there advice, both small and big, that you have for somebody like me?
*  The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you and do what you're doing. Obviously,
*  it's resonating with people if you're getting that big of an audience. I've listened to your
*  podcast. You're very good at it. Just keep doing it the way you're doing it. Don't let anybody else
*  get involved.
*  What about ... You've connected ... I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store.
*  I met him at the Ice House.
*  At the Ice House?
*  Ice House. Well, I think I met him at the Comedy Store, but then we talked at the Ice House.
*  I mean, what ...
*  You'd have to ask him.
*  Did you think deeply about ... Because you basically have nobody on your team.
*  So it almost feels like a marriage. Were you selective about a Jamie to somebody to bring
*  into your little circle?
*  Well, Jamie's exceptional.
*  He is. He's a special ... I mean, he might have grown ... I don't remember how he was
*  in the early days, maybe you could say, but he's grown into a special ...
*  He's definitely better at it, but right away, he's exceptional. He's got very little ego.
*  He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention. He's not a guy who overestimates anything
*  in terms of negative or positive. His interpretation of whether it's good things
*  that happen to the show or bad things that happen to the show, he just takes it all flat.
*  He's chill. He's just cool as fuck, and he's so smart, and he's so good as an audio engineer,
*  and as a podcast producer. He's the best.
*  But he's basically one of the only people on this whole team.
*  How do you find ... I mean, when you let people in ... I mean, I'm sure other people wanted to
*  get involved. Why don't you have a co-host? You basically kind of ... Well ...
*  Here's the problem with a co-host. When you and I are talking, when we're talking, I'm tuned
*  in to you, and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying, and I'm listening, and I'm interpreting
*  it, and then I'm calculating whether or not I have anything to say, whether to let you keep
*  talking, whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further, or whether I have a
*  disagreement. There's a dance that's going on. Now, when there's another person there,
*  chiming in too, it fucks the dance up. It's like dancing ... If you're doing a dance with someone,
*  if you're slow dancing with someone, and then a third person's there stepping on everyone's feet,
*  sometimes it's fun. Sometimes having a third person is fun. Comedy podcasts, sometimes it's fun.
*  Debate-
*  Fight companions.
*  Kind of structured.
*  Yeah, debate structures. But even then, it gets difficult because people talk over each other.
*  Also, I find that without headphones, it's way easier to talk over each other. You make mistakes.
*  You don't hear it the same way. When you have headphones, I hear what you hear. It's all one
*  sound. The audience hears exactly ... Or rather, I hear exactly what the audience hears.
*  Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours because you're over there. If I don't have
*  headphones on, it doesn't sound all together.
*  Yeah. At that point, one of the interesting things about your show is you almost never have done,
*  and you just generally don't do remote ... Sorry, not remote calls, but you don't go to another
*  person's location.
*  Yeah, I've only done a few, a small handful.
*  And just like, well, this is a Paul Ski. He should do this. But actually, we went back and forth on
*  email. I told him he needs to get his ass back in this studio. He's working on a book.
*  I was a fan of his a long time ago because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis. I reached out to him
*  a long time ago before he was willing to do it. But then I caught him in downtown LA. He was there
*  for something else, and I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.
*  Well, he doesn't get, I think ... Some of those folks don't get how much magic can happen in this
*  podcast studio. Bigger than anything they've ever done in terms of their work. I'm not talking about
*  reach, but in terms of the discovery of new ideas, there's something magical about conversation.
*  Somebody as brilliant as him, if he gives himself over to the conversation for multiple hours at a
*  time, that's another place where you've been an inspiration. Where I'm getting more and more
*  confidence of telling people, like any Elon Musk, that a lot of CEOs are like, well, he has 30
*  minutes on his schedule. I'm like, no, three hours. And then they're like, so some say no,
*  and then they come back. There's people that started coming back to like, okay, we're starting
*  to get it. They start to get it. And you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense, that there's some
*  value in long form. They think that nobody wants to listen for more than 30 minutes. They think,
*  like, I have nothing to say. But the reality is, if you just give yourself over to like the three
*  hours, just let it go, three hours, four hours, whatever it is, there's so much to discover about
*  what you didn't even know you think. Yeah. Yeah. You have to be confident that you could do it.
*  And in the beginning, I just did it because that's what I wanted to do. And no one was listening. So
*  I've always been a curious person. So I've always been interested in listening to how people think
*  about things and talking to people about their mindset and just expanding on my own ideas,
*  just talking shit. And so we would have these podcasts and they would go on forever. And
*  I have my friend Ari, I never let him die, never let this die down. Never let him forget this. He
*  was always like, you have to edit your podcast. I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up.
*  I go, why? He's like, because people are not going to listen to it. I go, they don't have to.
*  Yeah. I go, you listen to part of it. He goes, just do it. Just I'm telling you, trust me,
*  cut it down to like 45 minutes. That's all you need. And I'm like, no, no, I don't think you're
*  right. I like listening to long form things. No one has that kind of time. I go, okay, I'm
*  just going to keep doing it this way. So stick to your gut. No, he doesn't. His are like two and a
*  half hours long now. That's great. You won. But you wouldn't like say, I mentioned to you this before,
*  this is going to happen. It's actually made a lot of progress towards it. I'm going to talk to Putin,
*  but you wouldn't travel to Putin if you wanted to talk to you. Putin is a dangerous character.
*  He's not. Have you ever seen the thing with Jerry Craft where he stole his Super Bowl ring?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.
*  Oh really? I think it's a little bit, he just decided he's going to steal that Super Bowl ring.
*  Kind of. I think it was a- Kind of. He thought-
*  Can I see your ring? He shows him his ring and then he puts it on and says,
*  I could murder somebody with this ring. And then he walks off with it.
*  It's possible he did it as a, he's a big believer in displays of power.
*  Yeah. So like it's possible he did that, but I think he sees himself as like
*  a tool with which to demonstrate that Russia still belongs on the stage of the big players.
*  And so he, a lot of actions are selected through that lens, but in terms of a human being,
*  outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done, he is a really thoughtful,
*  intelligent, fun human being, like the wit and the depth from the JRE perspective is really
*  interesting. I'm like his manager now selling the, he's a judo guy.
*  He's really good at judo. I have seen him practice judo. He's a legit black belt.
*  And not only that, he loves it, not just skill wise, but to talk about it, to reason about it,
*  to think about it, to MMA as well. So, you know, it'd be a good conversation,
*  but you wouldn't travel to him. Well, that's hold to your principle. So that's the core
*  of the advice. Just hold to whatever- I would rather, here's the thing.
*  There's not a person that I have to have on the show. And I'm happy to talk to anybody. I'm just
*  as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump, as I am to probably more happy to talk to you.
*  As I am to talk to Mike Tyson, as I am to talk to Joey Diaz. I like talking to people.
*  I enjoy doing podcasts. I enjoy talking to a variety of people and I schedule them based on,
*  I want to like, I try not to get too many right wing people in a row or too many progressive
*  people in a row. I don't want to get repetitive. I try not to get too many fighters in a row.
*  I try to balance it out. Not too many comedians. Comedians are the one group where I can have
*  three, four in a row, five in a row, because that's my tribe. Those are my people. It's easy.
*  We can talk about anything. It's a weird dance. The conversations that you're doing on a podcast,
*  they're a strange dance. And you want to not step on your own feet and you want to make sure that
*  you do it in a way, do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people. Conversations are
*  learning how to talk to people. It's a weird skill. It's a weird skill that took a long time
*  for me to get good at. And I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it. And then I just
*  thought you're just talking. I was just, I know how to talk. We'll just talk to people. And then
*  along the way I realized like, oh, and then when you talk to people that are bad at it, you realize
*  that it's a skill. Like particularly one of the things about my people, about comedians is a lot
*  of them tend to want to talk, but don't want to listen. So they're waiting for you to stop
*  talking so they can talk, but they're not necessarily thinking about what you're saying.
*  And they're just waiting for their opportunity or they talk over you or they, and I try real hard
*  not to do that. And sometimes I fail, but when I'm at my best, I'm dancing.
*  Ultimately, the skill conversation is just really listening and listening and thinking.
*  Listening and thinking and being genuinely curious and really having a take on what they're
*  saying and maybe a follow-up question or maybe, it's got to be real. It's got to be authentic.
*  And when it is authentic and it's real, it resonates with people. They're listening and they go,
*  oh, I'm locked in with the way you're thinking. You two guys are in a conversation and I'm locked
*  in. When she talks and you listen, I'm listening too. When he says something to her or when she
*  says something to him, there's a thing that happens during conversations where you're there.
*  You're listening to, and it's with me, when I listen to a good podcast, I feel like I'm in the
*  room. I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like the friend that got to sit down and listen.
*  Yeah, it's a great conversation. I love conversations. I love listening to them
*  and I love putting them together. The fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big,
*  it's stunning to me. It blows me away. I never anticipated it. Never thought for a second that
*  stupid thing that I used to do on my couch in my office was the biggest thing I've ever done in my
*  life by far. People used to make fun of it. There's a comedy story documentary that's coming out
*  and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend, Tom Segura, when he first started doing
*  my podcast, he would be leaving and he would talk to Red Band. He's like, what the fuck is he doing?
*  Why is he doing this? Who's listening? He's like, oh, some people like it. And he's like,
*  fucking nonsense, waste of time. And in the documentary, it shows like 2000 views,
*  like one of the early Ustream episodes. Hilarious. And they don't just like it. They
*  form a friendship with you. Even me, when people come up to me, the love in their eyes is kind of
*  beautiful. It's weird, right? Yeah. You're part of their life. Yeah. And I don't know, it's also
*  heartbreaking because you realize you'll never really get to know them back, like,
*  because they clearly are friends with you. Yes. Yeah. And it's sad to see a person who's clearly
*  brilliant and interesting and is friends with you, but you don't get a chance to return that love.
*  My kids, it took them a while to figure out what's going on, but people come up to me and
*  you know, they would say something like, hey man, I fucking love you. Thanks, man. All right. Hey,
*  brother. Nice to meet you. My daughter was like six. She'd be like, do you know him? Yeah. I'm
*  like, no, I don't know him. She's like, how does he know you? It's very weird conversation I used
*  to have with young kids when I'd explain, I'd do this thing called the podcast and millions of
*  people listen. So now one of my daughters is 12 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy and
*  he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me. And so she's weirded out and she says to him,
*  I don't even think you like me. I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo.
*  She's going to have that conversation a few stages in her life.
*  That hard conversation with a boyfriend. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Well, that's the thing about
*  men too. This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine. I'm a man and I'm not, I'm also a man
*  that doesn't have to go through some sort of a corporate filter. I'm not going through
*  executive producers who tell me don't have this guest on, don't talk about that. We looked at
*  focus groups and they don't seem to like when you do this. There's none of that. I just do it.
*  So I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars and people are like, I don't want to hear
*  you talk about cars. Well, good. Congratulations. You found what you like. Here's good news.
*  There's 1500 other ones. Go listen to the other episodes where I don't talk about cars.
*  You don't have to listen. And it's not like your brand, you just are who you are and that's what
*  you do. It's authentically what I'm interested in. All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David
*  Fravor about his experience with UFOs, whether I'm talking to David Sinclair about life extension,
*  whether I'm talking to you about artificial intelligence or what, it's because I want to
*  talk to these people and that resonates. I like when people are into shit. I've talked about this
*  before. Things that I have no interest in making furniture, but I like this PBS show where this guy
*  makes furniture by hand. I love watching it. Because he's so into it. Is he sanding this and
*  polishing that? I'm not going to do that. I don't give a fuck about furniture. Furniture for me is
*  function, like this desk. Function works, but I love when people are into it. I'm happy that someone
*  can make it and they do a great job, but I'm not interested in the task or even the finished product
*  as much as I'm interested in someone's passion for something.
*  The passion that they've put into this, that shines through. Last question. I sometimes ask this just
*  what is it? To challenge, to make people roll their eyes, to make legitimate scientists roll
*  their eyes. I ask what is the meaning of life according to Joe Rogan?
*  I do not think there is a meaning. I think there's many, many meanings of life. I think there's a way
*  to navigate life that's enjoyable. I think it requires many things. It requires, first of all,
*  it requires love. You have to have loved ones. You have to have family. You have to have friends.
*  You have to have people that care about you and you have to care about them. I think that is primary.
*  Then it also requires interests. There has to be things that stimulate you. Now, it could be just
*  a subsistence lifestyle. There's many people that believe and practice this lifestyle of just living
*  off the land and hunting and fishing and living in the woods and they seem incredibly happy.
*  There's something to be said for that. That is an interest. There's something and there's a
*  direct connection between their actions and their sustenance. They get their food that way. They're
*  connected to nature and it's very satisfying for them. If you don't have that, I think you need
*  something that is interesting to you, something that you're passionate about. There's far too
*  many people that get sucked into living a life where you're just doing a job. You're just showing
*  up and putting in your time and then going home, but you don't have a passion for what you're doing.
*  I think that's a recipe for a boring and very unfulfilling life.
*  You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack. We talked about the demons and the violence
*  in there somewhere. What's the role of love in your own life?
*  It's very important, man. That's one of the reasons why I'm so interested in helping people.
*  I'm very interested in people feeling good. I like them to feel good. I want to help them. I like
*  doing things that make them feel like, oh, you care about me. Yeah, I care about you. I really do.
*  I want people to feel good. I want my family to feel good. I want my friends to feel good.
*  I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience. I'm a big believer in as much as I
*  can to spread positive energy and joy and happiness and relay all the good advice that
*  I've ever gotten. All the things that I've learned and if they can benefit people, then I find that
*  those things benefit people and actually improve the quality of their life or improve their success
*  or improve their relationships. I'm very happy to do that. That means a lot to me.
*  The way we interact with each other is so important. It's one of the reasons why
*  someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed. It's so devastating because there's all these
*  people that negative, all this negative energy coming your way and you feel it. As much as I
*  like to pretend that you're immune to that kind of stuff and some people do like to pretend that,
*  you feel it. There's a tangible force when people are upset at you. That's the same with loved ones
*  or family or anytime someone's upset at you, whether it's a giant group of people or there's
*  a small amount of people. That has an impact on you and your psyche and your physical being.
*  The more you can spread love and the more love comes back to you, you also create this butterfly
*  effect where other people start recognizing like, oh, when he's nice to me, I feel better and then
*  I'm going to be nicer to people. When I'm nicer to people, they feel better and I feel better.
*  It spreads outward. That's one thing that I've done through this podcast, I think, is I've imparted
*  my personal philosophy in kindness and generosity to other people.
*  To correct you, you didn't do it. The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain have
*  figured out. Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air have made their way into my head.
*  Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas they figured out.
*  Oh, yes. Probably, man. Probably. As far as the meaning of life, without that, you have nothing.
*  One of the biggest failures in life is to be extremely successful financially, but everybody
*  hates you. Everybody hates you and you're just miserable and alone and angry and depressed and
*  sad. When you hear about rich, famous people that commit suicide, wow, you've missed the mark. You
*  got some parts right, but you put too many eggs in one basket. You put too many eggs in the
*  financial basket or the success basket or the accomplishment basket and not enough in the
*  friendship and love basket. There's a balance to that. When I talked about the violence and all
*  that stuff, that to me is me understanding recognizing that is me trying to achieve that
*  balance. It's to go kill those demons so that this boat is level. Because if it's not, then the boat
*  is like this and then everything's all fucked up and every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.
*  Balance that boat out. Figure it out. Know who you are. Some people don't have that problem at all.
*  Some people, they could just go for walks and they're cool as a cucumber. I need more. I need
*  kettlebells. I need a heavy bag. I need the Echo bike, the Air Assault bike. I need some hardcore
*  shit. If I don't get that, I don't feel good. I figured that out too and that makes me a nicer
*  person and that makes my interactions nicer. It changes the quality of my friendships and
*  my relationships with people. I think we mentioned Neuralink. I can certainly guarantee that this is
*  one of the memories I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now once we get the feature ready. Joe, it's
*  a huge honor to talk to you. It's an honor to talk to you too, man. I'm glad you came down here for
*  this. The first week of me doing this here and it's very cool to have you always. I hope you make
*  Texas cool again and do your podcast another 10, 11, whatever, however many years you're still on
*  this earth. All right. Thank you, brother. Appreciate you, man. Thanks for listening to this
