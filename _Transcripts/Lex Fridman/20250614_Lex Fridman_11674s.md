# Terence Tao: Hardest Problems in Mathematics, Physics & the Future of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #472
**Lex Fridman:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k)
*  The following is a conversation with Terence Tao, widely considered to be one of the greatest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=0.0s)]
*  mathematicians in history, often referred to as the Mozart of math. He won the Fields Medal and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6.16s)]
*  the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics and has contributed groundbreaking work to a truly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=14.08s)]
*  astonishing range of fields in mathematics and physics. This was a huge honor for me, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=19.2s)]
*  for many reasons, including the humility and kindness that Terry showed to me throughout [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=26.16s)]
*  all our interactions. It means the world. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=33.04s)]
*  please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfriedman.com slash sponsors. And now, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=39.76s)]
*  dear friends, here's Terence Tao. What was the first really difficult [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=45.92s)]
*  research-level math problem that you encountered? One that gave you pause, maybe. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=53.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, in your undergraduate education, you learn about the really hard and possible [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  problems like the Riemann hypothesis, the Trinprimes conjecture. You can make problems [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=62.56s)]
*  arbitrarily difficult. That's not really a problem. In fact, there's even problems that we know to be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=67.44s)]
*  unsolvable. What's really interesting are the problems just on the boundary between what we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=70.8s)]
*  can do easily and what are hopeless. But what are problems where existing techniques can do like [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  90% of the job and then you just need that remaining 10%. I think as a PhD student, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=82.32s)]
*  the Kakeya problem certainly caught my eye. And it just got solved, actually. It's a problem I've [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=89.36s)]
*  worked on a lot in my early research. Historically, it came from a little puzzle by the Japanese [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  mathematician, Soichi Kakeya, in like 1918 or so. So the puzzle is that you have a needle [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=98.0s)]
*  in on the plane. Think like driving on a road. And you want to execute a U-turn. You want to turn [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=106.88s)]
*  the needle around. But you want to do it in as little space as possible. So you want to use this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=115.52s)]
*  little area in order to turn it around. But the needle is infinitely maneuverable. So you can [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=120.88s)]
*  imagine just spinning it around as a unit needle. You can spin it around its center. And I think [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=128.0s)]
*  that gives you a disc of area, I think pi over four. Or you can do a three-point U-turn, which [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=134.16s)]
*  is what we teach people in the driving schools to do. And that actually takes area pi over eight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=139.12s)]
*  So it's a little bit more efficient than a rotation. And so for a while, people thought that was the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=144.96s)]
*  most efficient way to turn things around. But Bezikovitch showed that, in fact, you could [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=149.52s)]
*  actually turn the needle around using as little area as you wanted. So 0.001, there was some really [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=154.72s)]
*  fancy multi back and forth U-turn thing that you could do. That you could turn the needle around. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=160.88s)]
*  And in so doing, it would pass through every intermediate direction. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=167.92s)]
*  Is this in the two-dimensional plane? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=170.72s)]
*  This is in the two-dimensional plane. So we understand everything in two dimensions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=172.4s)]
*  So the next question is what happens in three dimensions. So suppose the Hubble Space Telescope [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=175.92s)]
*  is a tube in space. And you want to observe every single star in the universe. So you want to rotate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=181.04s)]
*  the telescope to every single direction. And here's the unrealistic part. Suppose that space is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  at a premium, which it totally is not. You want to occupy as little volume as possible in order to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=190.56s)]
*  rotate your needle around in order to see every single star in the sky. How small a volume do you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=196.16s)]
*  need to do that? And so you can modify Bezikovitch's construction. And so if your telescope has zero [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=201.68s)]
*  thickness, then you can use as little volume as you need. That's a simple modification of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=207.76s)]
*  two-dimensional construction. But the question is that if your telescope is not zero thickness, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=211.84s)]
*  but just very, very thin, some thickness delta, what is the minimum volume needed to be able to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=216.32s)]
*  see every single direction as a function of delta? So as delta gets smaller, as the needle gets [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=222.48s)]
*  thinner, the volume should go down. But how fast does it go down? And the conjecture was that it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  goes down very, very slowly, like logarithically, roughly speaking. And that was proved after a lot [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=234.88s)]
*  of work. So this seems like a puzzle. Why is it interesting? So it turns out to be surprisingly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=241.2s)]
*  connected to a lot of problems in partial differential equations, in number theory, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=246.32s)]
*  in geometry, combinatorics. For example, in wave propagation, you splash some water around, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=250.48s)]
*  you create water waves and they travel in various directions. But waves exhibit both [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=255.92s)]
*  particle and wave type behavior. So you can have what's called a wave packet, which is like a very [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=261.28s)]
*  localized wave that is localized in space and moving a certain direction in time. And so if [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=266.08s)]
*  you plot it in both space and time, it occupies a region which looks like a tube. And so what can [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=271.12s)]
*  happen is that you can have a wave which initially is very dispersed, but it all focuses at a single [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=277.04s)]
*  point later in time. You can imagine dropping a pebble into a pond and the ripples spread out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=282.72s)]
*  But then if you time-reverse that scenario and the equations of wave motion are time-reversible, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  you can imagine ripples that are converging to a single point and then a big splash occurs, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=293.44s)]
*  maybe even a singularity. And so it's possible to do that. And geometrically what's going on is that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  there's always light rays. So if this wave represents light, for example, you can imagine [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=306.24s)]
*  this wave as a superposition of photons all traveling at the speed of light. They all travel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  in these light rays and they're all focusing at this one point. So you can have a very dispersed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=316.72s)]
*  wave focus into a very concentrated wave at one point in space and time, but then it defocuses [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=320.4s)]
*  again and it separates. But potentially if the conjecture had a negative solution, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=326.24s)]
*  so what I mean is that there's a very efficient way to pack tubes pointing in different directions [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=331.36s)]
*  to a very, very narrow region of very narrow volume, then you would also be able to create [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=336.72s)]
*  waves that start out, there'll be some arrangement of waves that start out very, very dispersed, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  but they would concentrate not just at a single point, but there'll be a lot of concentrations [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  in space and time. And you could create what's called a blow up where these waves, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=354.8s)]
*  their amplitude becomes so great that the laws of physics that they're governed by are no longer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  wave equations, but something more complicated and nonlinear. And so in mathematical physics, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  we care a lot about whether certain equations and wave equations are stable or not, whether they can [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  create these singularities. There's a famous unsolved problem called the Navier-Stokes [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  regularity problem. So the Navier-Stokes equations, equations that govern the fluid [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  flow or incompressible fluids like water. The question asks, if you start with a smooth [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=382.96s)]
*  velocity field of water, can it ever concentrate so much that the velocity becomes infinite [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=387.44s)]
*  at some point? That's called a singularity. We don't see that in real life. If you splash [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=392.32s)]
*  around water on the bathtub, it won't explode on you or have water leaving at a speed of light, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=398.56s)]
*  but potentially it is possible. And in fact, in recent years, the consensus has drifted towards [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=405.68s)]
*  the belief that in fact, for certain very special initial configurations of say water, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=413.68s)]
*  that singularities can form, but people have not yet been able to actually establish this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=421.36s)]
*  The Clay Foundation has these seven millennium prize problems, has a million dollar prize for [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=426.48s)]
*  solving one of these problems. This is one of them. Of these seven, only one of them has been [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  solved. The Poincare conjecture by Perlman. So the Kakeya conjecture is not directly, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=434.24s)]
*  directly related to the Navier-Stokes problem, but understanding it would help us understand [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=440.64s)]
*  some aspects of things like wave concentration, which would indirectly probably help us understand [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=447.04s)]
*  the Navier-Stokes problem better. Can you speak to the Navier-Stokes? So the existence and smoothness, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=451.36s)]
*  like you said, millennial prize problem. Right. You've made a lot of progress on this one. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=456.24s)]
*  In 2016, you published a paper, Finite Time Blowup for an Averaged Three-Dimensional Navier-Stokes [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=460.56s)]
*  Equation. Right. So we're trying to figure out if this thing usually doesn't blow up. Right. But [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=466.0s)]
*  can we say for sure it never blows up? Right. Yeah. So yeah, that is literally the million dollar [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  question. Yeah. So this is what distinguishes mathematicians from pretty much everybody else. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=479.04s)]
*  Like if, if something holds 9.99% of the time, that's good enough for most, you know, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=483.36s)]
*  for most things. But mathematicians are one of the few people who really care about whether [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=490.88s)]
*  every, like 100%, really 100% of all situations are covered by, by, yeah. So most fluid, most of the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=495.12s)]
*  time, water does not blow up, but could you design a very special initial state that does this? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=502.64s)]
*  And maybe we should say that this is a set of equations that govern in the field of fluid [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=509.2s)]
*  dynamics. Yes. Trying to understand how fluid behaves and it's actually turns out to be a really [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=514.24s)]
*  fluid is, yeah, extremely complicated thing to try to model. Yeah. So it has practical importance. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=519.28s)]
*  So this clay price problem concerns what's called the incompressible Navier-Stokes, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=524.4s)]
*  which governs things like water. There's something called the compressible Navier-Stokes, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=527.36s)]
*  which governs things like air. And that's particularly important for weather prediction. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=530.56s)]
*  Weather prediction, it does a lot of computational fluid dynamics. A lot of it is actually just trying [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=534.16s)]
*  to solve the Navier-Stokes equations as best they can. Also gathering a lot of data so that they can [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  get, they can initialize the equation. There's a lot of moving parts. So it's very important [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=544.08s)]
*  practically. Why is it difficult to prove general things about these set of equations like [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=548.8s)]
*  it not blowing up? Short answer is Maxwell's demon. So Maxwell's demon is a concept in [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=555.92s)]
*  thermodynamics. Like if you have a box with two gases in it, oxygen and nitrogen, and maybe you [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=561.6s)]
*  start with all the oxygen on one side and nitrogen on the other side, but there's no barrier between [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=566.24s)]
*  them. Then they will mix and they should stay mixed. There's no reason why they should unmix. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=569.36s)]
*  But in principle, because of all the collisions between them, there could be some sort of weird [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=575.68s)]
*  conspiracy that maybe there's a microscopic demon called Maxwell's demon that will, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=579.92s)]
*  every time oxygen and nitrogen atom collide, they will bounce off in such a way that the oxygen [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=584.8s)]
*  drifts onto one side and the nitrogen goes to the other. And you could have an extremely improbable [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=588.8s)]
*  configuration emerge, which we never see. And statistically, it's extremely unlikely. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  But mathematically, it's possible that this can happen and we can't rule it out. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=601.36s)]
*  And this is a situation that shows up a lot in mathematics. A basic example is the digits of pi, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=606.48s)]
*  3.14159 and so forth. The digits look like they have no pattern. And we believe they have no [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=612.72s)]
*  pattern. On the long term, you should see as many ones and twos and threes as fours and fives and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=617.6s)]
*  sixes. There should be no preference in the digits of pi to favor, let's say, seven over eight. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  But maybe there's some demon in the digits of pi that every time you compute more and more digits, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  it biases one digit to another. And this is a conspiracy that should not happen. There's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  no reason it should happen, but there's no way to prove it with our current technology. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=639.92s)]
*  Okay. So getting back to Navier-Stokes, a fluid has a certain amount of energy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  And because the fluid is in motion, the energy gets transported around. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=649.8399999999999s)]
*  And water is also viscous. So if the energy is spread out over many different locations, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=653.12s)]
*  the natural viscosity of the fluid will just damp out the energy and it will go to zero. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=658.88s)]
*  And this is what happens when we actually experiment with water. You splash around, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=663.76s)]
*  there's some turbulence and waves and so forth, but eventually it settles down. And the lower [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=670.4s)]
*  the amplitude, the smaller the velocity, the more calm it gets. But potentially there is some sort [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=675.36s)]
*  of demon that keeps pushing the energy of the fluid into a smaller and smaller scale. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=681.76s)]
*  And it will move faster and faster. And at faster speeds, the effective viscosity is relatively less. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=687.04s)]
*  And so it could happen that it creates some sort of, what's called a self-similar blow-up scenario [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=691.68s)]
*  where the energy of the fluid starts off at some large scale and then it all transfers [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=698.16s)]
*  energy into a smaller region of the fluid, which then at a much faster rate moves it into [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=705.52s)]
*  an even smaller region and so forth. And each time it does this, it takes maybe half as long [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  as the previous one. And then you could actually converge to all the energy concentrating in one [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  point in a finite amount of time. And that's a scenario called finite blow-up. So in practice, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=725.76s)]
*  this doesn't happen. So water is what's called turbulent. So it is true that if you have a big [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=734.48s)]
*  eddy of water, it will tend to break up into smaller eddies, but it won't transfer all the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=740.64s)]
*  energy from one big eddy into one smaller eddy. It will transfer into maybe three or four. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=745.36s)]
*  And then those ones split up into maybe three or four small eddies of their own. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=749.12s)]
*  And so the energy gets dispersed to the point where the viscosity can then keep everything [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=752.48s)]
*  under control. But if it can somehow concentrate all the energy, keep it all together, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=756.88s)]
*  and do it fast enough that the viscous effects don't have enough time to calm everything down, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=765.04s)]
*  then this blow-up can occur. So there are papers who had claimed that, oh, you just need to take [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=769.76s)]
*  into account conservation of energy and just carefully use the viscosity and you can keep [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=774.32s)]
*  everything under control for not just the Navier-Stokes, but for many, many types of equations [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=778.8s)]
*  like this. And so in the past, there have been many attempts to try to obtain what's called global [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=782.08s)]
*  regularity for Navier-Stokes, which is the opposite of final time blow-up, that velocity stays smooth. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=786.24s)]
*  And it all failed. There was always some sign error or some subtle mistake and it couldn't be salvaged. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=791.6s)]
*  So what I was interested in doing was trying to explain why we were not able to disprove [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=797.84s)]
*  final time blow-up. I couldn't do it for the actual equations of fluids, which were too [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=804.64s)]
*  complicated. But if I could average the equations of motion of Navier-Stokes, basically, if I could [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=808.0s)]
*  turn off certain types of ways in which water interacts and only keep the ones that I want. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=814.0s)]
*  So in particular, if there's a fluid and it could transfer its energy from a large eddy into this [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=820.24s)]
*  small eddy or this other small eddy, I would turn off the energy channel that would transfer energy [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=826.64s)]
*  to this one and direct it only into this smaller eddy while still preserving the law of conservation [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=832.08s)]
*  of energy. So you're trying to make a blow-up. Yeah. Yeah. So I basically engineer a blow-up [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=838.24s)]
*  by changing the laws of physics, which is one thing that mathematicians are allowed to do. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=844.0s)]
*  We can change the equation. How does that help you get closer to the proof of something? Right. So [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=847.12s)]
*  it provides what's called an obstruction in mathematics. So what I did was that basically, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=851.36s)]
*  if I turned off the certain parts of the equation, which usually when you turn off certain interactions, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  make it less nonlinear, it makes it more regular and less likely to blow up. But I found that by [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  turning off a very well-designed set of interactions, I could force all the energy to blow up [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=867.92s)]
*  and find that time. So what that means is that if you wanted to prove global regularity for [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=875.12s)]
*  Navier-Stokes for the actual equation, you must use some feature of the true equation, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=881.12s)]
*  which my artificial equation does not satisfy. So it rules out certain approaches. So the thing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=888.56s)]
*  about math is it's not just about finding or taking a technique that is going to work and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=897.68s)]
*  applying it, but you need to not take the techniques that don't work. And for the problems [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=901.52s)]
*  that are really hard, often there are dozens of ways that you might think might apply to solve [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  the problem, but it's only after a lot of experience that you realize there's no way that these methods [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=912.88s)]
*  are going to work. So having these counter examples for nearby problems kind of rules out, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=917.28s)]
*  it saves you a lot of time because you're not wasting energy on things that you now know cannot [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=922.48s)]
*  possibly ever work. How deeply connected is it to that specific problem of fluid dynamics or is it [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  some more general intuition you build up about mathematics? Right, yeah. So the key phenomenon [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=935.2s)]
*  that my technique exploits is what's called supercriticality. So in partial differential [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=940.0s)]
*  equations, often these equations are like a tug of war between different forces. So in Navier-Stokes, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  there's the dissipation force coming from viscosity and it's very well understood. It's linear, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=950.88s)]
*  it calms things down. If viscosity was all there was, then nothing bad would ever happen. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=956.16s)]
*  But there's also transport, that energy in one location of space can get transported because [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=962.16s)]
*  the fluid is in motion to other locations. And that's a nonlinear effect and that causes all [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=967.5999999999999s)]
*  the problems. So there are these two competing terms in the Navier-Stokes equation, the dissipation [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=973.68s)]
*  term and the transport term. If the dissipation term dominates, if it's large, then basically you [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=978.88s)]
*  get regularity. And if the transport term dominates, then we don't know what's going on. It's a very [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=983.84s)]
*  nonlinear situation. It's unpredictable. It's turbulent. So sometimes these forces are in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=990.08s)]
*  balance at small scales, but not in balance at large scales or vice versa. So Navier-Stokes is [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=994.24s)]
*  what's called supercritical. So at smaller and smaller scales, the transport terms are much [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1000.24s)]
*  stronger than the viscosity terms. So the viscosity terms are things that calm things down. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1004.88s)]
*  And so this is why the problem is hard. In two dimensions, so the Soviet mathematician, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1010.32s)]
*  Ladyshinskaya, she in the 60s shows in two dimensions, there was no blow up. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1016.8s)]
*  And in two dimensions, the Navier-Stokes equation is what's called critical. The effect of transport [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1021.28s)]
*  and the effect of viscosity are about the same strength, even at very, very small scales. And [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1025.2s)]
*  we have a lot of technology to handle critical and also subcritical equations and improve [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1029.68s)]
*  regularity. But for supercritical equations, it was not clear what was going on. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1033.68s)]
*  And I did a lot of work and then there's been a lot of follow up showing that for many other [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1038.8s)]
*  types of supercritical equations, you can create all kinds of blow up examples. Once the nonlinear [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1043.28s)]
*  effects dominate the linear effects at small scales, you can have all kinds of bad things happen. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1047.8400000000001s)]
*  So this is sort of one of the main insights of this line of work is that supercriticality [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1052.48s)]
*  versus criticality and subcriticality. This makes a big difference. I mean, that's a key qualitative [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1057.52s)]
*  feature that distinguishes some equations for being sort of nice and predictable and, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1063.28s)]
*  like planetary motion. I mean, there's certain equations that you can predict for millions of [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1066.96s)]
*  years and or thousands at least. Again, it's not really a problem, but there's a reason why we [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1071.6s)]
*  can't predict the weather past two weeks into the future because it's a supercritical equation. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1076.72s)]
*  Lots of really strange things are going on at very fine scales. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1081.76s)]
*  So whenever there's some huge source of nonlinearity, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1084.72s)]
*  that can create a huge problem for predicting what's going to happen. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1089.68s)]
*  Yeah. And if nonlinearity is somehow more and more featured and interesting at small scales. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1093.2s)]
*  I mean, there's many equations that are nonlinear, but in many equations, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1098.88s)]
*  you can approximate things by the bulk. So for example, planetary motion, you know, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1102.64s)]
*  if you want to understand the orbit of the moon or Mars or something, you don't really need the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1106.88s)]
*  microstructure of like the seismology of the moon or like exactly how the mass distributed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1111.28s)]
*  You just basically, you can almost approximate these patterns by point masses. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1117.28s)]
*  And just the aggregate behavior is important. But if you want to model a fluid like the weather, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  you can't just say in Los Angeles, the temperature is this, the wind speed is this. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1127.76s)]
*  For supercritical equations, the fine scale information is really important. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1131.36s)]
*  If we can just linger on the Navier-Stokes equations a little bit. So you've suggested, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1134.56s)]
*  maybe you can describe it, that one of the ways to solve it or to negatively resolve it would be to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1139.84s)]
*  construct a liquid, a kind of liquid computer. And then show that the halting problem from [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1150.16s)]
*  computation theory has consequences for fluid dynamics. So show it in that way. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1155.28s)]
*  Can you describe this? Yeah. So this came out of this work of constructing this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1161.04s)]
*  average equation that blew up. So as part of how I had to do this, so there's this naive way to do [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  it. You just keep pushing. Every time you get energy at one scale, you push it immediately to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  the next scale as fast as possible. This is the naive way to force blow up. It turns out in five [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1180.0s)]
*  and higher dimensions, this works. But in three dimensions, there was this funny phenomenon that [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1186.24s)]
*  I discovered that if you change the laws of physics, you just always keep trying to push [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1190.32s)]
*  the energy into smaller and smaller scales. What happens is that the energy starts getting [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1198.48s)]
*  spread out into many scales at once. So you have energy at one scale, you're pushing it into the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1202.56s)]
*  next scale. And then as soon as it enters that scale, you also push it to the next scale, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1208.72s)]
*  but there's still some energy left over from the previous scale. You're trying to do everything at [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1213.2s)]
*  once. And this spreads out the energy too much. And then it turns out that it makes it vulnerable [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1217.04s)]
*  for viscosity to come in and actually just damp out everything. So it turns out this directed [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1223.6s)]
*  motion doesn't actually work. There was a separate paper by some of the authors that actually showed [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1229.84s)]
*  this in three dimensions. So what I needed was to program a delay. So kind of like airlocks. So I [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1233.04s)]
*  needed an equation which would start with a fluid doing something at one scale. It would push this [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1242.32s)]
*  energy into the next scale, but it would stay there until all the energy from the largest scale [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1248.0s)]
*  got transferred. And only after you pushed all the energy in, then you sort of open the next gate. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1253.84s)]
*  And then you push that in as well. So by doing that, the energy inches forward scale by scale [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1259.36s)]
*  in such a way that it's always localized at one scale at a time. And then it can resist the effects [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1265.04s)]
*  of viscosity because it's not dispersed. So in order to make that happen, I had to construct [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1270.0s)]
*  a rather complicated non-linearity. And it was basically like, it was constructed like an [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1277.36s)]
*  electronic circuit. So I actually thanked my wife for this because she was trained as an electrical [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1284.24s)]
*  engineer. And she talked about, she had to design circuits and so forth. And if you want a circuit [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1288.24s)]
*  that does a certain thing, like maybe have a light that flashes on and then turns off and then on [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1296.32s)]
*  and then off, you can build it from more primitive components, capacitors and resistors and so forth. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1300.72s)]
*  And you have to build a diagram. And these diagrams, you can sort of follow up your eyeballs [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1305.76s)]
*  and say, oh yeah, the current will build up here and then it will stop and then it will do that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1311.76s)]
*  So I knew how to build the analog of basic electronic components, like resistors and capacitors [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1316.24s)]
*  and so forth. And I would stack them together in such a way that I would create something that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1320.8s)]
*  would open one gate and then there'll be a clock. And then once the clock hits a certain threshold, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1325.92s)]
*  it would close it. It's kind of a Rube Goldberg type machine, but described mathematically. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1330.0s)]
*  And this ended up working. So what I realized is that if you could pull the same thing off for the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1334.3200000000002s)]
*  actual equations. So if the equations of water support a computation. So like you can imagine [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1339.2s)]
*  kind of a steampunk, but it's really water punk type of thing where, so modern computers are [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1345.92s)]
*  electronic, they're powered by electrons passing through very tiny wires and interacting with [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1351.52s)]
*  other electrons and so forth. But instead of electrons, you can imagine these pulses [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1358.0s)]
*  of water moving at a certain velocity. And maybe there are two different configurations [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1362.72s)]
*  corresponding to a bit being up or down. Probably if you had two of these moving bodies of water [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1367.68s)]
*  collide, they would come out with some new configuration, which would be something like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1372.96s)]
*  an AND gate or OR gate. The output would depend in a very predictable way on the inputs. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1378.16s)]
*  And you could chain these together and maybe create a Turing machine. And then you have computers, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1384.64s)]
*  which are made completely out of water. And if you have computers, then maybe you can do robotics, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1390.72s)]
*  hydraulics and so forth. And so you could create some machine, which is basically a fluid analog [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1396.88s)]
*  of a Von Neumann machine. So Von Neumann proposed if you want to colonize Mars, the sheer cost of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1404.96s)]
*  transporting people and machines to Mars is just ridiculous. But if you could transport one machine [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1410.24s)]
*  to Mars and this machine had the ability to mine the planet, create some more materials, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  smelt them and build more copies of the same machine, then you could colonize the whole planet [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1419.68s)]
*  over time. So if you could build a fluid machine, it's a fluid robot. And what it would do, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1427.3600000000001s)]
*  its purpose in life, it's programmed so that it would create a smaller version of itself in some [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1438.24s)]
*  sort of cold state. It wouldn't start just yet. Once it's ready, the big robot, the configuration [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1442.96s)]
*  of water, would transfer all its energy into the smaller configuration and then power down. And then [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1447.44s)]
*  it would clean itself up. And then what's left is this newest state, which would then turn on [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1452.16s)]
*  and do the same thing, but smaller and faster. And then the equation has a certain scaling [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  symmetry. Once you do that, it can just keep iterating. So this in principle would create a [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1460.88s)]
*  blow up for the actual Navier-Stokes. And this is what I managed to accomplish for this average [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  Navier-Stokes. So it provided this sort of roadmap to solve the problem. Now this is [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1469.44s)]
*  a pipe dream because there are so many things that are missing for this to actually be a reality. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1475.8400000000001s)]
*  So I can't create these basic logic gates. I don't have these special configurations of water. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's candidates that include vortex rings that might possibly work. But also, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1488.96s)]
*  I don't know, computing is really nasty compared to digital computing. I mean, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1496.16s)]
*  because there's always errors. You have to do a lot of error correction along the way. I don't [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1500.0800000000002s)]
*  know how to completely power down the big machine so that it doesn't interfere with the running of [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1505.6000000000001s)]
*  the swirling machine. But everything in principle can happen. It doesn't contradict any of the laws [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1509.28s)]
*  of physics. So it's sort of evidence that this thing is possible. There are other groups who are [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1514.24s)]
*  now pursuing ways to make Navier-Stokes blow up, which are nowhere near as ridiculously complicated [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1521.52s)]
*  as this. They actually are pursuing much closer to the direct self-similar model, which can… [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1526.48s)]
*  It doesn't quite work as is, but there could be some simpler scheme than what I just described [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1534.72s)]
*  to make this work. There is a real leap of genius here to go from Navier-Stokes to this [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1539.44s)]
*  towing machine. So it goes from what? The self-similar blob scenario that you're trying [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1545.76s)]
*  to get the smaller and smaller blob to now having a liquid towing machine gets smaller, smaller, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1551.2s)]
*  smaller, and somehow seeing how that could be used to say something about a blow up. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1558.32s)]
*  I mean, that's a big leap. So there's precedent. I mean, so the thing about mathematics is that [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1566.96s)]
*  it's really good at spotting connections between what you might think of as completely different [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1572.72s)]
*  problems. But if the mathematical form is the same, you can draw a connection. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1578.96s)]
*  So there's a lot of previously on what are called cellular automator, the most famous of which is [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1584.8000000000002s)]
*  Conway's Game of Life. This is infinite discrete grid, and at any given time, the grid is either [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1590.64s)]
*  occupied by a cell or it's empty. And there's a very simple rule that tells you how these cells [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1594.96s)]
*  evolve. So sometimes cells live and sometimes they die. And when I was a student, it was a very [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1599.92s)]
*  popular screensaver to actually just have these animations go on. And they look very chaotic. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1606.72s)]
*  In fact, they look a little bit like turbulent flow sometimes. But at some point, people discovered [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1612.08s)]
*  more and more interesting structures within this Game of Life. So for example, they discovered [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1616.0s)]
*  this thing called a glider. So a glider is a very tiny configuration of like four or five cells, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1619.68s)]
*  which evolves and it just moves in a certain direction. And that's like this vortex rings. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1623.84s)]
*  Yeah, so this is an analogy. The Game of Life is kind of like a discrete equation. And the fluid [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1629.52s)]
*  navier-stokes is a continuous equation. But mathematically, they have some similar features. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1635.76s)]
*  So over time, people discovered more and more interesting things that you could build within [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1642.56s)]
*  the Game of Life. The Game of Life is a very simple system. It only has like three or four rules [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1647.04s)]
*  to do it. But you can design all kinds of interesting configurations inside it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1650.72s)]
*  There's something called a glider gun that does nothing to spit out gliders one at a time. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1654.96s)]
*  And then after a lot of effort, people managed to create handgates and oar gates for gliders. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1660.64s)]
*  There's this massive, ridiculous structure, which if you have a stream of gliders coming in here and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1668.56s)]
*  a stream of gliders coming in here, then you may produce a stream of gliders coming out. If both of [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1674.72s)]
*  the streams have gliders, then there will be an output stream. But if only one of them does, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1680.72s)]
*  then nothing comes out. So they could build something like that. And once you could build [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1686.56s)]
*  these basic gates, then just from software engineering, you can build almost anything. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1692.48s)]
*  You can build a Turing machine. I mean, it's enormous steampunk type things. They look [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1699.28s)]
*  ridiculous. But then people also generated self-replicating objects in the Game of Life. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1703.68s)]
*  A massive machine, a bonhomor machine, which over a huge period of time, and there were always [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1708.96s)]
*  little glider guns inside doing these very steampunk calculations, it would create another version of [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1713.52s)]
*  itself which could replicate. It's so incredible. A lot of this was like community crowdsourced by [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1718.48s)]
*  like amateur mathematicians, actually. So I knew about that work. And so that is part of what [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1724.08s)]
*  inspired me to propose the same thing with Navier-Stokes. As I said, analog is much worse [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1730.56s)]
*  than digital. You can't just directly take the constructions from the Game of Life and [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1736.96s)]
*  plunk them in. But again, it shows it's possible. There's a kind of emergence that happens with these [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1742.96s)]
*  cellular automata. Local rules, maybe it's similar to fluids, I don't know. But local rules [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1749.92s)]
*  operating at scale can create these incredibly complex dynamic structures. Do you think [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1758.48s)]
*  any of that is amenable to mathematical analysis? Do we have the tools to say something profound [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1766.16s)]
*  about that? The thing is, you can get this emergent, very complicated structures, but only with [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1772.72s)]
*  very carefully prepared initial conditions. So these glider guns and gates and software machines, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1777.2s)]
*  if you just plunk them randomly, some cells, and you're on the Game of Life, you will not see any of these. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1784.08s)]
*  And that's the analogous situation with Navier-Stokes again, that with typical initial [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1789.68s)]
*  conditions, you will not have any of this weird computation going on. But basically through [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1794.64s)]
*  engineering, by specially designing things in a very special way, you can make clever constructions. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1800.4s)]
*  I wonder if it's possible to prove the negative of like, basically prove that only through [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1807.44s)]
*  engineering can you ever create something interesting. This is a recurring challenge [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1812.96s)]
*  in mathematics that I call the dichotomy between structure and randomness. That most [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1817.92s)]
*  objects that you can generate in mathematics are random. They look like the digital supply. Well, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  we believe is a good example. But there's a very small number of things that have patterns. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1827.84s)]
*  But now you can prove something as a pattern by just constructing it. If something has a simple [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1833.36s)]
*  pattern and you have a proof that it does something like repeat itself every so often, you can do that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  And you can prove that most sequences of digits have no pattern. So if you just pick [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1844.32s)]
*  digits randomly, there's something called low-large numbers that tells you you're going to get as many [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1850.6399999999999s)]
*  ones as twos in the long run. But we have a lot fewer tools to, if I give you a specific pattern [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1854.08s)]
*  like the digital supply, how can I show that this doesn't have some weird pattern to it? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1862.56s)]
*  Some other work that I spend a lot of time on is to prove what are called structure theorems or [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1867.6s)]
*  inverse theorems that give tests for when something is very structured. So some functions are, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1871.1999999999998s)]
*  let's go additive. Like if you have a function of natural numbers, they're natural numbers. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1877.52s)]
*  So maybe two maps to four, three maps to six, and so forth. Some functions are also called [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1880.72s)]
*  additive, which means that if you add two inputs together, the output gets added as well. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1886.4s)]
*  For example, multiply by a constant. If you multiply a number by 10, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1891.52s)]
*  if you multiply a plus b by 10, that's the same as multiplying a by 10 and b by 10 and then add them [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1895.3600000000001s)]
*  together. So some functions are additive. Some functions are kind of additive, but not completely [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1900.24s)]
*  additive. So for example, if I take a number n, I multiply by the square root of two and I take the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1906.4s)]
*  integer part of that. So 10 by square root of two is like 14 point something. So 10 up to 14, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1913.0400000000002s)]
*  20 up to 28. So in that case, additivity is true then. So 10 plus 10 is 20 and 14 plus 14 is 28. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1918.96s)]
*  But because of this rounding, sometimes there's round off errors. And sometimes when you [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1926.48s)]
*  add a plus b, this function doesn't quite give you the sum of the two individual outputs, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1931.2s)]
*  but the sum plus or minus one. So it's almost additive, but not quite additive. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1935.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of useful results in mathematics and I've worked a lot developing things like this [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1941.28s)]
*  to the effect that if a function exhibits some structure like this, then there's a reason for [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1945.92s)]
*  why it's true. And the reason is because there's some other nearby function, which is actually [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1953.04s)]
*  completely structured, which is explaining this sort of partial pattern that you have. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1958.24s)]
*  And so if you have these little inverse theorems, it creates this sort of dichotomy that either [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1962.72s)]
*  the objects that you study either have no structure at all or they are somehow related to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1968.56s)]
*  something that is structured. And in either case, you can make progress. A good example of this is [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  that there's this old theorem in mathematics called Szemeredi's theorem proven in the 1970s. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1981.36s)]
*  It concerns trying to find a certain type of pattern in a set of numbers, the patterns of [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1986.1599999999999s)]
*  arithmetic progression, things like three, five and seven or 10, 15 and 20. And Szemeredi proved [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1990.4s)]
*  that any set of numbers that are sufficiently big, let's call it positive density, has arithmetic [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=1997.6s)]
*  progressions in it of any length you wish. So for example, the odd numbers have a set of density [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2004.96s)]
*  one half and they contain arithmetic progressions of any length. So in that case, it's obvious [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2010.56s)]
*  because the odd numbers are really, really structured. I can just take 11, 13, 15, 17. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2015.52s)]
*  I can easily find arithmetic progressions in that set. But Szemeredi's theorem also applies [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2021.12s)]
*  to random sets. If I take the set of all numbers and I flip a coin for each number and I only keep [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2028.0s)]
*  the numbers for which I got a heads, because I just flip coins, I just randomly take out half [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2035.04s)]
*  the numbers I keep one half. So that's a set that has no patterns at all. But just from random [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2039.92s)]
*  fluctuations, you will still get a lot of arithmetic progressions in that set. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2045.28s)]
*  Can you prove that there's arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length within a random? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2050.8s)]
*  Yes. Have you heard of the infinite monkey theorem? Usually mathematicians give boring names [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2057.84s)]
*  to theorists, but occasionally they give colorful names. The popular version of the infinite monkey [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2062.16s)]
*  theorem is that if you have an infinite number of monkeys in a room with each typewriter, they type [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2066.08s)]
*  out text randomly. Almost surely one of them is going to generate the entire square of Hamlet [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2071.12s)]
*  or any other finite string of text. It will just take some time, quite a lot of time actually. But [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2076.16s)]
*  if you have an infinite number, then it happens. So basically the theorem says that if you take an [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2081.12s)]
*  infinite string of digits or whatever, eventually any finite pattern you wish will emerge. It may [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  take a long time, but it will eventually happen. In particular, I think progressions of any length [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2094.48s)]
*  will eventually happen, but you need an extremely long random sequence for this to happen. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2099.36s)]
*  I suppose that's intuitive. It's just infinity. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2104.48s)]
*  Yeah. Infinity absorbs a lot of sins. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  How are we humans supposed to deal with infinity? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2111.6s)]
*  Well, you can think of infinity as an abstraction of a finite number for which you do not have a [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2114.96s)]
*  bound for. Nothing in real life is truly infinite, but you can ask yourself questions like, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2120.96s)]
*  what if I had as much money as I wanted? Or what if I could go as fast as I wanted? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2132.0s)]
*  A way in which mathematicians formalize that is mathematics has found a formalism to idealize [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2136.48s)]
*  instead of something being extremely large or extremely small to actually be exactly infinite [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2141.84s)]
*  or zero. Often the mathematics becomes a lot cleaner when you do that. In physics, we joke [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2145.36s)]
*  about assuming spherical cows. Real world problems have got all kinds of real world effects, but you [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  can idealize, send something to infinity, send something to zero. The mathematics becomes a lot [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2158.56s)]
*  simpler to work with that. I wonder how often using infinity forces us to deviate from [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2165.1200000000003s)]
*  the physics of reality. Yeah. There's a lot of pitfalls. We spend a lot of time in undergraduate [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2175.36s)]
*  math classes teaching analysis. It's often about how to take limits. For example, A plus B is [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2181.76s)]
*  always B plus A. When you have a finite number of terms and you add them, you can swap them and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2189.92s)]
*  there's no problem. But when you have an infinite number of terms, there are these sort of show [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2194.32s)]
*  games you can play where you can have a series which converges to one value, but you rearrange it [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2198.0s)]
*  and it suddenly converges to another value. You can make mistakes. You have to know what you're [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2202.56s)]
*  doing when you allow infinity. You have to introduce these epsilons and deltas and there's [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2207.04s)]
*  a certain type of way of reasoning that helps you avoid mistakes. In more recent years, people have [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2212.64s)]
*  started taking results that are true in infinite limits and what's called finalizing them. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2220.96s)]
*  You know that something's true eventually, but you don't know when. Now give me a rate. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2227.44s)]
*  If I don't have an infinite number of monkeys but a large finite number of monkeys, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  how long do I have to wait for Hamlet to come out? That's a more quantitative question. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2237.2000000000003s)]
*  This is something that you can attack by purely finite methods. You can use your finite intuition. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2243.36s)]
*  In this case, it turns out to be exponential in the length of the text that you're trying to [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  generate. This is why you never see the monkeys create Hamlet. You can maybe see them create a [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2253.92s)]
*  four-letter word, but nothing that big. I personally find once you finite an infinite [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2260.08s)]
*  statement, it does become much more intuitive and it's no longer so weird. Even if you're [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2265.7599999999998s)]
*  working with infinity, it's good to finite so that you can have some intuition. The downside is that [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  the finite types are just much messier. The infinite ones are found first usually, decades [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2278.48s)]
*  earlier and then later on people finite them. Since we mentioned a lot of math and a lot of [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2285.04s)]
*  physics, what is the difference between mathematics and physics as disciplines, as ways of [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2289.76s)]
*  understanding, of seeing the world? Maybe we can throw an engineering in there. You mentioned your [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2295.44s)]
*  wife is an engineer. Give it new perspective on circuits. This different way of looking at the [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2299.92s)]
*  world, given that you've done mathematical physics, you've worn all the hats. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2304.8s)]
*  I think science in general is interaction between three things. There's the real world. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2310.88s)]
*  There's what we observe of the real world, our observations, and then our mental models as to [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2315.76s)]
*  how we think the world works. We can't directly access reality. All we have are the observations [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2321.36s)]
*  which are incomplete and they have errors. There are many, many cases where we want to know, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2329.68s)]
*  for example, what is the weather like tomorrow? We don't yet have the observation we'd like to [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2337.52s)]
*  predict. Then we have these simplified models, sometimes making unrealistic assumptions, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2342.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, spherical cow type things. Those are the mathematical models. Mathematics is concerned [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2347.28s)]
*  with the models. Science collects the observations and it proposes the models that might explain [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2352.2400000000002s)]
*  these observations. What mathematics does is we stay within the model and we ask what are the [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2358.8s)]
*  consequences of that model? What predictions would the model make of future observations? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2363.92s)]
*  Or past observations, does it fit observed data? There's definitely a symbiosis. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2371.44s)]
*  I guess mathematics is unusual among other disciplines. We start from hypotheses, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2379.76s)]
*  like the axioms of a model, and ask what conclusions come up from that model. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2385.0400000000004s)]
*  In almost any other discipline, you start with the conclusions. I want to do this. I want to [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2390.48s)]
*  build a bridge. I want to make money. I want to do this. Okay, and then you find the path to get [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2395.12s)]
*  there. There's a lot less speculation about it. Suppose I did this, what would happen? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2401.68s)]
*  Planning and modeling. Speculative fiction maybe is one other place. That's about it, actually. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2409.12s)]
*  Most of the things we do in life is conclusions driven, including physics and science. I mean, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2417.12s)]
*  they want to know where is this asteroid going to go? What is the weather going to be tomorrow? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2420.8s)]
*  Mathematics also has this other direction of going from the axioms. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2427.52s)]
*  There is this tension in physics between theory and experiment. What do you think is the more [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  powerful way of discovering truly novel ideas about reality? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2438.32s)]
*  Well, you need both, top down and bottom up. It's a really interesting interaction between all these [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2442.0800000000004s)]
*  things. Over time, the observations and the theory and the modeling should both get closer [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2446.8s)]
*  to reality. Initially, and this is always the case, they're always far apart to begin with, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2453.04s)]
*  but you need one to figure out where to push the other. If your model is predicting anomalies [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2461.04s)]
*  that are not particular by experiment, that tells experimenters where to look to find more data, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2467.92s)]
*  to refine the models. It goes back and forth. Within mathematics itself, there's also a theory [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2474.72s)]
*  and experimental component. It's just that until very recently, theory has dominated almost [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2483.2s)]
*  completely. 99% of mathematics is theoretical mathematics. There's a very tiny amount of [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2488.72s)]
*  experimental mathematics. People do it. If they want to study prime numbers or whatever, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2493.2s)]
*  they can just generate large data sets. Once we had the computers, we had to do it a little bit. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2499.36s)]
*  Although even before, like Gauss, for example, he discovered reconjection, the most basic [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2505.92s)]
*  theorem in number theory, called the prime number theorem, which predicts how many primes, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2511.28s)]
*  up to a million, up to a trillion. It's not an obvious question. Basically, what he did was that [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2515.04s)]
*  he computed, mostly by himself, but also hired human computers, people whose professional job it [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2519.36s)]
*  was to do arithmetic, to compute the first 100,000 primes or something, and made tables, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2527.68s)]
*  and made a prediction. That was an early example of experimental mathematics. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2533.3599999999997s)]
*  Theoretical mathematics was just much more successful because doing complicated mathematical [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2542.56s)]
*  computations was just not feasible until very recently. Even nowadays, even though we have [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2546.72s)]
*  powerful computers, only some mathematical things can be explored numerically. There's [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2553.2s)]
*  something called the combinatorial explosion. If you want us to study, for example, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  Zermatt's theorem, you want to study all possible subsets of numbers one to a thousand. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2560.7999999999997s)]
*  There's only 1,000 numbers. How bad could it be? It turns out the number of different subsets of [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2564.72s)]
*  one to a thousand is two to the power of 1,000, which is way bigger than any computer can currently [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2568.48s)]
*  can enumerate. There are certain math problems that very quickly become just intractable to [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2574.4s)]
*  attack by direct brute force computation. Chess is another famous example. The number of chess [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2585.2000000000003s)]
*  positions we can't get a computer to fully explore. But now we have AI. We have tools to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2591.28s)]
*  explore this space not with 100% guarantees of success, but with experiment. We can empirically [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2599.6s)]
*  solve chess now. For example, we have very, very good AIs that don't explore every single position [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2607.8399999999997s)]
*  in the game tree, but they have found some very good approximation. People are using these chess [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2615.12s)]
*  engines to do experimental chess. They're revisiting old chess theories about this type [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2620.16s)]
*  of opening. This is a good type of move. This is not. They can use these chess engines to actually [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2627.44s)]
*  refine, in some cases overturn, conventional wisdom about chess. I do hope that mathematics [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2632.32s)]
*  have a larger experimental component in the future, perhaps powered by AI. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2641.12s)]
*  We'll of course talk about that. But in the case of chess, and there's a similar thing in mathematics, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2645.28s)]
*  I don't believe it's providing a kind of formal explanation of the different positions. It's just [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2650.4s)]
*  saying which position is better or not, that you can intuit as a human being. And then from that, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2658.16s)]
*  we humans can construct a theory of the matter. You've mentioned the Plato's cave allegory. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2662.56s)]
*  So in case people don't know, it's where people are observing shadows of reality, not reality itself. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2670.64s)]
*  And they believe what they're observing to be reality. Is that in some sense what mathematicians [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2678.7200000000003s)]
*  and maybe all humans are doing is looking at shadows of reality? Is it possible for us to truly [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2683.92s)]
*  access reality? Well, there are these three ontological things. There's actual reality, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2692.88s)]
*  there's observations, and models. And technically, they are distinct. And I think they will always be [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2699.44s)]
*  distinct. But they can get closer over time. And the process of getting closer often means that [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2707.04s)]
*  you have to discard your initial intuitions. So astronomy provides great examples. An initial [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2718.8s)]
*  model of the world is flat because it looks flat and is big. And the rest of the universe, the skies, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2727.68s)]
*  like the sun, for example, looks really tiny. And so you start off with a model which is actually [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2735.76s)]
*  really far from reality. But it fits the observations that you have. But over time, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2740.32s)]
*  as you make more and more observations, bringing it closer to reality, the model gets dragged along [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2747.36s)]
*  with it. And so over time, we had to realize that the Earth was round, that it spins, it goes around [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2752.16s)]
*  the solar system, the solar system goes around the galaxy, and so on and so forth. And the guys [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2756.7200000000003s)]
*  about the universe, the universe is expanding. The expansion is self-expanding, accelerating. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2760.72s)]
*  And in fact, very recently, this year or so, even the acceleration of the universe itself is [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2765.7599999999998s)]
*  this evidence that is non-constant. And the explanation behind why that is? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2770.7999999999997s)]
*  It's catching up. It's catching up. I mean, it's still the dark matter, dark energy, this kind of [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2776.08s)]
*  thing. Yes. We have a model that sort of explains, that fits the data really well. It just has a few [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2781.6s)]
*  parameters that you have to specify. So people say, oh, that's fudge factors. With enough fudge [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2786.08s)]
*  factors, you can explain anything. But the mathematical point of the model is that you want [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2793.2s)]
*  to have fewer parameters in your model than data points in your observational set. So if you have [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2799.6s)]
*  a model with 10 parameters that explains 10 observations, that is a completely useless model. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2803.92s)]
*  It's what's called overfitted. But if you have a model with two parameters and it explains [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2808.56s)]
*  a trillion observations, which is basically... So yeah, the dark matter model, I think it has [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2814.08s)]
*  like 14 parameters and it explains petabytes of data that the astronomers have. You can think of [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2818.64s)]
*  a theory, like one way to think about physical mathematical theory, it's a compression of the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2826.88s)]
*  universe and a data compression. So you have these petabytes of observations, you'd like to compress [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2833.2s)]
*  it to a model which you can describe in five pages and specify a certain number of parameters. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2839.68s)]
*  And if it can fit to reasonable accuracy, almost all of your observations, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2844.64s)]
*  the more compression that you make, the better your theory. In fact, one of the great surprises [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2850.0s)]
*  of our universe and of everything in it is that it's compressible at all. It's the unreasonable [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2853.8399999999997s)]
*  effectiveness of mathematics. Yeah. Einstein had a quote like that, the most incompressible thing [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2859.2s)]
*  about the universe is that it is comprehensible. Right. And not just comprehensible, you can do [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2863.04s)]
*  an equation like E equals MC squared. There is actually some mathematical possible explanation [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2867.76s)]
*  for that. So there's this phenomenon in mathematics called universality. So many complex systems at [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2872.4s)]
*  the macro scale are coming out of lots of tiny interactions at the macro scale. And normally [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2878.4s)]
*  because of the commercial explosion, you would think that the macro scale equations must be [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2883.2000000000003s)]
*  infinitely exponentially more complicated than the macro scale ones. And they are, if you want [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2888.0s)]
*  to solve them completely exactly. Like if you want to model all the atoms in a box of air, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2893.68s)]
*  Avogadro's number is humongous. There's a huge number of particles. If you actually have to track [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2901.44s)]
*  each one, it'll be ridiculous. But certain laws emerge at the microscopic scale that almost don't [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2905.3599999999997s)]
*  depend on what's going on at the macro scale, only depend on a very small number of parameters. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2911.2799999999997s)]
*  So if you want to model a gas of, you know, quintillion particles in a box, you just need [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2915.6s)]
*  to know temperature and pressure and volume and a few parameters like five or six. And it models [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2921.76s)]
*  almost everything you need to know about these 10 to 23 or whatever particles. So we have, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2926.88s)]
*  we don't understand universality anywhere near as we would like mathematically, but [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2937.0400000000004s)]
*  there are much simpler toy models where we do have a good understanding of why universality occurs. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2940.32s)]
*  Most basic one is the central limit theorem that explains why the bell curve shows up everywhere [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2946.8s)]
*  in nature, that so many things are distributed by what's called a Gaussian distribution, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2951.28s)]
*  famous bell curve. There's not even a meme with this curve. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2955.52s)]
*  And even the meme applies broadly. The universality to the meme. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, you can call meta if you like, but there are many, many processes. For example, you can take [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2963.0400000000004s)]
*  lots of independent random variables and average them together in various ways. You can take a [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2968.0s)]
*  simple average or more complicated average and we can prove in various cases that these bell curves, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2974.48s)]
*  these Gaussians emerge and it is a satisfying explanation. Sometimes they don't. So if you [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2979.36s)]
*  have many different inputs and they will correlate it in some systemic way, then you can get something [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2986.1600000000003s)]
*  very far from a bell curve show up. And this is also important to know when a system fails. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2990.4s)]
*  So universality is not a 100% reliable thing to rely on. The global financial crisis was a [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=2995.2000000000003s)]
*  famous example of this. People thought that mortgage defaults, that this sort of Gaussian [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3003.12s)]
*  type behavior that if you ask a population of 100,000 Americans with mortgages, ask what [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3010.4s)]
*  proportion of them were defaulting on mortgages. If everything was de-correlated, it would be an [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3018.48s)]
*  acid bell curve and you can manage risk of options and derivatives and so forth. And it is a very [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3022.72s)]
*  beautiful theory. But if there are systemic shocks in the economy that can push everybody to default [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3028.96s)]
*  at the same time, that's very non-Gaussian behavior. And this wasn't fully accounted for [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3035.76s)]
*  in 2008. Now I think there's some more awareness that systemic risk is actually a much bigger issue. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3041.84s)]
*  Just because the model is pretty and nice, it may not match reality. So the mathematics of working [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3049.76s)]
*  out what models do is really important. But also the science of validating when the models [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3056.96s)]
*  fit reality and when they don't. I mean, you need both. But mathematics can help because it can, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3064.8s)]
*  for example, the central limit theorem, it tells you that if you have certain axioms like [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3072.16s)]
*  non-correlation, that if all the inputs were not correlated to each other, then you have this [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3076.0s)]
*  Gaussian behavior and things are fine. It tells you where to look for weaknesses in the model. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3080.56s)]
*  So if you have a mathematical understanding of central limiter and someone proposes to use [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3085.36s)]
*  these Gaussian copy loads or whatever to model default risk, if you're mathematically trained, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3090.6400000000003s)]
*  you would say, okay, but what are the systemic correlation between all your inputs? And so [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3097.84s)]
*  then you can ask the economist, how much of a risk is that? And then you can go look for that. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  So there's always this synergy between science and mathematics. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3108.1600000000003s)]
*  A little bit on the topic of universality. You're known and celebrated for working across an [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3112.64s)]
*  incredible breadth of mathematics, reminiscent of Hilbert a century ago. In fact, the great [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3119.52s)]
*  Fields Medal winning mathematician Tim Gowers has said that you are the closest thing we get to [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3125.52s)]
*  Hilbert. He's a colleague of yours. But anyway, so you are known for this ability to go both deep [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3131.52s)]
*  and broad in mathematics. So you're the perfect person to ask, do you think there are threads [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3140.48s)]
*  that connect all the disparate areas of mathematics? Is there a kind of deep underlying structure [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3146.48s)]
*  to all of mathematics? There's certainly a lot of connecting threads. And a lot of the progress of [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3154.56s)]
*  mathematics can be represented by taking by stories of two fields of mathematics that were [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3160.96s)]
*  previously not connected and finding connections. An ancient example is geometry and number theory. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3167.44s)]
*  In the times of the ancient Greeks, these were considered different subjects. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3174.96s)]
*  Mathematicians worked on both. You could work both on geometry most famously, but also on numbers. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3178.96s)]
*  But they were not really considered related. A little bit. You could say that this length was [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3186.0s)]
*  five times this length because you could take five copies of this length and so forth. But it wasn't [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3192.96s)]
*  until Descartes who really realized that he developed analytical geometry that you can [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3196.72s)]
*  parameterize the plane, the geometric object, by two real numbers. And so geometric problems [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3202.64s)]
*  can be turned into problems about numbers. And today this feels almost trivial. There's no content [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3209.4399999999996s)]
*  to list. Of course, a plane is x, x and y because that's what we teach and it's internalized. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  But it was an important development that these two fields were unified. And this process has [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3226.72s)]
*  just gone on throughout mathematics over and over again. Algebra and geometry were separated, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3234.0s)]
*  and now we have this fluid algebraic geometry that connects them over and over again. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3238.0s)]
*  That's certainly the type of mathematics that I enjoy the most. I think there are different styles [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3242.24s)]
*  to being a mathematician. I think hedgehogs and foxes. A fox knows many things a little bit, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3247.52s)]
*  but a hedgehog knows one thing very, very well. And in mathematics, there's definitely both [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3251.76s)]
*  hedgehogs and foxes. And then there's people who can play both roles. And I think ideal collaboration [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3256.32s)]
*  between mathematicians involves you need some diversity. A fox working with many hedgehogs or [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3264.48s)]
*  vice versa. But I identify mostly as a fox. I like arbitrage somehow, learning how one field [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3271.6s)]
*  works, learning the tricks of that wheel, and then going to another field which people don't think [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3282.64s)]
*  is related, but I can adapt the tricks. So see the connections between the fields. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3286.72s)]
*  Yeah. So there are other mathematicians who are far deeper than I am. They're really hedgehogs. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3292.24s)]
*  They know everything about one field and they're much faster and [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3298.32s)]
*  more effective in that field. But I can give them these extra tools. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3302.0s)]
*  I mean, you've said that you can be both a hedgehog and the fox depending on the context, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3305.2000000000003s)]
*  depending on the collaboration. So what can you, if it's at all possible, speak to the difference [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3309.92s)]
*  between those two ways of thinking about a problem? Say you're encountering a new problem, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3315.04s)]
*  searching for the connections versus very singular focus. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm much more comfortable with the fox paradigm. Yeah. So yeah, I like looking for analogies, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3326.64s)]
*  narratives. I spend a lot of time, if there's a result, I see it in one field and I like the [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3335.2799999999997s)]
*  result. It's a cool result, but I don't like the proof. It uses types of mathematics that I'm not [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3341.7599999999998s)]
*  super familiar with. I often try to re-prove it myself using the tools that I favor. Often my [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3346.88s)]
*  proof is worse, but by the exercise they're doing, I can say, oh, now I can see what the other proof [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3353.36s)]
*  was trying to do. And from that, I can get some understanding of the tools that are used in that [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3360.4s)]
*  field. So it's very exploratory, very doing crazy things in crazy fields and reinventing the wheel [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3367.2000000000003s)]
*  a lot. Whereas the hedgehog style is much more scholarly, very knowledge-based. You stay up to [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3373.1200000000003s)]
*  speed on all the developments in this field. You know all the history. You have a very good [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3381.36s)]
*  understanding of exactly the strengths and weaknesses of each particular technique. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3386.48s)]
*  I think you'd rely a lot more on calculation than trying to find narratives. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3393.28s)]
*  So yeah, I can do that too, but there are other people who are extremely good at that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3399.84s)]
*  Let's step back and maybe look at a bit of a romanticized version of mathematics. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3404.24s)]
*  I think you've said that early on in your life, math was more like a puzzle-solving activity when [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3414.72s)]
*  you were young. When did you first encounter a problem or proof where you realized math can [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3421.68s)]
*  have a kind of elegance and beauty to it? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3428.72s)]
*  That's a good question. When I came to graduate school in Princeton, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3434.08s)]
*  John Conway was there at the time. He passed away a few years ago. But I remember one of the very [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3439.36s)]
*  first research talks I went to was a talk by Conway on what he called extreme proof. So Conway had [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3443.2799999999997s)]
*  just had this amazing way of thinking about all kinds of things in a way that you wouldn't normally [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3449.12s)]
*  think of. So he thought of proofs themselves as occupying some sort of space. So if you want to [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3453.52s)]
*  prove something, let's say that there's infinitely many primes, you'll have different proofs. But you [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3460.0s)]
*  could rank them in different axes. Some proofs are elegant, some proofs are long, some proofs are [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3465.2s)]
*  elementary and so forth. So the space of all proofs itself has some sort of shape. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3469.84s)]
*  So he was interested in extreme points of this shape. Out of all these proofs, what is the [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3477.76s)]
*  shortest at the expense of everything else or the most elementary or whatever? And so he gave some [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3483.52s)]
*  examples of well-known theorems and then he would give what he thought was the extreme proof [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3490.96s)]
*  in these different aspects. I just found that really eye-opening. It's not just getting a proof [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3495.6s)]
*  for a result was interesting, but once you have that proof, trying to optimize it in various ways. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3505.04s)]
*  That proofing itself had some craftsmanship to it. It's something for my writing style. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3513.52s)]
*  When you do your math assignments as an undergraduate, your homework and so forth, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3523.84s)]
*  you're sort of encouraged to just write down any proof that works. Okay. And as long as it gets a [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3527.6s)]
*  tick mark, you move on. But if you want your results to actually be influential and be read [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3532.7200000000003s)]
*  by people, it can't just be correct. It should also be a pleasure to read, motivated, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3539.28s)]
*  be adaptable to generalize to other things. It's the same in many other disciplines like coding. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3546.96s)]
*  There's a lot of analogies between math and coding. I like analogies if you haven't noticed. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3553.36s)]
*  You can code something spaghettical that works for a certain task and it's quick and dirty and it [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3559.44s)]
*  works. But there's lots of good principles for writing code well so that other people can use [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3564.16s)]
*  it, build upon it, and so on. It has fewer bugs and whatever. There's similar things with mathematics. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3570.08s)]
*  First of all, there's so many beautiful things there. And Calhoun is one of the great minds [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3579.6s)]
*  in mathematics ever and computer science. Just even considering the space of proofs and saying, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3584.3199999999997s)]
*  okay, what does this space look like and what are the extremes? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3591.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you mentioned, coding is an analogy. It's interesting because there's also this activity [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3596.32s)]
*  called the code golf, which I also find beautiful and fun where people use different programming [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3600.72s)]
*  languages to try to write the shortest possible program that accomplishes a particular task. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3607.68s)]
*  Then I believe there's even competitions on this. It's also a nice way to stress test [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3612.32s)]
*  not just the programs or in this case the proofs, but also the different languages. Maybe that's a [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3619.36s)]
*  different notation or whatever to use to accomplish a different task. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3627.52s)]
*  Yeah, you learn a lot. I mean, it may seem like a frivolous exercise, but it can generate all these [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3631.44s)]
*  insights, which if you didn't have this artificial objective to pursue, you might not see. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you use the most beautiful or elegant equation in mathematics? I mean, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3642.96s)]
*  one of the things that people often look to in beauty is the simplicity. So if you look at E [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3648.7200000000003s)]
*  equals MC squared, so when a few concepts come together, that's why the Euler identity is often [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3654.8s)]
*  considered the most beautiful equation in mathematics. Do you find beauty in that one, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3661.52s)]
*  in the Euler identity? Yeah. Well, as I said, I mean, what I find most appealing is connections [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3667.6800000000003s)]
*  between different things. So if you eat the pi i equals minus one. So yeah, people are always [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3671.68s)]
*  using all the fundamental constants. Okay. I mean, that's cute. But to me, so the exponential function [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3678.72s)]
*  was just to measure exponential growth, you know, so compound interest or decay, anything which is [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3686.16s)]
*  continuously growing, continuously decreasing growth and decay or dilation or contraction is [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3691.12s)]
*  modeled by the exponential function. Whereas pi comes around from circles and rotation. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3696.4s)]
*  If you want to rotate a needle, for example, 180 degrees, you need to rotate by pi radians. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3702.48s)]
*  And i, complex numbers, represents the swapping between root and imaginary axes of a 90 degree [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3706.88s)]
*  rotation. So a change in direction. So the exponential function represents growth and [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3711.6s)]
*  decay in the direction that you already are. When you stick an i in the exponential, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3717.04s)]
*  now it's instead of motion in the same direction as your current position, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3722.96s)]
*  it's the motion as a right angle is to your current position. So rotation. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3726.96s)]
*  And then so, if the pi i equals minus one, it tells you that if you rotate for a time pi, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3731.2799999999997s)]
*  you end up at the other direction. So it unifies geometry through dilation and exponential growth [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3736.24s)]
*  dynamics through this act of complexification, rotation by i. So it connects together all these [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3740.8799999999997s)]
*  two as mathematics. The famous geometry and complex numbers, they're all [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3747.28s)]
*  next door neighbors in mathematics because of this identity. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3754.4s)]
*  Do you think the thing you mentioned is cute, the collision of notations from these disparate fields, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3757.28s)]
*  is just a frivolous side effect? Or do you think there is legitimate value in notation? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3764.4s)]
*  All our old friends come together and unite. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3770.88s)]
*  It's confirmation that you have the right concepts. So when you first study anything, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3775.2000000000003s)]
*  you have to measure things and give them names. And initially, sometimes because your model is [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3781.76s)]
*  again too far off from reality, you give the wrong things the best names. And you only find [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3787.84s)]
*  out later what's really important. Physicists can do this sometimes. I mean, but it turns out okay. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3792.88s)]
*  So actually, physics, so it equals mc squared. Okay. So one of the big things was the E. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3797.84s)]
*  So when Aristotle first came up with his laws of motion, and then Galileo and Newton and so forth, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3803.3599999999997s)]
*  they saw the things they could measure. They could measure mass and acceleration and force [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3810.8799999999997s)]
*  and so forth. Newtonian mechanics, for example, ethicals ma was the famous Newton's second law [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3814.48s)]
*  of motion. So those were the primary objects. So they gave them the central building in the theory. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3819.8399999999997s)]
*  It was only later after people started analyzing these equations that there always seemed to be [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3824.3999999999996s)]
*  these quantities that were conserved. So in particular, momentum and energy. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3829.36s)]
*  And it's not obvious that things happen energy. It's not something you can directly measure the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3834.8s)]
*  same way you can measure mass and velocity. So both, but over time, people realized that this [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3839.28s)]
*  was actually a really fundamental concept. Hamilton, eventually in the 19th century, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3843.1200000000003s)]
*  reformulated Newton's laws of physics into what's called Hamiltonian mechanics, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3847.04s)]
*  where the energy, which is now called the Hamiltonian, was the dominant object. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3851.04s)]
*  Once you know how to measure the Hamiltonian of any system, you can describe completely [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3855.1200000000003s)]
*  the dynamics, like what happens to all the states. It really was a central actor, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3859.2s)]
*  which was not obvious initially. And this helped actually, this change of perspective really helped [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3864.88s)]
*  when quantum mechanics came along. Because the early physicists who studied quantum mechanics, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3872.56s)]
*  they had a lot of trouble trying to adapt their Newtonian thinking because everything was a [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3878.96s)]
*  particle and so forth to quantum mechanics. Because I think it was a wave, it just looked [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3884.48s)]
*  really, really weird. Like you ask what is the quantum division if it was MA? And it's really, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3889.52s)]
*  really hard to give an answer to that. But it turns out that the Hamiltonian, which was so [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3894.0s)]
*  secretly behind the scenes in classical mechanics, also is the key object in quantum mechanics, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3900.08s)]
*  that there's also an object called a Hamiltonian. It's a different type of object. It's what's [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3907.6s)]
*  called an operator rather than a function. But again, once you specify it, you specify the [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3911.12s)]
*  dynamics. So there's something called Schrodinger's equation that tells you exactly how quantum [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3916.56s)]
*  systems evolve once you have a Hamiltonian. So side by side, they look completely different [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3920.7999999999997s)]
*  objects. One involves particles, one involves waves, and so forth. But with this centrality, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3925.44s)]
*  you could start actually transferring a lot of intuition and facts from classical mechanics to [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3931.8399999999997s)]
*  quantum mechanics. So for example, in classical mechanics, there's this thing called Nutter's [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3935.7599999999998s)]
*  theorem. Every time there's a symmetry in a physical system, there was a conservation law. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3939.84s)]
*  So the laws of physics are translation invariant. Like if I move 10 steps to the left, I experience [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3944.32s)]
*  the same laws of physics as if I was here. And that corresponds to conservation momentum. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3948.2400000000002s)]
*  If I turn around by some angle, again, I experience the same laws of physics. This [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3954.1600000000003s)]
*  corresponds to conservation of angular momentum. If I wait for 10 minutes, I still have the same [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3958.08s)]
*  laws of physics. So there's time transition invariance. This corresponds to the law of [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3962.7200000000003s)]
*  conservation of energy. So there's this fundamental connection between symmetry [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3966.0s)]
*  and conservation. And that's also true in quantum mechanics, even though the equations [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3970.8s)]
*  are completely different. But because they're both coming from the Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3975.68s)]
*  controls everything. Every time the Hamiltonian has a symmetry, the equations will have a [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3979.2s)]
*  conservation law. So once you have the right language, it actually makes things a lot cleaner. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3983.6s)]
*  One of the problems is why we can't unify quantum mechanics and general relativity yet. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3992.8s)]
*  We haven't figured out what the fundamental objects are. For example, we have to give up [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3996.32s)]
*  the notion of space and time being these almost ingredient type spaces. And we kind of know that [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=3999.84s)]
*  at very tiny scales, there's going to be quantum fluctuations, there's going to be space-time foam. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4007.28s)]
*  And trying to use Cartesian code as XYZ, it's a non-starter. But we don't know what to replace [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4012.48s)]
*  it with. We don't actually have the mathematical concepts. The analog or Hamiltonian that sort of [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4020.08s)]
*  organized everything. Does your gut say that there is a theory of everything, so this is [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4027.7599999999998s)]
*  even possible to unify to find this language that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4032.72s)]
*  I believe so. I mean, the history of physics has been that of unification, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4039.44s)]
*  much like mathematics over the years. Electricity and magnetism were separate [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4043.2799999999997s)]
*  theories and then Maxwell unified them. Newton unified the motions of heavens for the motions [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4047.2s)]
*  of objects on the earth and so forth. So it should happen. It's just that the, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4052.24s)]
*  again, to go back to this model of the observations and theory. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4058.56s)]
*  Part of our problem is that physics is a victim of its own success. Two big theories of physics, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4062.3999999999996s)]
*  general relativity and quantum mechanics are so good now, so together they cover 99.9% of [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4068.8799999999997s)]
*  all the observations we can make. And you have to either go to extremely insane particle [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4074.48s)]
*  accelerations or the early universe or things that are really hard to measure in order to get [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4079.04s)]
*  any deviation from either of these two theories to the point where you can actually figure out how to [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4084.72s)]
*  combine them together. But I have faith that we've been doing this for centuries. We've [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4090.0s)]
*  made progress before. There's no reason why we should stop. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4096.08s)]
*  Do you think you will be a mathematician that develops a theory of everything? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4098.64s)]
*  What often happens is that when the physicists need some theory of mathematics, there's often [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  some precursor that the mathematicians worked out earlier. So when Einstein started realizing that [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4111.44s)]
*  space was curved, he went to some mathematician and asked, is there some theory of curved space [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4117.599999999999s)]
*  that the mathematicians already came up with that could be useful? And he said, oh yeah, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4123.2s)]
*  I think Riemann came up with something. And so yeah, Riemann had developed Riemannian geometry, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4126.719999999999s)]
*  which is precisely a theory of spaces that are curved in various general ways, which [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4132.4s)]
*  turned out to be almost exactly what was needed for Einstein's theory. This is going back to [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4138.24s)]
*  Wigner's unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. I think the theories that work well for explaining [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4142.4s)]
*  the universe tend to also involve the same mathematical objects that work well to solve [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4146.799999999999s)]
*  mathematical problems. Ultimately, they're just both ways of organizing data in useful ways. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4150.96s)]
*  It just feels like you might need to go some weird land that's very hard to [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4157.4400000000005s)]
*  intuit. You have string theory. Yeah, that was a leading candidate for many decades. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4162.64s)]
*  I think it's slowly falling out of fashion because it's not matching experiment. So one of the big [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4167.92s)]
*  challenges, of course, like you said, is experiment is very tough because of how effective both [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4174.08s)]
*  theories are. But the other is like, you're talking about, you're not just deviating from [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4181.12s)]
*  space time. You're going into some crazy number of dimensions. You're doing all kinds of weird [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4189.12s)]
*  stuff that to us, we've gone so far from this flat earth that we started at. Like you mentioned, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4193.84s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very hard to use our limited descendants of cognition to intuit [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4199.76s)]
*  what that reality really is like. This is why analogies are so important. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4208.160000000001s)]
*  The round earth is not intuitive because we're stuck on it. But round objects in general, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4212.96s)]
*  we have pretty good intuition over. And we have interest about light works and so forth. It's [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4219.84s)]
*  actually a good exercise to actually work out how eclipses and phases of the sun and the moon and [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4224.4800000000005s)]
*  so forth can be really easily explained by round earth and round moon and models. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4228.64s)]
*  And you can just take a basketball and a golf ball and a light source and actually do these [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4237.04s)]
*  things yourself. So the intuition is there, but you have to transfer it. That is a big leap [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4242.48s)]
*  intellectual for us to go from flat to round earth because our life is mostly lived in flat land. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4248.4s)]
*  Yeah. To load that information. And we're all like, take it for granted. We take so many things for [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4255.36s)]
*  granted because science has established a lot of evidence for this kind of thing. But [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4259.36s)]
*  you know, we're in a round rock, flying through space. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4264.8s)]
*  That's a big leap. And you have to take a chain of those leaps, the more and more and more we [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4270.64s)]
*  progress. Right. Yeah. So modern science is maybe again a victim of its own success is that [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4275.12s)]
*  in order to be more accurate, it has to move further and further away from your initial intuition. And [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4280.64s)]
*  so for someone who hasn't gone through the whole process of science education, it looks more and [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4284.72s)]
*  more suspicious because of that. So we need more grounding. I mean, there are scientists who do [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4289.2s)]
*  excellent outreach, but there's lots of science things that you can do at home. Lots of YouTube [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4297.36s)]
*  videos. I did a YouTube video recently with Grant Sanderson that we talked about earlier, how the [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4302.96s)]
*  ancient Greeks were able to measure things like the distance of the moon, distance of the earth, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4308.32s)]
*  and using techniques that you could also replicate yourself. It doesn't all have to be like fancy [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4311.679999999999s)]
*  space telescopes and very intimidating mathematics. Yeah, that's I highly recommend that. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4317.84s)]
*  I believe you have a lecture and you also did an incredible video with Grant. It's a beautiful [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4323.2s)]
*  experience to try to put yourself in the mind of a person from that time shrouded in mystery. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4328.32s)]
*  You know, you're like on this planet, you don't know the shape of it, the size of it. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4335.68s)]
*  You see some stars, you see some, you see some things and you try to like localize yourself [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4340.64s)]
*  in this world and try to make some kind of general statements about distance to places. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4344.8s)]
*  Change of perspective is really important. You see travel broadens the mind. This is intellectual [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4349.360000000001s)]
*  travel. You know, put yourself in the mind of the ancient Greeks or some other person, some other [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4353.28s)]
*  time period, make hypotheses, spherical cows, whatever, speculate. And this is what mathematicians [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4358.08s)]
*  do and some artists do actually. It's just incredible that given the extreme constraints, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4366.0s)]
*  you could still say very powerful things. That's why it's inspiring. Looking back in history, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4371.12s)]
*  how much can be figured out when you don't have much to figure out stuff with. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4376.24s)]
*  If you propose axioms, then the mathematics does follow those axioms to their conclusions. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4381.44s)]
*  And sometimes you can get quite a long way from initial hypotheses. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4385.92s)]
*  If we stay in the land of the weird, you mentioned general relativity. You've contributed [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4390.08s)]
*  to the mathematical understanding of Einstein's field equations. Can you explain this work [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4395.84s)]
*  and from a sort of mathematical standpoint, what aspects of general relativity are intriguing to [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4400.88s)]
*  you, challenging to you? I have worked on some equations, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4408.8s)]
*  there's something called the wave maps equation or the sigma field model, which is not quite the [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4413.28s)]
*  equation of space-time gravity itself, but of certain fields that might exist on top of space-time. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4418.16s)]
*  So Einstein's equations of relativity just describe space and time itself. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4425.76s)]
*  But then there's other fields that live on top of that. There's the electromagnetic field, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4430.64s)]
*  there's things called Yang-Mills fields. And there's this whole hierarchy of different equations [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4434.400000000001s)]
*  of which Einstein's considered one of the most nonlinear and difficult. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4439.28s)]
*  But relatively low in the hierarchy was this thing called the wave maps equation. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4442.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's a wave which at any given point is fixed to be like on a sphere. So I can think of a bunch [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4446.400000000001s)]
*  of arrows in space and time, and yeah, so it's pointing in different directions. But they [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4453.28s)]
*  propagate like waves. If you wiggle an arrow, it will propagate and make all the arrows move [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4459.28s)]
*  kind of like sheaves of wheat in the wheat field. And I was interested in the global regularity [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4464.16s)]
*  problem again for this question. Is it possible for all the energy here to collect at a point? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4469.84s)]
*  So the equation I considered was actually what's called a critical equation where [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4475.2s)]
*  the behaviour at all scales is roughly the same. And I was able barely to show that you couldn't [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4479.360000000001s)]
*  actually force a scenario where all the energy concentrated at one point. That at the end you [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4485.92s)]
*  had to dismiss a little bit, and the moment it just a little bit, it would stay regular. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4489.68s)]
*  Yeah, this was back in 2000. That was part of why I got interested in aerosols afterwards. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4494.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I developed some techniques to solve that problem. So part of it is this problem is [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4499.200000000001s)]
*  really nonlinear because of the curvature of the sphere. There was a certain nonlinear effect, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4505.44s)]
*  which was a non-perturbed effect. When you looked at it normally, it looked larger than the linear [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4510.5599999999995s)]
*  effects of the wave equation. And so it was hard to keep things under control, even when the energy [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4516.16s)]
*  was small. But I developed what's called a gauge transformation. So the equation is kind of like [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4522.639999999999s)]
*  an evolution of sheaves of wheat, and they're all bending back and forth. And so there's a lot of [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4527.28s)]
*  motion. But if you imagine stabilizing the flow by attaching little cameras at different points [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4532.08s)]
*  in space, which are trying to move in a way that captures most of the motion, and under this [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4537.84s)]
*  sort of stabilized flow, the flow becomes a lot more linear. I discovered a way to transform the [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4543.28s)]
*  equation to reduce the amount of nonlinear effects. And then I was able to solve the equation. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4549.44s)]
*  I found this transformation while visiting my aunt in Australia. And I was trying to understand [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4556.24s)]
*  the dynamics of all these fields. And I couldn't do a pen and paper. And I had none of the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4560.8s)]
*  computers to do any computer simulations. So I ended up closing my eyes, being on the floor. I [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4566.08s)]
*  just imagined myself to actually be this vector field and rolling around to try to see how to [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4571.360000000001s)]
*  change coordinates in such a way that somehow things in all directions would behave in a [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4576.8s)]
*  reasonably linear fashion. And my aunt walked in on me while I was doing that. And she was asking, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4580.64s)]
*  what am I doing doing this? It's complicated. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4585.84s)]
*  Okay, fine. You're a young man. I don't ask questions. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4591.2s)]
*  I have to ask about that. How do you approach solving difficult problems? If it's possible [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  to go inside your mind when you're thinking, are you visualizing in your mind the mathematical [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4604.72s)]
*  objects, symbols maybe? What are you visualizing in your mind usually when you're thinking? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4611.76s)]
*  A lot of pen and paper. One thing you pick up as a mathematician is I call it cheating strategically. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4617.04s)]
*  The beauty of mathematics is that you get to change the problem, change the rules as you wish. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4625.76s)]
*  You don't get to do this for any other field. If you're an engineer and someone says, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4631.68s)]
*  build a bridge over this river, you can't say, I want to build this bridge over here instead. Or [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4635.6s)]
*  I want to put it out of paper instead of steel. But in mathematics, you can do whatever you want. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4639.2s)]
*  It's like trying to solve a computer game where there's unlimited cheat codes available. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4647.12s)]
*  So you can set this dimension that's too large. I've set it to one. I'd solve the one-dimensional [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4653.12s)]
*  problem first. There's a main term and an error term. I'm going to make a spherical [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4659.44s)]
*  cow assumption. I'll assume the error term is zero. And so the way you should solve these [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4663.28s)]
*  problems is not in this Iron Man mode where you make things maximally difficult. But actually, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4667.2s)]
*  the way you should approach any reasonable math problem is that if there are 10 things that are [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4672.96s)]
*  making your life difficult, find a version of the problem that turns off nine of the difficulties [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4678.72s)]
*  but only keeps one of them and solve that. If you solve 10 cheats, then the game is trivial. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4682.32s)]
*  But if you solve nine cheats, you solve one problem, that teaches you how to deal with [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4691.12s)]
*  that particular difficulty. And then you turn that one off and you turn something else on. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4695.84s)]
*  And then you solve that one. And after you know how to solve the 10 problems, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4699.76s)]
*  10 difficulties separately, then you have to start merging them a few at a time. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4703.04s)]
*  As a kid, I watched a lot of these Hong Kong action movies from a culture. And one thing is [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4709.360000000001s)]
*  every time there's a fight scene, maybe the hero gets swarmed by 100 bad guy goons or whatever. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4716.400000000001s)]
*  But it will always be choreographed so that you'd always be only fighting one person at a time. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4722.24s)]
*  And then you would defeat that person and move on. And because of that, he could defeat all of them. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4726.0s)]
*  Whereas if they had fought a bit more intelligently and just swarmed the guy at once, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4731.28s)]
*  it would make for a much worse cinema. But they would win. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4736.0s)]
*  Are you usually pen and paper? Are you working with computer and latex? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4741.92s)]
*  I'm mostly pen and paper actually. In my office, I have four giant blackboards. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4748.08s)]
*  And sometimes I just have to write everything I know about the problem on the four blackboards [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4752.639999999999s)]
*  and then sit on my couch and just sort of see the whole thing. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4757.28s)]
*  Is it all symbols like notation or is there some drawings? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4760.32s)]
*  There's a lot of drawing and a lot of bespoke doodles that only make sense to me. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4763.759999999999s)]
*  The beautiful blackboard you can erase. It's a very organic thing. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4770.0s)]
*  I'm beginning to use more and more computers, partly because AI makes it much easier to do [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4774.8s)]
*  simple coding things. If I wanted to plot a function before, which is moderately complicated, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4779.36s)]
*  as an iteration or something, I'd have to remember how to set up a Python program and [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4784.4s)]
*  how does a for loop work and debug it. And it would take two hours and so forth. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4789.76s)]
*  And now I can do it in 10, 15 minutes. I'm using more and more computers to do simple explorations. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4794.16s)]
*  Let's talk about AI a little bit if we could. Maybe a good entry point is just talking about [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4801.4400000000005s)]
*  computer-assisted proofs in general. Can you describe the Lean formal proof programming [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4808.16s)]
*  language and how it can help as a proof assistant and maybe how you started using it [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4814.400000000001s)]
*  and how it has helped you? Lean is a computer language, much like [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4822.16s)]
*  standard languages like Python and C and so forth. Except that in most languages, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4829.5199999999995s)]
*  the focus is on using executable code. Lines of code do things. They flip bits or they make a [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4834.48s)]
*  robot move or they deliver you text on the internet or something. Lean is a language that can also do [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4840.08s)]
*  that. It can also be run as a standard traditional language, but it can also produce certificates. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4846.8s)]
*  So a software language like Python might do a computation and give you the answer is seven. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4852.72s)]
*  Does the sum of three plus four is equal to seven. But Lean can produce not just the answer, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4857.52s)]
*  but a proof that how it got the answer of seven as three plus four and all the steps involved. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4862.400000000001s)]
*  It creates these more complicated objects, not just statements, but statements with proofs [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4871.2s)]
*  attached to them. And every line of code is just a way of piecing together previous statements to [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4874.72s)]
*  create new ones. So the idea is not new. These things are called proof assistants. And so they [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4881.2s)]
*  provide languages for which you can create quite complicated, intricate mathematical proofs. And [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4886.08s)]
*  they produce these certificates that give a 100% guarantee that your arguments are correct. If you [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4892.24s)]
*  trust the compiler of Lean, but they made the compiler really small and you can, there are [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4898.48s)]
*  several different compilers available for the same level. Can you give people some intuition about [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4902.8s)]
*  the difference between writing on pen and paper versus using Lean programming language? How hard [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4907.28s)]
*  is it to formalize a statement? So Lean, a lot of mathematicians were involved in the design of [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4913.6s)]
*  Lean. So it's designed so that individual lines of code resemble individual lines of mathematical [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4919.4400000000005s)]
*  argument. Like you might want to introduce a variable, you want to prove a contradiction. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4925.92s)]
*  There are various standard things that you can do and it's written so ideally it's like a one-to-one [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4931.360000000001s)]
*  correspondence. In practice, it isn't because Lean is like explaining a proof to an extremely [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4935.76s)]
*  pedantic colleague who will point out, okay, did you really mean this? Like what happens if this is [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4941.04s)]
*  zero? Okay. How do you justify this? So Lean has a lot of automation in it to try to be less annoying. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4946.32s)]
*  So for example, every mathematical object has to come with a type. Like if I talk about X, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4956.16s)]
*  is X a real number or a natural number or a function or something? If you write things [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4961.2s)]
*  informally, it's often in the context. You say, clearly X is equal to, let X be the sum of Y and [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4968.64s)]
*  Z and Y and Z were already real numbers, so X should also be a real number. So Lean can do a lot [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4975.92s)]
*  of that, but every so often it says, wait a minute, can you tell me more about what this object is? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4980.96s)]
*  What type of object it is? You have to think more at the philosophical level, not just sort of [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4986.56s)]
*  computations that you're doing, but sort of what each object actually is in some sense. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4992.4800000000005s)]
*  Is it using something like LLMs to do the type inference or like you mentioned with the real [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=4997.36s)]
*  number? It's using much more traditional, sort of good old-fashioned AI. You can represent all these [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5003.04s)]
*  things as trees and there's always algorithms to match one tree to another tree. So it's actually [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5007.599999999999s)]
*  doable to figure out if something is a real number or a natural number. Yeah, every object [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5011.12s)]
*  comes with a history of where it came from and you can kind of trace it. Oh, I see. Yeah, so it's [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5017.36s)]
*  designed for reliability. So modern AIs are not used in, it's a disjoint technology. People are [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5022.56s)]
*  beginning to use AIs on top of Lean. So when a mathematician tries to program a proof in Lean, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5029.04s)]
*  often there's a step, okay, now I want to use the fundamental calculus, say, okay, to do the next [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5035.04s)]
*  step. So the Lean developers have built this massive project called Metholib, a collection of [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5040.080000000001s)]
*  tens of thousands of useful facts about methodical objects. And somewhere in there is the fundamental [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5045.76s)]
*  calculus, but you need to find it. So a lot of the bottleneck now is actually lemma search. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5051.12s)]
*  There's a tool that you know is in there somewhere and you need to find it. And so there are various [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5056.24s)]
*  search engines specialized for Metholib that you can do. But there's now these large language [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5062.48s)]
*  models that you can say, I need the fundamental calculus at this point. And it was like, okay, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5066.48s)]
*  for example, when I code, I have GitHub Copilot installed as a plugin to my IDE. And it scans [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5072.0s)]
*  my text and it sees what I need. It says, you know, I might even type it, okay, now I need to [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5078.64s)]
*  use the fundamental calculus. Okay. And then it might suggest, okay, try this. And like maybe 25% [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5082.64s)]
*  of the time, it works exactly. And then another 10, 15% of the time, it doesn't quite work, but [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5087.76s)]
*  it's close enough that I can say, oh, yeah, if I just change it here and here, it will work. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5092.8s)]
*  And then like half the time, it gives me complete rubbish. So, but people are beginning to use AIs [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5096.320000000001s)]
*  a little bit on top, mostly on the level of basically fancy autocomplete. That you can type [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5101.4400000000005s)]
*  half of one line of a proof and it will find it. Yeah. But a fancy, especially fancy with the sort [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5108.4s)]
*  of capital letter F is remove some of the friction. Yeah. Mathematician might feel when they move from [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5113.44s)]
*  pen and paper to formalizing. Yes. Yeah. So right now I estimate that the effort, time and effort [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5121.2s)]
*  taken to formalize the proof is about 10 times the amount taken to write it out. Yeah. So it's doable, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5126.879999999999s)]
*  but you don't, it's annoying. But doesn't it like kill the whole vibe of being a mathematician? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5132.88s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean- Having a pedantic co-worker. Right. Yeah. If that was the only aspect of it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5139.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. But okay. There's some things, because it was actually more pleasant to do things formally. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5144.64s)]
*  So there was a theorem I formalized and there was a certain constant 12 that came out in the final [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5149.92s)]
*  statement. And so this 12 had to be carried all through the proof. And like everything had to be [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5156.16s)]
*  checked that it goes all the, all these other numbers that had to be consistent with this final [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5160.48s)]
*  number 12. And then so we wrote a paper through this theorem with this number 12. And then a few [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5164.32s)]
*  weeks later, someone said, oh, we can actually improve this 12 to an 11 by reworking some of [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5168.719999999999s)]
*  these steps. And when this happens with pen and paper, like every time you change your parameter, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5172.32s)]
*  you have to check line by line that every single line of your proof still works. And there can be [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5177.12s)]
*  subtle things that you didn't quite realize, some properties on number 12 that you didn't even [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5180.959999999999s)]
*  realize that you were taking advantage of. So a proof can break down at a subtle place. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5184.879999999999s)]
*  So we had formalized the proof with this constant 12. And then when this new paper came out, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5189.28s)]
*  we said, oh, so that took like three weeks to formalize and like 20 people to formalize this [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5193.84s)]
*  original proof. So now let's update the 12 to 11. And what you can do with Lean, so you just, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5199.599999999999s)]
*  in your headline theorem, you change your 12 to 11, you run the compiler and like off the thousands [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5207.679999999999s)]
*  of lines of code you have, 90% of them still work. And there's a couple that are lined in red. Now I [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5212.719999999999s)]
*  can't justify these steps, but it immediately isolates which steps you need to change, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5217.84s)]
*  but you can skip over everything which works just fine. And if you program things correctly, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5221.84s)]
*  with good programming practices, most of your lines will not be red. And there'll just be a few [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5226.88s)]
*  places where you, I mean, if you don't hard code your constants, but you sort of, you use smart [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5231.360000000001s)]
*  tactics and so forth, you can localize the things you need to change to a very small period of time. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5238.24s)]
*  So it's like within a day or two, we had updated our proof. Because this is a very quick process. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5244.4s)]
*  You make a change, there are 10 things now that don't work. For each one, you make a change, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5250.48s)]
*  and now there's five more things that don't work. But the process converges [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5254.32s)]
*  much more smoothly than with pen and paper. So that's for writing. Are you able to read it? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5257.759999999999s)]
*  Like if somebody else has a proof, are you able to like, what's the versus paper? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5262.16s)]
*  Yeah, so the proofs are longer, but each individual piece is easier to read. So [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5268.08s)]
*  if you take a math paper and you jump to page 27, and you look at paragraph six, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5274.08s)]
*  and you have a line of text or math, I often can't read it immediately, because it assumes various [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5278.64s)]
*  definitions, which I have to go back and maybe on 10 pages earlier, this was defined. And this, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5285.68s)]
*  the proof is scattered all over the place. And you basically are forced to read fairly sequentially. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5290.72s)]
*  It's not like say a novel where like, you know, in theory, you could open up a novel halfway through [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5295.76s)]
*  and start reading. There's a lot of context. But when a proof in lean, if you put your cursor [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5300.4s)]
*  on a line of code, every single object there, you can hover over it and it will say what it is, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5304.719999999999s)]
*  where it came from, where it's justified. You can trace things back much easier than [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5309.12s)]
*  flipping through a math paper. So one thing that lean really enables is actually collaborating on [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5313.5199999999995s)]
*  proofs at a really atomic scale that you really couldn't do in the past. So traditionally, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5318.08s)]
*  pen and paper, when you want to collaborate with another mathematician, either you do it [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5322.799999999999s)]
*  at a blackboard where you can really interact. But if you're doing it sort of by email or [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5327.76s)]
*  something, basically, yeah, you have to segment it. So I'm going to finish section three, you do [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5331.92s)]
*  section four, but you can't really sort of work on the same thing, collaborate at the same time. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5337.04s)]
*  But with lean, you can be trying to formalize some portion of the proof and say, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5342.96s)]
*  I got stuck at line 67 here, I need to prove this thing, but it doesn't quite work. Here's [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5346.4800000000005s)]
*  like the three lines of code I'm having trouble with. But because all the context is there, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5351.12s)]
*  someone else can say, Oh, okay, I recognize what you need to do, you need to apply this trick or [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5354.88s)]
*  this tool. And you can do extremely atomic level conversations. So because of lean, I can collaborate, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5359.12s)]
*  you know, with dozens of people across the world, most of them I don't have never met [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5365.4400000000005s)]
*  in person. And I may not know actually, even whether they're how reliable they are in their, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5369.2s)]
*  in the proof segment. But lean gives me a certificate of trust. So I can do I can do [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5376.64s)]
*  trustless mathematics. So there's so many interesting questions. There's one you're [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5381.92s)]
*  you're known for being a great collaborator. So what is the right way to approach [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5386.56s)]
*  solving a difficult problem in mathematics when you're collaborating? Are you doing a divide and [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5394.64s)]
*  conquer type of thing? Or are you brain? Are you focused in a particular part and you're [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5399.4400000000005s)]
*  brainstorming? There's always a brainstorming process first. Yeah. So math research projects [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5404.56s)]
*  by their nature, when you start, you don't really know how to do the problem. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5410.08s)]
*  It's not like an engineering project where some other theory has been established for decades, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5414.88s)]
*  and its implementation is the main difficulty. You have to figure out even what is the right path. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5418.4s)]
*  So this is what I said about about cheating first, you know, it's like, to go back to the [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5423.5199999999995s)]
*  bridge building analogy, you know, first assume you have infinite budget and like unlimited amounts of [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5428.72s)]
*  workforce and so forth. Now can you can you build this bridge? Okay, okay. Now have infinite budget, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5433.5199999999995s)]
*  but only finite workforce. Now can you do that and so forth? So I mean, of course, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5438.24s)]
*  no no engineer can actually do this because they have fixed requirements. Yes, there's this sort [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5444.16s)]
*  of jam sessions always at the beginning where you try all kinds of crazy things and you you make all [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5448.719999999999s)]
*  these assumptions that are unrealistic, but you plan to fix later. And you try to see if there's [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  even some skeleton of an approach that might work. And then hopefully that breaks up the problem into [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5458.639999999999s)]
*  smaller sub problems, which you don't know how to do. But then you focus on the sub ones. And [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5465.36s)]
*  sometimes different collaborators are better at working on certain things. So one of my themes [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5470.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm known for is a theme of Ben Green, which is now called the Green Tower theorem. It's a statement [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5476.719999999999s)]
*  that the primes contain atomic progressions of any event. So it was a modification of this theme [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5481.2s)]
*  was already. And the way we collaborated was that Ben had already proven a similar result for [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5485.2s)]
*  progressions of length three. He showed that sets like the primes contain lots of questions of length [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5490.4s)]
*  three, even and even subsets of the prime, certain subsets do. But his techniques only worked for [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5495.679999999999s)]
*  for the three questions that didn't work for longer progressions. But I had these techniques [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5503.36s)]
*  coming from my gothic theory, which is something that I had been playing with and I knew better [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5507.679999999999s)]
*  than I'd been at the time. And so if I could justify certain randomness properties of some [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5512.0s)]
*  set relating to the primes, like there's a certain technical condition, which if I could [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5518.08s)]
*  have it, if Ben could supply me that this fact, I could conclude the theorem. But I, what I asked [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5523.44s)]
*  was a really difficult question in number theory, which he said, there's no way we can prove this. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5528.48s)]
*  Can you, so he said, can you prove your part of the theorem using a weaker hypothesis that I have [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5534.0s)]
*  a chance to prove it? And he proposed something which he could prove, but it was too weak for me. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5538.24s)]
*  I can't use this. So there's this, there's this conversation going back and forth. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5542.96s)]
*  Different cheats too. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5548.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I want to cheat more, he wants to cheat less. But eventually we found a property which [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5549.92s)]
*  A, he could prove and B, I could use. And then we could prove our view. And yeah, so there's a, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5556.0s)]
*  there are all kinds of dynamics. I mean, every collaboration has some story, no two are the same. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5563.44s)]
*  And then on the flip side of that, like you mentioned with lean programming, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5571.28s)]
*  now that's almost like a different story because you can do, you can create, I think you've mentioned [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5574.96s)]
*  a kind of a blueprint for a problem. And then you can really do a divide and conquer with lean, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5580.64s)]
*  where you're working on separate parts and they're using the computer system proof checker, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5588.4800000000005s)]
*  essentially to make sure that everything is correct along the way. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5593.92s)]
*  Yeah. So it makes it incompatible and yeah, and trustable. Yeah. So currently only a few [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5596.96s)]
*  mathematical projects can be cut up in this way. At the current state of the art, most of the lean [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5603.36s)]
*  activity is on formalizing proofs that have already been proven by humans. A math paper basically is [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5608.16s)]
*  a blueprint in a sense. It is taking a difficult statement, like big theorem, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5613.759999999999s)]
*  breaking it up into a hundred little lemmas. But often not all written with enough detail [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5617.92s)]
*  that each one can be sort of directly formalized. A blueprint is like a really pedantically written [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5624.16s)]
*  version of a paper where every step is explained as much detail as possible. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5628.8s)]
*  And to try to make each step kind of self-contained and depending on only a very specific [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5635.84s)]
*  number of previous statements that have been proven so that each node of this blueprint graph [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5640.96s)]
*  that gets generated can be tackled independently of all the others. And you don't even need to know [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5645.84s)]
*  how the whole thing works. So it's like a modern supply chain. Like if you want to create an iPhone [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5650.4800000000005s)]
*  or some other complicated object, no one person can build a single object, but you can have [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5655.04s)]
*  specialists who just, if they're given some widgets from some other company, they can combine them [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5661.04s)]
*  together to form a slightly bigger widget. I think that's a really exciting possibility [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5665.76s)]
*  because you can have, if you can find problems that could be broken down this way, then you can [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5669.04s)]
*  have thousands of contributors, right? Yes. So I told you before about the split between theoretical [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5675.28s)]
*  and experimental mathematics. And right now most mathematics is theoretical and when you type it, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5681.76s)]
*  it's experimental. I think the platform that Lean and other software tools, so GitHub and things [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5685.68s)]
*  like that, allow, they will allow experimental mathematics to scale up to a much greater degree [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5691.12s)]
*  than we can do now. So right now, if you want to do any mathematical exploration of some mathematical [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5697.68s)]
*  pattern or something, you need some code to write out the pattern. And I mean, sometimes there are [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5705.360000000001s)]
*  some computer algebra packages that can help, but often it's just one mathematician coding lots and [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5708.64s)]
*  lots of Python or whatever. And because coding is such an error-prone activity, it's not practical [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5713.280000000001s)]
*  to allow other people to collaborate with you on writing modules for your code, because if one of [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5718.72s)]
*  the modules has a bug in it, the whole thing is unreliable. So you get these bespoke spaghetti code [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5722.88s)]
*  written by non-professional programmers, but by mathematicians, and they're clunky and slow. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5732.4800000000005s)]
*  And so because of that, it's hard to really mass produce experimental results. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5739.2s)]
*  But yeah, I'm already starting some projects where we are not just experimenting with data, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5745.5199999999995s)]
*  but experimenting with proofs. So I have this project called the Equational Theories Project. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5752.8s)]
*  Basically, we generated about 22 million little problems in abstract algebra. Maybe I should [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5756.8s)]
*  back up and tell you what the project is. Okay, so abstract algebra studies operations like [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5761.04s)]
*  multiplication and addition and the abstract properties. So multiplication, for example, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5765.36s)]
*  is commutative. X times Y is always Y times X, at least for numbers. And it's also associative. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5769.759999999999s)]
*  X times Y times Z is the same as X times Y times Z. So these operations obey some laws that don't [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5775.2s)]
*  obey others. For example, X times X is not always equal to X. So that law is not always true. So [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5783.36s)]
*  given any operation, it obeys some laws and not others. And so we generated about 4,000 of these [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5788.24s)]
*  possible laws of algebra that certain operations can satisfy. And our question is which laws imply [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5794.64s)]
*  which are the ones? So for example, does commutativity imply associativity? And the answer is no, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5799.360000000001s)]
*  because it turns out you can describe an operation which obeys the commutative law, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5805.76s)]
*  but doesn't obey the associative law. So by producing an example, you can show that [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5808.240000000001s)]
*  commutativity does not imply associativity. But some other laws do imply other laws by substitution [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5812.64s)]
*  and so forth. And you can write down some algebraic proof. So we look at all the pairs between these [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5817.280000000001s)]
*  4,000 laws and there's about 22 million of these pairs. And for each pair, we ask, does this law [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5822.08s)]
*  imply this law? If so, give a proof, if not, give a counterexample. So 22 million problems, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5827.44s)]
*  each one of which you could give to an undergraduate algebra student, and they had a decent chance of [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5834.64s)]
*  solving the problem. Although there are a few, at least 22 million, there are like 100 or so that [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5839.6s)]
*  are really quite hard, but a lot are easy. And the project was just to work out to determine the [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5843.6s)]
*  entire graph, like which ones imply which other ones. That's an incredible project, by the way. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5849.2s)]
*  Such a good idea, such a good test of the very thing we've been talking about on a scale that's [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5852.96s)]
*  remarkable. Yeah, so it would not have been feasible. I mean, the state of the art in the [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5857.04s)]
*  literature was like 15 equations and sort of how they apply. That's at the limit of what a [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5861.28s)]
*  human independent paper can do. So you need to scale it up. So you need a crowdsource, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5865.84s)]
*  but you also need to trust all the, I mean, no one person can check 22 million of these proofs. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5870.96s)]
*  You need to be computerized. And so it only became possible with Lean. We were hoping to [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5878.32s)]
*  use a lot of AI as well. So the project is almost complete. So at least 20 million, all but two [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5884.4s)]
*  have been settled. Wow. Well, actually, and of those two, we have a pen and paper proof of the [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5889.92s)]
*  two, and we were formalizing it. In fact, this morning I was working on finishing it. So we're [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5896.16s)]
*  almost done on this. It's incredible. Yeah, how many people were able to get it? About 50. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5901.679999999999s)]
*  Which in mathematics is considered a huge number. It's a huge number. That's crazy. Yeah. So we're [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5908.4s)]
*  gonna have a paper 50 authors and a big appendix of food contributor. What? Here's an interesting [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5913.5199999999995s)]
*  question. Not to maybe speak even more generally about it. When you have this pool of people, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5919.2s)]
*  is there a way to organize the contributions by level of expertise of the people, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5925.759999999999s)]
*  all the contributors? Now, okay. I'm asking a lot of pothead questions here, but I'm imagining a [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5930.08s)]
*  bunch of humans and maybe in the future, some AI's. Can there be like an ELO rating type of [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5936.88s)]
*  situation where like a gamification of this? The beauty of these lean projects is that [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5942.72s)]
*  automatically you get all this data. So like everything's uploaded to this GitHub, GitHub [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5949.28s)]
*  tracks who contributed what. So you could generate statistics from at any later point in time. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5953.4400000000005s)]
*  You can say, oh, this person contributed this many lines of code or whatever. I mean, these are very [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5960.8s)]
*  crude metrics. I would definitely not want this to become like part of your tenure review or [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5964.88s)]
*  something. But I mean, I think already in enterprise computing, right? People do use some of these [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5969.76s)]
*  metrics as part of the assessment of performance of an employee. Again, this is the direction, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5977.12s)]
*  which is a bit scary for academics to go down. We don't like metrics so much. And yet academics [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5983.84s)]
*  use metrics. They just use old ones. Number of papers. Yeah. It's true. It's true that, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5991.12s)]
*  it feels like this is a metric while flawed is going more in the right direction, right? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=5999.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting. At least it's a very interesting metric. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6005.68s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's interesting to study. I mean, I think you can do studies of whether these are [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6008.72s)]
*  better predictors. There's this problem called Goodheart's law. If a statistic is actually used [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6013.28s)]
*  to incentivize performance, it becomes gamed and then it is no longer a useful measure. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6018.08s)]
*  Oh, humans. Always gaming. Yeah. I know. I mean, it's rational. So what we've done for this project [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6022.5599999999995s)]
*  is self-report. So there are actually standard categories from the sciences of what types of [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6028.16s)]
*  contributions people give. So there's this concept and validation and resources and coding and so [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6034.0s)]
*  forth. So there's a standard list of 12 or so categories. And we just ask each contributor to [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6040.24s)]
*  this big matrix of all the authors and all the categories just to tick the boxes where they think [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6046.64s)]
*  that they contributed. And just to give a rough idea, you did some coding and you provided some [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6051.360000000001s)]
*  compute, but you didn't do any of the pen and paper verification or whatever. And I think that [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6058.400000000001s)]
*  works out. Traditionally, mathematicians just order alphabetically by surname. So we don't have this [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6063.360000000001s)]
*  tradition as in the sciences of lead author and second author and so forth, which we're proud of. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6068.240000000001s)]
*  We make all the authors equal status, but it doesn't quite scale to this size. So a decade ago, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6073.36s)]
*  I was involved in these things called polymath projects. It was the crowdsourcing mathematics, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6079.679999999999s)]
*  but without the lean component. So it was limited by you needed a human moderator to actually check [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6084.16s)]
*  that all the contributions coming in were actually valid. And this was a huge bottleneck actually. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6088.719999999999s)]
*  But still we had projects that were 10 authors or so. But we had decided at the time [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6094.16s)]
*  not to try to decide who did what, but to have a single pseudonym. So we created this fictional [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6100.0s)]
*  character called DHJ polymath in the spirit of Bo Ba Ki. Bo Ba Ki is the pseudonym for a famous [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6106.8s)]
*  group of mathematicians in the 20th century. And so the paper was authored on the pseudonym. So none [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6113.36s)]
*  of us got the author credit. This actually turned out to be not so great for a couple of reasons. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6118.64s)]
*  So one is that if you actually wanted to be considered for tenure or whatever, you could not [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6123.76s)]
*  use this paper as you submitted it as one of your publications because you didn't have the [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6129.68s)]
*  formal author credit. But the other thing that we've recognized much later is that when people [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6136.16s)]
*  referred to these projects, they naturally referred to the most famous person who was [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6143.12s)]
*  involved in the project. So this was Tim Gower's polymath project, this was Terence Tao's polymath [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6147.6s)]
*  project, and not mention the other 19 or whatever people that were involved. So we're trying something [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6151.6s)]
*  different this time around where everyone's an author, but we will have an appendix with this [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6158.0s)]
*  matrix and we'll see how that works. So both projects are incredible, just the fact that you're [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6163.36s)]
*  involved in such huge collaborations. But I think I saw a talk from Kevin Buzzard about the linear [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6168.88s)]
*  programming languages a few years ago, and you're saying that this might be the future of mathematics. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6174.16s)]
*  And so it's also exciting that you're embracing, one of the greatest mathematicians in the world, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6180.08s)]
*  embracing this, what seems like the paving of the future of mathematics. So I have to ask you here [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6185.76s)]
*  about the integration of AI into this whole process. So DeepMind's alpha proof was trained [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6193.68s)]
*  using reinforcement learning on both failed and successful formal lean proofs of IMO problems. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6201.84s)]
*  So this is sort of high level high school. Oh, very high level, yes. Very high level high school [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6208.0s)]
*  level mathematics problems. What do you think about the system and maybe what is the gap between [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6214.08s)]
*  this system that is able to prove the high school level problems versus gradual level problems? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6219.2s)]
*  Yeah, the difficulty increases exponentially with the number of steps involved in the proof. It's a [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6227.04s)]
*  commentarial explosion. So the thing of large language models is that they make mistakes. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6232.8s)]
*  And so if a proof has got 20 steps and your large language model has a 10% failure rate [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6237.92s)]
*  at each step of going in the wrong direction, it's extremely unlikely to actually reach the end. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6242.719999999999s)]
*  Actually, just to take a small tangent here, how hard is the problem of mapping [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6249.76s)]
*  from natural language to the formal program? Oh, yeah, it's extremely hard, actually. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6256.5599999999995s)]
*  Natural language, it's very fault tolerant. You can make a few minor grammatical errors and [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6261.28s)]
*  the speaker in the second language can get some idea of what you're saying. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6266.4s)]
*  Yeah, but formal language, if you get one little thing wrong, I think that the whole thing is [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6269.2s)]
*  nonsense. Even formal to formal is very hard. There are different incompatible [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6274.4800000000005s)]
*  proofs in languages. There's Lean, but also Coq and Isabelle and so forth. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6280.16s)]
*  And actually, even converting from a formal language to formal language [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6284.400000000001s)]
*  is an unsolved problem. That is fascinating. Okay, so, but once you have an informal language, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6287.12s)]
*  they're using their RL train model, something akin to AlphaZero that they used to go [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6295.76s)]
*  to then try to come up with proofs. They also have a model, I believe it's a separate model [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6303.68s)]
*  for geometric problems. So what impresses you about the system and what do you think is the gap? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6307.52s)]
*  Yeah, we talked earlier about things that are amazing over time become kind of normalized. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6315.280000000001s)]
*  Of course, geometry is a solvable problem. Right, that's true. That's true. I mean, it's still [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6318.96s)]
*  beautiful. Yeah, it's a great work. It shows what's possible. The approach doesn't scale [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6323.12s)]
*  currently. Three days of Google's server time to solve one high school math problem. This is not a [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6330.08s)]
*  scalable prospect, especially with the exponential increase in complexity. So, it's a very [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6336.400000000001s)]
*  prospect, especially with the exponential increase in complexity increases. Which you [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6343.6s)]
*  mentioned that they got a silver medal performance. The equivalent of. I mean, yeah. The equivalent [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6349.76s)]
*  of a silver medal. So first of all, they took way more time than was allotted. And they had [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6354.160000000001s)]
*  this assistance where the humans started helped by formalizing. But also, they're giving us those [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6358.8s)]
*  full marks for the solution, which I guess is formally verified. So I guess that's fair. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6365.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. There are efforts. There will be a proposal at some point to actually have an AI math [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6369.52s)]
*  Olympiad where at the same time as the human contestants get to the actual Olympiad problems, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6377.92s)]
*  the AI's will also be given the same problems, the same time period. And the outputs will have [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6385.6s)]
*  to be created by the same judges. Which means that will have to be written in natural language [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6390.400000000001s)]
*  rather than formal language. Oh, I hope that happens. I hope this IMO happens. I hope next one. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6396.24s)]
*  It won't happen this IMO. The performance is not good enough in the time period. But there are [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6401.84s)]
*  smaller competitions. There are competitions where the answer is a number rather than a long form [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6408.639999999999s)]
*  proof. And that's, AI is actually a lot better at problems where there's a specific numerical answer. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6414.48s)]
*  Because it's easy to do reinforcement learning on it. Yeah, you got the right answer, you got [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6423.04s)]
*  the wrong answer. It's a very clear signal. But a long form proof either has to be formal and then [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6427.92s)]
*  the lean can give it a thumbs up, thumbs down, or it's informal. But then you need a human to [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6434.16s)]
*  create it. And if you're trying to do billions of reinforcement learning runs, you can't hire [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6438.8s)]
*  enough humans to create those. It's already hard enough for the last time people want to do [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6447.52s)]
*  reinforcement learning on just the regular text that people get. But now if you hire people, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6453.360000000001s)]
*  not just give thumbs up, thumbs down, but actually check the output mathematically. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6458.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's too expensive. So if we just explore this possible future, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6463.200000000001s)]
*  what is the thing that humans do that's most special in mathematics? So that you could see AI [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6470.72s)]
*  not cracking for a while. So inventing new theories, so coming up with new conjectures versus [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6477.68s)]
*  proving the conjectures, building new abstractions, new representations, maybe [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6484.56s)]
*  an AI turnstile with seeing new connections between disparate fields. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6491.92s)]
*  That's a good question. I think the nature of what mathematicians do over time has changed a lot. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6496.72s)]
*  So a thousand years ago, mathematicians had to compute the date of Easter. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6502.0s)]
*  And there's really complicated calculations, but it's all automated, being automated centuries. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6506.32s)]
*  We don't need that anymore. They used to navigate to do spherical navigation, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6511.68s)]
*  spherical trigonometry to navigate how to get from the old world to the new. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6515.68s)]
*  It's like a very complicated calculation, again, being automated. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6519.36s)]
*  Even a lot of undergraduate mathematics, even before AI, like Wolfram Alpha, for example, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6524.4800000000005s)]
*  is not a language model, but it can solve a lot of undergraduate level math tasks. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6529.52s)]
*  On the computational side, verifying routine things like having a problem and say, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6533.12s)]
*  here's a problem in partial differential equations. Could you solve it using any of the [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6538.4s)]
*  20 standard techniques? And the AI will say, yes, I've tried all 20. Here are the 100 different [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6541.76s)]
*  permutations and here's my results. And that type of thing, I think it will work very well. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6546.64s)]
*  The type of scaling to once you solve one problem to make the AI attack 100 adjacent problems. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6551.92s)]
*  Make the AI attack 100 adjacent problems. The things that humans do still, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6558.5599999999995s)]
*  where the AI really struggles right now is knowing when it's made a wrong turn. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6566.879999999999s)]
*  And it can say, oh, I'm going to solve this problem. I'm going to split up this problem [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6572.639999999999s)]
*  into these two cases. I'm going to try this technique. And sometimes if you're lucky, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6576.639999999999s)]
*  it's a simple problem, it's the right technique and you solve the problem. And sometimes it will [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6581.759999999999s)]
*  have a problem. It would propose an approach which is just complete nonsense. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6586.08s)]
*  But it looks like a proof. So this is one annoying thing about LLM-generated mathematics. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6591.28s)]
*  We've had human-generated mathematics that's very low quality, submissions from people who [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6600.0s)]
*  don't have the formal training and so forth. But if a human proof is bad, you can tell it's bad [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6605.12s)]
*  pretty quickly. It makes really basic mistakes. But the AI-generated proofs, they can look [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6609.28s)]
*  superficially flawless. And it's partly because that's what the reinforcement learning has like [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6615.679999999999s)]
*  you train them to do. To produce text that looks like what is correct, which for many applications [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6619.759999999999s)]
*  is good enough. So the error is often really subtle. And then when you spot them, they're [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6626.639999999999s)]
*  really stupid. Like no human would have actually made that mistake. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6631.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's actually really frustrating in the programming context because I program a lot. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6636.08s)]
*  Yeah, when a human makes low quality code, there's something called code smell. You can tell. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6640.88s)]
*  Immediately like there's signs. But with AI-generated code, and then you're right, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6647.6s)]
*  eventually you find an obvious dumb thing that just looks like good code. It's very tricky too, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6654.0s)]
*  and frustrating for some reason. Yeah, so the sense of smell. This is one thing that humans have. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6661.92s)]
*  There's a metaphorical mathematical smell that is not clear how to get the AI to duplicate that. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6671.04s)]
*  Eventually, I mean, so the way AlphaZero and so forth to make progress on Go and chess and so [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6678.8s)]
*  forth is in some sense they have developed a sense of smell for Go and test positions. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6685.6s)]
*  This position is good for white, this is good for black. They can't initiate why, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6690.4s)]
*  but just having that sense of smell lets them strategize. So if AIs gain that ability to sort [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6695.68s)]
*  of assess the viability of certain proof strategies. So you can say, I'm going to try to break up this [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6702.96s)]
*  problem into two small subtasks. And then you can say, oh, this looks good. The two tasks look like [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6708.72s)]
*  they're simpler tasks than your main task. And they still got a good chance of being true. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6714.08s)]
*  So this is good to try. Or no, you've made the problem worse because each of the two subproblems [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6718.400000000001s)]
*  is actually harder than your original problem, which is actually what normally happens if you [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6722.56s)]
*  try a random thing to try. It's very easy to transform a problem into an even harder problem. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6726.080000000001s)]
*  Very rarely do you transform into a simpler problem. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6732.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so if they can pick up the sense of smell, then they could maybe start competing with [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6736.8s)]
*  human level mathematicians. So this is a hard question, but not competing, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6743.200000000001s)]
*  but collaborating. Hypothetically, if I gave you an oracle that was able to do some aspect of what [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6746.64s)]
*  you do and you could just collaborate with it, what would you like that oracle to be able to do? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6755.52s)]
*  Would you like it to maybe be a verifier, like check to the codes? Yes, Professor Tao, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6761.280000000001s)]
*  this is a promising fruitful direction. Or would you like it to [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6771.12s)]
*  generate possible proofs and then you see which one is the right one? Or would you like it to [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6779.04s)]
*  maybe generate different representation, totally different ways of seeing this problem? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6785.36s)]
*  I think all of the above. A lot of it is we don't know how to use these tools because it's a paradigm [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6790.8s)]
*  that's not... We have not had in the past systems that are competent enough to understand complex [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6796.64s)]
*  instructions that can work at massive scale, but are also unreliable. It's a bit unreliable in [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6804.16s)]
*  subtle ways, whereas it's sufficiently good output. It's an interesting combination. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6814.32s)]
*  You have graduate students that you work with who are kind of like this, but not at scale. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6820.88s)]
*  We had previous software tools that can work at scale, but very narrow. We have to figure out how [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6828.32s)]
*  to use... Tim Gow is actually... You can imagine he actually foresaw in 2000, he was envisioning [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6835.36s)]
*  what mathematics would look like in actually two and a half decades. He wrote in his article [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6843.28s)]
*  like a hypothetical conversation between a mathematical assistant of the future and himself [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6851.5199999999995s)]
*  trying to solve a problem. They would have to have a conversation. Sometimes the human would propose [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6857.36s)]
*  an idea and the AI would evaluate it. Sometimes the AI would propose an idea. Sometimes a competition [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6862.4s)]
*  was required and the AI would just go and say, okay, I've checked the 100 cases needed here. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6869.52s)]
*  Or the first... You said this is true for all n, I've checked it by n up to 100 and it looks [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6873.76s)]
*  good so far. Or hang on, there's a problem at n equals 46. Just a free-form conversation [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6879.84s)]
*  where you don't know in advance where things are going to go, but just based on... I think ideas [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6885.52s)]
*  are good to propose on both sides, calculations are good to propose on both sides. I've had [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6890.72s)]
*  conversations with AI where I say, okay, we're going to collaborate to solve this math problem. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6894.080000000001s)]
*  It's a problem that I already know the solution to. I try to prompt it. Okay, so here's the problem. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6898.72s)]
*  I suggest using this tool. It'll find this lovely argument using a completely different tool, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6902.8s)]
*  which eventually goes into the weeds and say, no, no, no, try using this. Okay, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6907.2s)]
*  it might start using this and then it'll go back to the tool that it wanted to do before. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6911.2s)]
*  You have to keep railroading it onto the path you want. I could eventually force it to give [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6916.08s)]
*  the proof I wanted, but it was like herding cats. The amount of personal effort I had to take to [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6921.360000000001s)]
*  not just to prompt it, but also check its output because a lot of what it looked like [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6928.0s)]
*  was going to work. I know there's a problem on 917. Basically arguing with it, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6932.16s)]
*  it was more exhausting than doing it unassisted. That's the current state of the art. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6938.24s)]
*  I wonder if there's a phase shift that happens to where it's no longer feels like herding cats. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6943.92s)]
*  Maybe you'll surprise us how quickly that comes. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6952.08s)]
*  I believe so. In formalization, I mentioned before that it takes 10 times longer to formalize a proof [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6954.64s)]
*  that you've added by hand. With these modern AI tools and also just better tooling, the lean [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6960.32s)]
*  developers are doing a great job adding more and more features and making it user-friendly. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6967.84s)]
*  You know, it's going from nine to eight to seven, okay, no big deal, but one day it will drop a little [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6971.84s)]
*  one. That's a phase shift because suddenly it makes sense when you write a paper to write it [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6977.28s)]
*  in lean first or through a conversation with AI who's generating lean on the fly with you. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6986.0s)]
*  It becomes natural for journals to accept. Maybe they'll offer an expedite referee. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6991.5199999999995s)]
*  If a paper has already been formalized in lean, they'll just ask the referee to comment on the [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=6997.44s)]
*  significance of the results and how it connects to literature and not worry so much about the [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7003.52s)]
*  correctness because that's been certified. Papers are getting longer and longer in mathematics and [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7007.4400000000005s)]
*  it's harder and harder to get good refereeing for the really long words, unless they're really [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7012.64s)]
*  important. It is actually an issue which in the formalization is coming in just the right time [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7017.280000000001s)]
*  for this to be. The easier and easier it gets because of the tooling and all the other factors, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7022.72s)]
*  then you're going to see much more like math label grow potentially exponentially. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7027.120000000001s)]
*  It's a virtuous cycle. Okay. One phase shift of this type that happened in the past was the [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7033.84s)]
*  adoption of LaTeX. LaTeX is this typesetting language that all mathematicians use now. In the [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7038.8s)]
*  past, people used all kinds of word processors and typewriters and whatever, but at some point, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7043.52s)]
*  LaTeX became easier to use than all other competitors and people just switched within [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7048.64s)]
*  a few years. It was just a dramatic phase shift. It's a wild out there question, but what year, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7054.240000000001s)]
*  how far away are we from an AI system being a collaborator on a proof that wins the Fields [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7062.56s)]
*  Medal? That level. Okay. Well, it depends on the level of collaboration. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7072.64s)]
*  It deserves to get the Fields Medal, so half and half. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7078.64s)]
*  Already, I can imagine if it was a medal winning paper having some AI systems in writing it, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7083.200000000001s)]
*  and I just, like the auto-complete alone is already, I use it, it speeds up my own writing. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7088.56s)]
*  Like, you can have a theorem, you have a proof, and the proof has three cases. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7096.080000000001s)]
*  And I write down the proof of the first case and the auto-complete just suggests that now [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7099.92s)]
*  here's how the proof of the second case could work. And it was exactly correct. That was great. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7103.6s)]
*  Saved me like five, 10 minutes of typing. But in that case, the AI system doesn't get [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7107.6s)]
*  the Fields Medal. No. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7112.56s)]
*  Are we talking 20 years, 50 years, 100 years? What do you think? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7117.6s)]
*  Okay. So I gave a bit of a print, but it's about 2026, which is now next year. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7121.76s)]
*  There will be math collaborations with AI. So not Fields Medal winning, but actual research [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7127.280000000001s)]
*  level math papers. Like published ideas that are in part generated by AI. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7133.6s)]
*  Maybe not the ideas, but at least some of the computations. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7138.240000000001s)]
*  The verifications. Yeah. I mean, that already happened. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7142.88s)]
*  That already happened. Yeah. There are problems that were solved by a complicated process, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7145.280000000001s)]
*  conversing with AI to propose things and the human goes and tries it and the contract doesn't work. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7151.84s)]
*  But it might pose a different idea. It's hard to disentangle exactly. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7157.52s)]
*  There are certainly math results, which could only have been accomplished because there was a [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7164.8s)]
*  human mathematician and an AI involved. But it's hard to disentangle credit. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7169.68s)]
*  I mean, these tools, they do not replicate all the skills needed to do mathematics, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7178.16s)]
*  but they can replicate some non-trivial percentage of them, 30, 40%. So they can fill in gaps. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7184.24s)]
*  Coding is a good example. It's annoying for me to code in Python. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7192.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not a native professional programmer, but with AI, the friction cost of doing it is much [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7198.96s)]
*  reduced. So it fills in that gap for me. AI is getting quite good at literature review. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7208.64s)]
*  I mean, there's still a problem with hallucinating references that don't exist. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7215.6s)]
*  But this, I think, is a civil war problem. If you train in the right way and so forth, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7220.8s)]
*  you can verify using the internet. You should in a few years get to the point where you have a [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7225.6s)]
*  lemma that you need and say, has anyone proven this lemma before? And we'll do basically a fancy web [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7235.5199999999995s)]
*  search, AI assistant, and say, yeah, there are these six papers where something similar has [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7241.28s)]
*  happened. I mean, you can ask it right now and it will give you six papers of which maybe one [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7245.36s)]
*  is legitimate and relevant. One exists, but it's not relevant for hallucinating. It has a non-zero [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7249.92s)]
*  success rate right now, but there's so much garbage. The signal-to-noise ratio is so poor that [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7256.4s)]
*  it's most helpful when you already somewhat know the literature and you just need to be [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7265.04s)]
*  prompted to be reminded of a paper that was really subconsciously in your memory. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7269.76s)]
*  Versus helping you discover a new you were not even aware of, but is the correct citation. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7274.0s)]
*  Yeah, that it can sometimes do, but when it does, it's buried in a list of options. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7279.2s)]
*  I mean, being able to automatically generate a related work section that is correct, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7286.96s)]
*  that's actually a beautiful thing that might be another phase shift because it assigns credit [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7292.48s)]
*  correctly. It breaks you out of the silos of thought. Yeah, there's a big hump to overcome [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7297.12s)]
*  right now. I mean, it's like self-driving cars. The safety margin has to be really high [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7304.96s)]
*  to be feasible. So yeah, there's a last-morrow problem with a lot of AI applications that [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7312.32s)]
*  they can develop tools that work 20%, 80% of the time, but it's still not good enough. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7319.28s)]
*  And in fact, even worse than good in some ways. I mean, another way of asking the field's mental [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7325.52s)]
*  question is what year do you think you'll wake up and be like real surprised? You read the headline, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7330.16s)]
*  the news or something happened that AI did, like, you know, real breakthrough something. It doesn't, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7337.2s)]
*  you know, like fields metal, even hypothesis. It could be like really just this AlphaZero moment [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7343.84s)]
*  would go that right. Right. Yeah, this decade, I can see it like making a conjecture between [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7351.04s)]
*  two unrelated, two things that people thought was unrelated. Oh, interesting generating a [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7359.36s)]
*  conjecture that's a beautiful conjecture. Yeah, and actually has a real chance of being correct [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7363.679999999999s)]
*  and meaningful. Because that's actually kind of doable, I suppose. But the word the data is, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7368.639999999999s)]
*  it's yeah, no, that would be truly amazing. The current models struggle a lot. I mean, so [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7375.28s)]
*  a version of this is, I mean, the physicists have a dream of getting the AI to discover new laws of [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7381.36s)]
*  physics. The dream is you just feed it all this data. Okay. And this is a huge, here's a new [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7386.4s)]
*  patent that we didn't see before. But it actually even struggled, the current state of the art even [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7394.0s)]
*  struggles to discover old laws of physics from the data. Or if it does, there's a big concern [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7398.0s)]
*  contamination that it did it only because it's like somewhere in this training data, it already [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7404.4s)]
*  somehow new, you know, Boyle's law or whatever you're trying to reconstruct. Part of it is that [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7408.24s)]
*  we don't have the right type of training data for this. Yeah, so for laws of physics, like we don't [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7416.08s)]
*  have like a million different universes or a million different balls of nature. And [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7420.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot of what we're missing in math is actually the negative space of, so we have published things [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7428.719999999999s)]
*  of things that people have been able to prove and conjectures that ended up being verified. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7432.96s)]
*  Or we kind of examples produced, but we don't have data on things that were proposed and the [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7438.0s)]
*  kind of a good thing to try. But then people quickly realized that it was the wrong conjecture. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7443.919999999999s)]
*  And then they this out, but we should actually change our claim to modify it in this way to [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7448.639999999999s)]
*  actually make it more plausible. There's a trial and error process, which is a real integral part [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7453.679999999999s)]
*  of human mathematical discovery, which we don't record because it's embarrassing. We make mistakes [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7459.28s)]
*  and we only like to publish our wins. And the AI has no access to this data to train on. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7465.2s)]
*  I sometimes joke that basically, AI has to go through grad school and actually, you know, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7472.8s)]
*  go to grad courses, do the assignments, go to office hours, make mistakes, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7479.04s)]
*  get advice on how to correct the mistakes and learn from that. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7484.24s)]
*  Let me ask you, if I may, about Grigori Perlman. You mentioned that you try to be careful in your [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7487.68s)]
*  work and not let a problem completely consume you. Just you've really fallen in love with the [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7495.2s)]
*  problem and really cannot rest until you solve it. But you also hasted to add that sometimes this [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7500.72s)]
*  approach actually can be very successful. An example you gave is Grigori Perlman, who proved [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7506.0s)]
*  the Poincare conjecture and did so by working alone for seven years with basically little [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7511.04s)]
*  contact with the outside world. Can you explain this one millennial prize problem that's been [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7518.64s)]
*  solved, Poincare conjecture, and maybe speak to the journey that Grigori Perlman's been on? [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7525.44s)]
*  All right. So it's the question about curved spaces. Earth is a good example. So I think it [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7531.5199999999995s)]
*  was a 2D surface. In such a round view, it could maybe be a torus with a hole in it or it can have [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7536.0s)]
*  many holes. And there are many different topologies a priori that a surface could have, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7540.64s)]
*  even if you assume that it's bounded and smooth and so forth. So we have figured out how to [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7546.72s)]
*  classify surfaces. As a first approximation, everything is determined. Let's call the genus, [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7552.0s)]
*  how many holes it has. So the sphere has genus zero, a donut has genus one, and so forth. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7555.6s)]
*  And one way you can tell these surfaces apart, probably the sphere has, which is called simply [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7560.400000000001s)]
*  connected. If you take any closed loop on the sphere, like a big closed little rope, you can [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7564.240000000001s)]
*  contract it to a point while staying on the surface. And the sphere has this property, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7569.2s)]
*  but a torus doesn't. If you're on a torus and you take a rope that goes around, say, the outer [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7573.679999999999s)]
*  diameter of the torus, it can't get through the hole. There's no way to contract it to a point. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7578.88s)]
*  So it turns out that the sphere is the only surface with this property of contractability, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7585.12s)]
*  up to continuous deformations of the sphere. So things that I want to call topologically [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7590.639999999999s)]
*  equivalent of the sphere. So Poincare asked the same question in higher dimensions. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7595.28s)]
*  It becomes hard to visualize because surface you can think of as embedded in three dimensions, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7599.92s)]
*  but a curved free space, we don't have good intuition of 4D space to live in. And then [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7604.4s)]
*  there are also 3D spaces that can't even fit into four dimensions. You need five or six or [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7610.48s)]
*  higher. But anyway, mathematically, you can still pose this question that if you have a bounded [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7614.88s)]
*  three-dimensional space now, which also has this simply connected property that every loop can be [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7619.679999999999s)]
*  contracted, can you turn it into a three-dimensional version of the sphere? And so this is the Poincare [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7624.08s)]
*  conjecture. Weirdly in higher dimensions, four and five, it was actually easier. So [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7628.16s)]
*  it was solved first in higher dimensions. There's somehow more room to do the deformation. It's [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7632.96s)]
*  easier to move things around to a sphere. But three was really hard. So people tried many [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7637.12s)]
*  approaches. There's sort of commentory approaches where you chop up the surface into little [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7643.76s)]
*  triangles or tetrahedra and you just try to argue based on how the faces interact with each other. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7647.84s)]
*  There were algebraic approaches. There's various algebraic objects like things called the fundamental [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7652.0s)]
*  group that you can attach to these homology and cohomology and all these very fancy tools. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7659.04s)]
*  They also didn't quite work. But Richard Hamilton's proposed a partial differential [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7664.8s)]
*  equations approach. So you have this object which is sort of secret as a sphere, but it's given to [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7671.2s)]
*  you in a really weird way. So think of a ball that's been crumpled up and twisted and it's [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7679.6s)]
*  not obvious that it's a ball. But if you have some sort of surface which is a deformed sphere, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7686.320000000001s)]
*  for example, think of it as the surface of a balloon. You could try to inflate it. You blow [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7696.96s)]
*  it up. And naturally, as you fill it with air, the wrinkles will sort of smooth out and it will turn [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7700.400000000001s)]
*  into a nice round sphere. Unless, of course, it was a torus or something in which case it would [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7706.72s)]
*  get stuck at some point. Like if you inflate a torus, there would be a point in the middle. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7711.84s)]
*  When the inner ring shrinks to zero, you get a singularity and you can't blow up any further. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7715.76s)]
*  You can't flow any further. So he created this flow which is now called Ricci flow, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7720.400000000001s)]
*  which is a way of taking an arbitrary surface or space and smoothing it out to make it rounder and [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7724.56s)]
*  rounder to make it look like a sphere. And he wanted to show that either this process would [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7729.280000000001s)]
*  give you a sphere or it would create a singularity. I very much like how PDEs either have global [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7734.96s)]
*  regularity or finite time blow up. Basically, it's almost exactly the same thing. It's all [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7740.16s)]
*  connected. And he showed that for two dimensions, two dimensional surfaces, if you start to simply [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7744.64s)]
*  connect, no singularity is ever formed. You never ran into trouble and you could flow and it will [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7751.6s)]
*  give you a sphere. And so he got a new proof of the two dimensional result. But by the way, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7756.72s)]
*  that's a beautiful explanation of Ricci flow and its application in this context. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7760.88s)]
*  How difficult is the mathematics here for the 2D case? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7764.4s)]
*  Yeah, these are quite sophisticated equations on par with the Einstein equations. Slightly simpler, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7767.839999999999s)]
*  but they were considered hard nonlinear equations to solve. And there's lots of special tricks in [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7776.0s)]
*  2D that helped. But in 3D, the problem was that this equation was actually super critical. It's [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7780.719999999999s)]
*  the same problem as Navier-Stokes. As you blow up, maybe the curvature could get concentrated in [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7787.04s)]
*  finer and smaller regions. And it looked more and more nonlinear and things just looked worse [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7791.68s)]
*  and worse. And there could be all kinds of singularities that showed up. There's these [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7797.4400000000005s)]
*  things called neck pinches where the surface behaves like a barbell and it pinches at a point. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7804.4800000000005s)]
*  Some singularities are simple enough that you can see what to do next. You just make a snip [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7812.8s)]
*  and then you can turn one surface into two and e-bolt them separately. But the prospect that's [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7815.76s)]
*  really nasty, like not that singularities showed up that you couldn't see how to resolve in any way, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7821.599999999999s)]
*  that you couldn't do any surgery to. So you need to classify all the singularities, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7828.4s)]
*  like what are all the possible ways that things can go wrong. So what Perlman did was first of [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7833.2s)]
*  all, he turned the problem from a super critical problem to a critical problem. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7838.799999999999s)]
*  I said before about how the invention of energy, the Hamiltonian, really clarified [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7843.44s)]
*  Newtonian mechanics. So he introduced something which is now called Perlman's reduced volume and [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7848.72s)]
*  Perlman's entropy. He introduced new quantities, kind of like energy, that looked the same at every [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7854.56s)]
*  single scale and turned the problem into a critical one where the nonlinearities actually [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7859.76s)]
*  suddenly looked a lot less scary than they did before. And then he had to solve, he still had to [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7863.92s)]
*  analyze the singularities of this critical problem. And that itself was a problem similar to this [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7868.8s)]
*  wave mapping I worked on actually. So on the level of difficulty of that, so he managed to classify [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7874.0s)]
*  all the singularities of this problem and show how to apply surgery to each of these and through [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7879.36s)]
*  that was able to resolve the Poincare Conjecture. So quite, like a lot of really ambitious steps [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7883.92s)]
*  and like nothing that a large language model today, for example, could. I mean, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7890.96s)]
*  at best I could imagine a model proposing this idea as one of hundreds of different things to try. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7895.679999999999s)]
*  But the other 99 would be complete dead ends, but you'd only find out after months of work. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7902.4800000000005s)]
*  He must have had some sense that this was the right track to pursue because [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7907.360000000001s)]
*  it takes years to get from A to B. So you've done, like you said, actually, you see even strictly [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7912.08s)]
*  mathematically, but more broadly in terms of the process, you've done similarly difficult [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7916.88s)]
*  things. What can you infer from the process he was going through because he was doing it alone? [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7925.84s)]
*  What are some low points in a process like that? When you start to like, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7930.8s)]
*  you've mentioned hard shit like AI doesn't know when it's failing. What happens to you, [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7934.24s)]
*  you're sitting in your office when you realize the thing you did for the last few days, maybe weeks, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7940.32s)]
*  is a failure? Well, for me, I switched to a different problem. So I'm a fox, I'm not a hedgehog. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7946.72s)]
*  But you will generally, that is a break that you can take is to step away and look at a different [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7953.28s)]
*  problem. You can modify the problem too. I mean, you can ask them if there's a specific thing that's [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7957.36s)]
*  blocking you, that some bad case keeps showing up for which your tool doesn't work. You can just [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7964.0s)]
*  assume by fiat this bad case doesn't occur. So you do some magical thinking, but strategically, [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7970.88s)]
*  okay, for the point to see if the rest of the argument goes through. If there's multiple [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7978.719999999999s)]
*  problems with your approach, then maybe you just give up. But if this is the only problem, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7982.72s)]
*  then everything else checks out, then it's still worth fighting. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7988.240000000001s)]
*  So yeah, you have to do some forward reconnaissance sometimes. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7992.8s)]
*  And that is sometimes productive to assume like, okay, we'll figure it out. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=7997.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Sometimes actually it's even productive to make mistakes. So one of the, I mean, there's [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8001.6s)]
*  a project which actually we won some prizes for, actually, before other people. We worked on this [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8008.64s)]
*  PDE problem. Again, actually this blow off regularity type problem. And it was considered very hard. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8015.280000000001s)]
*  Jean Bourguin, who was another fields specialist who worked on a special case of this, but he [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8021.6s)]
*  could not solve the general case. And we worked on this problem for two months. And we thought we [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8026.160000000001s)]
*  solved it. We had this cute argument that everything fit and we were excited. We were [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8031.360000000001s)]
*  planning celebration to get together and have champagne or something. And we started writing [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8036.4s)]
*  it up. And one of us, not me, but another co-author said, oh, in this lemma here, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8042.24s)]
*  we have to estimate these 13 terms that show up in this expansion. And we estimate 12 of them, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8049.839999999999s)]
*  but in our notes, I can't find the estimation of the 13th. Can someone supply that? And I said, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8054.32s)]
*  sure, I'll look at this. And actually, yeah, we didn't cover that. We completely omitted this term. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8058.96s)]
*  And this turned out to be worse than the other 12 terms put together. In fact, we could not estimate [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8063.2s)]
*  this term. And we tried for a few more months and all different permutations. And there was always [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8067.04s)]
*  this one term that we could not control. And so this was very frustrating. But because we had [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8072.08s)]
*  already invested months and months of effort into this already, we stuck at this. We tried increasingly [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8080.72s)]
*  desperate things and crazy things. And after two years, we found an approach that was somewhat [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8086.16s)]
*  different, quite a bit, from our initial strategy, which didn't generate these problematic terms [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8091.36s)]
*  and actually solve the problem. So we solved the problem after two years. But if we hadn't had that [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8097.44s)]
*  initial full storm of nearly solving the problem, we would have given up by month two or something [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8102.5599999999995s)]
*  and worked on an easier problem. If we had known it would take two years, I'm not sure we would have [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8107.839999999999s)]
*  started the project. Sometimes actually having the incorrect – it's like Columbus traveling in the [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8113.5199999999995s)]
*  new world, an incorrect version of the measurement of the size of the Earth. He thought he was going [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8119.12s)]
*  to find a new trade route to India. Or at least that was how he sold it in his prospectus. I mean, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8124.5599999999995s)]
*  it could be that he secretly knew. But just on the psychological element, do you have emotional or [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8129.68s)]
*  self-doubt that just overwhelms you most like that? Because this stuff, it feels like math is so [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8139.28s)]
*  engrossing that it can break you. When you invest so much yourself in the problem and then it turns [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8146.56s)]
*  out wrong, you could start to – similar way chess has broken some people. Yeah. I think different [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8153.76s)]
*  mathematicians have different levels of emotional investment in what they do. I mean, I think for [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8162.080000000001s)]
*  some people it's as a job. You have a problem and if it doesn't work out, you go on the next one. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8166.240000000001s)]
*  And yeah, so the fact that you can always move on to another problem, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8171.12s)]
*  it reduces the emotional connection. I mean, there are certain problems that are what I call [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8177.12s)]
*  mathematical diseases where we just latch onto that one problem and they spend years and years [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8183.92s)]
*  thinking about nothing but that one problem. And maybe their career suffers and so forth. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8189.84s)]
*  How could this big win – once I finish this problem, I will make up for all the years of [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8195.679999999998s)]
*  lost opportunity. I mean, occasionally it works. But I really don't recommend it [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8203.759999999998s)]
*  for people without the right fortitude. Yeah. So I've never been super invested in any one problem. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8212.24s)]
*  One thing that helps is that we don't need to call our problems in advance. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8219.759999999998s)]
*  Well, when we do grant proposals, we say we will study this set of problems. But even though we [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8223.359999999999s)]
*  don't promise definitely by five years, we supply a proof of all these things. You promise to make [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8229.84s)]
*  some progress or discover some interesting phenomena. And maybe you don't solve the problem, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8236.32s)]
*  but you find some related problem that you can say something new about. And that's a much more [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8240.88s)]
*  feasible task. But I'm sure for you, there's problems like this. You have made so much progress [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8245.68s)]
*  towards the hardest problems in the history of mathematics. So is there a problem that just haunts [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8254.4s)]
*  you? It sits there in the dark corners, twin prime conjecture, Riemann hypothesis, global conjecture. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8261.76s)]
*  Twin prime – again, so I mean, the problems like the Riemann hypothesis, those are so far out of [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8268.32s)]
*  reach. You think so? Yeah. There's no even viable strategy. Even if I activate all the cheats that I [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8273.76s)]
*  know of in this problem, there's still no way to get me to be. I think it needs a breakthrough in [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8280.72s)]
*  another area of mathematics to happen first. And for someone to recognize that, that would be a [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8290.960000000001s)]
*  useful thing to transport into this problem. So we should maybe step back for a little bit and [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8295.6s)]
*  just talk about prime numbers. Okay. So they're often referred to as the atoms of mathematics. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8301.36s)]
*  Can you just speak to the structure that these atoms provide? So the natural numbers have two [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8306.480000000001s)]
*  basic operations, attention and addition and multiplication. So if you want to generate the [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8312.560000000001s)]
*  natural numbers, you can do one or two things. You can start with one and add one to itself over and [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8317.36s)]
*  over again, and that generates the natural numbers. So additively, they're very easy to generate, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8321.2s)]
*  one, two, three, four, five. Or you can take the prime number. If you want to generate [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8324.560000000001s)]
*  it moduligatively, you can take all the prime numbers, two, three, five, seven, and multiply [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8328.08s)]
*  them all together. And together, that gives you all the natural numbers, except maybe for one. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8331.28s)]
*  So there are these two separate ways of thinking about the natural numbers from an additive point [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8337.36s)]
*  of view and a more moduligative point of view. And separately, they're not so bad. So any question [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8341.2s)]
*  about that natural number that only involves addition is relatively easy to solve. And any [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8347.84s)]
*  question that only involves multiplication is relatively easy to solve. But what has been [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8351.92s)]
*  frustrating is that you combine the two together, and suddenly you get an extremely rich – I mean, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8356.56s)]
*  we know that there are statements in number theory that are actually as undecidable. There [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8362.4s)]
*  are certain polynomials in some number of variables, and that's a solution in the natural numbers. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8366.0s)]
*  And the answer depends on an undecidable statement, like whether the axioms of mathematics [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8370.0s)]
*  are consistent or not. But yeah, but even the simplest problems that combine something [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8375.76s)]
*  moduligative such as the primes with something additive such as shifting by two. Separately, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8383.6s)]
*  we understand both of them well, but if you ask when you shift the prime by two, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8388.56s)]
*  how often can you get another prime? It's been amazingly hard to relate the two. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8393.6s)]
*  And we should say that the twin prime conjecture is just that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8399.12s)]
*  It pauses that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by two. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8403.2s)]
*  Now, the interesting thing is that you have been very successful at pushing forward the field [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8407.679999999998s)]
*  in answering these complicated questions of this variety. Like you mentioned the Green Tile Theorem, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8414.16s)]
*  it proves that prime numbers contain arithmetic progressions of any length, [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8420.96s)]
*  which is mind-blowing that you could prove something like that. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8425.679999999998s)]
*  Right. Yeah, so what we've realized because of this type of research is that different patterns [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8427.679999999998s)]
*  have different levels of indestructibility. So what makes the twin prime problem hard is that [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8434.08s)]
*  if you take all the primes in the world, you know, three, five, seven, 11, so forth, there are some [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8441.44s)]
*  twins in there, 11 and 13 is a twin prime, pair of twin primes and so forth. But you could easily, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8445.92s)]
*  if you wanted to, redact the primes to get rid of these twins. The twins, they show up and there [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8451.44s)]
*  are infinitely many of them, but they're actually recently sparse. Initially there's quite a few, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8459.84s)]
*  but once you've got the millions, the trillions, they become rarer and rarer. And you could actually [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8464.56s)]
*  just, if someone was given access to the database of primes, you just edit out a few primes here [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8469.36s)]
*  and there, they could make the twin prime conjecture false by just removing like 0.01% of the primes or [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8474.72s)]
*  something. Just well chosen to do this. And so you could present a censored database of the primes, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8479.52s)]
*  which passes all of the statistical tests of the primes. It obeys things like the polynomial [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8488.96s)]
*  theorem and other texts about the primes, but doesn't contain any twin primes anymore. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8494.08s)]
*  And this is a real obstacle for the twin prime conjecture. It means that any proof strategy to [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8498.8s)]
*  actually find twin primes in the actual primes must fail when applied to these slightly edited [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8504.88s)]
*  primes. And so it must be some very subtle, delicate feature of the primes that you can't [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8511.119999999999s)]
*  just get from like aggregate statistical analysis. Okay. So that's out. Yeah. On the other hand, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8517.84s)]
*  arithmetic progressions has turned out to be much more robust. You can take the primes and you can [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8524.24s)]
*  eliminate 99% of the primes actually. And you can take any 90% that you want. And it turns out, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8528.880000000001s)]
*  another thing we proved is that you still get arithmetic progressions. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8535.28s)]
*  Arithmetic progressions are like cockroaches. Of arbitrary length. Yes. That's crazy. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8538.64s)]
*  So for people who don't know arithmetic progressions is [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8545.92s)]
*  a sequence of numbers that differ by some fixed amount. Yeah. But it's again, like it's an [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8549.68s)]
*  infinite monkey type phenomenon. For any fixed length of your set, you don't get arbitrary [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8554.160000000002s)]
*  length progressions. You only get quite short progressions. But you're saying twin prime is [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8558.480000000001s)]
*  not an infinite monkey phenomena. I mean, it's a very subtle one. It's still an infinite monkey [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8561.76s)]
*  phenomena. Right. Yeah. If the primes were really genuinely random, if the primes were generated by [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8567.76s)]
*  monkeys, then yes, in fact, the infinite monkey theorem would- Oh, but you're saying that twin [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8572.56s)]
*  prime, you can't use the same tools. It doesn't appear random almost. Well, we don't know. Yeah. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8578.32s)]
*  We believe the primes behave like a random set. And so the reason why we care about the [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8587.279999999999s)]
*  twin prime conjecture is a test case for whether we can genuinely confidently say with zero percent [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8591.519999999999s)]
*  chance of error that the primes behave like a random set. Okay. Random versions of the primes [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8597.76s)]
*  we know contain twins, at least 100% probably, or probably tending to 100% as you go out further [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8603.28s)]
*  and further. Yeah. So the primes we believe that they're random. The reason why arithmetic [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8610.16s)]
*  progressions are indestructible is that regardless of whether it looks random or looks structured, [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8616.48s)]
*  like periodic, in both cases, the arithmetic progressions appear, but for different reasons. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8622.48s)]
*  And this is basically all the ways in which the theorems- There are many proofs of these [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8628.48s)]
*  sort of arithmetic progression of theorems, and they're all proven by some sort of dichotomy where [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8632.48s)]
*  your set is either structured or random, and in both cases, you can say something, and then you [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8636.4s)]
*  put the two together. But in twin primes, if the primes are random, then you're happy, you win. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8640.4s)]
*  But if your primes are structured, they can be structured in a specific way that eliminates the [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8646.88s)]
*  twins. And we can't rule out that one conspiracy. And yet you were able to make, as I understand, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8652.24s)]
*  progress on the K-tupo version. Right. Yeah. So the one funny thing about conspiracies is that any [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8659.039999999999s)]
*  one conspiracy theory is really hard to disprove. That if you believe the water is run by lizards, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8664.48s)]
*  you say, here's some evidence that it's not run by lizards. Well, that episode was planted by the [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8669.92s)]
*  lizards. Yeah. You may have encountered this kind of phenomena. So there's almost no way [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8674.08s)]
*  to definitively rule out a conspiracy. And the same is true in mathematics. A conspiracy is [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8682.16s)]
*  solely devoted to eliminating twin primes. You have to also infiltrate other areas of mathematics, [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8688.4s)]
*  too. But it could be made consistent, at least as far as we know. But there's a weird phenomenon [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8693.84s)]
*  that you can make one conspiracy rule out other conspiracies. So if the water is run by lizards, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8699.44s)]
*  it can also be run by aliens. So one unreasonable thing is hard to disprove. But more than one, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8706.48s)]
*  there are tools. So for example, we know there's infinitely many primes that are no two. So the [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8713.52s)]
*  infinitely many pairs of primes, which differ by at most 246 actually is the code. So there's a bound. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8720.96s)]
*  Yes. Right. So there's twin primes, there's things called cousin primes that differ by four. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8727.84s)]
*  This thing called sexy primes that differ by six. What are sexy primes? Primes that differ by six. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8734.56s)]
*  The name is much less exciting than the name suggests. So you can make a conspiracy rule out [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8739.84s)]
*  one of these. But once you have like 50 of them, it turns out that you can't rule out all of them [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8746.8s)]
*  at once. It requires too much energy somehow in this conspiracy space. How do you do the bound [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8750.64s)]
*  part? How do you develop a bound for the different between the primes that there's an infinite number [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8756.960000000001s)]
*  of? So it's ultimately based on what's called the pigeonhole principle. So the pigeonhole principle [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8763.36s)]
*  is the statement that if you have a number of pigeons and they all have to go into pigeonholes [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8768.720000000001s)]
*  and you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, then one of the pigeonholes has to have at least two [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8772.400000000001s)]
*  pigeons in. So there has to be two pigeons that are close together. So for instance, if you have [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8776.16s)]
*  100 numbers and they all range from one to a thousand, two of them have to be at most 10 [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8780.720000000001s)]
*  apart because you can divide up the numbers from one to 100 into 100 pigeonholes. Let's say if you [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8785.36s)]
*  have 101 numbers, then two of them have to be distance less than 10 apart because two of them [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8791.68s)]
*  have to belong to the same pigeonhole. So it's a basic principle in mathematics. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8796.880000000001s)]
*  So it doesn't quite work with the primes regularly because the primes get sparser and sparser [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8805.12s)]
*  as you go out. That few and fewer numbers are prime. But it turns out that there's a way to [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8809.12s)]
*  assign weights to numbers. So there are numbers that are kind of almost prime, but they're not [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8814.560000000001s)]
*  they don't have no factors at all other than themselves and one, but they have very few [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8821.119999999999s)]
*  factors. And it turns out that we understand almost primes a lot better than primes. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8825.199999999999s)]
*  And so for example, it was known for a long time that they were twin almost primes. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8831.199999999999s)]
*  This has been worked out. So almost primes are things we kind of understand. So you can actually [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8835.039999999999s)]
*  restrict attention to a suitable set of almost primes. And whereas the primes are very sparse [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8840.16s)]
*  overall, relative to the almost primes, they're actually much less sparse. You can set up a set [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8847.36s)]
*  of almost primes where the primes have density like say 1%. And that gives you a shot at proving [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8852.880000000001s)]
*  by applying some sort of pigeonhole principle that there's pairs of primes that are just only 100 [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8858.480000000001s)]
*  apart. But in order to prove the Trin primes conjecture, you need to get the density of [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8862.400000000001s)]
*  primes that are almost up to 50%. Once you get up to 50%, you will get Trin primes. But unfortunately [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8866.400000000001s)]
*  there are barriers. We know that no matter what kind of good set of almost primes you pick, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8873.36s)]
*  the density of primes can never get above 50%. It's called the parity barrier. And I would love [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8879.2s)]
*  to find, so one of my long-term dreams is to find a way to breach that barrier. Because it would open [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8884.400000000001s)]
*  up not only the Trin primes conjecture, the go back conjecture and many other problems in number [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8888.640000000001s)]
*  theory are currently blocked because our current techniques would require going beyond this [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8892.720000000001s)]
*  theoretical parity barrier. It's like pulling fast in the speed of light. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8899.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So we should say a Trin prime conjecture, one of the biggest problems in the history of [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8904.08s)]
*  mathematics, go back conjecture also. They feel like next door neighbors. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8907.92s)]
*  Is there been days when you felt you saw the path? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8913.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you try something and it works super well. You again, [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8917.6s)]
*  get a sense of mathematical smell. We talked about earlier. You learn from experience when [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8924.88s)]
*  things are going too well. Because there are certain difficulties that you sort of have to [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8929.599999999999s)]
*  encounter. I think the way a colleague might put it is that, if you are on the streets of New York [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8934.56s)]
*  and you put on a blindfold and you put on a car and after some hours, the blindfold is off and [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8942.88s)]
*  you're in Beijing. That was too easy somehow. There was no ocean being crossed. Even if you [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8948.32s)]
*  don't know exactly what was done, you're suspecting that something wasn't right. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8955.44s)]
*  But is that still in the back of your head? Do you return to the prime numbers every once [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8961.68s)]
*  in a while at the sea? Yeah. When I have nothing better to do, [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8968.72s)]
*  which is less than that time, which is busy with so many things these days. But yeah, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8971.039999999999s)]
*  when I have free time and I'm too frustrated to work on my real research projects and I also [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8975.6s)]
*  don't want to do my administrative support, I don't want to do some errands for my family. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8981.84s)]
*  I can play with these things for fun. Usually you get nowhere. You have to learn to just say, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8986.640000000001s)]
*  okay, fine. Once again, nothing happened. I will move on. Very occasionally, one of these problems [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8992.640000000001s)]
*  I actually solved. Sometimes as you say, you think you solved it and then you forward for [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=8998.4s)]
*  maybe 15 minutes and then you think I should check this because this is too easy, too good to be true [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9005.119999999999s)]
*  and usually is. What's your gut say about when these problems will be solved? When prime and go [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9010.0s)]
*  back? I think we'll keep getting more partial results. It does need at least one. This parity [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9016.32s)]
*  barrier is the biggest remaining obstacle. There are simpler versions of conjecture where we are [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9024.8s)]
*  getting really close. I think in 10 years, we will have many more much closer results. We may not [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9030.56s)]
*  have the whole thing. So, Tune Times is somewhat close. Riemann hypothesis, it has happened by [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9038.96s)]
*  accident. So, the Riemann hypothesis is a more general conjecture about the distribution of [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9046.08s)]
*  prime numbers. Right. It's viewed multiplicatively. For questions only involving multiplication, [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9052.4s)]
*  no addition. The primes really do behave as randomly as you could hope. There's a phenomenon [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9057.68s)]
*  in probability called square root cancellation. If you want to poll, say America up on some issue [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9063.52s)]
*  and you ask one or two voters, you may have sampled a bad sample and then you get a really [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9071.199999999999s)]
*  imprecise measurement of the full average. But if you sample more and more people, the accuracy [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9076.64s)]
*  gets better and better. It actually improves the square root of the number of people you sample. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9082.56s)]
*  If you sample a thousand people, you can get a two, three percent margin of error. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9089.279999999999s)]
*  In the same sense, if you measure the primes in a certain multiplicative sense, there's a certain [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9093.76s)]
*  type of statistic you can measure. It's called the Riemann's data function. It fluctuates up and down. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9097.84s)]
*  But in some sense, as you keep averaging more and more, the fluctuations should go down as if they [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9102.48s)]
*  were random. There's a very precise way to quantify that. The Riemann hypothesis is a very elegant [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9108.0s)]
*  way that captures this. But as with many others in mathematics, we have very few tools to show [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9113.68s)]
*  that something really genuinely behaves really random. This is not just a little bit random, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9119.76s)]
*  but it's asking that it behaves as random as an actually random set, this square root cancellation. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9125.2s)]
*  We know because of things related to the parity problem, most of us, [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9132.0s)]
*  usual techniques cannot hope to settle this question. The proof has to come out of left field. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9136.32s)]
*  No one has any serious proposal. There's various ways to sort of, as I said, [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9147.36s)]
*  you can modify the primes a little bit and you can destroy the Riemann hypothesis. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9152.56s)]
*  It has to be very delicate. You can't apply something that has huge margins of error. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9157.68s)]
*  It has to just barely work. There's all these pitfalls that you have to dodge very adeptly. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9161.92s)]
*  Prime numbers are just fascinating. What to you is most mysterious about the prime numbers? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9170.56s)]
*  That's a good question. Conjecturally, we have a good model of them. As I said, [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9179.92s)]
*  they have certain patterns. The primes are usually odd, for instance. But apart from these [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9185.12s)]
*  obvious patterns, they behave very randomly. There's something called the Cramer random [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9189.12s)]
*  model of the primes. After a certain point, primes just behave like a random set. There's [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9194.640000000001s)]
*  various slight modifications to this model, but this has been a very good model. It matches the [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9199.76s)]
*  numerics. It tells us what to predict. I can tell you with complete certainty that the Turing-Pierre [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9204.240000000002s)]
*  conjecture is true. The random model gives overwhelming odds that it's true. I just can't [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9208.480000000001s)]
*  prove it. Most of our mathematics is optimized for solving things with patterns in them. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9212.720000000001s)]
*  And the primes have this anti-pattern, as do almost everything, really. But we can't prove that. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9219.84s)]
*  I guess it's not mysterious that the primes are being random. It's kind of random because [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9228.08s)]
*  there's no reason for them to have any kind of secret pattern. But what is mysterious is [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9230.800000000001s)]
*  what is the mechanism that really forces the randomness to happen? This is just absent. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9238.720000000001s)]
*  Another incredibly surprisingly difficult problem is the Kolatz conjecture. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9244.72s)]
*  Oh, yes. Simple to state, beautiful to visualize in its simplicity, and yet extremely [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9249.6s)]
*  difficult to solve. And yet you have been able to make progress. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9257.6s)]
*  Paul Erdard said about the Kolatz conjecture that mathematics may not be ready for such problems. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9261.92s)]
*  Others have stated that it is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach. This [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9268.16s)]
*  is in 2010. Out of reach of present-day mathematics, and yet you have made some [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9273.28s)]
*  progress. Why is it so difficult to make? Can you actually even explain what it is? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9277.52s)]
*  So it's a problem that you can explain. It helps with some visual aids. So you take any natural [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9282.400000000001s)]
*  number, like say 13, and you apply the following procedure to it. So if it's even, you divide it [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9290.800000000001s)]
*  by 2. And if it's odd, you multiply it by 3 and add 1. So even numbers get smaller, odd numbers [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9295.92s)]
*  get bigger. So 13 will become 40, because 13 times 3 is 39, add 1 to get 40. So it's a simple [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9301.36s)]
*  process. For odd numbers and even numbers, they're both very easy operations. And then you put it [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9307.76s)]
*  together, it's still reasonably simple. But then you ask what happens when you iterate it. You [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9311.76s)]
*  take the output that you just got and feed it back in. So 13 becomes 40. 40 is now even, divide [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9317.36s)]
*  by 2 is 20. 20 is still even, divide by 2 is 10. 5, and then 5 times 3 plus 1 is 16. And then 8, 4, 2, 1. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9322.24s)]
*  So and then from 1 it goes 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1. It cycles forever. So this sequence I just described, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9330.4s)]
*  13, 40, 20, 10, so both of these are also called hailstorm sequences, because there's an oversimplified [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9337.2s)]
*  model of hailstorm formation, which is not actually quite correct, but it's somehow taught to [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9342.8s)]
*  high school students as a first-box summation, is that a little nugget of ice gets an ice crystal [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9347.76s)]
*  that forms and clouded. It goes up and down because of the wind. And sometimes when it's cold, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9354.24s)]
*  it requires a bit more mass and maybe it melts a little bit. And this process of going up and down [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9360.0s)]
*  creates this sort of partially melted ice, which eventually becomes this hailstorm. And eventually [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9365.04s)]
*  it falls down to the earth. So the conjecture is that no matter how high you start up, like you take [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9368.800000000001s)]
*  a number which is in the millions or billions, you have this process that goes up if you're odd [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9374.0s)]
*  and down if you're even, it eventually goes down to earth all the time. No matter where you start [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9378.800000000001s)]
*  with this very simple algorithm, you end up at one and you might climb for a while. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9384.48s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So if you plot these sequences, they look like Brownian motion. They look like [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9389.119999999999s)]
*  the stock market. They just go up and down in a seemingly random pattern. And in fact, usually [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9394.64s)]
*  that's what happens, that if you plug in a random number, you can actually prove at least initially [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9400.32s)]
*  that it would look like a random walk. And it's actually a random walk with a downward drift. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9404.24s)]
*  It's like if you're always gambling on a roulette at the casino with odds slightly weighted against [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9410.56s)]
*  you. So sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but over in the long run, you lose a bit more than you [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9416.08s)]
*  win. And so normally your wallet will hit, will go to zero if you just keep playing over and over [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9421.12s)]
*  again. So statistically it makes sense. Yes. So the result that I proved roughly speaking [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9426.4s)]
*  asserts that statistically like 19% of all inputs would drift down to maybe not all the way to one, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9432.96s)]
*  but to be much, much smaller than what you started. So it's like if I told you that if you go to a [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9440.96s)]
*  casino, most of the time you will end up, if you keep playing for long enough, you end up with a [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9446.16s)]
*  smaller amount in your wallet than when you started. That's kind of like the result that I [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9450.0s)]
*  proved. So why is that result? Like, can you continue down that thread to prove the full [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9454.48s)]
*  conjecture? Well, the problem is that I used arguments from probability theory. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9461.84s)]
*  And this always is exceptional event. So in probability, we have this low large numbers, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9467.36s)]
*  which tells you things like if you play a casino with a game at a casino with a losing expectation, [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9473.2s)]
*  over time you are guaranteed, well, almost surely with probability as close to 100% as you wish, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9479.6s)]
*  you're guaranteed to lose money. But there's always this exceptional outlier. Like it is [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9485.36s)]
*  mathematically possible that even in the game is the odds and not in your favor, you could just [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9490.0s)]
*  keep winning slightly more often than you lose. Very much like how in Navier-Stokes, it could be [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9494.72s)]
*  most of the time your waves can disperse. There could be just one outlier choice of initial [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9500.16s)]
*  conditions that would lead you to blow up. And there could be one outlier choice of [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9506.0s)]
*  special number that you stick in that shoots off infinity while all other numbers crash to earth, [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9513.04s)]
*  crash to one. In fact, there's some mathematicians, Alex Kontorovich, who proposed that [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9517.92s)]
*  actually these collapse iterations are like these similar automata. If you look at what [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9526.880000000001s)]
*  they happen in binary, they do actually look a little bit like these game of life type patterns. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9534.16s)]
*  And in an analogy to how the game of life can create these massive self-replicating objects and [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9539.44s)]
*  so forth, possibly you could create some sort of heavier than air flying machine, [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9544.4s)]
*  a number which is actually encoding this machine, whose job it is to encode is to create a version [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9548.64s)]
*  of itself which is larger. Heavier than air machine, encoded in a number that flies forever. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9555.359999999999s)]
*  So Conway in fact worked on this problem as well. So Conway, so similar in fact, [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9562.8s)]
*  that was one of my inspirations for the Navier-Stokes project. Conway studied generalizations [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9568.96s)]
*  of the collapse problem where instead of multiplying by three and adding one or dividing by two, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9574.16s)]
*  you have a more complicated branching rules. But instead of having two cases, maybe you have 17 [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9578.4s)]
*  cases and then you go up and down. And he showed that once your iteration gets complicated enough, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9582.64s)]
*  you can actually encode Turing machines and you can actually make these problems undecidable and [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9588.08s)]
*  do things like this. In fact, he invented a programming language for these kind of fractional [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9592.16s)]
*  linear transformations. He showed a fractrat as a play on a fulltrat. And he showed that you [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9597.84s)]
*  can program if it was Turing complete, you could make a program that if your number you insert in [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9604.32s)]
*  was encoded as a prime, it would sink to zero, it would go down, otherwise it would go up [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9611.52s)]
*  and things like that. So the general class of problems is really as complicated as all the [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9615.84s)]
*  mathematics. Some of the mystery of the cellular automata that we talked about, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9622.480000000001s)]
*  having a mathematical framework to say anything about cellular automata, maybe the same kind of [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9627.2s)]
*  framework is required. Yeah. Yeah. If you want to do it, not statistically, but you really want [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9632.72s)]
*  100% of all inputs to follow the earth. Yeah. So what might be feasible is just 99%, you know, [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9638.72s)]
*  go to one, but like everything, you know, that looks hard. What would you say is out of these [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9646.0s)]
*  within reach, famous problems is the hardest problem we have today. Is there a Riemann hypothesis? [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9652.96s)]
*  We want to stop there. P equals NP is a good one because like that's a meta problem. Like if you [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9659.679999999998s)]
*  solve that in the positive sense that you can find a P equals NP algorithm, potentially this solves [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9666.24s)]
*  a lot of other problems as well. And we should mention some of the conjectures we've been talking [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9672.64s)]
*  about. You know, a lot of stuff is built on top of them though. There's ripple effects, P equals NP [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9676.56s)]
*  has more ripple effects than basically any other. Right. If the Riemann hypothesis is disproven, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9681.599999999999s)]
*  that'd be a big mental shock to number theorists, but it would have follow on effects for [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9686.88s)]
*  cryptography because a lot of cryptography uses number theory, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9694.96s)]
*  uses number theory constructions involving primes and so forth. And it relies very much on the [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9700.48s)]
*  intuition that number of those are built over many, many years of what operations involving [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9705.199999999999s)]
*  primes behave randomly and what ones don't. And in particular encryption methods are designed [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9710.16s)]
*  to turn text with information on it into text, which is indistinguishable from random noise. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9716.24s)]
*  And hence we believe to be almost impossible to crack at least mathematically. But if something [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9724.32s)]
*  has caught our beliefs as Riemann hypothesis is wrong, it means that there are actual patterns [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9733.039999999999s)]
*  of the primes that we're not aware of. And if there's one, there's probably going to be more. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9739.2s)]
*  And suddenly a lot of our crypto systems are in doubt. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9743.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But then how do you then say stuff about the primes? [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9747.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9753.519999999999s)]
*  That you're going towards the conjecture again, because you want it to be random, right? [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9753.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9761.599999999999s)]
*  You want it to be random. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9761.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So more broadly, I'm just looking for more tools, more ways to show that things are random. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9762.8s)]
*  How do you prove a conspiracy doesn't happen? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9767.84s)]
*  Is there any chance to you that P equals NP? Can you imagine a possible universe? [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9770.48s)]
*  It is possible. I mean, there's various scenarios. I mean, there's one where it is technically [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9777.28s)]
*  possible, but in fact, it's never actually implementable. The evidence is sort of slightly [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9783.28s)]
*  pushing in favor of no, that we'd probably be is not a good NP. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9787.76s)]
*  I mean, it seems like it's one of those cases similar to Riemann hypothesis. I think the [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9791.12s)]
*  evidence is leaning pretty heavily on the no. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9796.0s)]
*  Certainly more on the no than on the yes. The funny thing about P equals NP is that [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9799.92s)]
*  we have also a lot more obstructions than we do for almost any other problem. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9803.2s)]
*  So while there's evidence, we also have a lot of results ruling out many, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9807.28s)]
*  many types of approaches to the problem. This is the one thing that the computer [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9811.84s)]
*  scientists have actually been very good at. It's actually saying that certain approaches cannot [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9815.84s)]
*  work. No-go theorems. It could be undecidable. We don't know. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9819.76s)]
*  There's a funny story I read that when you won the Fields Medal, somebody from the internet wrote you [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9823.92s)]
*  and asked, you know, what are you going to do now that you've won this [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9830.720000000001s)]
*  prestigious award? And then you just quickly, very humbly said that, you know, this shiny metal is [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9834.240000000002s)]
*  not going to solve any of the problems I'm currently working on. So I'm going to keep working on them. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9840.16s)]
*  It's just, first of all, it's funny to me that you would answer an email in that context. And [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9845.04s)]
*  second of all, it just shows your humility. But anyway, maybe you could speak to the Fields Medal, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9848.72s)]
*  but it's another way for me to ask about Gregorio Perlman. What do you think about [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9855.76s)]
*  him famously declining the Fields Medal and the Millennial Prize, which came with a $1 million [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9863.279999999999s)]
*  of prize money? He stated that I'm not interested in money or fame. The prize is completely [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9869.599999999999s)]
*  irrelevant for me. If the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9875.2s)]
*  Yeah. He's somewhat of an outlier, even among mathematicians who tend to have somewhat idealistic [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9880.320000000002s)]
*  views. I've never met him. I think I'll be interested in meeting one day, but I never had [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9887.36s)]
*  the chance. I know people who met him, but he's always had strong views about certain things. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9891.44s)]
*  I mean, it's not like he was completely isolated from the math community. I mean, he would give [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9896.0s)]
*  talks and write papers and so forth. But at some point, he just decided not to engage with the [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9900.0s)]
*  rest of the community. He was disillusioned or something. I don't know. And he decided to [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9904.8s)]
*  peace out and collect mushrooms in St. Petersburg or something. And that's fine. You can do that. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9913.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's another sort of flip side. I mean, a lot of problems that we solve, [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9920.56s)]
*  some of them do have practical application. That's great. But if you stop thinking about a problem, [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9925.439999999999s)]
*  he hasn't published since in this field, but that's fine. There's many, many other people [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9932.72s)]
*  who have done so as well. Yeah. So I guess one thing I didn't realize initially with the Fields [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9936.64s)]
*  Medal is that it sort of makes you part of the establishment. So most mathematicians, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9942.56s)]
*  just career mathematicians, you just focus on publishing your next paper, [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9950.56s)]
*  maybe getting one test to promote one rank and starting a few projects, maybe taking some [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9953.36s)]
*  students or something. Yeah. But then suddenly people want your opinion on things and you have [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9959.28s)]
*  to think a little bit about things that you might just so foolishly say because you know, [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9964.720000000001s)]
*  no one's going to listen to you. It's more important now. Is it constraining to you? Are [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9968.16s)]
*  you able to still have fun and be a rebel and try crazy stuff and play with ideas? I have a lot less [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9973.04s)]
*  free time than I had previously. I mean, mostly by choice. I mean, I can always see I have the [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9980.0s)]
*  option to sort of decline. So I'd claim a lot of things. I could decline even more or I could [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9986.48s)]
*  acquire a reputation being so unreliable that people don't even ask anymore. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9992.8s)]
*  I love the different algorithms here. This is great. It's always an option. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=9998.0s)]
*  But you know, there are things that I don't spend as much time as I do as a postdoc, [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10003.359999999999s)]
*  just working on one part of the time or fooling around. I still do that a little bit, [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10011.279999999999s)]
*  but yeah, as you're advancing your career, some of the more soft skills, so math somehow [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10016.32s)]
*  front loads all the technical skills to the early stages of your career. So yeah, so it's [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10021.28s)]
*  as a postdoc is publish or perish, you're incentivized to basically focus on proving [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10026.56s)]
*  very technical things. So prove yourself as well as proof of theorems. But then as you get more [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10032.16s)]
*  senior, you have to start mentoring and giving interviews and trying to shape direction of the [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10038.88s)]
*  field, both research wise and sometimes you have to do some administrative things. And it's kind of [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10046.88s)]
*  the right social contract because you need to work in the trenches to see what can help mathematicians. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10054.96s)]
*  – The other side of the establishment, sort of the really positive thing is that you get to be [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10059.759999999998s)]
*  a light that's an inspiration to a lot of young mathematicians and young people that are just [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10066.16s)]
*  interested in mathematics. It's like, yeah, it's just how the human mind works. This is where I [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10069.68s)]
*  would probably say that I like the Fields Medal, that it does inspire a lot of young people somehow. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10074.88s)]
*  I don't, this is just how human brains work. At the same time, I also want to give sort of respect [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10083.52s)]
*  to somebody like Gregorio Perlman, who is critical of awards in his mind. Those are his principles. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10088.64s)]
*  Any human that's able for their principles to do the thing that most humans would not be able to do. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10096.48s)]
*  It's beautiful to see. – Some recognition is necessary and important, but yeah, it's also [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10103.28s)]
*  important to not let these things take over your life and only be concerned about getting the next [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10110.24s)]
*  big award or whatever. Again, you see these people try to only solve really big math problems and not [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10115.92s)]
*  work on things that are less sexy, if you wish, but actually still interesting and instructive. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10123.44s)]
*  As you say, the way the human mind works, we understand things better when they're attached [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10131.6s)]
*  to humans. Also, if they're attached to a small number of humans, the way our human mind is wired, [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10136.480000000001s)]
*  we can comprehend the relationships between 10 or 20 people. Once you get to be like 100 people, [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10145.2s)]
*  there's a limit. I figured there's a name for it. Beyond which, it just becomes the other. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10152.32s)]
*  You have to simplify the whole mass of 9.9% of humanity becomes the other. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10159.36s)]
*  These models are incorrect and this causes all kinds of problems. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10165.76s)]
*  To humanize a subject, if you identify a small number of people, these are representative people [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10170.880000000001s)]
*  of the subject, role models, for example. That has some role, but it can also be, [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10176.56s)]
*  too much of it can be harmful because I'll be the first to say that my own career [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10185.68s)]
*  path is not that of a typical mathematician. I had a very accelerated education. I skipped a lot of [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10191.119999999999s)]
*  classes. I think I was very fortunate mentoring opportunities and I think I was at the right place [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10196.24s)]
*  at the right time. Just because someone doesn't have my trajectory doesn't mean that they can't [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10202.16s)]
*  be good mathematicians. They may be mathematicians in a very different style and we need people with [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10208.64s)]
*  a different style. Sometimes too much focus is given on the person who did the last step to complete [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10213.92s)]
*  a project in mathematics or elsewhere that's really taken centuries or decades with lots and [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10224.16s)]
*  lots of previous work. That's a story that's difficult to tell if you're not an expert. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10228.56s)]
*  It's easier to just say one person did this one thing. It makes for a much simpler history. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10235.439999999999s)]
*  I think on the whole it is a hugely positive thing to talk about Steve Jobs as a representative [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10240.48s)]
*  of Apple. I personally know and of course everybody knows the incredible design, [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10247.68s)]
*  the incredible engineering teams, just the individual humans on those teams. They're not [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10253.84s)]
*  a team. They're individual humans on a team and there's a lot of brilliance there. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10259.68s)]
*  But it's just a nice shorthand like a very like Pi. Steve Jobs. As a starting point, [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10264.08s)]
*  as a first approximation. And then read some biographies and then look into much deeper [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10271.68s)]
*  first approximation. That's right. You mentioned you were a person to Andrew Wiles at that time. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10276.0s)]
*  He's a professor there. It's a funny moment how history is just all interconnected. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10282.4s)]
*  At that time he announced that he proved the Fermat's Last Theorem. What did you think, [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10287.199999999999s)]
*  maybe looking back now with more context about that moment in math history? [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10291.44s)]
*  I was a graduate student at the time. I vaguely remember there was press attention and [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10297.84s)]
*  we all had pigeonholes in the same mail room. So we all took out mail and suddenly Andrew [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10303.199999999999s)]
*  Wiles' mailbox exploded to be overflowing. That's a good metric. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10309.6s)]
*  We all talked about it at tea and so forth. Most of us didn't understand the proof. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10316.720000000001s)]
*  We understand high level details. In fact, there's an ongoing project to formalize it in lean. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10322.800000000001s)]
*  Can we take that small tangent? How difficult is that? As I understand the proof for [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10329.36s)]
*  Fermat's Last Theorem has super complicated objects. It's really difficult to formalize, [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10337.04s)]
*  no? Yeah, I guess you're right. The objects that they use, you can define them. They've been [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10342.240000000002s)]
*  defined in lean. Just defining what they are can be done. That's really not trivial, but it's been [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10348.160000000002s)]
*  done. But there's a lot of really basic facts about these objects that have taken decades to [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10353.76s)]
*  prove and that they're in all these different math papers. Lots of these have to be formalized as [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10359.76s)]
*  well. Kevin Buzzard's goal, actually, he has a five-year grant to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10364.4s)]
*  He doesn't think he will be able to get all the way down to the basic axioms, but he wants to [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10373.68s)]
*  formalize it to the point where the only things that he needs to rely on as black boxes are things [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10378.48s)]
*  that were known by 1980 to number theorists at the time. Then some other person or some other [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10382.8s)]
*  work would have to be done to get from there. It's a different area of mathematics than the [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10390.0s)]
*  type of mathematics I'm used to. In analysis, which is my area, the objects we study are much [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10396.24s)]
*  closer to the ground. I study things like prime numbers and functions and things that are within [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10402.72s)]
*  scope of a high school math education to at least define. But then there's this very advanced [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10410.16s)]
*  algebraic side of number theory where people have been building structures upon structures for quite [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10417.76s)]
*  a while. It's a very sturdy structure. At the base, it's extremely well developed in the textbooks [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10421.6s)]
*  and so forth. But it does get to the point where if you haven't taken these years of study and you [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10430.08s)]
*  want to ask about what is going on at level six of this tower, you have to spend quite a bit of [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10437.04s)]
*  time before they can even get to the point where you can see something you recognize. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10442.64s)]
*  What inspires you about his journey that was similar as we talked about? Seven years, [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10447.039999999999s)]
*  mostly working in secret. Yeah, that is a romantic… It fits with the romantic image that people have of [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10453.199999999999s)]
*  mathematicians to the extent that they think of them at all as these eccentric wizards or something. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10462.88s)]
*  So that certainly kind of accentuated that perspective. It is a great achievement. His [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10469.679999999998s)]
*  style of solving problems is so different from my own, which is great. We need people like that. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10478.16s)]
*  Can you speak to it? In terms of you like the collaborative… [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10484.0s)]
*  I like moving on from a problem if it's giving too much difficulty. But you need the people who [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10489.439999999999s)]
*  have the tenacity and the fearlessness. I've collaborated with people like that where I want [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10496.16s)]
*  to give up because the first approach that we tried didn't work and the second one didn't approach. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10502.08s)]
*  They're convinced and they have the third, fourth, and the fifth of what works. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10506.64s)]
*  I have to use my words. Okay, I didn't think this was going to work, but yes, you were right all along. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10511.68s)]
*  We should say for people who don't know, not only are you known for the brilliance of your work, [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10516.8s)]
*  but the incredible productivity, just the number of papers, which are all [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10520.8s)]
*  of very high quality. So there's something to be said about being able to jump from topic to topic. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10524.88s)]
*  Yeah, it works for me. There are also people who are very productive and they focus [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10531.359999999999s)]
*  very deeply on it. I think everyone has to find their own workflow. One thing which is [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10535.6s)]
*  a shame in mathematics is that we have mathematics, there's sort of a one-size-fits-all [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10540.96s)]
*  approach to teaching mathematics. We have a certain curriculum and so forth. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10545.359999999999s)]
*  Maybe if you do math competitions or something, you get a slightly different experience. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10551.679999999998s)]
*  I think many people don't find their native math language until very late, or usually too late, [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10556.8s)]
*  so they stop doing mathematics and they have a bad experience with a teacher who's trying to [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10564.16s)]
*  teach them one way to do mathematics and they don't like it. My theory is that evolution has [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10569.039999999999s)]
*  not given us a math center of a brain directly. We have a vision center and a language center [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10576.32s)]
*  and some other centers which have evolution as a home, but we don't have an innate sense of [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10581.36s)]
*  mathematics. But our other centers are sophisticated enough that we can repurpose other areas of our [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10586.64s)]
*  brain to do mathematics. So some people have figured out how to use the visual center to do [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10597.44s)]
*  mathematics and so they think very visually when they do mathematics. Some people have repurposed [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10601.6s)]
*  their language center and they think very symbolically. Some people, if they are very [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10605.36s)]
*  competitive and they like gaming, there's this part of your brain that's very good at solving [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10611.92s)]
*  puzzles and games and that can be repurposed. But when I talk to other mathematicians, [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10618.880000000001s)]
*  I can tell that they're using some different styles of thinking than I am. Not disjoint, [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10627.2s)]
*  but they may prefer visual. I don't actually prefer visual so much. I need also visual aids [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10633.04s)]
*  myself. Mathematics provides a common language so we can still talk to each other even if we are [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10638.480000000001s)]
*  thinking in different ways. But you can tell there's a different set of subsystems being used in the [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10644.560000000001s)]
*  thinking process. Yeah, they take different paths. They're very quick at things that I struggle with [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10651.44s)]
*  and vice versa and yet they still get to the same goal. That's beautiful. Yeah, but I mean, [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10655.76s)]
*  the way we educate, unless you have a personalized tutor or something, education just by nature of [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10662.4s)]
*  scale has to be mass produced. You have to teach the 30 kids. If they have 30 different styles, [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10667.68s)]
*  you can't teach 30 different ways. On that topic, what advice would you give to students, [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10672.56s)]
*  young students who are struggling with math but are interested in it and would like to get better? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10678.72s)]
*  Is there something in this complicated educational context? What would you? Yeah, [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10685.28s)]
*  it's a tricky problem. One nice thing is that there are now lots of sources for mathematical [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10690.08s)]
*  enrichment outside the classroom. In my day, there are already math competitions. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10694.96s)]
*  There are also popular math books in the library. Now you have YouTube. There are forums [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10700.88s)]
*  just devoted to solving math puzzles. Math shows up in other places. For example, there are [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10707.039999999999s)]
*  hobbyists who play poker for fun. They are interested in very specific probability questions. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10715.199999999999s)]
*  There's a community of amateur probabilists in poker, in chess, in baseball. There's math [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10727.439999999999s)]
*  all over the place. I'm hoping with these new tools for Lean that we can incorporate [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10737.76s)]
*  broader public into math research projects. This doesn't happen at all currently. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10746.800000000001s)]
*  In the sciences, there is some scope for citizen science. Astronomers, [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10754.0s)]
*  there are amateurs who discover comets. There are biologists who identify butterflies and so forth. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10758.16s)]
*  And in math, there are small number of activities where amateur mathematicians can discover new [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10763.679999999998s)]
*  primes and so forth. But previously, because we have to verify every single contribution, [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10769.679999999998s)]
*  most mathematical research projects, it would not help to have input from the general public. In [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10775.92s)]
*  fact, it would just be time consuming because just error checking and everything. But one thing about [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10781.359999999999s)]
*  these formalization projects is that they are bringing in more people. I'm sure there are high [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10788.4s)]
*  school students who have already contributed to some of these formalizing projects, who have [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10794.56s)]
*  contributed to Math-a-lib. You don't need to be a PhD holder to just work on one atomic thing. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10797.039999999999s)]
*  There's something about the formalization here that also, as a very first step, opens it up to [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10803.359999999999s)]
*  the programming community too. The people who are already comfortable with programming. It seems [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10809.44s)]
*  like programming is somehow, maybe just the feeling, but it feels more accessible to folks [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10814.32s)]
*  than math. Math is seen as this extreme, especially modern mathematics, seen as this extremely [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10819.44s)]
*  difficult to enter area. And programming is not, so that could be just an entry point. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10826.24s)]
*  You can execute code and you can get results. You can print out the world pretty quickly. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10831.119999999999s)]
*  If programming was taught as an almost entirely theoretical subject, where you just taught [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10838.8s)]
*  the computer science, the theory of functions and routines and so forth, and outside of some [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10843.44s)]
*  very specialized homework assignments, you would not actually program on the weekend for fun. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10849.76s)]
*  They would be considered as hard as math. There are communities of non-mathematicians [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10855.52s)]
*  where they're deploying math for some very specific purpose, like optimizing their poker game. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10864.160000000002s)]
*  And for them, then math becomes fun for them. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10869.84s)]
*  RG What advice would you give in general to young people how to pick a career? [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10872.480000000001s)]
*  How to find themselves? [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10876.480000000001s)]
*  MG That's a tough, tough, tough question. Yeah. So there's a lot of certainty now in the world. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10877.52s)]
*  There was this period after the war where, at least in the West, if you came from a good [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10884.960000000001s)]
*  demographic, there was a very stable path to a good career. You go to college, you get an education, [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10889.92s)]
*  you pick one profession and you stick to it. It's becoming much more a thing of the past. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10898.48s)]
*  I think you just have to be adaptable and flexible. I think people will have to get skills [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10904.16s)]
*  that are transferable, like learning one specific programming language or one specific subject of [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10908.56s)]
*  mathematics or something. That itself is not a super transferable skill, but knowing how to [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10913.44s)]
*  reason with abstract concepts or how to problem solve when things go wrong. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10921.6s)]
*  These are things which I think we will still need. Even as our tools get better, [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10926.8s)]
*  and you'll be working with AI, sports, and so forth. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10930.72s)]
*  RG But actually, you're an interesting case study. You're like one of the great living [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10933.6s)]
*  mathematicians. And then you had a way of doing things, and then all of a sudden you start [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10940.0s)]
*  learning. First of all, you kept learning new fields, but you learn lean. That's a non-trivial [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10946.32s)]
*  thing to learn. For a lot of people, that's an extremely uncomfortable leap to take, right? [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10953.36s)]
*  KM First of all, I've always been interested in [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10960.0s)]
*  new ways to do mathematics. I feel like a lot of the ways we do things right now are inefficient. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10964.32s)]
*  Many of my colleagues, we spend a lot of time doing very routine computations or doing things [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10972.480000000001s)]
*  that other mathematicians would instantly know how to do, and we don't know how to do them. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10976.560000000001s)]
*  Why can't we search and get a quick response? That's why I've always been interested in [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10980.72s)]
*  exploring new workflows. About four or five years ago, I was on a committee where we had to [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10985.44s)]
*  ask for ideas for interesting workshops to run at the Math Institute. At the time, Peter Schultzer [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10992.4s)]
*  had just formalized one of his new theorems. There were some other developments in computer [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=10996.96s)]
*  assisted proof that looked quite interesting. I said, oh, we should run a workshop on this. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11002.88s)]
*  It's a pretty good idea. I was a bit too enthusiastic about this idea, so I got [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11009.36s)]
*  voluntold to actually run it. I did with a bunch of other people, Kevin Pazin and Jordan Ellenberg. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11015.04s)]
*  It was a nice success. We brought together a bunch of mathematicians, [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11024.32s)]
*  including scientists and other people, and we got up to speed on the state of the art. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11028.16s)]
*  It was really interesting developments that most mathematicians didn't know was going on. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11033.04s)]
*  There were lots of nice proofs of concept. It was just a hint of what was going to happen. This was [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11038.88s)]
*  just before chat GPT, but even then, there was one talk about language models and the potential [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11043.28s)]
*  capability of those in the future. That got me excited about the subject, so I started giving [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11048.32s)]
*  talks about this is something more of us should start looking at. Now that I'd arranged to run [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11053.6s)]
*  this conference, then chat GPT came out, and suddenly AI was everywhere. I got interviewed a [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11060.16s)]
*  lot about this topic, and in particular, the interaction between AI and formal proof systems. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11066.08s)]
*  I said, yeah, they should be combined. This is perfect synergy to happen here. At some point, [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11073.68s)]
*  I realized that I have to actually do not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. I don't work [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11079.68s)]
*  in machine learning, and I don't work in proof formalization. There's a limit to how much I can [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11084.32s)]
*  just rely on authority and say, I'm a wonder mathematician. Just trust me when I say that [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11088.48s)]
*  this is going to change mathematics, and I'm not doing it when I don't do it anyway myself. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11093.68s)]
*  I felt like I had to actually justify it. A lot of what I get into, actually, I don't quite see [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11098.24s)]
*  an advice as how much time I'm going to spend on it. It's only after I'm sort of waist deep [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11106.64s)]
*  in a project that I realized by that point I'm committed. Well, that's deeply admirable that [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11111.44s)]
*  you're willing to go into the fray, be in some small way a beginner, [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11116.96s)]
*  or have some of the sort of challenges that a beginner would. It's in new concepts, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11122.88s)]
*  new ways of thinking, also sucking at a thing that others ... I think in that talk, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11128.64s)]
*  you could be a field-winning mathematician and an undergrad knows something better than you. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11136.72s)]
*  Yeah. I think mathematics inherently ... I mean, mathematics is so huge these days that nobody [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11142.16s)]
*  knows all of modern mathematics. Inevitably, we make mistakes. You can't cover up your mistakes [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11148.08s)]
*  with just sort of bravado. I mean, because people will ask for your proofs, and if you don't have [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11156.32s)]
*  the proofs, you don't have the proofs. I don't love math. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11161.28s)]
*  Yeah. It does keep us honest. I mean, it's not a perfect panacea, but I think [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11164.16s)]
*  we do have more of a culture of admitting error, because we're forced to all the time. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11172.4s)]
*  Big ridiculous question. I'm sorry for it once again. Who is the greatest mathematician of all [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11177.52s)]
*  time? Maybe one who's no longer with us. Who are the candidates? Euler, Gauss, Newton, Ramanujan, [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11183.92s)]
*  Hilbert? First of all, as mentioned before, there's some time dependence. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11191.92s)]
*  On the day. Yeah. If you part cumulatively over time, [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11196.8s)]
*  for example, Euclid is one of the leading contenders. Then maybe some unnamed anonymous [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11201.04s)]
*  mathematicians before that. Whoever came up with the concept of numbers. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11207.52s)]
*  Do mathematicians today still feel the impact of Hilbert? [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11213.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11217.2s)]
*  Directly of everything that's happened in the 20th century? [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11218.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Hilbert spaces. We have lots of things that are named after him, of course. Just the [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11220.720000000001s)]
*  arrangement of mathematics and just the introduction of certain concepts. I mean, [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11224.960000000001s)]
*  23 problems have been extremely influential. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11229.04s)]
*  There's some strange power to the declaring which problems [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11232.080000000002s)]
*  are hard to solve. The statement of the open problems. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11236.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's this bystander effect everywhere. If no one says you should do X, [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11239.36s)]
*  everyone just mills around waiting for somebody else to do something and nothing gets done. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11246.0s)]
*  One thing that actually you have to teach undergraduates in mathematics is that [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11254.880000000001s)]
*  you should always try something. You see a lot of paralysis in an undergraduate trying a math [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11258.4s)]
*  problem. If they recognize that there's a certain technique that can be applied, they will try it. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11265.6s)]
*  There are problems for which they see none of their standard techniques obviously applies. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11270.72s)]
*  The common reaction is then just paralysis. I don't know what to do. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11275.36s)]
*  I think there's a quote from the Simpsons. I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11281.2s)]
*  The next step then is to try anything no matter how stupid. In fact, almost the stupid or the better. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11284.56s)]
*  Which I think is almost guaranteed to fail, but the way it fails is going to be instructive. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11294.24s)]
*  It fails because you're not at all taking into account this hypothesis. Oh, this hypothesis must [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11300.24s)]
*  be useful. That's a clue. I think you also suggested somewhere this fascinating approach, [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11304.64s)]
*  which really stuck with me as they're using it and it really works. I think you said it's called [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11310.4s)]
*  structured procrastination. No, yes. It's when you really don't want to do a thing. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11314.880000000001s)]
*  They imagine a thing you don't want to do more. Yes. That's worse than that. Then in that way, [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11319.68s)]
*  you procrastinate by not doing the thing that's worse. Yeah. That's a nice hack. It actually works. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11325.6s)]
*  Yeah. With anything, psychology is really important. You talk to athletes like marathon [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11331.68s)]
*  runners and so forth and they talk about what's the most important thing, is it their training [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11340.880000000001s)]
*  regimen or their diet and so forth. So much of it is psychology. Just tricking yourself to [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11344.960000000001s)]
*  think that the problem is feasible so that you're motivated to do it. [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11351.6s)]
*  Is there something our human mind will never be able to comprehend? [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11355.52s)]
*  Well, I guess in math, there must be some large number that you can't understand. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11359.52s)]
*  That was the first thing that came to mind. So that, but even broadly, is there something about [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11369.44s)]
*  our mind that's going to be limited even with the help of mathematics? [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11376.48s)]
*  Well, okay. How much augmentation are you willing? For example, if I didn't even have pen and paper, [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11381.92s)]
*  like if I had no technology whatsoever, okay, so I'm not allowed blackboard, pen and paper. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11387.52s)]
*  Right. You're already much more limited than you would be. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11392.400000000001s)]
*  Incredibly limited. Even language, the English language is a technology. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11395.76s)]
*  It's one that's been very internalized. So you're right. The formulation of the [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11400.560000000001s)]
*  problem isn't correct because there really is no longer just a solo human. We're already augmented [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11406.0s)]
*  in extremely complicated, intricate ways, right? We're already like a collective intelligence. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11414.16s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. So humanity plural has much more intelligence in principle on these good days [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11420.48s)]
*  than the individual humans put together. It can all have less. Okay. But yeah, so yeah, [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11427.6s)]
*  the mathematical community plural is an incredibly super intelligent entity that no single human [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11434.48s)]
*  mathematician can come close to replicating. You see it a little bit on these question analysis [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11443.04s)]
*  sites. So this method will flow, which is the method version of stackable flow. And sometimes [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11447.6s)]
*  you get this very quick responses to very difficult questions from the community. And it's a pleasure [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11452.640000000001s)]
*  to watch actually as an expert. I'm a fan spectator of that site, just seeing the brilliance of the [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11458.560000000001s)]
*  different people there, the depth of knowledge that some people have and the willingness to [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11466.32s)]
*  engage in the rigor and the nuance of the particular question. It's pretty cool to watch. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11472.48s)]
*  It's almost like just fun to watch. What gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on, [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11477.44s)]
*  human civilization? I think, yeah, the younger generation is always like really creative and [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11483.279999999999s)]
*  enthusiastic and inventive. It's a pleasure working with young students. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11489.52s)]
*  The progress of science tells us that the problems that used to be really difficult [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11501.12s)]
*  can become trivial to solve. I mean, it was like navigation, just knowing where you were [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11504.960000000001s)]
*  on the planet was this horrendous problem. People died or lost fortunes because they [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11514.56s)]
*  couldn't navigate. And we have devices in our pockets that do this automatically for us, [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11520.56s)]
*  like it's a completely solved problem. So things that seem unfeasible for us [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11523.84s)]
*  now could be maybe just sort of homework exercises for me. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11528.88s)]
*  Yeah. One of the things I find really sad about the finiteness of life is that I won't get to see [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11532.88s)]
*  all the cool things we create as a civilization. Because in the next 200 years, just imagine [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11537.439999999999s)]
*  showing up in 200 years. Yeah. Well, already plenty has happened. If you could go back in time and [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11545.279999999999s)]
*  talk to your teenage self or something. Just the internet and our AI, they're getting to [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11550.4s)]
*  internalize and say, yeah, of course an AI can understand our voice and give reasonable, [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11559.76s)]
*  slightly incorrect answers to any question. But this was mind blowing even two years ago. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11565.44s)]
*  And in the moment it's hilarious to watch on the internet and so on the drama. People take [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11570.64s)]
*  everything for granted very quickly. And then we humans seem to entertain ourselves with drama. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11576.16s)]
*  Out of anything that's created, somebody needs to take one opinion, another person needs to take [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11582.24s)]
*  an opposite opinion, argue with each other about it. But when you look at the arc of things, [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11586.88s)]
*  I mean, it's just even in progress of robotics, just to take a step back and be like, wow, [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11590.96s)]
*  this is beautiful that we humans are able to create this. Yeah. When the infrastructure [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11596.64s)]
*  culture is healthy, the community of humans can be so much more intelligent and mature and [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11601.039999999999s)]
*  rational than the individuals within it. Well, one place I can always count on rationality is [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11608.4s)]
*  the comment section of your blog, which I'm a big fan of. There's a lot of really smart people there. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11614.0s)]
*  And thank you, of course, for putting those ideas out on the blog. And I can't tell you how [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11618.88s)]
*  honored I am that you would spend your time with me today. I was looking forward to this for a [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11626.4s)]
*  long time, Terry. I'm a huge fan. You inspire me, you inspire millions of people. Thank you so much [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkBz-cdB-k&t=11631.92s)]
