# Jimmy Wales: Wikipedia | Lex Fridman Podcast #385
**Lex Fridman:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diJp4zoQPqo)
*  We've never bowed down to government pressure anywhere in the world and we never will.
*  We understand that we're hardcore and actually there is a bit of nuance about how different
*  companies respond to this, but our response has always been just to say no. And if they
*  threaten to block, well knock yourself out, you're going to lose Wikipedia.
*  The following is a conversation with Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, one of, if not the most
*  impactful websites ever, expanding the collective knowledge, intelligence and wisdom of human
*  civilization. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the
*  description. And now dear friends, here's Jimmy Wales. Let's start at the beginning. What is the
*  origin story of Wikipedia? The origin story of Wikipedia. Well, so I was watching the growth of
*  the free software movement, open source software, and seeing programmers coming together to
*  collaborate in new ways, sharing code, doing that under a free license, which is really interesting
*  because it empowers an ability to work together. That's really hard to do if the code is still
*  proprietary because then if I chip in and help, we sort of have to figure out how I'm going to
*  be rewarded and what that is. But the idea that everyone can copy it and it just is part of the
*  commons really empowered a huge wave of creative software production. And I realized that that kind
*  of collaboration could extend beyond just software to all kinds of cultural works.
*  And the first thing that I thought of was an encyclopedia. I thought, oh, that seems obvious
*  that an encyclopedia, you can collaborate on it. There's a few reasons why. One, we all pretty much
*  know what an encyclopedia entry on, say, the Eiffel Tower should be like. You should see a
*  picture, a few pictures maybe, history, location, something about the architect, et cetera, et cetera.
*  So we have a shared understanding of what it is we're trying to do and then we can collaborate
*  and different people can chip in and find sources and so on and so forth. So set up first Newpedia,
*  which was about two years before Wikipedia. And with Newpedia, we had this idea that in order
*  to be respected, we had to be even more academic than a traditional encyclopedia because a bunch
*  of volunteers on the internet getting out of the encyclopedia, you could be made fun of if it's
*  just every random person. So we had implemented this seven-stage review process to get anything
*  published. And two things came of that. So one thing, one of the earliest entries that we published
*  after this rigorous process, a few days later, we had to pull it because as soon as it hit the web
*  and the broader community took a look at it, people noticed plagiarism and realized that it wasn't
*  actually that good, even though it had been reviewed by academics and so on. So we had to pull it. So
*  it's like, oh, okay, well, so much for a seven-stage review process. But also I decided that I wanted
*  to try. I was frustrated. Why is this taking so long? Why is it so hard? So I thought, okay,
*  I saw that Robert Merton had won a Nobel Prize in economics for his work on option pricing theory.
*  And when I was in academia, that's what I worked on was option pricing theory, how to publish paper.
*  So I'd worked through all of his academic papers and I knew his work quite well. I thought, oh,
*  I'll just, I'll write a short biography of Merton. And when I started to do it, I'd been out of
*  academia, hadn't been a grad student for a few years then. I felt this huge intimidation because
*  they were going to take my draft and send it to the most prestigious finance professors that we
*  could find to give me feedback for revisions. And it felt like being back in grad school.
*  It's like this really oppressive sort of like, you're going to submit it for review and you're
*  going to get critiques. Elaborate the bad part of grad school.
*  Yeah, yeah, the bad part of grad school, right? And so I was like, oh, this isn't intellectually
*  fun. This is like the bad part of grad school. It's intimidating and there's a lot of
*  potential embarrassment if I screw something up and so forth. And so that was when I realized,
*  okay, look, this is never going to work. This is not something that people are really going to want
*  to do. So Jeremy Rosenfeld, one of my employees had brought and showed me the Wiki concept in
*  December. And then Larry Sanger brought in the same and said, what about this Wiki idea?
*  And so in January, we decided to launch Wikipedia, but we weren't sure. So the original
*  project was called Newpedia. And even though it wasn't successful, we did have quite a group of
*  academics and like really serious people. And we were concerned that, oh, maybe these academics
*  are going to really hate this idea. And we shouldn't just convert the project immediately.
*  We should launch this as a side project, the idea of here's a Wiki where we can start playing
*  around. But actually we got more work done in two weeks than we had in almost two years,
*  because people were able to just jump on and start doing stuff. And it was actually a very
*  exciting time. Back then you could be the first person who typed Africa is a continent and hit
*  save, which isn't much of an encyclopedia entry, but it's true and it's a start and it's kind of
*  fun. You put your name down. Actually a funny story was several years later, I just happened
*  to be online and I saw when his name is Robert Allman won the Nobel Prize in Economics. And we
*  didn't have an entry on him at all, which was surprising, but it wasn't that surprising. This
*  was still early days. And so I got to be the first person to type Robert Allman won the Nobel Prize
*  in Economics and hit save, which again wasn't a very good article. But then I came back two
*  days later and people had improved it and so forth. So that second half of the experience where with
*  Robert Merton, I never succeeded because it was just too intimidating. It was like, oh no,
*  I was able to chip in and help. Other people jumped in. Everybody was interested in the topic
*  because it's all in the news at the moment. And so it's just a completely different model,
*  which worked much, much better. What is it that made that so accessible, so fun, so natural to
*  just add something? Well, I think it's, especially in the early days, and this by the way has gotten
*  much harder because there are fewer topics that are just green field available. But you could say,
*  oh, well, I know a little bit about this and I can get it started. But then it is fun to come back
*  then and see other people have added and improved and so on and so forth. And that idea of collaborating
*  where people can, much like open source software, you put your code out and then people suggest
*  revisions and they change it and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator. It's just
*  a kind of a fun, wonderful, quite geeky hobby, but people enjoy it. How much debate was there
*  over the interface, over the details of how to make that seamless and frictionless? Yeah,
*  I mean, not as much as there probably should have been in a way. During that two years of the failure
*  of Newpedia where very little work got done, what was actually productive was there was a huge long
*  discussion, email discussion, very clever people talking about things like neutrality, talking
*  about what is an encyclopedia, but also talking about more technical ideas, things. Back then,
*  XML was kind of all the rage and thinking about, oh, could we, shouldn't you have certain data
*  that might be in multiple articles that gets updated automatically? So for example,
*  the population of New York City, every 10 years there's a new official census. Couldn't you just
*  update that bit of data in one place and it would update across all languages? That is a reality
*  today, but back then it was just like, how do we do that? How do we think about that? So that is
*  the reality today where there's some universal variables. Yeah, so Wikidata. Yeah, Wikidata,
*  you can link from a Wikipedia entry, you can link to that piece of data in Wikidata. I mean,
*  it's a pretty advanced thing, but there are advanced users who are doing that. And then when
*  that gets updated, it updates in all the languages where you've done that. I mean, that's really
*  interesting. There was this chain of emails in the early days of discussing the details of what is,
*  so there's the interface, there's the... Yeah, so the interface, so an example, there was some
*  software called UseModWiki, which we started with. It's quite amusing actually, because
*  the main reason we launched with UseModWiki is that it was a single Perl script. So it was really
*  easy for me to install it on the server and just get running. But it was some guy's hobby project,
*  it was cool, but it was just a hobby project. And all the data was stored in flat text files,
*  so there was no real database behind it. So to search the site, you basically used
*  Grab, which is just like basic Unix utility to look through all the files. So that clearly was
*  never going to scale. But also in the early days, it didn't have real logins. So you could set your
*  username, but there were no passwords. So I might say Bob Smith, and then someone else comes along
*  and says, no, I'm Bob Smith, and they both had it. Now that never really happened, we didn't have a
*  problem with it, but it was kind of obvious, like you can't grow a big website where everybody can
*  pretend to be everybody. That's not going to be good for trust and reputation and so forth.
*  So quickly I had to write a little login, store people's passwords and things like that, so you
*  could have unique identities. And then another example of something quite, you would have never
*  thought would have been a good idea, and it turned out to not be a problem. But to make a link in
*  Wikipedia, in the early days, you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist by just
*  using camel case, meaning it's like upper case, lower case, and you smash the words together. So
*  maybe New York City, you might type N-E-W, no space, capital Y, York City. And that would make
*  a link, but that was ugly. That was clearly not right. And so I was like, okay, well, that's just
*  not going to look nice. Let's just use square brackets. Two square brackets makes a link. That
*  may have been an option in the software. I'm not sure I thought of square brackets, but anyway,
*  we just did that, which worked really well. It makes nice links and you can see in its red links
*  or blue links, depending on if the page exists or not. But the thing that didn't occur to me even
*  think about is that, for example, on the German language standard keyboard, there is no square
*  bracket. So for German Wikipedia to succeed, people had to learn to do some alt codes to
*  get the square bracket or a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket when they could find one,
*  they would just cut and paste one in. And yet German Wikipedia has been a massive success. So
*  somehow that didn't slow people down. How is it that the German keyboards don't have a square
*  bracket? How do you do programming? How do you live life to its fullest without square brackets?
*  Very good question. I'm not really sure. Maybe it does now because keyboard standards have
*  drifted over time and becomes useful to have a certain character. I mean, same thing,
*  there's not really a W character in Italian. And it wasn't on keyboards or I think it is now,
*  but in general, W is not a letter in Italian language, but it appears in enough international
*  words that it's crept into Italian. And all of these things are probably Wikipedia articles
*  in themselves. Oh yeah. The discussion of square brackets. Whole discussion, I'm sure.
*  On both the English and the German Wikipedia. And the difference between those two might be very
*  interesting. So Wikidata is fascinating, but even the broader discussion of
*  what is an encyclopedia, can you go to that sort of philosophical question of
*  what is an encyclopedia? What is an encyclopedia? So the way I would put it is an encyclopedia,
*  what our goal is, is the sum of all human knowledge, but sum meaning summary.
*  And this was an early debate. I mean, somebody started uploading the full text of Hamlet,
*  for example, and we said, wait, hold on a second. That's not an encyclopedia article, but why not?
*  So Hence was born Wikisource, which is where you put original texts and things like that out of
*  copyright text. Because they said, no, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's a
*  perfectly valid thing, but the actual text of the play is not an encyclopedia article.
*  So most of it's fairly obvious, but there are some interesting quirks and differences. So for
*  example, as I understand it, in French language encyclopedias, traditionally, it would be quite
*  common to have recipes, which in English language, that would be unusual. You wouldn't find a recipe
*  for chocolate cake in Britannica. And so I actually don't know the current state,
*  haven't thought about that in many, many years now. State of cake recipes in Wikipedia,
*  in English Wikipedia? I wouldn't say there's chocolate cake recipes. I mean, you might find
*  a sample recipe somewhere. I'm not saying there are none, but in general, no, like we wouldn't
*  have recipes. I told myself I would not get outraged in this conversation, but now I'm outraged.
*  I'm deeply upset. It's actually very complicated. I love to cook. I'm actually quite a good
*  cook. And what's interesting is it's very hard to have a neutral recipe because-
*  Like a canonical recipe for cake chocolate cake.
*  A canonical recipe is kind of difficult to come by because there's so many variants and
*  it's all debatable and interesting. For something like chocolate cake, you could probably say,
*  here's one of the earliest recipes or here's one of the most common recipes. But
*  um, you know, for many, many things, uh, the variants are as interesting, you know, as,
*  you know, somebody said to me recently, you know, uh, 10 Spaniards, 12 paella recipes. So,
*  you know, these are all matters of open discussion.
*  Well, just to throw some numbers as of May 27th, 2023, there are 6 million, 6.66 million articles
*  in the English Wikipedia containing over 4.3 billion words, including articles. The total
*  number of pages is 58 million. Does that blow your mind?
*  I mean, yes, it does. I mean, it doesn't because I know those numbers and see them
*  from time to time. But in another sense, a deeper sense, yeah, it does. I mean, it's really
*  uh, remarkable. I remember when, uh, English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles and when
*  German Wikipedia passed 100,000, because I happened to be in Germany with a bunch of
*  Wikipedians that night. And, um, you know, then it seemed quite big. I mean, we knew at that time
*  that it was nowhere near complete. I remember at Wikimania in Harvard, uh, when we, when we did
*  our annual conference there in Boston, um, someone who had come to the conference from Poland
*  had brought along with him a small encyclopedia, a single volume, uh, encyclopedia of biographies.
*  So short biographies, normally a paragraph or so about famous people in Poland. And there were
*  some 22,000 entries. And he pointed out that even then, 2006, Wikipedia felt quite big.
*  He said in English Wikipedia, there's only a handful of these, you know, less than 10%. I think
*  he said, um, and so then you realized, yeah, actually, you know, who was the mayor of Warsaw
*  in 1873? Don't know. Probably not in English Wikipedia, but it probably might be today,
*  but there's so much out there. And of course, what we get into when we're talking about how
*  many entries there are and how many, you know, how many could there be, is this very deep
*  philosophical issue of notability, um, which is the question of, well, how do you, how do you
*  draw the limit? How do you draw, you know, what, what is there? So sometimes people say, oh, there
*  should be no limit, but I think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny if you really pause and think
*  about it. So I see in your hand there, you've got a BIC pen, pretty standard. Everybody's seen,
*  you know, billions of those in life. Classic though. It's a classic clear BIC pen. So could
*  we have an entry about that BIC pen? Well, I bet we do that type of BIC pen, um, because it's classic,
*  everybody knows it and it's got a history. And, um, actually there's something interesting about
*  the BIC company. They make pens. They also make kayaks and there's something else they're famous
*  for. Basically, uh, they're, they're sort of a definition by non-essentials company, anything
*  that's long and plastic. That's what they make. So if you want to find the common ground, the platonic
*  form of a BIC. But could we have an article about that very BIC pen in your hand? So Lex Friedman's
*  BIC pen as of this week. Oh, the very, this very specific instance. And the answer is no, there's
*  not much known about it. I dare say, unless, you know, it's very special to you and your great
*  grandmother gave it to you or something, you probably know very little about it. It's a pen.
*  It's just here in the office. Um, so that, that's just to show there's a, there's, there is a limit.
*  In German Wikipedia, they used to talk about the, the rear nut of the wheel of Uli Fuchs bicycle,
*  Uli Fuchs, the well-known Wikipedia of the time, to sort of illustrate, like you can't have an
*  article about literally everything. And so then it raises the question, what can you have an article
*  about what can't you? And that can vary depending on the subject matter. Um, one of the areas where
*  we try to be much more careful would be biographies. The reason is a biography of a living person,
*  if you get it wrong, it can actually be quite hurtful, quite damaging. And so if someone is a
*  private person, um, and somebody tries to create a Wikipedia entry, there's no way to update it.
*  There's not much known. So for example, uh, an encyclopedia article about my mother, my mother,
*  school teacher, later a pharmacist, wonderful woman, but never been in the news. I mean, other
*  than me talking about why there shouldn't be a Wikipedia entry that's probably made it in somewhere,
*  standard example, but, um, you know, there's not enough known. Um, and you could sort of imagine a,
*  a database of genealogy having date of birth, date of death, and you know, some certain elements
*  like that of, of private people, but you couldn't really write a biography. And one of the areas
*  this comes up quite often is, uh, what we call BLP one, a we've got lots of acronyms biography
*  of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real sort of danger zone.
*  And the type of example would be a victim of a crime. So someone who's a victim of a famous
*  serial killer, but about whom like really not much is known. They weren't a public person. They're
*  just a victim of a crime. We really shouldn't have an article about that person. They'll be mentioned,
*  of course, and maybe the specific crime might have an article, but for that person, no, not really.
*  That's not really something that makes any sense because how can you write a biography about
*  someone you don't know much about? And this is, you know, it varies from, from field to field.
*  So for example, for many academics, we will have an entry that we might not have in a different
*  context because for an academic, it's important to have sort of their career, you know, what papers
*  they've published, things like that. You may not know anything about their personal life, but that's
*  actually not encyclopedically relevant in the same way that it is for a member of a royal family,
*  where it's basically all about the family. So, you know, we're fairly nuanced about notability
*  and where it comes in. And I've always thought that the term notability, I think, is a little
*  problematic. I mean, we struggled about how to talk about it. The problem with notability is
*  it can feel insulting to say, oh no, you're not noteworthy. My mother's noteworthy. She's a
*  really important person in my life, right? So that's not right. But it's more like verifiability.
*  Is there a way to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry?
*  It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me, as I've learned recently. And the first thought
*  I had when I saw that was, surely I am not notable enough. So I was very surprised and grateful that
*  such a page could exist. And actually just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people
*  that are part of creating and maintaining Wikipedia. It's my favorite website on the
*  internet. The collection of articles that Wikipedia has created is just incredible.
*  Yeah, we'll talk about the various details of that. But the love and care that goes into
*  creating pages for individuals, for a big pen, for all this kind of stuff is just really incredible.
*  So I just felt the love when I saw that page. But I also felt, just because I do this podcast,
*  and I just through this podcast, gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial.
*  I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite,
*  to me as a person who loves other human beings, I've gone to be at the receiving end of some
*  kind of attacks through the Wikipedia form. Like you said, when you look at living individuals,
*  it can be quite hurtful. The little details of information. And because I've become friends
*  with Elon Musk, and I've interviewed him, but I've also interviewed people on the left,
*  far left, people on the right, some people would say far right. And so now you take a step,
*  you put your toe into the cold pool of politics, and the shark emerges from the depths and pulls
*  you right in. The boiling hot pool of politics. Yeah, I guess it's hot. And so I got to experience
*  some of that. I think what you also realize is there has to be for Wikipedia kind of credible
*  sources, verifiable sources. And there's a dance there because some of the sources are
*  pieces of journalism. And of course, journalism operates under its own complicated incentives,
*  such that people can write articles that are not factual, or are cherry picking all the flaws
*  they can have in a journalistic article. And those can be used as sources. It's like they
*  dance hand in hand. And so for me, sadly enough, there was a really kind of concerted attack
*  to say that I was never at MIT. I never did anything at MIT. Just to clarify, I am a research
*  scientist at MIT. I have been there since 2015. I'm there today. I'm at a prestigious,
*  amazing laboratory called LIDS. And I hope to be there for a long time. I work on AI, robotics,
*  machine learning. There's a lot of incredible people there. And by the way, MIT has been very
*  kind to defend me. Unlike Wikipedia says, it is not an unpaid position. There was no controversy.
*  It was all very calm and happy and almost boring research that I've been doing there.
*  And the other thing, because I am half Ukrainian, half Russian,
*  and I've traveled to Ukraine, and I will travel to Ukraine again.
*  And I will travel to Russia for some very difficult conversations. My heart's been broken by this war.
*  I have family in both places. It's been a really difficult time. But the little battle about the
*  biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me. I also want to clarify
*  sort of personally, I use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there. My father was not born in
*  Chukolsk, Russia. He was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in Chukolsk, which is a town not in
*  Russia. There is a town that called that in Russia, but there's another town in Tajikistan,
*  which is a former Republic of the Soviet Union. It is that town is not called B-U-S-T-O-N,
*  Buston, which is funny because we're now in Austin and I also am in Boston. It seems like my whole
*  life is surrounded by these kinds of towns. So I was born in Tajikistan. And the rest of the
*  biography is interesting, but my family is very evenly distributed between their origins and where
*  they grew up between Ukraine and Russia, which adds a whole beautiful complexity to this whole
*  thing. So I want to just correct that. It's like the fascinating thing about Wikipedia
*  is in some sense, those little details don't matter. But in another sense, what I felt when
*  I saw a Wikipedia page about me or anybody I know is there's this beautiful kind of
*  saving that this person existed. Like a community that notices you. It says,
*  like a little, you see like a butterfly that floats and you're like, huh,
*  that it's not just any butterfly. It's that one. I like that one. Or you see a puppy or something or
*  it's this big pen. This one, I remember this one as the scratch and you get noticed in that way.
*  I don't know. That's a beautiful thing. Maybe it's very silly of me and naive,
*  but I feel like Wikipedia in terms of individuals is an opportunity to celebrate
*  people, to celebrate ideas. And not a battleground of attacks of the kind of stuff we might see on
*  Twitter, like the mockery, the derision, this kind of stuff. And of course you don't want to cherry
*  pick all of us have flaws and so on, but it just feels like to highlight a controversy of some sort
*  when that doesn't at all represent the entirety of the human, in most cases, is sad.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a few things to unpack and all that. So first, one of the things
*  I find really always find very interesting is your status with MIT. Okay, that's upsetting and it's
*  an argument and can be sorted out. But then what's interesting is you gave as much time to that,
*  which is actually important and relevant to your career and so on, to also where your father was
*  born, which most people would hardly notice, but is really meaningful to you. And I find that a lot
*  when I talk to people who have a biography in Wikipedia is they're often as annoyed by a tiny
*  error that no one's going to notice. Like this town in Tajikistan has got a new name and so on.
*  Nobody even knows what that means or whatever, but it can be super important. And so that's one of
*  the reasons for biographies we say human dignity really matters. And so some of the things
*  have to do with, and this is a common debate that goes on in Wikipedia, is what we call undue weight.
*  So I'll give an example. There was an article I stumbled across many years ago
*  about the mayor. No, he wasn't a mayor. He was a city council member of, I think it was
*  Peoria, Illinois, but some small town in the Midwest. And the entry, he's been on the city
*  council for 30 years or whatever. He's a pretty, I mean, frankly, pretty boring guy and seems like
*  a good local city politician. But in this very short biography, there was a whole paragraph,
*  a long paragraph about his son being arrested for DUI. And it was clearly undue weight. It's like,
*  what has this got to do with this guy if it even deserves a mention? It wasn't even clear
*  had he done anything hypocritical, had he done himself anything wrong, even was his son,
*  his son got a DUI. That's never great, but it happens to people and it doesn't seem like a
*  massive scandal for your dad. So of course, I just took that out immediately. This is a long, long
*  time ago. And that's the sort of thing where we have to really think about in a biography and
*  about controversies to say, is this a real controversy? So in general, one of the things
*  we tend to say is like any section, so if there's a biography and there's a section called
*  controversies, that's actually poor practice because it just invites people to say, oh,
*  I want to work on this entry. Let's see, there's seven sections. Oh, this one's quite short. Can I
*  add something? Go out and find some more controversies. That's nonsense, right? And in general,
*  putting it separate from everything else kind of makes it seem worse and also doesn't put it in
*  the right context. Whereas if it's sort of a life-long, there is a controversy, there's always
*  potential controversy for anyone. It should just be sort of worked into the overall article
*  because then it doesn't become a temptation. You can contextualize appropriately and so forth.
*  So that's part of the whole process. But I think for me, one of the most important things is what
*  I call community health. So yeah, are we going to get it wrong sometimes? Yeah, of course. We're
*  humans and doing good quality sort of reference material is hard. The real question is, how do
*  people react to a criticism or a complaint or a concern? And if the reaction is defensiveness or
*  combativeness back, or if someone's really sort of in there being aggressive and in the wrong,
*  no, no, no, hold on, we've got to do this the right way. You got to say, okay, hold on,
*  are there good sources? Is this contextualized appropriately? Is it even important enough to
*  mention? What does it mean? And sometimes one of the areas where I do think there is a very
*  complicated flaw, and you've alluded to it a little bit, but it's like, we know the media is
*  deeply flawed. We know that journalism can go wrong. And I would say, particularly in the last
*  whatever 15 years, we've seen a real decimation of local media, local newspapers. We've seen a
*  real rise in clickbait headlines and sort of eager focus on anything that might be controversial.
*  We've always had that with us, of course. There's always been tabloid newspapers,
*  but that makes it a little bit more challenging to say, okay, how do we sort things out when we
*  have a pretty good sense that not every source is valid? So as an example, a few years ago,
*  it's been quite a while now, we deprecated the mail online as a source. And the mail online,
*  the digital arm of the Daily Mail, it's a tabloid. It's not completely, it's not fake news,
*  but it does tend to run very hyped up stories. They really love to attack people and go on the
*  attack for political reasons and so on. And it just isn't great. And so by saying deprecated,
*  some people say, oh, you banned the Daily Mail. No, we didn't ban it as a source. We just said, look,
*  it's probably not a great source. You should probably look for a better source. So certainly,
*  if the Daily Mail runs a headline saying, new cure for cancer, it's like, probably there's more
*  serious sources than a tabloid newspaper. So in an article about lung cancer, you probably wouldn't
*  cite the Daily Mail. That's kind of ridiculous. But also for celebrities and so forth to sort
*  of know, well, they do cover celebrity gossip a lot, but they also tend to have vendettas and
*  so forth. And you really have to step back and go, is this really encyclopedic or is this just the
*  Daily Mail going on a rant? And some of that requires a great community health. It requires
*  massive community health. Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of, I've actually iffy about
*  people I know, things I know about myself. I still feel like a love for knowledge emanating.
*  From the article. I feel the community health. So I will take all slight inaccuracies.
*  I love it because that means there's people, for the most part, I feel a respect and love in a
*  search for knowledge. Like sometimes, because I also love Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange for
*  programming related things. And they can get a little cranky sometimes to a degree where it's
*  like, it's not as, like you can see, you can feel the dynamics of the health of the particular
*  community and sub communities too, like a particular C sharp or Java or Python or whatever.
*  Like there's little like communities that emerge. You can feel the levels of toxicity because a
*  little bit of strictness is good, but a little too much is bad because of the defensiveness.
*  Because when somebody writes an answer and then somebody else kind of says, well modify it and
*  then get defensive and there's this tension that's not conducive to like improving towards a more
*  truthful depiction of like what that topic. Yeah. A great example that I really loved
*  this morning that I saw, someone left a note on my user talk page in English Wikipedia saying,
*  it was quite a dramatic headline saying, racist hook on front page. So we have on the front page
*  of Wikipedia, we have a little section called, did you know? And it's just little tidbits and facts
*  as things people find interesting. And there's a whole process for how things get there.
*  And the one that somebody was raising a question about was it was comparing a very well-known
*  US football player, Black. There was a quote from another famous sport person
*  comparing him to a Lamborghini, clearly a compliment. And so somebody said, actually,
*  here's a study, here's some interesting information about how Black sports people are
*  far more often compared to inanimate objects. And given that kind of analogy, and I think it's
*  demeaning to compare a person to a car, et cetera, et cetera. But they said, I'm not deleting it,
*  I'm not removing it, I just want to raise the question. And then there's this really interesting
*  conversation that goes on where I think the general consensus was, you know what, this isn't like
*  the alarming headline racist thing on the front page of Wikipedia, that sounds holy moly,
*  that sounds bad. But it's sort of like, actually, yeah, this probably isn't the sort of analogy that
*  we think is great. And so we should probably think about how to improve our language and not
*  compare sports people to inanimate objects, and particularly be aware of certain racial
*  sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing if there is a disparity in the media of
*  how people are called. And I just thought, you know what, nothing for me to weigh in on here.
*  This is a good conversation. Like, nobody's saying, you know, people should be banned if
*  they refer to, what was his name? The fridge, refrigerator Perry, the very famous comparison
*  to an inanimate object of a Chicago Bears player many years ago. But they're just saying, hey,
*  let's be careful about analogies that we just pick up from the media. I said, yeah, you know,
*  that's good. On the sort of deprecation of news sources, really interesting because
*  I think what you're saying is ultimately you want to make a article by article decision,
*  kind of use your own judgment. And it's such a subtle thing because the there's just a lot of
*  hit pieces written about individuals like myself, for example, that masquerade as kind of an objective,
*  thorough exploration of a human being. It's fascinating to watch because controversy and
*  hit pieces just get more clicks. Oh, yeah. And this is a, I guess as a Wikipedia contributor,
*  you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense like a radar of clickbait
*  versus truth, like to pick out the truth from the click baity type language. Oh, yeah. I mean,
*  it's really important. And, you know, we talk a lot about weasel words, you know, and, you know,
*  actually, I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and chat. But just to quickly mention in this area,
*  I think one of the potentially powerful tools, because it is quite good at this, I've played
*  around with and practiced it quite a lot. But chat GBT four is really quite able to take a passage
*  and point out potentially biased terms to rewrite it to be more neutral. Now, it is a bit
*  anodyne and it's a bit, you know, cliched. So sometimes it just takes the spirit out of
*  something that's actually not bad. It's just like, you know, poetic language. And you're like,
*  okay, that's not actually helping. But in many cases, I think that sort of thing is quite
*  interesting. And I'm also interested in, you know, can you imagine where you feed in a Wikipedia
*  entry, and all the sources, and you say, help me find anything in the article that is not accurately
*  reflecting what's in the sources. And that doesn't have to be perfect. It only has to be good enough
*  to be useful to community. So if it scans an article and all the sources, and you say,
*  oh, it came back with 10 suggestions, and seven of them were decent, and three of them,
*  it just didn't understand, well, actually, that's probably worth my time to do. And it can help us,
*  you know, really, more quickly get good people to sort of review obscure entries,
*  and things like that. So just as a small aside on that, and we'll probably talk about language
*  models a little bit, or a lot more. But one of the articles, one of the hit pieces about me,
*  the journalists actually was very straightforward and honest about having used GPT to write part of
*  the article, and then finding that they made an error and apologize for the error the GPT-4
*  generated, which has this kind of interesting loop, which the articles are used to write Wikipedia
*  pages. GPT is trained on Wikipedia. And there's like this interesting loop where the weasel words
*  and the nuances can get lost, or can propagate even though they're not grounded in reality.
*  Somehow, in the generation of the language model, new truths can be created and kind of linger.
*  Yeah, there's a famous webcomic that's titled Cytogenesis, which is about how
*  something, an error is in Wikipedia, and there's no source for it, but then a lazy journalist reads
*  it and writes the source. And then some helpful Wikipedia spots that it has a source, finds a
*  source and adds it to Wikipedia. And voila, magic. This happened to me once, it nearly happened.
*  There was this, I mean, it was really brief. I went back and researched it, I'm like, this is really
*  odd. So Biography Magazine, which is a magazine published by the Biography TV channel, had a
*  profile of me and it said, in his spare time, I'm not quoting exactly, it's been many years,
*  but in his spare time, he enjoys playing chess with friends. I thought, wow, that sounds great.
*  Like I would like to be that guy, but actually, I mean, I play chess with my kids sometimes, but no,
*  it's not a hobby of mine. And I was like, where did they get that? And I contacted the magazine,
*  I said, where did that come from? They said, oh, it was in Wikipedia. I looked in the history,
*  there had been vandalism of Wikipedia, which is not damaging, it's just false. And it had already
*  been removed. But then I thought, oh gosh, well, I better mention this to people because otherwise,
*  somebody's going to read that and they're going to add it to the entry and it's going to take on a
*  life of its own. And then sometimes I wonder if it has because I was invited a few years ago to
*  do the ceremonial first move in the world chess championship. And I thought, I wonder if they think
*  I'm a really big chess enthusiast because they read this biography magazine article. But that
*  problem, when we think about large language models and the ability to quickly generate very plausible,
*  but not true content, I think is something that there's going to be a lot of shakeout, a lot of
*  implications of that. What would be hilarious is because of the social pressure of Wikipedia
*  and the momentum, you would actually start playing a lot more chess. Not only the articles are written
*  based on Wikipedia, but your own life trajectory changes because of the Wikipedia,
*  just to make it more convenient. Yeah. Aspire to. Aspire to, yeah. Aspirational.
*  What, if we could just talk about that before we jump back to some other interesting topics
*  in Wikipedia, let's talk about GPT-4 and large language models. So they are in part trained on
*  Wikipedia content. Yeah. What are the pros and cons of these language models? What are your thoughts?
*  Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on. Obviously the technology has moved very quickly
*  in the last six months and looks poised to do so for some time to come. So first things first,
*  I mean, part of our philosophy is the open licensing, the free licensing, the idea that
*  this is what we're here for. We are a volunteer community and we write this
*  encyclopedia. We give it to the world to do what you like with. You can modify it,
*  redistribute it, redistribute modified versions, commercially, non-commercially,
*  this is the licensing. So in that sense, of course it's completely fine. Now we do worry a bit about
*  attribution because it is a Creative Commons attribution share-alike license. So attribution
*  is important, not just because of our licensing model and things like that, but it's just,
*  proper attribution is just good intellectual practice. And that's a really hard, complicated
*  question. If I were to write something about my visit here, I might say in a blog post, I was in
*  Austin, which is a city in Texas. I'm not going to put a source for Austin as a city in Texas,
*  that's just general knowledge. I learned it somewhere, I can't tell you where. So you don't
*  have to cite and reference every single thing. But if I actually did research and I used something
*  very heavily, it's just morally proper to give your sources. So we would like to see that. And
*  obviously, they call it grounding. So particularly people at Google are really keen on figuring out
*  grounding. That's a cool term. So any text that's generated trying to ground it to the Wikipedia
*  quality source. I mean, the same kind of standard of what a source means that Wikipedia uses,
*  the same kind of source that we generate. The same kind of thing. And of course,
*  one of the biggest flaws in ChatGPD right now is that it just literally will make things up just to
*  be amiable. I think it's programmed to be very helpful and amiable and doesn't really know or
*  care about the truth. It can get bullied into, it can kind of be convinced into. Well, but like this
*  morning, the story I was telling earlier about comparing a football player to a Lamborghini,
*  and I thought, is that really racial? I don't know. But I'm mulling it over and I thought,
*  I'm going to go to ChatGPD. So I said to ChatGPD4, I said, this happened in Wikipedia. Can you think
*  of examples where a white athlete has been compared to a fast car inanimate object? And it comes up
*  in a very plausible essay where it tells why these analogies are common in sport. I said,
*  no, no, could you give me some specific examples? So it gives me three specific examples, very
*  plausible, correct names of athletes and contemporaries and all of that could have been
*  true. I googled every single quote and none of them existed. And so I'm like, well, that's really
*  not good. I wanted to explore a thought process I was in. First, I thought, how do I Google? And
*  it's kind of a hard thing to Google because unless somebody has written about this specific topic,
*  it's a large language model. It's processed all this data. It can probably piece that together.
*  But it just can't yet. So I hope that ChatGPD5, 6, 7, 3 to 5 years, I'm hoping we'll see a much
*  higher level of accuracy where when you ask a question like that, I think instead of being
*  quite so eager to please by giving you a plausible sounding answer, it's just say, don't know.
*  Or maybe display how much bullshit might be in this generated text. I really would like to make
*  you happy right now, but I'm really stretched thin with this generation. Well, it's one of the things
*  I've said for a long time. So in Wikipedia, one of the great things we do may not be great for our
*  reputation, except in a deeper sense for the long term, I think it is. But we'll all be on notice
*  that says the neutrality of this section has been disputed or the following section doesn't cite any
*  sources. And I always joke, sometimes I wish the New York Times would run a banner saying the
*  neutrality of this has been disputed. They could give us an extra. We had a big fight in the newsroom
*  as to whether to run this or not. But we thought it's important enough to bring it to, but just be
*  aware that not all the journalists are on board with it. Oh, that's actually interesting. And that's
*  fine. I would trust them more for that level of transparency. So yeah, similarly, ChatGPD should
*  say, yeah, 87% bullshit. Well, the neutrality one is really interesting because that's basically a
*  summary of the discussions that are going on underneath. It would be amazing if I should be
*  honest, I don't look at the talk page often. It would be nice somehow if there was kind of a summary
*  in this banner way of like, this, lots of wars have been fought on this here land for this here
*  paragraph. It's really interesting. Yeah, I hadn't thought of that because one of the things I do
*  spend a lot of time thinking about these days and people have found that we're moving slowly, but
*  we are moving, thinking about, okay, these tools exist. Are there ways that this stuff can be useful
*  to our community? Because a part of it is we do approach things in a non-commercial way in a
*  really deep sense. It's been great that Wikimedia has become very popular, but really we're just
*  a community whose hobby is writing an encyclopedia. That's first. And if it's popular,
*  great. If it's not, okay, we might have trouble paying for more servers, but it'll be fine.
*  And so how do we help the community use these tools? What are the ways that these tools can
*  support people? One example I never thought about, I'm going to start playing with it is,
*  feed in the article and feed in the talk page and say, can you suggest some warnings in the article
*  based on the conversations in the talk page? I think it might be good at that. It might
*  get it wrong sometimes, but again, if it's reasonably successful at doing that and you
*  can say, oh, actually, yeah, it does suggest the neutrality of this has been disputed on a section
*  that has a seven page discussion in the back, that might be useful. I don't know.
*  Yeah. I mean, some more color to the, not neutrality, but also the amount of emotion
*  laden in the exploration of this particular part of the topic. It might actually help you
*  look at more controversial pages, like a page on a war in Ukraine or a page on Israel and Palestine.
*  There could be parts that everyone agrees on and there's parts that are just like tough.
*  The hard parts.
*  And it would be nice to, when looking at those beautiful, long articles to know like, all right,
*  let me just take in some stuff where everybody agrees on.
*  I can give an example that I haven't looked at in a long time, but I was really pleased with
*  what I saw at the time. So the discussion was that they're building something in Israel
*  and for their own political reasons, one side calls it a wall, harkening back to Berlin wall,
*  apartheid, the other calls it a security fence. So we can understand quite quickly if we give it
*  a moment's thought, like, okay, I understand why people would have this grappling over the language.
*  Like, okay, you want to highlight the negative aspects of this and you want to highlight the
*  positive aspects. So you're going to try and choose a different name. And so there was this
*  really fantastic Wikipedia discussion on the talk page. How do we word that paragraph to talk about
*  the different naming? It's called this by Israelis, called this by Palestinians.
*  And how you explain that to people could be quite charged, right? You could easily
*  explain, oh, there's this difference and it's because this side's good and this side's bad
*  and that's why there's a difference. Or you could say, actually, let's just try and really stay as
*  neutral as we can and try to explain the reasons. So you may come away from it with a concept,
*  oh, okay, I understand what this debate is about now.
*  And just the term Israel-Palestine conflict is still the title of a page at Wikipedia.
*  But the word conflict is something that is a charged word.
*  Of course, yeah.
*  Because from the Palestinian side or from certain sides, the word conflict doesn't
*  accurately describe the situation because if you see it as a genocide, one-way genocide,
*  it's not a conflict because to people that discuss, that challenge the word conflict,
*  they see conflict is when there's two equally powerful sides fighting.
*  Yeah, yeah. No, it's hard. And in a number of cases, so this actually speaks to a slightly
*  broader phenomenon, which is there are a number of cases where there is no one word that can
*  get consensus. And in the body of an article, that's usually okay because we can explain the
*  whole thing. You can come away with an understanding of why each side wants to use a certain word.
*  But there are some aspects, like the page has to have a title. So there's that. Same thing with
*  certain things like photos. It's like, well, there's different photos, which one's best,
*  a lot of different views on that. But at the end of the day, you need the lead photo because
*  there's one slot for a lead photo. Categories is another one. So at one point, I have no idea if
*  it's in there today, but I don't think so. I was listed in American entrepreneurs, fine,
*  American atheists. And I said, hmm, that doesn't feel right to me. Just personally, it's true. I
*  mean, I wouldn't disagree with the objective fact of it. But when you click the category and you see
*  sort of a lot of people who are, you might say, American atheist activists, because that's their
*  big issue. So Madeleine Murray O'Hare or various famous people who, Richard Dawkins, who make it a
*  big part of their public argument and persona. But that's not true of me. It's just like my private
*  personal belief. It's not something I campaign about. So it felt weird to put me in the category,
*  but what category would you put? And do you need that? In this case, I argued,
*  it doesn't need that kind of like, that's not, I don't speak about it publicly, except incidentally
*  from time to time, I don't campaign about it. So it's weird to put me with this group of people.
*  And that argument carried the day. I hope not just because it was me, but categories can be like that,
*  where you're either in the category or you're not. And sometimes it's a lot more complicated
*  than that. And is it, again, we go back to, is it undue weight? If someone who is now
*  prominent in public life and generally considered to be a good person was convicted of something,
*  let's say DUI, when they were young, we normally in normal sort of discourse, we don't think,
*  oh, this person should be in the category of American criminals. Because you think, oh,
*  criminal, technically speaking, it's against the law to drive under the influence of alcohol,
*  and you were arrested and you spent a month in prison or whatever. But it's odd to say that's
*  a criminal. So just as an example in this area is Mark Wahlberg, Marky Mark, that's what I always
*  think of him as, because that was his first sort of famous name, who I wouldn't think should be
*  listed as in the category American criminal, even though he did, he was convicted of quite a bad
*  crime when he was a young person, but we don't think of him as a criminal. Should the entry
*  talk about that? Yeah, that's actually an important part of his life story, that he had a very rough
*  youth and he could have gone down a really dark path and he turned his life around. That's actually
*  interesting. So categories are tricky. Especially with people, because we like to assign labels to
*  people into ideas somehow, and those labels stick. And there's certain words that have a lot of power,
*  like criminal, like political, left, right, center, anarchist, objectivist,
*  what other philosophies are there, Marxist, communist, social democrat, democratic socialist,
*  socialist. And if you add that as a category, all of a sudden it's like, oh boy, you're that guy now.
*  Yeah. And I don't know if you want to be that guy. Well, there's definitely some really charged ones,
*  like alt-right, I think is quite complicated and tough. It's not a completely meaningless label,
*  but boy, I think you really have to pause before you actually put that label on someone.
*  Partly because now you're putting them in a group of people, some of them are quite,
*  you wouldn't want to be grouped with. So it's, yeah. Let's go into some, you mentioned the hot
*  water of the pool that we're both tipping a toe in. Do you think Wikipedia has a left-leaning
*  political bias, which is something it is sometimes accused of?
*  Yeah. So I don't think so, not broadly. And I think you can always point to specific entries
*  and talk about specific biases, but that's part of the process of Wikipedia. Anyone can come and
*  challenge and to go on about that. But I see fairly often on Twitter some quite extreme
*  accusations of bias. And I think, actually, I just, I don't see it. I don't buy that.
*  And if you ask people for an example, they normally struggle, and depending on who they are
*  and what it's about. So it's certainly true that some people who have quite fringe viewpoints,
*  and who knows, the full rush of history in 500 years, they might be considered to be
*  path-breaking geniuses, but at the moment, quite fringe views. And they're just unhappy
*  that Wikipedia doesn't report on their fringe views as being mainstream. And that, by the way,
*  goes across all kinds of fields. I mean, I was once accosted on the street outside the TED
*  conference in Vancouver by a guy who was a homeopath, who was very upset that Wikipedia's
*  entry on homeopathy basically says it's pseudoscience. And he felt that was biased.
*  And I said, I can't really help you because we cite good quality sources to talk about the
*  scientific status, and it's not very good. So it depends. And I think it's something that we
*  should always be vigilant about. But in general, I think we're pretty good. And I think any time
*  you go to any serious political controversy, we should have a pretty balanced perspective on
*  who's saying what, what the views are, and so forth. I would actually argue that the areas where
*  we are more likely to have bias that persist for a long period of time are actually fairly obscure
*  things or maybe fairly non-political things. I just give, it's kind of a humorous example, but
*  it's meaningful. If you read our entries about Japanese anime, they tend to be very, very positive
*  and very favorable because almost no one knows about Japanese anime except for fans. And so the
*  people who come and spend their days writing Japanese anime articles, they love it. They kind
*  of have an inherent love for the whole area. Now, they'll, of course, being human beings,
*  they'll have their internal debates and disputes about what's better or not. But in general,
*  they're quite positive because nobody actually cares. On anything that people are quite
*  passionate about, then hopefully, there's quite a lot of interesting stuff. So I'll give an example,
*  a contemporary example where I think we've done a good job as of my most recent look at it.
*  And that is the question about the efficacy of masks during the COVID pandemic. And that's an
*  area where I would say the public authorities really kind of jerked us all around a bit.
*  The very first days, they said, whatever you do, don't rush on and buy masks. And their concern was
*  shortages in hospitals. Okay, fair enough. Later, it's like, no, everybody's got to wear a mask
*  everywhere. It really works really well. And then now, I think the evidence is mixed. Masks seem to
*  help. In my personal view, masks seem to help. They're no huge burden. You might as well wear
*  a mask in any environment where you're with a giant crowd of people and so forth. But it's
*  very politicized, that one. And it's very politicized where certainly in the US, much more so. I mean,
*  I live in the UK. I live in London. I've never seen kind of on the streets sort of the kind of
*  thing that there's a lot of reports of people actively angry because someone else is wearing
*  a mask, that sort of thing in public. And so because it became very politicized, then clearly
*  if Wikipedia... So anyway, if you go to Wikipedia and you research this topic, I think you'll find
*  more or less what I've just said. Actually, after it's all to this point in history,
*  it's mixed evidence. Masks seem to help, but maybe not as much as some of the authorities said. And
*  here we are. And that's kind of an example where I think, okay, we've done a good job, but I suspect
*  there are people on both sides of that very emotional debate who think this is ridiculous.
*  Hopefully, we've got quality sources. So then hopefully those people who read this can say,
*  oh, actually, it is complicated. If you can get to the point of saying, okay, I have my view,
*  but I understand other views and I do think it's a complicated question, great. Now we're a little
*  bit more mature as a society. Well, that one is an interesting one because I feel like I hope that
*  that article also contains the meta conversation about the politicization of that topic. To me,
*  it's almost more interesting than whether masks work or not. At least at this point, it's like why
*  it became... Masks became a symbol of the oppression of a centralized government if you wear them.
*  You're a sheep that follows the mass control, the mass hysteria of an authoritarian regime.
*  And if you don't wear a mask, then you are a science denier, anti-vaxxer, a alt-right,
*  probably a Nazi. Exactly. And that whole politicization of society is just so damaging.
*  And I don't know in the broader world, how do we start to fix that? That's a really hard question.
*  Well, at every moment, because you mentioned mainstream and fringe,
*  there seems to be a tension here. And I wonder what your philosophy is on it, because there's
*  mainstream ideas and there's fringe ideas. You look at lab leak theory for this virus,
*  there could be other things we can discuss where there's a mainstream narrative. Well,
*  if you just look at the percent of the population or the population with platforms, what they say,
*  and then what is a small percentage in opposition to that? And what is Wikipedia's responsibility
*  to accurately represent both the mainstream and the fringe, do you think?
*  Well, I think we have to try to do our best to recognize both, but also to appropriately
*  contextualize. And so, this can be quite hard, particularly when emotions are high.
*  That's just a fact about human beings. I'll give a simpler example, because there's not a
*  lot of emotion around it. Our entry on the moon doesn't say, some say the moon's made of rocks,
*  some say cheese, who knows? That kind of false neutrality is not what we want to get to.
*  That doesn't make any sense. But that one's easy. We all understand. I think there is a Wikipedia
*  entry called something like the moon is made of cheese, where it talks about this is a common
*  joke or thing that children say or that people tell to children or whatever. It's just a thing.
*  Everybody's heard moon's made of cheese. But nobody thinks, wow, Wikipedia is so one-sided,
*  it doesn't even acknowledge the cheese theory. I'd say the same thing about flat earth.
*  That's exactly what I'm looking up right now.
*  Very little controversy. We will have an entry about flat earth theorizing, flat earth people.
*  My personal view is most of the people who claim to be flat earthers are just having a laugh,
*  trolling, and more power to them, have some fun, but let's not be ridiculous.
*  Of course, for most of human history, people believe that the earth is flat. So
*  the article I'm looking at is actually kind of focusing on this history. Flat earth is an
*  archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many
*  ancient cultures subscribe to flat earth cosmography with pretty cool pictures of what a flat earth
*  would look like. Is that a dragon or angels on the edge? There's a lot of controversy about that.
*  What is on the edge? Is it the wall? Is it angels? Dragons? Is there a dome?
*  How can you fly from South Africa to Perth? Because on a flat earth
*  view, that's really too far for any plane to make it. It's all spread out.
*  What I want to know is what's on the other side, Jimmy. What's on the other side?
*  That's what all of us want to know. I presume there's probably a small section about
*  the conspiracy theory of flat earth because I think there's a sizable percent of the population
*  who at least will say they believe in a flat earth. I think it is a movement
*  that just says that the mainstream narrative, to have distrust and skepticism about the mainstream
*  narrative, which to a very small degree is probably a very productive thing to do as
*  part of the scientific process, but you can get a little silly and ridiculous with it.
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's exactly right. I think I find on many, many cases, and of course,
*  I like anybody else might quibble about this or that in any Wikipedia article,
*  but in general, I think there is a pretty good willingness and indeed eagerness to say,
*  oh, let's fairly represent all of the meaningfully important sides. There's still a lot to unpack in
*  that. Meaningfully important. People who are raising questions about the efficacy of masks,
*  okay, that's actually a reasonable thing to have a discussion about and hopefully we should treat
*  that as a fair conversation to have and actually address which authorities have said what and so
*  on and so forth. And then there are other cases where it's not meaningful opposition. You just
*  wouldn't say. I doubt if the main article, Moon, it may mention, geez, probably not even because
*  it's not credible and it's not even meant to be serious by anyone. Or the article on the earth
*  certainly won't have a paragraph that says, well, most scientists think it's round, but
*  certain people think flat. That's just a silly thing to put in that article.
*  You would want to address, that's an interesting cultural phenomenon. You want to put it somewhere.
*  So this goes into all kinds of things about politics. You want to be really careful,
*  really thoughtful about not getting caught up in the anger of our times and really recognize.
*  I remember being really kind of proud of the US at the time when McCain was running against Obama
*  because I thought, oh, I've got plenty of disagreements with both of them. But they both
*  seem like thoughtful and interesting people who I would have different disagreements with, but I
*  always felt like, yeah, like that's good. Now we can have a debate. Now we can have an interesting
*  debate and it isn't just sort of people slamming each other, personal attacks and so forth.
*  And you're saying Wikipedia also represented that.
*  I hope so. Yeah. And I think so in the main, obviously you can always find a debate that went
*  horribly wrong because there's humans involved. But speaking of those humans,
*  I would venture to guess, I don't know the data, maybe you can let me know, but the personal
*  political leaning of the group of people who edit Wikipedia probably leans left, I would guess.
*  So to me, the question there is, I mean, the same is true for Silicon Valley.
*  The task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased,
*  even though there is a bias for the engineers, engineers, engineers, engineers,
*  who create it. And I think I believe it's possible to do that. You know, there's kind of
*  conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible. And there's this whole conspiracy where the left
*  is controlling it and so on. I think, I think engineers for the most part went to create
*  platforms that are open and unbiased that are, that create all kinds of perspective because
*  that's super exciting to have all kinds of perspectives battle it out. But yeah,
*  still, is there, is there a degree to which the personal political bias of the editors might
*  seep in, in silly ways and in big ways? Silly ways could be, I think, hopefully I'm correct
*  in saying this, but the right will call it the Democrat Party. And the left will call it the
*  Democratic Party. Right? Like subtle, it always hits my ear weird, like, are we children here?
*  We're literally taking words and like just jabbing at each other. Like, yeah, I could,
*  I could like capitalize a thing in a certain way, or I can like just, just take a word and mess with
*  them. And that's a small way of how you use words. But you can also, you know, have a bigger way about,
*  about beliefs, about various perspectives on political events and Hunter Biden's laptop on
*  how big of a story that is or not, how big the censorship of that story is or not, that kind of,
*  and then there's these camps that take very strong points and they construct big narratives
*  around that. And I mean, it's very sizable percent of the population believes the two narratives
*  that compete with each other. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's really interesting. And it feels, but it's
*  hard to judge, you know, the, the sweep of history within your own lifetime. Yeah. But it feels like
*  it's gotten much worse that this idea of two parallel universes where people can agree on
*  certain basic facts feels worse than it used to be. And I'm not sure if that's true or if it just
*  feels that way, but also I'm not sure what the causes are. I think I would lay a lot of the blame
*  in recent years on social media algorithms, which reward clickbait headlines, which reward
*  tweets that go viral and they go viral because they're cute and clever. I mean, my most successful
*  tweet ever by a fairly wide margin, some reporter tweeted at Elon Musk, because he was completely
*  because he was complaining about Wikipedia or something. You should buy Wikipedia. And I just
*  wrote not for sale and you know, 90 zillion retweets and people liked it and it was all very good.
*  But I'm like, you know what? It's cute line, right? And it's a good like mic drop and all that. And I
*  was pleased with myself. Like it's really discourse, right? It's not really sort of the, what I like to
*  do, but it's what social media really rewards, which is kind of a, lets you and him have a fight.
*  Right. And that's more interesting. I mean, it's funny because at the time I was, I was texting with
*  Elon, who was very pleasant to me and all of that. He might've been a little bit shitty. The reporter
*  might've been a little bit shitty, but you fed into the shitty with snarky, funny response,
*  not for sale. And like, where do you, like what, so that's a funny little exchange and you could
*  probably after that laugh it off and it's fun. Well, like that kind of mechanism that rewards
*  the snark can go into viciousness. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and we certainly see it online, you know,
*  a series of tweets, you know, sort of a tweet thread of 15 tweets that assesses the quality
*  of the evidence for masks, pros and cons and sort of where this, that's not going to go viral,
*  you know, but, you know, a smack down for a famous politician who was famously in favor of mask,
*  who also went to a dinner and didn't wear a mask, that's going to go viral. And, you know, that,
*  that's partly human nature. You know, people love to call out hypocrisy and all of that,
*  but it's partly what these systems elevate automatically. I talk about this with respect
*  to Facebook, for example. So I think Facebook has done a pretty good job,
*  although it's taken longer than it should in some cases. But, you know, if you have a,
*  a very large following and you're really spouting hatred or, or misinformation,
*  disinformation, they've kicked people off. They've done, you know, some reasonable things there.
*  But actually the deeper issue is of this, this, the anger we're talking about of the,
*  the contentiousness of everything. I make a family example with two great stereotypes.
*  So one, the, the, the crackpot racist uncle and one, the sweet grandma. And I always want to
*  point out about all of my uncles in my family were wonderful people. So I didn't have a crackpot
*  racist, but everybody knows the stereotype. Well, so grandma, she just posts like sweet
*  comments on the kids' pictures and congratulates people on their wedding anniversary.
*  And crackpot uncle's posting his nonsense. And normally it's sort of at Christmas dinner,
*  everybody rolls their eyes. Oh yeah, uncle Frank's here. He's probably going to say some racist
*  comment and we're going to tell him to shut up or, you know, maybe let's not invite him this year.
*  You know, the normal human drama. He's got his three mates down at the pub who listen to him and,
*  and all of that. But now grandma's got, you know, 54 followers on Facebook,
*  which is the intimate family and racist uncle has 714. He's not a massive influence or whatever,
*  but how did that happen? It's because the algorithm notices, oh, when, when she posts,
*  nothing happens. He posts and then everybody jumps in to go, gosh, shut up on uncle Frank,
*  you know, like that's outrageous. And it's like, oh, there's engagement, there's page views,
*  there's ads, right? And, and those algorithms, I think they're working to improve that, but it's
*  really hard for them. It's hard to improve that if that actually is working. If the people who
*  are saying things that get engagement, if it's not too awful, but it's just, you know, like maybe
*  it's not a racist uncle, but maybe it's an uncle who posts a lot about what an idiot Biden is,
*  right? Which isn't necessarily an offensive or blockable or banable thing. And it shouldn't be,
*  but if that's the discourse that gets elevated because it gets a rise out of people,
*  then suddenly in a society, it's like, oh, this is, we get more of what we reward. So I, I think
*  that's a piece of what's gone on. Well, if we could just take that tangent, I'm having a conversation
*  with Mark Zuckerberg a second time. Is there something you can comment on how to decrease
*  toxicity on that particular platform Facebook? You also have worked on creating a social network
*  that is less toxic yourself. So can we just talk about the different ideas that these already big
*  social networks can do and what you have been trying to do? So a piece of it is, it's hard.
*  The problem with making a recommendation to Facebook is that I actually believe
*  their business model makes it really hard for them. And I'm not anti-capitalism. I'm not, you
*  know, great, somebody's got business, they're making money. That's not, that's not where I come
*  from. But certain business models mean you are going to prioritize things that maybe aren't that
*  long-term helpful. And so that's a big piece of it. So certainly for Facebook, you could say,
*  you know, with vast resources, start to prioritize content that's higher quality,
*  that's healing, that's kind. Try not to prioritize content that seems to be just getting
*  a rise out of people. Now those are vague human descriptions, right? But I do believe
*  good machine learning algorithms, you can optimize in slightly different ways.
*  But to do that, you may have to say, actually, we're not necessarily going to increase pay views
*  to the maximum extent right now. And I've said this to people at Facebook, it's like,
*  you know, if your actions are, you know, convincing people that you're breaking
*  Western civilization, that's really bad for business in the long run. Certainly, these days,
*  I'll say Twitter is the thing that's on people's minds as being more upsetting at the moment. But
*  I think it's true. And so one of the things that's really interesting about Facebook, compared to a
*  lot of companies is that Mark has a pretty unprecedented amount of power. His ability
*  to name members of the board, his control of the company is pretty hard to break. Even if
*  financial results aren't as good as they could be, because he's taken a step back from
*  the perfect optimization to say, actually, for the long term health in the next 50 years
*  of this organization, we need to rein in some of the things that are working for us and making
*  money because they're actually giving us a bad reputation. So one of the recommendations I would
*  say is, and this is not to do with the algorithms and all that, but you know, how about just a
*  moratorium on all political advertising? I don't think it's their most profitable segment,
*  but it's given rise to a lot of deep hard questions about dark money, about, you know,
*  ads that are run by questionable people that push false narratives or, you know, the classic kind
*  of thing is you run, I saw a study about Brexit in the UK where people were talking about there
*  were ads run to animal rights activists saying, finally, when we're out from under Europe, the UK
*  can pass proper animal rights legislation. We're not constrained by the European process. Similarly,
*  for people who are advocates of fox hunting to say, finally, when we're out of Europe, we can
*  reimplement. So you're telling people what they want to hear. And in some cases, it's really hard
*  for journalists to see that. So it used to be that for political advertising, you really needed to
*  find some kind of mainstream narrative. And this is still true to an extent, mainstream narrative that
*  60% of people can say, oh, I can buy into that, which meant it pushed you to the center. It pushed
*  you to sort of try and find some nuanced balance. But if your main method of recruiting people is
*  an a tiny little one on one conversation with them, because you're able to target using
*  targeted advertising, suddenly you don't need consistent using a really good
*  targeting operation, really good Cambridge analytic style, machine learning algorithm data
*  to convince people. And that just feels really problematic. So I mean, until they can think
*  about how to solve that problem, I would just say, you know what, it's going to cost us X amount,
*  but it's going to be worth it to kind of say, you know what, we actually think our political
*  advertising policy hasn't really helped contribute to discourse and dialogue and finding reasoned,
*  you know, middle ground and compromise solution. So let's just not do that for a while until we
*  figure that out. So that's maybe a piece of advice. And coupled with, as you were saying,
*  recommender systems for the newsfeed and other contexts that don't always optimize engagement,
*  but optimize the long term mental wellbeing and balance and growth of a human being.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a very difficult problem.
*  It's a difficult problem. Yeah. And, you know, so in, with WT social, WikiTropics social,
*  we're launching in a few months time, a completely new system, new domain name, new lots of things.
*  But the idea is to say, let's, let's focus on trust. People can rate each other as trustworthy,
*  rate content as trustworthy. You have to start from somewhere. So we'll start with a core base
*  of our tiny community who I think are sensible, thoughtful people want to recruit more, but to
*  say, you know what, actually let's have that as a pretty strong element to say, let's not optimize
*  based on what gets the most page views in this session. Let's optimize on what sort of the
*  feedback from people is. This is meaningfully enhancing my life. And so part of that is,
*  and it's probably not a good business model, but part of that is say, okay, we're not going to
*  pursue an advertising business model, but a, you know, membership model where, you know, you can,
*  you don't have to be a member, but you can pay to be a member. You maybe get some benefit from that,
*  but in general to say, actually the problem with, and actually the division I would say is,
*  and the analogy I would give is broadcast television funded by advertising gives you
*  a different result than paying for HBO, paying for Netflix, paying for whatever. And the reason is,
*  you know, if you think about it, what is your incentive as a TV producer, you're going to make
*  a comedy for ABC network in the U S you basically say, I want something that almost everybody will
*  like and listen to. So it tends to be a little blander, you know, family friendly, whatever.
*  Whereas if you say, oh, actually I'm going to use the HBO example and an old example, you say,
*  you know what? Sopranos isn't for everybody. Sex and the city isn't for everybody, but between
*  the two shows, we've got something for everybody that they're willing to pay for. So you can get
*  edgier, higher quality in my view content rather than saying it's got to not offend anybody in the
*  world. It's got to be for everybody, which is really hard. So same thing, you know, here in a
*  social network, if your business model is advertising, it's going to drive you in one direction.
*  If your business model is membership, I think it drives you in a different direction. I actually,
*  and I've said this to Elon about Twitter blue, which I think wasn't rolled out well and so forth,
*  but it's like, the piece of that that I like is to say, look, actually if there's a model
*  where your revenue is coming from people who are willing to pay for the service,
*  even if it's only part of your revenue, if it's a substantial part, that does change your broader
*  incentives to say, actually, are people going to be willing to pay for something that's actually
*  just toxicity in their lives? No, I'm not sure it's been rolled out well. I'm not sure how it's going.
*  And maybe I'm wrong about that as a plausible business model. But I do think it's interesting
*  to think about just in broad terms, business model drives outcomes in sometimes surprising
*  ways unless you really pause to think about it. So if we can just linger on Twitter and Elon
*  before I would love to talk to you about the underlying business model, Wikipedia, which is
*  this brilliant bold move at the very beginning. But since you mentioned Twitter, what do you think
*  works? What do you think is broken about Twitter? It's a long conversation. But to start with,
*  one of the things that I always say is it's a really hard problem. So I can see that right
*  up front. I said this about the old ownership of Twitter and the new ownership of Twitter,
*  because unlike Wikipedia, and this is true actually for all social media, there's a box.
*  And the box basically says, what do you think? What's on your mind? You can write whatever the
*  hell you want. This is true, by the way, even for YouTube. I mean, the box is to upload a video,
*  but again, it's just like an open-ended invitation to express yourself. And what makes that hard is
*  some people have really toxic, really bad, some people are very aggressive, they're actually
*  stalking, they're actually abusive. And suddenly you deal with a lot of problems.
*  Whereas at Wikipedia, there is no box that says, what's on your mind? There's a box that says,
*  this is an entry about the moon. Please be neutral, please cite your facts. Then there's
*  a talk page, which is not coming rant about Donald Trump. If you go on the talk page of
*  the Donald Trump entry and you just start ranting about Donald Trump, people would say, what are
*  you doing? Stop doing that. We're not here to discuss, there's a whole world of the internet
*  out there for you to go and rant about Donald Trump. It's just not fun to do on Wikipedia,
*  somehow it's fun on Twitter. Well, also on Wikipedia, people are going to say stop.
*  And actually, are you here to tell us how can we improve the article or are you just here to rant
*  about Trump? Because that's not actually interesting. So because the goal is different,
*  so that's just admitting and saying upfront, this is a hard problem. Certainly, I'm writing
*  a book on trust. So the idea is, in the last 20 years, we've lost trust in all kinds of
*  institutions and politics. The Edelman Trust Barometer Survey has been done for a long time.
*  Trust in politicians, trust in journalism, it's declined substantially, and I think,
*  in many cases, deservedly. So how do we restore trust and how do we think about that?
*  Does that also include trust in the idea of truth?
*  Trust in the idea of truth, even the concept of facts and truth is really, really important.
*  And the idea of uncomfortable truths is really important. So when we look at
*  Twitter, and we say, we can see, okay, this is really hard. So here's my story about Twitter.
*  It's a two-part story and it's all pre-Elon Musk ownership. So many years back,
*  somebody accused me of horrible crimes on Twitter. And like anybody would, I'm in the public eye,
*  people say bad things, I don't really, I brush it off, whatever. But I'm like, this is actually
*  really bad, accusing me of pedophilia. That's just not okay. So I thought, I'm going to report this.
*  So I click report, I report the tweet, and there's five others, and I go through the process. And
*  then I get an email that says, whatever, a couple of hours later saying, thank you for your report,
*  we're looking into this. Great, okay, good. Then several hours further, I get an email back saying,
*  sorry, we don't see anything here to violate our terms of use. And I'm like, okay. So I emailed
*  Jack and I say, Jack, come on, this is ridiculous. And he emails back roughly saying, yeah, sorry,
*  Jimmy, don't worry, we'll sort this out. And I just thought to myself, you know what?
*  That's not the point, right? I'm Jimmy Wales, I know Jack Dorsey, I can email Jack Dorsey,
*  he'll listen to me because he's got an email from me and sorts it out for me. What about the
*  teenager who's being bullied and is getting abuse, right? And getting accusations that aren't true,
*  are they getting the same kind of like really poor result in that case? So fast forward a few years,
*  same thing happens, the exact quote I was going to say, please help me, I'm only 10 years old and
*  Jimmy Wales raped me last week. I was like, come on, fuck off, that's ridiculous. So I report,
*  I'm like, this time I'm reporting, but I'm thinking, well, we'll see what happens.
*  This one gets even worse because then I get a same result email back saying, sorry, we don't
*  see any problems. So I raise it with other members of the board who I know and Jack and like, this is
*  really ridiculous, like this is outrageous. And some of the board members, friends of mine,
*  sympathetic and so good for them, but actually got an email back then from the general counsel,
*  head of trust and safety saying, actually, there's nothing in this tweet that violates
*  our terms of service, we don't regard and gave reference to the Me Too movement. If we didn't
*  allow accusations, the Me Too movement, it's an important thing. And I was like, you know what,
*  actually, if someone says I'm 10 years old and someone raped me last week, I think the advice
*  should be, here's the phone number of the police. Like you need to get the police involved, Twitter
*  is not the place for that accusation. So even back then, by the way, they did delete those tweets,
*  but I mean, the rationale they gave is spammy behavior. So completely separate from abusing me,
*  it was just like, oh, well, they were retweeting too often. Okay, whatever. So like, that's just
*  broken. Like that's a system that it's not working for people in the public eye. I'm sure it's not
*  working for private people who get abuse, really horrible abuse can happen. So how is that today?
*  Well, it hasn't happened to me since Elon took over, but I don't see why it couldn't. And I
*  suspect now if I send a report and email someone, there's no one there to email me back because
*  he's gotten rid of a lot of the trust and safety staff. So I suspect that problem is still really
*  hard. Just content moderation at huge scales. At huge scales is really something. And I don't know
*  the full answer to this. I mean, a piece of it could be, you know, to say actually making
*  specific allegations of crimes. This isn't the place to do that. You know, we've got a huge
*  database. If you've got an accusation of crime, here's who you should call the police, the FBI,
*  whatever it is. It's not to be done in public. And then you do face really complicated questions
*  about MeToo movement and people coming forward in public and all of that. But again, it's like,
*  probably you should talk to a journalist, right? Probably there are better avenues than just
*  tweeting from an account that was created 10 days ago, obviously set up to abuse someone.
*  So I think they could do a lot better. But I also admit it's a hard problem.
*  And there's also ways to indirectly or more humorously or a more mocking way to make the
*  same kinds of accusations. In fact, the accusations you mentioned, if I were to guess,
*  don't go that viral because they're not funny enough or cutting enough. But if you make it witty
*  and cutting and, and meme it somehow, sometimes actually indirectly making accusations versus
*  directly make the accusation. I can go viral and they can destroy reputations and you get to watch
*  yourself. Just all kinds of narratives take hold. Yeah. No, I mean, I remember another
*  case that didn't bother me because it wasn't of that nature. But somebody was saying, you know,
*  I'm sure you're making millions off of Wikipedia. I'm like, no, actually, I don't even work there.
*  I have no salary. And they're like, you're lying. I'm going to check your 990 form,
*  which is the US form for tax reporting for charities. Yeah, knock it. Here's the link. Go
*  read it and you'll see I'm listed as a board member and my salary is listed as zero. So,
*  you know, so, you know, things like that. It's like, okay, that one that feels like you're wrong,
*  but I can take that and I can, we can have that debate quite quickly. And again, it didn't go
*  viral because it was kind of silly. And if anything would have gone viral, it was me responding.
*  But that's one where it's like, actually, I'm happy to respond because a lot of people don't know
*  that I don't work there and that I don't make millions. And I'm not a billion. Well, they must
*  know that because it's in most news media about me. But the other one I didn't respond to publicly
*  because it's like, Barbra Streisand effect, you know, it's like sometimes calling attention to
*  someone who's abusing you who basically has no followers and so on is just a waste. And everything
*  you're describing now is just something that all of us have to kind of learn. Because everybody's
*  in the public eye. I think when you have just two followers and you get bullied by one of the
*  followers, it hurts just as much as when you have a large number. So it's not your situation, I think,
*  is echoed in the situations of millions of other, especially teenagers and kids and so on.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's actually an example. So we don't generally use my picture and the
*  banners anymore on Wikipedia, but we did. And then we did an experiment one year where we
*  tried other people's pictures. So one of our developers, and, you know, one guy, lovely,
*  very sweet guy. And he doesn't look like your immediate thought of a nerdy Silicon Valley
*  developer. He looks like a heavy metal dude because he's cool. And so suddenly here he is with long
*  hair and tattoos. And there's his sort of say, here's what your money goes for. Here's my letter
*  asking for support. And he got massive abuse from Wikipedia, like calling him creepy and, you know,
*  like really massive. And this was being shown to 80 million people a day. His picture, not the abuse,
*  right? The abuse was elsewhere on the internet. And he was bothered by it. And I thought, you know
*  what? There is a difference. I actually am in the public eye. I get huge benefits from being in the
*  public eye. I go around and make public speeches. If any random thing I think of, I can write and
*  get it published in the New York Times and, you know, have this interesting life. He's not a public
*  figure. And so actually he wasn't mad at us. He was just like, yeah, actually suddenly being
*  thrust in the public eye and you get suddenly lots of abuse, which normally, you know, if you're a
*  teenager and somebody in your class is abusing you, it's not going to go viral. So you're only going
*  to be hurtful because it's local and it's your classmates or whatever. But when, when sort of
*  ordinary people go viral in some abusive way, it's really, really quite tragic. I don't know. I mean,
*  even at a small scale, it feels viral when the five people, five people at your school and there's a
*  rumor and there's this feeling like you're surrounded and nobody, and the feeling of loneliness, I think,
*  which you're speaking to when you don't have a plat, when you at least feel like you don't
*  have a platform to defend yourself. And then this powerlessness that I think a lot of teenagers
*  definitely feel and a lot of people, I think you're right. And that, I think even when just like two
*  people make up stuff about you or lie about you or say mean things about you or bully you, that can
*  feel like a crowd. Yeah, yeah. That's it. And it's a tear. I mean, whatever that is in our genetics
*  and our biology and our, the way our brain works, it just can be a terrifying experience. And
*  somehow to correct that, I mean, I think because everybody feels the pain of that,
*  everybody suffers the pain of that, I think we'll be forced to fix that as a society to figure out
*  a way around that. I think it's really hard to fix because I don't think that problem
*  isn't necessarily new. You know, someone in high school who writes graffiti that says Becky has a
*  slut and spreads a rumor about what Becky did last weekend. That's always been damaging. It's
*  always been hurtful and that's really hard. Those kinds of attacks there is all the time itself.
*  They precede the internet. Now, what do you think about this technology that feels
*  Wikipedia like, which is community notes on Twitter? Do you like it? Yeah. Pros and cons.
*  Do you think it's scalable? I do like it. I don't know enough about specifically how it's implemented
*  to really have a very deep view, but I do think it's quite, it's the uses I've seen of it, I've
*  found quite good. And in some cases, changed my mind. You know, it's like I see something.
*  And of course, you know, the sort of human tendency is to retweet something that you
*  hope is true or that you are afraid is true. Or, you know, it's like that kind of quick mental
*  action. And then, you know, I saw something that I liked and agreed with and then a community note
*  under it that made me think, oh, actually, this is a more nuanced issue. So I like that. I think
*  that's really important. Now, how is it specifically implemented? Is it scalable?
*  I don't really know how they've done it, so I can't really comment on that. But in general,
*  I do think it's, you know, when you're only mechanisms on Twitter, and you're a big Twitter
*  user, you know, we know the platform and you've got plenty of followers and all of that. The only
*  mechanisms are retweeting, replying, blocking. It's a pretty limited scope, and it's kind of good if
*  there's a way to elevate a specific thoughtful response. And it can be a little bit more
*  specific, thoughtful response. And it kind of goes to, again, like, does the algorithm just pick
*  the retweet or the, I mean, retweeting, it's not even the algorithm that makes it viral. Like,
*  you know, if Paolo Quello, very famous author, I think he's got like, I don't know, I haven't
*  looked lately. He used to have 8 million Twitter followers. I think I looked at, he's got 16 million
*  now or whatever. Well, if he retweets something, it's going to get seen a lot. Or Elon Musk,
*  if he retweets something, it's going to get seen a lot. That's not an algorithm. That's just the way
*  the platform works. So it is kind of nice if you have something else and how that something else
*  is designed. That's obviously a complicated question. Well, there's this interesting thing
*  that I think Twitter is doing, but I know Facebook is doing for sure, which is really interesting.
*  So you have, what are the signals that a human can provide at scale? Like in Twitter, it's retweet.
*  In Facebook, I think you can share. I think, yeah, but there's basic interactions. You can
*  have comment and so on. But there's also in Facebook, and YouTube has this too, is,
*  would you like to see more of this or would you like to see less of this?
*  They post that sometimes. And the thing that the neural net that's learning from that has to figure
*  out is the intent behind you saying, I want to see less of this. Did you see too much of this
*  content already? You like it, but you don't want to see so much of it. You already figured it out.
*  Great. Or does this content not make you feel good? There's so many interpretations that I'd
*  like to see less of this. But if you get that kind of signal, this actually can create a really
*  powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day. That doesn't create an echo
*  chamber or silo. It actually just makes you feel good in the good way, which is like it challenges
*  you, but it doesn't exhaust you and make you kind of this weird animal. I've been saying for a long
*  time, if I went on Facebook one morning and they said, oh, we're testing a new option,
*  rather than showing you things we think you're going to like, we want to show you some things
*  that we think you will disagree with, but which we have some signals that suggest it's of quality.
*  Now that sounds interesting. I want to see something where, oh, I don't agree with it.
*  So Larry Lessig is a good friend of mine, founder of Creative Commons, and he's moved on to doing
*  stuff about corruption and politics and so on. And I don't always agree with Larry, but I always
*  grapple with Larry because he's so interesting and he's so thoughtful that even when we don't agree,
*  I'm like, actually, I want to hear him out, right? Because I'm going to learn from it.
*  And that doesn't mean I always come around to agree with him, but I'm going to understand
*  a perspective and that's really great feeling. Yeah. There's this interesting thing on social
*  media where people kind of accuse others of saying, well, you don't want to hear opinions
*  that you disagree with or ideas you disagree with. I think this is something that's thrown at me all
*  the time. The reality is there's literally almost nothing I enjoy more. It's a odd thing to accuse
*  you of because you have quite a wide range of long conversations with a very diverse bunch of people.
*  But there is a very harsh drop off because what I like is high quality disagreement that really
*  makes me think. And at a certain point, there's a threshold, it's kind of a gray area when the
*  quality of the disagreement, it just sounds like mocking and you're not really interested
*  in a deep understanding of the topic or you yourself don't seem to carry deep understanding
*  of the topic. There's something called intelligence squared debates. The main one is the British
*  version with the British accent, everything always sounds better. And the Brits seem to argue
*  more intensely, they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate. Those people, I often
*  disagree with basically everybody involved and it's so fun. I learned something that's high quality.
*  If we could do that, if there's some way for me to click a button that says,
*  filter out lower quality, just today. You sometimes show it to me because I want to be able to, but
*  today I'm just not in the mood for the mockery. Just high quality stuff. Even flat earth, I want
*  to get high quality arguments for the flat earth. It would make me feel good because I would see,
*  that's really interesting. I never really thought in my mind to challenge the mainstream narrative
*  of general relativity, of a perception of physics. Maybe all of reality, maybe all of space time is
*  an illusion. That's really interesting. I never really thought about, let me consider that fully.
*  What's the evidence? How do you test that? What are the alternatives? How would you be
*  able to have such consistent perception of a physical reality if all of it is an illusion?
*  All of us seem to share the same kind of perception of reality. That's the kind of stuff I love,
*  but not like the mockery of it. It seems that social media can inspire.
*  I talk sometimes about how people assume that the big debates in Wikipedia, the arguments
*  are between the party of the left and the party of the right. I would say, no, it's actually
*  the party of the kind and thoughtful and the party of the jerks is really it. Left and right,
*  bring me somebody I disagree with politically as long as they're thoughtful, kind. We're going to
*  have a real discussion. I give an example of our article on abortion. If you can bring together a
*  kind and thoughtful Catholic priest and a kind and thoughtful planned paranoid activist,
*  and they're going to work together on the article on abortion, that can be a really great thing
*  if they're both kind and thoughtful. That's the important part. They're never going to agree
*  on the topic, but they will understand, okay, Wikipedia is not going to take a side,
*  but Wikipedia is going to explain what the debate is about, and we're going to
*  try to characterize it fairly. It turns out your kind and thoughtful people,
*  even if they're quite ideological, like a Catholic priest is generally going to be quite
*  ideological on the subject of abortion, but they can grapple with ideas and they can discuss,
*  and they may feel very proud of the entry at the end of the day, not because they suppress the
*  other side's views, but because they think the case has been stated very well that other people
*  can come to understand it. And if you're highly ideological, you assume, I think naturally,
*  if people understood as much about this as I do, they'll probably agree with me. You may be wrong
*  about that, but that's often the case. So that's what I think we need to encourage more of
*  in society generally, is grappling with ideas in a really thoughtful way.
*  RG So is it possible if the majority of volunteers, editors of Wikipedia,
*  really dislike Donald Trump, are they still able to write an article that empathizes with the
*  perspective of, for a time at least, a very large percentage of the United States that were
*  supporters of Donald Trump, and to have a full, broad representation of him as a human being,
*  him as a political leader, him as a set of policies promised and implemented, all that kind of stuff?
*  JS Yeah, I think so. And I think if you read the article, it's pretty good. And I think a piece of
*  that is within our community, if people have the self-awareness to understand, so I personally
*  wouldn't go and edit the entry on Donald Trump. I get emotional about it and I'm like,
*  I'm not good at this. And if I tried to do it, I would fail. I wouldn't be a good Wikipedia.
*  So it's better if I just step back and let people who are more dispassionate on this topic,
*  edit it. Whereas there are other topics that are incredibly emotional to some people,
*  where I can actually do quite well. I'm going to be okay. Maybe we were discussing earlier
*  the efficacy of masks. I'm like, oh, I think that's an interesting problem. And I don't know the
*  answer, but I can help kind of catalog what's the best evidence and so on. I'm not going to get
*  upset. I'm not going to get angry. I'm able to be a good Wikipedia. So I think that's important.
*  And I do think though, in a related framework, that the composition of the community is really
*  important. Not because Wikipedia is or should be a battleground, but because blind spots. Maybe I
*  don't even realize what's biased. If I'm particularly of a certain point of view and
*  I've never thought much about it. So one of the things we focus on a lot, the Wikipedia volunteers
*  are, we don't know the exact number, but let's say 80% plus male. And there are certain demographic,
*  they tend to be college educated, heavier on tech geeks than not, et cetera, et cetera.
*  So there is a demographic to the community and that's pretty much global. I mean, somebody said
*  to me once, why is it only white men who edit Wikipedia? And I said, you've obviously not met
*  the Japanese Wikipedia community. It's kind of a joke because the broader principle still stands.
*  Who edits Japanese Wikipedia? A bunch of geeky men, right? And women as well. So we do have women
*  in the community and that's very important. But we do think, okay, you know what? That does lead
*  to some problems. It leads to some content issues simply because people write more about what they
*  know and what they're interested in. They'll tend to be dismissive of things as being unimportant
*  if it's not something that they personally have an interest in. I like the example as a parent,
*  I would say our entries on early childhood development probably aren't as good as they
*  should be because a lot of the Wikipedia volunteers, actually we're getting older,
*  the Wikipedia, so the demographic has changed a bit. But it's like if you've got a bunch of
*  25 year old tech geek dudes who don't have kids, they're just not going to be interested
*  in early childhood development. And if they tried to write about it, they probably wouldn't
*  do a good job because they don't know anything about it. And somebody did a look at our entries
*  on novelists who've won a major literary prize. And they looked at the male novelists versus the
*  female. And the male novelists had longer and higher quality entries. And why is that? Well,
*  it's not because, because I know hundreds of Wikipedians, it's not because these are a bunch
*  of biased, sexist men who are like books by women are not important. It's like, no, actually there
*  is a gender kind of breakdown of readership. There are books, like hard science fiction is
*  a classic example, hard science fiction, mostly read by men. Other types of novels, more read by
*  women. And if we don't have women in the community, then these award winning, clearly important
*  novelists may have less coverage. And not because anybody consciously thinks,
*  oh, we don't like what a book by Maya Angelou, like who cares? She's a poet, like that's not
*  interesting. No, but just because people write what they know, they write what they're interested
*  in. So we do think diversity in the community is really important. And that's one area where I do
*  think it's really clear. But I can also say, you know what, actually, that also applies in the
*  political sphere. Like to say, actually, we do want kind and thoughtful Catholic priests,
*  kind and thoughtful conservatives, kind and thoughtful libertarians, kind and thoughtful
*  Marxists, you know, to come in. But the key is the kind and thoughtful piece. So when people
*  sometimes come to Wikipedia outraged by some, you know, dramatic thing that's happened on Twitter,
*  they come to Wikipedia with a chip on their shoulder ready to do battle. And it just doesn't
*  work out very well, you know? And there's tribes in general where I think there's a responsibility
*  on the larger group to be even kinder and more welcoming to the smaller group.
*  Yeah, we think that's really important. And so, you know, oftentimes, people come in and,
*  you know, there's a lot. When I talk about community health, one of the aspects of that,
*  that we do think about a lot that I think about a lot is not about politics. It's just like,
*  how are we treating newcomers to the community? And so I can tell you what our ideals are,
*  what our philosophy is. But do we live up to that? So, you know, the ideal is you come to Wikipedia,
*  you know, we have rules, like one of our fundamental rules is ignore all rules,
*  which is partly written that way because it piques people's attention. Like, what the hell kind of
*  rule is that, you know? But basically says, look, don't get nervous and depressed about a bunch of,
*  you know, what's the formatting of your footnote, right? So you shouldn't come to Wikipedia,
*  add a link and then get banned or yelled at because it's not the right format.
*  Instead, somebody should go, oh, hey, yeah, thanks for helping. But, you know, here's the link to
*  how to format, you know, if you want to keep going, you might want to learn how to format a
*  footnote and to be friendly and to be open and to say, oh, right, oh, you're new and you clearly
*  don't know everything about Wikipedia. And, you know, sometimes in any community that can be quite
*  hard. So people come in and they've got a great big idea and they're going to propose this to the
*  Wikipedia community and they have no idea. That's basically a perennial discussion we've had
*  7,000 times before. And so then ideally you would say to the person, oh, yeah, great, thanks. Like,
*  a lot of people have, and here's where we got to and here's the nuanced conversation we've had
*  about that in the past that I think you'll find interesting. And sometimes people are just like,
*  oh, God, another one, you know, who's come in with this idea which doesn't work and they don't
*  understand why. You can lose patience, but you shouldn't. And that's kind of human, you know.
*  But I think it just does require really thinking, you know, in a self-aware manner of like, oh,
*  I was once a newbie. Actually, we do have, we have a great, I just did an interview with
*  Emily Temple Woods who, she was Wikipedia of the Year. She's just like a great, well-known
*  Wikipedia. And I interviewed her for my book and she told me something I never knew. Apparently,
*  it's not secret. Like, she didn't reveal it to me, but is that when she started at Wikipedia,
*  she was a vandal. She came in and vandalized Wikipedia. And then basically what happened was
*  she'd done some sort of, vandalized a couple of articles. And then somebody popped up on her talk
*  page and said, hey, like, why are you doing this? Like, we're trying to make an encyclopedia here.
*  This wasn't very kind. And she felt so bad. She's like, oh, right, I didn't really think of it that
*  way. She just was coming in as, she was like 13 years old, combative and, you know, like having fun
*  and trolling a bit. And then she's like, oh, actually, oh, I see your point and became a great
*  Wikipedia. And so that's the ideal, really, is that you don't just go, throw a block, fuck off.
*  You go, hey, you know, like, what gives, you know? Which is, I think the way we tend to treat things
*  in real life, you know, if you've got somebody who's doing something obnoxious in your friend
*  group, you probably go, hey, like, really, I don't know if you've noticed, but I think this person is
*  actually quite hurt that you keep making that joke about them. And then they usually go, oh, you know
*  what? I didn't, I thought that was okay. I didn't, and then they stop or they keep it up and then
*  everybody goes, well, you're the asshole. Well, yeah, I mean, that's just an example that gives
*  me faith in humanity that, that we're all capable and wanting to be kind to each other. And in
*  general, this, the fact that there's a small group of volunteers, they're able to contribute so much
*  to the organization, the collection, the discussion of all of human knowledge is so,
*  it makes me so grateful to be part of this whole human project. That's one of the reasons I love
*  Wikipedia is gives me faith in humanity. Yeah. No, I once was at Wikimania's, our annual
*  conference and people come from all around the world, like really active volunteers.
*  I was at the dinner, we were in Egypt at Wikimania in Alexandria, at the sort of closing dinner or
*  whatever. And a friend of mine came and sat at the table and she's sort of been in the movement more
*  broadly, Creative Commons. She's not really a Wikipedian. She'd come to the conference
*  because she's into Creative Commons and all that. So we have dinner and it just turned out, I sat
*  down at the table with most of the members of the English Language Arbitration Committee. And they're
*  a bunch of very sweet, geeky Wikipedians. And as we left the table, I said to her, it's really like,
*  I still find this kind of sense of amazement. Like we just had dinner with some of the most powerful
*  people in English language media, because they're the people who are like the final court of appeal
*  in English Wikipedia. And thank goodness they're not media moguls, right? They're just a bunch
*  of geeks who are just like well-liked in the community because they're kind and they're
*  thoughtful and they really sort of think about things. I was like, this is great, lovely media.
*  Yeah. It's like to the degree that geeks
*  run the best aspect of human civilization brings me joy in all aspects. And this is
*  true in programming, like Linux, like programmers, like people that kind of specialize in a thing
*  and they don't really get caught up in into the mess of the bickering of society. They just kind
*  of do their thing and they value the craftsmanship of it, the competence of it.
*  If you've never heard of this or looked into it, you'll enjoy it. I read something recently that
*  I didn't even know about, but like the fundamental like time zones and they change from time to time.
*  Sometimes a country will pass daylight savings or move it by a week, whatever. There's a file
*  that's on all sort of Unix-based computers and basically all computers end up using this file.
*  It's the official time zone file, but why is it official? It's just this one guy.
*  It's like this guy and a group, a community around him. And basically something weird happened
*  and it broke something because he was on vacation. And I'm just like, isn't that wild, right? That
*  first of all, most people never even think about like how do computers know about time zones?
*  Well, they know because they just use this file which tells all the time zones and which
*  dates they change and all of that. But there's just one guy and he doesn't get paid for it.
*  It's just he's like, with all the billions of people on the planet, he sort of put his hand up
*  and goes, yo, I'll take care of the time zones. And there's a lot of programmers listening to
*  this right now with PTSD about time zones. And then there's on top of this one guy,
*  there's other libraries, the different programming languages that help manage the time zones for you,
*  but still there's just within those, it's amazing just the packages, the libraries,
*  how few people build them out of their own love for building, for creating, for community and all
*  of that. I almost like don't want to interfere with the natural habitat of the geek.
*  When you spot them in the wild, you just want to be like, whoa, careful. That thing is treasured.
*  I met a guy many years ago, lovely, really sweet guy. And he was running a bot on English Wikipedia
*  that I thought, wow, that's actually super clever. What he had done is his bot was like
*  spell checking. But rather than simple spell checking, what he had done is create a database
*  of words that are commonly mistaken for other words. They're spelled wrong, so I can't even
*  give an example. And so the word is, people often spell it wrong, but no spell checker catches it
*  because it is another word. And so what he did is he wrote a bot that looks for these words
*  and then checks the sentence around it for certain keywords. So in some context,
*  this isn't correct, but buoy and buoy. People sometimes type B-O-Y when they mean B-O-U-Y.
*  So if he sees the word buoy, B-O-Y in an article, he would look in the context and see,
*  is this a nautical reference? And if it was, he didn't auto correct, he just would flag it up
*  to himself to go, oh, check this one out. And that's not a great example, but he had
*  thousands of examples. And I was like, that's amazing. I would have never thought to do that.
*  And I'm glad that somebody did. And that's also part of the openness of the system. And also,
*  I think, being a charity, being this idea of actually, this is a gift to the world
*  that makes someone go, oh, well, I'll put my hand up. I see a little piece of things that I can make
*  better because I'm a good programmer and I can write this script to do this thing, and I'll find
*  it fun. Amazing. Well, I got to ask about this big, bold decision at the very beginning to not do
*  advertisements on the website. And just in general, the philosophy of the business model,
*  Wikipedia, what went behind that? Yeah. So I think most people know this,
*  but we're a charity. So in the US, you know, registered as a charity. And we don't have any
*  ads on the site. And the vast majority of the money is from donations, but the vast majority
*  from small donors. So people giving 25 bucks or whatever. If you're listening to this, go donate.
*  Go donate. Donate now. I've donated so many times. And we have millions of donors every year,
*  but it's like a small percentage of people. I would say in the early days, a big part of it was
*  aesthetic almost as much as anything else. It was just like, I just think I don't really want ads
*  on Wikipedia. Like, I just think it would be, there's a lot of reasons why it might not be good.
*  And even back then, I didn't think as much as I have since about a business model can tend to
*  drive you in a certain place. And really thinking that through in advance is really important,
*  because you might say, yeah, we're really, really keen on community control and neutrality.
*  But if we had an advertising-based business model, probably that would begin to erode. Even
*  if I believe in it very strongly, organizations tend to follow the money in the DNA in the long
*  run. And so things like, I mean, it's easy to think about some of the immediate problems. So
*  if you go to read about, I don't know, Nissan, car company, and if you saw an ad for the new
*  Nissan at the top of the page, you might be like, did they pay for this? Or do the advertisers have
*  influence over the content? Because you kind of wonder about that for all kinds of media.
*  And that undermines trust.
*  Undermines trust, right? But also things like, we don't have clickbait headlines in Wikipedia.
*  You've never seen Wikipedia entries with all this kind of listicles, sort of the 10 funniest cat
*  pictures, number seven, make you cry. None of that kind of stuff, because there's no incentive,
*  no reason to do that. Also, there's no reason to have an algorithm to say, actually, we're going
*  to use our algorithm to drive you to stay on the website longer. We're going to use the algorithm
*  to drive you to, you know, it's like, oh, you're reading about Queen Victoria. There's nothing to
*  sell you when you're reading about Queen Victoria. Let's move you on to Las Vegas, because actually
*  the ad revenue around hotels in Las Vegas is quite good. So we don't have that sort of, there's no
*  incentive for the organization to go, oh, let's move people around to things that have better ad
*  revenue. Instead, it's just like, oh, well, what's most interesting to the community, just to make
*  those links. So that decision just seemed obvious to me. But as I say, it was less of a business
*  decision and more of an aesthetic. It's like, oh, like this is how I like Wikipedia, doesn't have
*  ads. I don't really want, you know, in these early days, like a lot of the ads, that was well before
*  the era of really quality ad targeting and all that. So you get a lot of banners, punch the
*  monkey ads and all that kind of nonsense. And so, you know, but there was no guarantee. There was
*  no, it was not really clear how could we fund this? You know, like it was pretty cheap, it still is
*  quite cheap compared to, you know, most, you know, we don't have a hundred thousand employees and all
*  of that. But would we be able to raise money through donations? And so I remember the first
*  time that we did, like really did a donation campaign was on a Christmas day in 2003, I think
*  it was, there was, we had three servers, database servers and two front end servers, and they were
*  all the same size or whatever. And two of them crashed. They broke. Like, I don't even know,
*  remember now, like the hard drive, it was like, it's Christmas day. So I scrambled on Christmas day
*  to sort of go onto the database server, which fortunately survived and have it become a front
*  end server as well. And the site was really slow and it wasn't working very well. And I was like,
*  okay, it's time we need to do a fundraiser. And so I was hoping to raise $20,000 in a month's time
*  but we raised nearly 30,000 within two, three weeks time. So that was the first proof point of
*  like, oh, like we put a banner up and people will donate. Like we just explained we need the money
*  and people are like already, we were very small back then and people were like, oh yeah, like I
*  love this. I want to contribute. Then over the years we've become more sophisticated about the
*  fundraising campaigns and we've tested a lot of different messaging and so forth. What we used to
*  think, I remember one year we really went heavy with, we have great ambitions to,
*  the idea of Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia for every single person on the planet.
*  So what about the languages of Sub-Saharan Africa? So I thought, okay, we're trying to raise money,
*  we need to talk about that because it's really important and near and dear to my heart.
*  And just instinctively knowing nothing about charity fundraising, you see it all around,
*  it's like, oh, charities always mention like the poor people they're helping. So let's talk about
*  that. Didn't really work as well. The pitch that, like this is very vague and very sort of broad,
*  but the pitch that works better than any other in general is a fairness pitch of like, you use it
*  all the time, you should probably chip in. And most people are like, yeah, you know what, my life
*  would suck without Wikipedia, I use it constantly and whatever, I should chip in. Like it just seems
*  like the right thing to do. And there's many variants on that, obviously. And that's really,
*  it works. And people are like, oh yeah, Wikipedia, I love Wikipedia and I shouldn't.
*  And so sometimes people say, why are you always begging for money on the website? And it's not
*  that often, it's not that much, but it does happen. They're like, why don't you just get
*  Google and Facebook and Microsoft, why don't they pay for it? And I'm like, hmm,
*  I don't think that's really the right answer. Influence starts to creep in.
*  Influence starts to creep in and questions start to creep in. Like the best funding for Wikipedia
*  is the small donors. We also have major donors, right? We have high net worth people who donate,
*  but we always are very careful about that sort of thing to say, wow, that's really great and
*  really important. But we can't let that become influence because that would just be really
*  not good for Wikipedia. I would love to know how many times I've visited Wikipedia, how much time
*  I've spent on it, because I have a general sense that it's the most useful site I've ever used
*  competing maybe with Google search, which ultimately lands on Wikipedia. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But if I were just reminded of like, hey, remember all those times your life was made better
*  because of the site? I think I would be much more like, yeah, why did I waste money on site X, Y,
*  Z when I should be giving a lot here? Well, the Guardian newspaper has a similar model,
*  which is they have ads, but they also, there's no paywall, but they just encourage people to donate.
*  And they do that. Like I've sometimes seen a banner saying,
*  this is your 134th article you've read this year, would you like to donate? And I think that's,
*  I think it's effective. I mean, they're testing. But also I wonder, just for some people, if they
*  just don't feel guilty and then think, well, I shouldn't bother them so much. I don't know.
*  It's a good question. I don't know the answer. I guess that's the thing I could also turn on
*  because that would make me happy. I feel like legitimately there's some sites,
*  and it speaks to our social media discussion, Wikipedia unquestionably makes me feel better
*  about myself if I spend time on it. Like there's some websites where I'm like, if I spend time on
*  Twitter, sometimes I'm like, I regret. There's, I think Elon talks about this, minimize the number
*  of regretted minutes. My number of regretted minutes on Wikipedia is like zero. I don't
*  remember a time. I've just discovered this, I started following on Instagram, a page,
*  depth of Wikipedia. Oh yeah. There's like crazy Wikipedia page. There's no Wikipedia page. Yeah,
*  I gave her a media contributor of the year award this year because she's so great.
*  Yeah, she's amazing. Depth of Wikipedia is so fun. So I, yeah, so that's, that's, that's the kind of
*  interesting point that I, I don't even know if there's a competitor there. Maybe the sort of
*  programming Stack Overflow type of websites, but everything else there's always a trade off.
*  There's a big, it's probably because of the ad driven model, because there's an incentive to pull
*  you into click bait and Wikipedia has no click bait. It's all about the quality of the knowledge
*  and the wisdom and so on. Yeah, that's right. And I also like Stack Overflow, although I wonder,
*  I wonder what you think of this. I've, I, so I only program for fun as a hobby and I don't have
*  to do it, but I do and I'm not very good at it. So therefore I end up on Stack Overflow quite a lot,
*  trying to figure out what's gone wrong. And I have really transitioned to using
*  chat.gbt. Yeah. Much more for that because I can often find the answer clearly explained
*  and it just, it works better than sifting through threads. And I kind of feel bad about that because
*  I do love Stack Overflow and their community. I mean, I'm assuming I haven't read anything about
*  the news about it. I'm assuming they are keenly aware of this and they're thinking about how can we
*  sort of use this chunk of knowledge that we've got here and provide a new type of interface where you
*  can query it with a question and actually get an answer that's based on the answers that we've had.
*  I don't know. And I think Stack Overflow currently has policies against using GPT. Like there's a
*  contentious kind of tension. Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But they're trying to figure that out.
*  And so we are similar in that regard. Like obviously all the things we've talked about,
*  like chat.gbt makes stuff up and it makes up references. So our community has already put
*  into place some policies about it, but roughly speaking, there's always more nuance, but roughly
*  speaking, it's sort of like you, the human are responsible for what you put into Wikipedia.
*  So if you use chat.gbt, you better check it. There's a lot of great use cases of, you know,
*  like, oh, well, I'm not a native speaker of German, but I kind of am pretty good. I'm not
*  talking about myself, a hypothetical me that's pretty good. And I kind of just want to run my
*  edit through chat.gbt in German to go make sure my grammar is okay. That's actually cool.
*  Does it make you sad that people might use, uh, increasingly use chat.gbt for something where they
*  would previously use Wikipedia? So basically use it to answer basic questions about the Eiffel Tower.
*  Yeah. And where the answer really comes at the source of it from Wikipedia, but they're using
*  this as an interface. Yeah, no, no, that's completely fine. I mean, part of it is our
*  ethos has always been here's our gift to the world, make something. So if the knowledge is
*  more accessible to people, even if they're not coming through us, that's fine. Now, obviously
*  we do have certain business model concerns, right? Like if, and we've talked where we've had more
*  conversation about this, this whole GPT thing is new. Things like if you ask Alexa, um, you know,
*  what is the Eiffel Tower? And she reads you the first two sentences from Wikipedia and doesn't
*  say it's from Wikipedia. And they've recently started citing Wikipedia. Then we worry like,
*  oh, if people don't know they're getting the knowledge from us, are they going to donate
*  money? Or are they just thinking, oh, what's Wikipedia for? I can just ask Alexa. It's like,
*  well, Alexa only knows anything because she read Wikipedia. So we do think about that,
*  but it doesn't bother me in the sense of like, oh, I want people to always come to Wikipedia first.
*  But we're also, you know, had a great demo, like literally just hacked together over a weekend by
*  our head of machine learning where he did this little thing to say, um, you could ask any
*  question and he was just knocking it together. So he used, uh, the open AI's API just to make a demo,
*  ask you a question, um, why do ducks fly south for winter? Which is the kind of thing you think, oh,
*  I, I, I might just Google for that. I might start looking in Wikipedia. I don't know.
*  And so what he does, he asks, what are some Wikipedia entries that might answer this?
*  Then he grabbed those Wikipedia entries, said, here's some Wikipedia entries,
*  answer this question based only on the information in this. And he had pretty good results and it
*  kind of prevented the making stuff up. Now it's just a, he hacked together a weekend, but
*  what it made me think about was, oh, okay. So now we've got this huge body of knowledge
*  that in many cases you're like, oh, I'm really, I want to know about Queen Victoria. I'm just
*  going to go read the Wikipedia entry and it's going to take me through her life and so forth.
*  But other times you've got a specific question and maybe we could have a better search experience
*  where you can come to Wikipedia, ask your specific question, get your specific answer that's from
*  Wikipedia, including links to the articles you might want to read next. And that's just a step
*  forward. Like that's just using a new type of technology to make the extraction of information
*  from this body of text into my brain faster and easier. So I think that's kind of cool.
*  I would love to see a Chad GPT grounding into websites like Wikipedia and the other comparable
*  website to me will be Wolfram Alpha for more mathematical knowledge, that kind of stuff.
*  So grounding, taking you to a page that is really crafted. The moment you start actually taking you
*  to like journalists websites, like news websites, it starts getting a little iffy. You're now in a
*  land that has a wrong incentive. Right. And you need somebody to have filtered through that and
*  tried to knock off the rough edges. Yeah. No, it's very, I think that's exactly right. And I think
*  that kind of grounding is, I think they're working really hard on it. I think that's really important.
*  And that actually, if you asked me to step back and be very business-like about our business model
*  and where's it going to go for us? And are we going to lose half our donations because everybody's
*  just going to stop coming to Wikipedia and go to Chad GPT? I think grounding will help a lot
*  because frankly, most questions people have, if they provide proper links, we're going to be at
*  the top of that just like we are in Google. So we're still going to get tons of recognition and
*  tons of traffic just from, even if it's just the moral properness of saying, here's my source.
*  So I think we're going to be all right in that. Yeah. And the close partnership of if the model
*  is fine-tuned, is constantly retrained, that Wikipedia is one of the primary places where
*  if you want to change what the model knows, one of the things you should do is contribute to
*  Wikipedia or clarify Wikipedia. Yeah. Or elaborate, expand all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. You mentioned all of us have controversies. I have to ask,
*  do you find the controversy of whether you are the sole founder or the co-founder of Wikipedia
*  ironic, absurd, interesting, important? What are your comments?
*  So I would say unimportant, not that interesting. I mean, one of the things that
*  people are sometimes surprised to hear me say is I actually think Larry Sanger doesn't get enough
*  credit for his early work in Wikipedia, even though I think co-founder is not the right title for that.
*  So, you know, like he had a lot of impact and a lot of great work and I disagree with a lot of
*  things since and all that and that's fine. So yeah, no, to me that's like, it's one of these
*  things that the media love a falling out story. So they want to make a big deal out of it and I'm
*  just like, yeah, no. So there's a lot of interesting engineering contributions in the early days,
*  like you were saying, there's debates about how to structure it, what the heck is this thing that
*  we're doing and there's important people that contributed to that. Yeah, definitely. So he also,
*  you said you had some disagreements. Larry Sanger said that nobody should trust Wikipedia
*  and that Wikipedia seems to assume that there's only one legitimate defensible version of the
*  truth on any controversial question. That's not how Wikipedia used to be. I presume you disagree
*  with that analysis. Yeah, I mean, just straight up, I disagree. Like go and read any Wikipedia entry
*  on a controversial topic and what you'll see is a really diligent effort to explain all the relevant
*  sides. So yeah, just disagreeing. So on controversial questions, you think perspectives
*  are generally represented? I mean, it has to do with the kind of the tension between the mainstream
*  and the non mainstream that we were talking about. Yeah, no, I mean, for sure. Like to take
*  this area of discussion seriously is to say, yeah, you know what, actually, that is a big part of
*  what Wikipedians spend their time grappling with is to say, you know, how do we figure out
*  whether a less popular view is pseudoscience? Is it just a less popular view that's gaining acceptance
*  in the mainstream? Is it fringe versus crackpot, et cetera, et cetera? And that debate is what
*  you've got to do. There's no choice about having that debate of grappling with something.
*  And I think we do. And I think that's really important. And I think if anybody said
*  to the Wikipedia community, gee, you should stop, you know, sort of covering minority viewpoints
*  on this issue, I think they would say, I don't even understand why you would say that. Like we
*  have to sort of grapple with minority viewpoints in science and politics and so on. But it's,
*  and like this is one of the reasons why, you know, there is no magic simple answer to all these
*  things. It's really contextual. It's case by case. It's like, you know, you've got to really say,
*  okay, what is the context here? How do you do it? And you've always got to be open to correction
*  and to change and to sort of challenge and always be sort of serious about that.
*  I think what happens again with social media is when there is that grappling process in Wikipedia
*  and a decision is made to remove a paragraph or to remove a thing or to say a thing,
*  you're going to notice the one direction of the oscillation of the grappling and not the
*  correction. And you've got to highlight that and say, how did, how come this person, I don't know,
*  I want maybe legitimacy of elections. That's the thing that comes up. Donald Trump maybe.
*  I can give a really good example, which is there was this sort of dust up about the definition of
*  recession in Wikipedia. So the accusation was, and the accusation was often quite ridiculous
*  and extreme, which is under pressure from the Biden administration, Wikipedia changed the
*  definition of recession to make Biden look good. Or we did it not under pressure, but because we're
*  a bunch of lunatic leftists and so on. And then when I see something like that in the press,
*  I'm like, oh dear, what's happened here? How do we do that? Because I always just accept things
*  for five seconds first. And then I go and I look and I'm like, you know what? That's literally,
*  completely not what happened. What happened was one editor thought the article needed restructuring.
*  So the article is always said, so the traditional kind of loose definition of recession is
*  two quarters of negative growth. But there's always been within economics, within important
*  agencies in different countries around the world, a lot of nuance around that. And there's other
*  factors that go into it and so forth. And it's just an interesting, complicated topic.
*  And so the article has always had the definition of two quarters. The only thing that really
*  changed was moving that from the lead, from the top paragraph to further down. And then
*  news stories appeared saying, Wikipedia has changed the definition of recession.
*  And then we got a huge rush of trolls coming in. So the article was temporarily protected,
*  I think only semi-protected. And people were told, go to the talk page to discuss.
*  So it was a dust-up that was, you know, when you look at it as a Wikipedia, you're like, oh,
*  like this is a really routine kind of editorial debate. Another example, which unfortunately,
*  our friend Elon fell for, I would say, is the Twitter files. So there was an article called
*  the Twitter files, which is about these files that were released once Elon took control of
*  Twitter and he released internal documents. And what happened was somebody nominated it for
*  deletion, but even the nomination said, this is actually, this is mainly about the Hunter Biden
*  laptop controversy. Shouldn't this information be there instead? So anyone can, like it takes exactly
*  one human being anywhere on the planet to propose something for deletion. And that triggers a
*  process where people discuss it, which within a few hours, it was what we call snowball closed,
*  i.e. this doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of passing. So an admin goes, yeah, wrong,
*  and closed the debate. And that was it. That was the whole thing that happened.
*  And so nobody proposed suppressing the information. Nobody proposed it wasn't important.
*  It was just like editorially boring internal questions. And, you know, so sometimes people
*  read stuff like that and they're like, Oh, you see, look at these leftists. They're trying to
*  suppress the truth again. It's like, well, slow down a second and come and look like literally
*  it's not what happened. Yeah. So I think the right is more sensitive to censorship. And so they will
*  more likely highlight, there's more virality to highlighting something that looks like censorship
*  in any walks of life. And this moving a paragraph from one place to another, removing it and so on,
*  as part of the regular grappling of Wikipedia can make a hell of a good article or YouTube video.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sounds really enticing and intriguing and surprising to most people
*  because they're like, I'm reading Wikipedia. It doesn't seem like a crackpot leftist website.
*  It seems pretty kind of dull really in its own geeky way. So that makes a good story. It's like,
*  Oh, am I being misled because there's a shadowy cabal of Jimmy Wales.
*  You know, I generally, I read political stuff. I mentioned to you that I'm traveling to have
*  some very difficult conversation with high profile figures, both in the war in Ukraine and in Israel
*  and Palestine. And, you know, I read the Wikipedia articles around that. And I also read books on the
*  conflict and the history of the different regions. And I find the Wikipedia articles to be very
*  balanced and there's many perspectives being represented. But then I asked myself, well,
*  am I one of them leftist crackpots? They can't see the truth. I mean, it's something I ask myself
*  all the time. Forget the leftists, just crackpot. Am I just being a sheep in accepting it? And I
*  think that's an important question to always ask, but not too much. Yeah, no, a little bit,
*  but not too much. No, I think we always have to challenge ourselves of like, what do I potentially
*  have wrong? Well, you mentioned pressure from government. You've criticized Twitter for
*  allowing giving in to Turkey's government censorship. There's also conspiracy theories
*  or accusations of Wikipedia being open to pressure from government to government organizations, FBI,
*  and all this kind of stuff. What is the philosophy about pressure from government and censorship?
*  So we're super hardcore on this. We've never bowed down to government pressure anywhere in the world
*  and we never will. And we understand that we're hardcore. And actually there is a bit of nuance
*  about how different companies respond to this, but our response has always been just to say no. And
*  if they threaten to block, we'll knock yourself out. You're going to lose Wikipedia. And that's
*  been very successful for us as a strategy because governments know they can't just casually threaten
*  to block Wikipedia or block us for two days and we're going to cave in immediately to get back
*  into the market. And that's what a lot of companies have done. And I don't think that's good.
*  We can go one level deeper and say, I'm actually quite sympathetic. If you have staff members in
*  a certain country and they are at physical risk, you've got to put that into your equation. So I
*  understand that. If Elon said, actually I've got a hundred staff members on the ground in such
*  a country and if we don't comply, somebody's going to get arrested and it could be quite serious.
*  Okay. That's a tough one. That's actually really hard. But yeah, no. And then the FBI one, no,
*  we like the criticism I saw, I kind of prepared for this because I saw people responding to your
*  requests for questions and I was like, somebody's like, oh, well, don't you think it was really bad
*  that you da-da-da-da-da? I actually reached out to staff saying, can you just make sure I've got my
*  facts right? And the answer is we received zero requests of any kind from the FBI or any of the
*  other government agencies for any changes to content in Wikipedia. And had we received those
*  requests at the level of the Wikimedia Foundation, we would have said, it's not our, like we can't
*  do anything because Wikipedia is written by the community. And so the Wikimedia Foundation can't
*  change the content of Wikipedia without causing, I mean, God, that would be a massive controversy.
*  You can't even imagine. What we did do, and this is what I've done, I've been to China and met with
*  the minister of propaganda. We've had discussions with governments all around the world, not because
*  we want to do their bidding, but because we don't want to do their bidding, but we also don't want
*  to be blocked. And we think actually having these conversations are really important. Now, there's
*  no threat of being blocked in the US. That's just never going to happen. There is the first amendment.
*  But in other countries around the world, it's like, okay, what are you upset about? Let's have the
*  conversation. Let's understand and let's have a dialogue about it so that you can understand
*  where we come from and what we're doing and why. And then sometimes it's like, gee,
*  if somebody complains that something's bad in Wikipedia, whoever they are, don't care who they
*  are. It could be you, it could be the government, it could be the pope. I don't care who they are.
*  It's like, oh, okay, well, our responsibility as Wikipedia is to go, oh, hold on, let's check.
*  Is that right or wrong? Is there something that we've got wrong in Wikipedia? Not because you're
*  threatening to block us, but because we want Wikipedia to be correct. So we do have these
*  dialogues with people. And a big part of what was going on with, you might call it pressure on
*  social media companies or dialogue with, depending on, as we talked earlier, grapple with the
*  language, depending on what your view is. In our case, it was really just about, oh, okay,
*  right, they want to have a dialogue about COVID misinformation. We are this enormous source of
*  information, which the world depends on. We're going to have that conversation. We're happy to
*  say, if they say, how do you know that Wikipedia is not going to be pushing some crazy anti-vax
*  narrative? First, I think it's somewhat inappropriate for a government to be asking
*  pointed questions in a way that implies possible penalties. I'm not sure that ever happened because
*  we would just go, I don't know, the Chinese blocked us. So it goes, right? We're not going
*  to cave into any kind of government pressure, but whatever the appropriateness of what they
*  were doing, I think there is a role for government in just saying, let's understand the information
*  ecosystem. Let's think about the problem of misinformation, disinformation in society,
*  particularly around election security, all these kinds of things. I think it would be
*  irresponsible of us to get a call from a government agency and say, yeah, why don't you just fuck off?
*  You're the government. But it would also be irresponsible to go, oh dear, government agents,
*  not happy. Let's fix Wikipedia so the FBI loves us. When you say you want to have discussions with
*  the Chinese government or with organizations like CDC and WHO, it's to thoroughly understand
*  what the mainstream narrative is so that it can be properly represented but not drive
*  what the articles are. Well, it's actually important to say, whatever the Wikimedia
*  Foundation thinks has no impact on what's in Wikipedia. So it's more about saying to them,
*  right, we understand you're the World Health Organization or you're whoever,
*  and part of your job is to sort of public health is about communications. You want to understand
*  the world. So it's more about, oh, well, let's explain how Wikipedia works.
*  So it's more about explaining how Wikipedia works and like, hey, it's the volunteers.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  It's a battle of ideas and here's how the sources are used.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  What a legitimate source is and what not a legitimate source is.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, I suppose there's some battle about what is a legitimate source.
*  There could be statements made that CDC, I mean, like there's government organizations
*  in general have sold themselves to be the place where you go for expertise. And some of that
*  has been to a small degree raised in question over the response to the pandemic.
*  Well, I think in many cases, and this goes back to my topic of trust. So there were definitely
*  cases of public officials, public organizations where I felt like they lost the trust of the
*  public because they didn't trust the public. And so the idea is like, we really need people
*  to take this seriously and take actions. Therefore, we're going to put out some
*  overblown claims because it's going to scare people into behaving correctly.
*  You know what? That might work for a little while, but it doesn't work in the long run
*  because suddenly people go from a default stance of like the Center for Disease Control,
*  very well respected scientific organization, sort of, I don't know, they've got Fault in
*  Atlanta with the last vile of smallpox or whatever it is that people think about them.
*  And to go, oh, right, these are scientists we should actually take seriously and listen to,
*  and they're not politicized. And it's like, okay. And if you put out statements,
*  and I don't know if the CDC did, but health organization, whoever, that are provably false,
*  and also provably, you kind of knew they were false, but you did it to scare people because
*  you wanted them to do the right thing. It's like, no, you know what? That's not going to work in the
*  long run. You're going to lose people. And now you've got a bigger problem, which is a lack of
*  trust in science, a lack of trust in authorities who are, you know, by and large, they're like,
*  quite boring government bureaucrat scientists who just are trying to help the world.
*  Well, I've been criticized, and I've been torn on this. I've been criticized for criticizing
*  Anthony Fauci too hard. The degree to which I criticized him is because he's a leader,
*  and I'm just observing the effect in the loss of trust in the institutions like the NIH,
*  that where I personally know there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have to blame the leaders for the effects on the distrust in the scientific work that they're
*  doing because of what I perceive as basic human flaws of communication, of arrogance, of ego,
*  of politics, all those kinds of things. Now you could say you're being too harsh, possible,
*  but I think that's the whole point of free speech is you can criticize the people who lead.
*  Leaders, unfortunately, are fortunately responsible for the effects on society. To me,
*  Anthony Fauci, or whoever in the scientific position around the pandemic, had an opportunity
*  to have an FDR moment or to get everybody together and inspire about the power of science
*  to rapidly develop a vaccine that saves us from this pandemic and future pandemic that can threaten
*  the well-being of human civilization. This was epic and awesome and sexy. And to me,
*  when I talk to people about science, it's anything but sexy in terms of the virology
*  and biology development because it's been politicized, it's icky, and people just don't
*  talk to me about the vaccine. I understand, I understand. I got vaccinated. Let's switch topics.
*  Yeah. Well, it's interesting because as I say, I live in the UK and I think
*  all these things are a little less politicized there. And I haven't played close enough attention
*  to Fauci to have a really strong view. I'm sure I would disagree with some things. I definitely,
*  you know, I remember hearing at the beginning of the pandemic as I'm unwrapping my Amazon package
*  with the masks I bought because I heard there's a pandemic and I just was like, I want some N95
*  mask, please. And they were saying, don't buy masks. And the motivation was because they didn't
*  want there to be shortages in hospitals, fine. But they were also statements of masks, they're
*  not effective and they won't help you. And then the complete about face to, you're ridiculous
*  if you're not wearing them. You know, it's just like, no, like that about face just lost people
*  from day one. The distress and the intelligence of the public to deal with nuance, to deal with
*  the uncertainty. Yeah, this is exactly what, you know, I think this is where the Wikipedia neutral
*  point of view is and should be an ideal and obviously every article and everything, you know
*  me now and you know how I am about these things. But like ideally is to say, look, we're happy to
*  show you all the perspectives. This is Planned Parenthood's view and this is Catholic Church view
*  and we're going to explain that and we're going to try to be thoughtful and put in the best arguments
*  from all sides because I trust you. Like you read that and you're going to be more educated and
*  you're going to begin to make a decision. I mean, I can just talk in the UK, the government,
*  da da da da. When we found out in the UK that very high level government officials were not following
*  the rules they had put on everyone else, I moved from, I had just become a UK citizen just a little
*  while before the pandemic. And you know, it's kind of emotional. Like you get a passport in a new
*  country and you feel quite good. And I did my oath to the queen and then they dragged the poor old
*  lady out to tell us all to be good. And I was like, we're British and we're going to do the right
*  things and it's going to be tough, but we're going to, you know. So you have that kind of
*  Dunkirk spirit moment and you're like following the rules to a T and then suddenly it's like,
*  well, they're not following the rules. And so suddenly I shifted personally from,
*  I'm going to follow the rules even if I don't completely agree with them, I'll still follow
*  because I think we've got all chipping together to like, you know what, I'm going to make wise and
*  thoughtful decisions for myself and my family. And that generally is going to mean following
*  the rules, but it's basically, you know, when they're, you know, at certain moments in time,
*  like you're not allowed to be in an outside space unless you're exercising. I'm like,
*  I think I can sit in a park and read a book. Like it's going to be fine. Like that's irrational rule,
*  which I would have been following just personally of like, I'm just going to do the right thing.
*  Yeah. And the loss of trust, I think at scale was probably harmful to science and to me,
*  the scientific method and the scientific communities is one of the biggest hopes,
*  at least to me, for the survival and the thriving of human civilization.
*  Absolutely. And I, you know, I think you see some of the ramifications of this.
*  There's always been like pretty anti-science, anti-vax people. Okay. That's always been a thing,
*  but I feel like it's bigger now simply because of that lowering of trust. So a lot of people,
*  yeah, maybe it's like you say, a lot of people are like, yeah, I got vaccinated and I really
*  don't want to talk about this because it's so toxic, you know? And that's unfortunate because
*  I think people should say, what an amazing thing. And, you know, there's also a whole range of
*  discourse around if this were a disease that was primarily killing babies, I think people's
*  emotions about it would have been very different, right or wrong, than the fact that when you really
*  looked at the sort of death rate of getting COVID, wow, it's really dramatically different.
*  If you're late in life, this was really dangerous. And if you're 23 years old,
*  yeah, well, it's not great. Like, and long COVID is a thing and all of that. But,
*  and I think some of the public communications, again, were failing to properly contextualize,
*  not all of it, you know, it's a complicated matter, but yeah.
*  Let me read your Reddit comment that received two likes.
*  Oh, two whole people liked it.
*  Yeah, two people liked it. And I don't know, maybe you can comment on whether there's truth to it,
*  but I just found it interesting because I've been doing a lot of research on World War II recently.
*  So this is about Hitler. It's a long statement. I was there when a big push was made to fight
*  bias at Wikipedia. Our target became getting the Hitler article to be Wiki's featured article.
*  The idea was that the voting body only wanted articles that were good PR and especially
*  articles about socially liberal topics. So the Hitler article had to be two to three times better
*  and more academically researched to beat the competition. This bias seems to hold today.
*  For example, the current list of political featured articles at a glance seems to have
*  only two books, one on anarchism and one on Karl Marx. Surely we're not going to say there have
*  only ever been two articles about political non-biography books worth being featured,
*  especially compared to 200 plus video games. That's the only topics with good books are
*  socialism and anarchy. Do you have any interesting comments on this kind of featured, how the features
*  are selected, maybe Hitler because he's a special figure, you know, Nazi.
*  No, I love the comparison to how many video games have been. And that definitely speaks to my earlier
*  as like, if you've got a lot of young geeky men who really like video games, that doesn't necessarily
*  give you get you the right place in every respect. Certainly. Yeah, so here's a funny story. I woke
*  up one morning to a bunch of journalists in Germany trying to get in touch with me
*  because German language Wikipedia chose to have as the featured article of the day,
*  swastika. And people were going crazy about it. And some people were saying,
*  it's illegal. Has German Wikipedia been taken over by Nazi sympathizers and so on? And it turned out
*  it's not illegal. Like discussing the swastika, using the swastika as a political campaign and
*  using it in certain ways is illegal in Germany in a way that it wouldn't be in the US because of
*  First Amendment. But in this case, it was like, actually, part of the point is the swastika symbol
*  is from other cultures as well. And they just thought it was interesting. I did joke to the
*  committee. I'm like, please don't put the swastika on the front page without warning me because I'm
*  going to get a lot of... Now it wouldn't be me. It's the foundation. I'm not that much on the
*  front lines. So I would say that to put Hitler on the front page of Wikipedia, it is a special topic
*  and you would want to say, yeah, let's be really careful that it's really, really good before we
*  do that. Because if we put it on the front page and it's not good enough, that could be a problem.
*  There's no inherent reason. Clearly, World War II is a very popular topic in Wikipedia. It's like,
*  turn on the History Channel. It's a fascinating period of history that people are very interested
*  in. And then on the other piece, like, anarchism and Karl Marx? Karl Marx, yeah.
*  Oh yeah. I mean, that's interesting. I'm surprised to hear that not more political
*  books or topics have made it to the front page. Now we're taking this Reddit comment.
*  I mean, as if it's completely... As if it's...
*  Yeah, but I'm trusting. So I think that probably is right. They probably did have the list up.
*  No, I think that piece, the piece about how many of those featured articles have been video games
*  and if it's disproportionate, I think the community should go, actually, what's gone...
*  Like, that doesn't seem quite right. You can imagine that because you're looking for an article
*  to be on the front page of Wikipedia, you want to have a bit of diversity in it. You want it to be
*  not always something that's really popular that week. So like, I don't know, the last couple of
*  weeks, maybe Succession, a big finale of Succession might lead you to think, oh, let's put Succession
*  on the front page. That's going to be popular. In other cases, you kind of want to pick something
*  super obscure and quirky because people also find that interesting and fun. So yeah, don't know,
*  but you don't want it to be video games most of the time. That sounds quite bad.
*  Well, let me ask you just for, as somebody who's seen the whole thing, the development of the
*  millions of articles, big impossible question. What's your favorite article?
*  My favorite article. Well, I've got an amusing answer, which is possibly also true. There's
*  an article in Wikipedia called Inherently Funny Words. One of the reasons I love it is
*  when it was created early in the history of Wikipedia, it kind of became like a dumping
*  ground. People would just come by and write in any word that they thought sounded funny.
*  And then it was nominated for deletion because somebody's like, this is just a dumping ground.
*  People are putting all kinds of nonsense in. And in that deletion debate, somebody came forward and
*  said, essentially, wait a second, hold on. This is actually a legitimate concept in the theory of
*  humor and comedy. And a lot of famous comedians and humors have written about it. And it's actually
*  a legitimate topic. So then they went through and they meticulously referenced every word that was
*  in there and threw out a bunch that weren't. And so it becomes this really interesting. Now,
*  my biggest disappointment, and it's the right decision to make because there was no source,
*  but it was a picture of a cow, but there was a rope around its head tying on some horns
*  onto the cow. So it was kind of a funny looking picture. It looked like a bull with horns,
*  but it's just like a normal milk cow. And below it, the caption said, according to some, cow is an
*  inherently funny word, which is just hilarious to me, partly because the according to some sounds
*  a lot like Wikipedia. But there was no source. So it went away and I feel very sad about that.
*  But I've always liked that. And I actually, the reason depths of Wikipedia amuses me so greatly
*  is because it does highlight really interesting, obscure stuff. And you're like, wow, I can't
*  believe somebody wrote about that in Wikipedia. It's quite amusing. And sometimes there's a bit
*  of wry humor in Wikipedia. There's always a struggle. You're not trying to be funny,
*  but occasionally a little inside humor can be quite healthy.
*  And apparently words with the letter K are funny. There's a lot of really well researched stuff on
*  this page. It's actually exciting. And I should mention for depths of Wikipedia, it's run by
*  Annie Rowerda. That's right, Annie. And let me just read off some of the pages.
*  Octopolis and Octolantis are two separate non-human underwater settlements built by
*  the gloomy octopuses in Jervis Bay, East Australia. The first settlement named Octopolis by biologists
*  was founded in 2009. The individual structures in Octopolis consist of burrows around a piece of
*  human detritus believed to be scrap metal. And it goes on in this way.
*  It's great.
*  Satiric misspelling, least concerned species. Humans were formally assessed as a species of
*  least concern in 2008. I think Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would slightly disagree.
*  And last one, let me just say friendship paradox is the phenomena first observed by the sociologist
*  Scott Feld in 1991 that on average an individual's friends have more friends than that individual.
*  Oh, that's very interesting. That's the kind of thing that makes you want to, like it sounds
*  implausible at first, because shouldn't everybody have on average about the same number of friends
*  as all their friends? So you really want to dig into the math of that and really think, oh, why
*  would that be true? And it's one way to feel more lonely in a mathematically rigorous way.
*  Somebody also on Reddit asks, I would love to hear some war stories from behind the scenes.
*  Is there something that we haven't mentioned that was particularly difficult in this entire
*  journey you're on with Wikipedia?
*  I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, so part of what I always say about myself is that I'm a pathological
*  optimist. So I always think everything is fine. And so things that other people might find a
*  struggle, I'm just like, oh, well, this is the thing we're doing to each other. And I'm like,
*  this is the thing we're doing today. So that's kind of about me. And it's actually,
*  I'm aware of this about myself. So I do like to have a few pessimistic people around me to keep me
*  a bit on balance. Yeah, I mean, I would say some of the hard things, I mean, there were hard
*  moments like when two out of three servers crashed on Christmas Day, and then we needed to
*  do a fundraiser and no idea what was going to happen. I would say as well,
*  the like, in that early period of time, the growth of the website and the traffic to the website was
*  phenomenal and great, the growth of the community. And in fact, the healthy growth of the community
*  was fine. And then the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit I set up to own and operate Wikipedia,
*  as a small organization, it had a lot of growing pains. And, you know, that was, it was like,
*  that was the piece that's just like many companies or many organizations that are in a fast growth.
*  It's like, you've hired the wrong people, or there's this conflict that's arisen and nobody's
*  got experience to do this and all that. So no specific stories to tell. But, you know, like,
*  I would say growing the organization was harder than growing the community and growing the website,
*  which is interesting. Well, yeah, it's kind of miraculous and inspiring that a community can
*  emerge and be stable and that has so much kind of productive, positive output. It kind of makes
*  you think. I mean, I don't, it's one of those things you don't want to analyze too much,
*  because like, you don't want to mess with a beautiful thing, but it gives me faith in
*  communities that they can spring up in other domains as well. Yeah, I think that's exactly
*  right. And, you know, at Fandom, my for-profit wiki company, where, you know, it's like all these
*  communities about pop culture, mainly sort of entertainment, gaming, and so on. There's a lot
*  of small communities. And so I went last year to our Community Connect Conference and just met some
*  of these people and like, you know, here's one of the leaders of the Star Wars wiki, which is called
*  Wookiepedia, which I think is great. And, you know, he's telling me about his community and all that,
*  and I'm like, oh, right. Yeah, I love this. Like, so it's not the same purpose as Wikipedia
*  of a neutral, high quality encyclopedia, but a lot of the same values are there of like, oh,
*  people should be nice to each other. It's like, when people get upset, it's like, just remember,
*  we're working on Star Wars wiki together. Like, there's no reason to get too outraged and just kind
*  of people, just like geeky people with a hobby. Where do you see Wikipedia in 10 years, 100 years,
*  and 1000 years? Right. So 10 years, I would say pretty much the same. Like, we're not going to
*  have, we're not going to become TikTok, you know, with entertainment, scroll by video, humor, and
*  blah, blah, blah, an encyclopedia. I think in 10 years, we probably will have a lot more AI
*  supporting tools like I've talked about, and probably your search experience would be,
*  you can ask a question and get the answer rather than, you know, from our body of work.
*  So search and discovery, a little bit improved interface, some of that.
*  All that. I always say one of the things that people, most people won't notice,
*  because already they don't notice it, is the growth of Wikipedia in the languages of the
*  developing world. So you probably don't speak Swahili, so you're probably not checking out
*  that Swahili Wikipedia is doing very well. And it is doing very well. And I think that kind of
*  growth is actually super important, it's super interesting. But most people won't notice that.
*  If we can just look on that, if we could, do you think there's so much incredible translation
*  work is being done with AI, with language models, do you think that can accelerate
*  Wikipedia? So you start with the basic draft of the translation of articles and then build on that.
*  So what I used to say is, like machine translation for many years wasn't much use to the community,
*  because it just wasn't good enough. As it's gotten better, it's tended to be a lot better in what we
*  might call economically important languages. That's because the corpus that they train on and all
*  of that. So to translate from English to Spanish, if you've tried Google Translate recently,
*  Spanish to English is what I would do. It's pretty good. It's actually not bad. It used to be half
*  a joke and then for a while it was kind of like, well, you can get the gist of something. And now
*  it's like, actually, it's pretty good. However, we've got a huge Spanish community who write
*  in native Spanish. So they're able to use it and they find it useful, but they're writing.
*  But if you tried to do English to Zulu, where there's not that much investment, like there's
*  loads of reasons to invest in English to Spanish because they're both huge economically important
*  languages, Zulu not so much. So for those smaller languages, it was just still terrible.
*  My understanding is it's improved dramatically and also because the new methods of training don't
*  necessarily involve identical corpuses to try to match things up, but rather reading and understanding
*  with tokens and large language models and then reading and understanding, and then you get a much
*  richer. Anyway, apparently it's quite improved. So I think that now it is quite possible that
*  these smaller language communities are going to say, oh, well, finally I can put something in
*  an English and I can get out Zulu that I feel comfortable sharing with my community because
*  it's actually good enough, or I can edit it a bit here and there. So I think that's huge. So I do
*  think that's going to happen a lot and that's going to accelerate, again, what will remain to
*  most people in an invisible trend, but that's the growth in all these other languages.
*  So then move on to a hundred years. I was starting to get scary.
*  Well, the only thing I say about a hundred years is like, we've built the Wikimedia Foundation
*  and we run it in a quite cautious and financially conservative and careful way. So every year we
*  build our reserves, every year we put aside a little bit of more money. We also have the
*  endowment fund, which we just passed a hundred million. That's a completely separate fund
*  with a separate board so that it's not just like a big fat bank account for some future
*  profligate CEO to blow through. The foundation will have to get the approval of a second order
*  board to be able to access that money and that board can make other grants through the community
*  and things like that. So the point of all that is I hope and believe that we're building in a
*  financially stable way that we can weather various storms along the way so that hopefully
*  we're not taking the kind of risks, and by the way, we're not taking too few risks either.
*  That's always hard. I think the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia will exist in a
*  hundred years. If anybody exists in a hundred years, we'll be there.
*  Do you think the internet just looks unpredictably different?
*  I do. I do. I think right now, this enormous step forward we've seen has become public in the last
*  year of the large language models really is something else. It's really interesting. You and
*  I have both talked today about the flaws and the limitations, but still, as someone who's been
*  around technology for a long time, it's that feeling of the first time I saw a web browser,
*  the first time I saw the iPhone, the first time the internet was really usable on a phone, and
*  it's like, wow, that's a step change difference. There's a few other... Maybe Google search.
*  Search was actually one. I remember AltaVista was kind of cool for a while, then it just got
*  more and more useless because the algorithm wasn't good. And it's like, oh, Google search,
*  now the internet works again. And so large language model, it feels like that to me.
*  Wow, this is something new and really pretty remarkable. And it's going to have some downsides.
*  Like the negative use case, people in the area who are experts, they're giving a lot of warnings.
*  I don't know enough to... I'm not that worried, but I'm a pathological optimist. But I do see some
*  really low-hanging fruit bad things that can happen. So my example is, how about some highly
*  customized spam where the email that you receive isn't just misspelled words and trying to get
*  through filters, but actually is a targeted email to you that knows something about you
*  by reading your LinkedIn profile and writes a plausible email that will get through the filters.
*  And it's like, suddenly, oh, that's a new problem. That's going to be interesting.
*  Is there, just on the Wikipedia editing side, does it make the job of the volunteer,
*  of the editor more difficult if in a world where larger and larger percentage of the internet is
*  written by an LLM? So one of my predictions, and we'll see, ask me again in five years how this
*  panned out, is that in a way, this will strengthen the value and importance of some traditional
*  brands. So if I see a news story and it's from the Wall Street Journal, from the New York Times,
*  from Fox News, I know what I'm getting and I trust it to whatever extent I might have
*  trust or distrust in any of those. And if I see a brand new website that looks plausible,
*  but I've never heard of it, and it could be machine-generated content that may be full of
*  errors, I think I'll be more cautious. I think I'm more interested. And we can also talk about
*  this around photographic evidence. So obviously, there will be scandals where major media
*  organizations get fooled by a fake photo. However, if I see a photo of, the recent was the pope
*  wearing an expensive puffer jacket, I'm going to go, yeah, that's amazing that a fake like that
*  could be generated, but my immediate thought is not, oh, so the pope's dipping into the money, eh?
*  Partly because this particular pope doesn't seem like he'd be the type.
*  My favorite is extensive pictures of Joe Biden and Donald Trump hanging out and having fun together.
*  Brilliant. So I think people will care about the provenance of a photo. And if you show me a photo
*  and you say, yeah, this photo is from Fox News, even though I don't necessarily think that's the
*  highest, but I'm like, wow, it's a news organization and they're going to have journalists
*  and they're going to make sure the photo is what it purports to be. That's very different from a
*  photo randomly circulating on Twitter. Whereas I would say 15 years ago, a photo randomly circulating
*  on Twitter, in most cases, the worst you could do, and this did happen, is misrepresent the
*  battlefield. So like, oh, here's a bunch of injured children. Look what Israel's done, but actually,
*  it wasn't Israel. It was another case 10 years ago. That has happened. That has always been around.
*  But now we can have much more specifically constructed, plausible looking photos that if
*  I just see them circulating on Twitter, I'm going to go, just don't know. Not sure. Like,
*  I can make that in five minutes. So- Well, I also hope that it's kind of like what you're writing
*  about in your book, that we could also have citizen journalists that have a stable, verifiable
*  trust that builds up. So it doesn't have to be New York Times or this organization.
*  You could be in an organization of one as long as it's stable and carries through time and it builds
*  up or builds up. Now, I agree, but the one thing I've said in the past, and this depends on who
*  that person is and what they're doing, but it's like, I think my credibility, my general credibility
*  in the world should be the equal of a New York Times reporter. So if something happens and I
*  witness it and I write about it, people are going to go, well, Jimmy Wells said it. That's just like
*  if a New York Times reporter said it, I'm going to tend to think he didn't just make it up.
*  Truth is, nothing interesting ever happens around me. I don't go to war zones. I don't go to big
*  press conferences. I don't interview Putin and Zelensky. So just to an extent, yes. Whereas I
*  do think for other people, those traditional models of credibility are really, really important.
*  And then there is this sort of citizen journalism. I don't know if you think of what you do as
*  journalism, I kind of think it is, but you do interviews. You do long-form interviews.
*  And I think people, like if you come and you say, right, here's my tape,
*  but you wouldn't hand out a tape. I just gestured to you as if I'm handing you a cassette tape.
*  If you put it into your podcast, here's my interview with Zelensky and people aren't going
*  to go, yeah, how do we know? That could be a deep fake. You could have faked that because people are
*  like, well, no, you're a well-known podcaster and you do interview interesting people and yeah,
*  you wouldn't think that. So that your brand becomes really important. Whereas if suddenly,
*  and I've seen this already, I've seen sort of video with subtitles in English and apparently
*  the Ukrainian was the same and it was Zelensky saying something really outrageous.
*  And I'm like, yeah, I don't believe that. Like, I don't think he said that in a meeting with,
*  you know, whatever. I think that's Russian propaganda or probably just trolls.
*  Yeah. And then building platforms and mechanisms of how that trust can be verified.
*  If something appears on a Wikipedia page, that means something. If something appears on,
*  like say my Twitter account, that means something. That means I, this particular human,
*  have signed off on it. And then the trust you have in this particular human transfers to the
*  piece of content. And then hopefully there's millions of people with different metrics of
*  trust. And then you could see that there's a certain kind of bias in the set of conversations
*  you're having. So maybe, okay, I trust this person of this kind of bias and I'll go to this other
*  person of this other kind of bias that I can integrate them in this kind of way. Just like
*  you said with Fox news and what else. Yeah, what's your journal in your times? Like they've
*  all got their, like where they sit. Yeah. So you have built, I would say one of, if not the most
*  impactful website in the history of human civilization. So let me ask for you to give
*  advice to young people how to have an impact in this world. High schoolers, college students,
*  wanting to have a big positive impact. Yeah, great. If you want to be successful,
*  do something you're really passionate about rather than some kind of cold calculation of what can
*  make you the most money. Cause if you go and try to do something and you're like, I'm not that
*  interested, but I'm going to make a lot of money doing it. You're probably not going to be that
*  good at it. And so that, that is a big piece of it. I also like, you know, so for startups,
*  I give this advice. So yeah, and this is a career startup, any kind of like young person just
*  starting out is like, you know, be persistent, right? There'll be moments when it's not working
*  out and you can't just give up too easily. You've got to persist through some hard times, maybe two
*  servers crash on a Sunday and you've got to sort of scramble to figure it out, but persist through
*  that. And then also be prepared to pivot. That's a newer word, new for me, but when I pivoted from
*  newpedia to Wikipedia, it's like, this isn't working. I've got to completely change.
*  So be willing to completely change direction when something's not working. Now, the problem with
*  these two wonderful pieces of advice is which situation am I in today, right? Is this a moment
*  when I need to just power through and persist because I'm going to find a way to make this work
*  or is this a moment where I need to go, actually, this is totally not working and I need to change
*  direction. But also I think for me, that always gives me a framework of like, okay, let's, okay,
*  here's a problem. Do we need to change direction or do we need to kind of power through it? And
*  just knowing like those are the choices, not always the only choices, but those are choices,
*  I think can be helpful to say, okay, am I checking it out? Like, because I'm having a little bump and
*  I'm feeling emotional and I'm just going to give up too soon. Okay, ask yourself that question.
*  And also it's like, am I being pigheaded and trying to do something that actually doesn't
*  make sense? Okay, ask yourself that question too, even though they're contradictory questions.
*  Sometimes it'll be one, sometimes it'll be the other, and you got to really think it through.
*  I think persisting with the business model behind Wikipedia is such an inspiring story
*  because we live in a capitalist world. We live in a scary world, I think, for an internet business.
*  And so like to do things differently than a lot of websites are doing. Like Wikipedia has lived
*  through the successive explosion of many websites that are basically ad-driven. Google is ad-driven.
*  Facebook, Twitter, all of these websites are ad-driven. And to see them succeed become these
*  incredibly rich, powerful companies that if I could just have that money, you would think
*  as somebody running Wikipedia, I could do so much positive stuff. And so to persist through that is,
*  I think is from my perspective now, Monday night quarterback or whatever,
*  is the right decision. But boy, is that a tough decision.
*  It seemed easy at the time. And then you just kind of stay with it.
*  Yeah, just stay with it. It's working. So now when you chose persistent.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I always like to give an example of MySpace,
*  because I just think it's an amusing story. So MySpace was poised, I would say, to be Facebook.
*  It was huge. It was viral. It was lots of things. Kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even TikTok
*  because it was like a lot of entertainment content, casual. And then Rupert Murdoch bought it and it
*  collapsed within a few years. And part of that, I think, was because they were really, really
*  heavy on ads and less heavy on the customer experience. So I remember to accept a friend
*  request was like three clicks where you saw three ads. And on Facebook, you accept the friend
*  request. You didn't even leave the page. That just accepted. But what is interesting. So I used to
*  give this example of like, yeah, well, Rupert Murdoch really screwed that one up. And in a sense,
*  maybe he did. But somebody said, you know what, actually, he bought it for, and I don't remember
*  the numbers, he bought it for 800 million and it was very profitable through its decline.
*  And he actually made his money back and more. So it wasn't like from a financial point of view,
*  it was a bad investment in the sense of you could have been Facebook, but on sort of more
*  mundane metrics, it's like, actually worked out okay for him. It all matters how you define success.
*  It does. And that is also advice to young people. One of the things I would say, like,
*  when we have our mental models of success, as an entrepreneur, for example, and your examples in
*  your mind are Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg. So people who at a very young age had one really
*  great idea that just went straight to the moon and became one of the richest people in the world.
*  That is really unusual, like really, really rare. And for most entrepreneurs, that is not the life
*  path you're going to take. You're going to fail, you're going to reboot, you're going to learn from
*  what you failed at, you're going to try something different. And that is really important because if
*  your standard of success is, well, I feel sad because I'm not as rich as Elon Musk. It's like,
*  well, so should almost everyone, possibly everyone except Elon Musk is not as rich as Elon Musk. And
*  so that, like realistically, you can set a standard of success, even in a really now since
*  which I don't recommend of thinking about your financial success. It's like, if you measure your
*  financial success by thinking about billionaires, like that's heavy. Like that's probably not good.
*  I don't recommend it. Whereas like I personally, you know, like for me, when people, when journalists
*  say, oh, how does it feel to not be a billionaire? I usually say, I don't know. How does it feel to
*  you? Because they're not. But also I'm like, I live in London. The number of bankers that no one's
*  ever heard of who live in London, who make far more money than I ever will is quite a large number.
*  And I wouldn't trade my life for theirs at all. Right? Because mine is so interesting. Like,
*  oh, right. Jimmy, we need you to go and meet the Chinese propaganda minister. Oh, okay. That's
*  super interesting. Like, yeah, Jimmy, you know, like, here's the situation. Like, you can go to
*  this country and while you're there, the president has asked to see you. It's like,
*  that's super interesting. Jimmy, you're going to this place and there's a local Wikipedia who said,
*  do you want to stay with me and my family? And I'm like, yeah, like, that's really cool. Like,
*  I would like to do that. That's really interesting. Don't do that all the time,
*  but I've done it and it's great. So like, for me, that's like arranging your life so that
*  you have interesting experiences is just great. Well, this is more to the question of what
*  Wikipedia looks like in a thousand years. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
*  Why are we here? Human civilization, what's the meaning of life?
*  I don't think there is an external answer to that question.
*  And I should mention that there's a very good Wikipedia page on the different philosophies
*  of the meaning of life. Oh, interesting. I have to read that and see what I think. Hopefully,
*  it's neutral and gives a wide frame. Oh, it's a really good reference to a lot
*  of different philosophies about meaning. The 20th century philosophy in general,
*  from Nietzsche to the existentialists, to some of the Boer, all of them have an idea of meaning.
*  They really struggle systematically, rigorously, and that's what the page, and obviously a shout
*  out to the Hitchhiker's Guide and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think there's no
*  external answer to that. I think it's internal. I think we decide what meaning we will have in our
*  lives and what we're going to do with ourselves. And so when I think, if we're talking about
*  thousand years, millions of years, Uri Milner wrote a book. He's a big internet investor guy.
*  He wrote a book advocating quite strongly for humans exploring the universe and getting off
*  the planet. And he funds projects using lasers to send little cameras and interesting stuff.
*  And he talks a lot in the book about meaning. His view is that the purpose of the human species is to
*  broadly survive and get off the planet. Well, I don't agree with everything he has to say,
*  because I think that's not a meaning that can motivate most people in their own lives. It's like,
*  okay, great. The distances of space are absolutely enormous. So I don't know,
*  should we build generation ships to start flying places? Well, I can't do that. And even if I could,
*  even if I'm Elon Musk and I could devote all my wealth to building, I'll be dead on the ship on
*  the way. So is that really meaning? But I think it's really interesting to think about. And reading
*  his little book, it's quite a short little book, reading his book, it did make me think about,
*  wow, this is big. This is not what you think about in your day-to-day life.
*  It's like, where is the human species going to be in 10 million years? And it does make you
*  turn back to Earth and say, gee, let's not destroy the planet. We're stuck here for at least a while.
*  And therefore, we should really think about sustainability. And I mean,
*  1 million years sustainability. And we don't have all the answers. We have nothing close to
*  the answers. I'm actually excited about AI in this regard, while also bracketing. Yeah, I understand
*  there's also risks and people are terrified of AI. But I actually think it is quite interesting,
*  this moment in time that we may have in the next 50 years, to really, really solve some really
*  really long-term human problems, for example, in health. The progress that's being made in
*  cancer treatment, because we are able to at scale model molecules and genetics and things like this,
*  it's huge. It's really exciting. So if we can hang on for a little while,
*  and certain problems that seem completely intractable today, like climate change,
*  may end up being actually not that hard. And we just might be able to alleviate
*  the full diversity of human suffering. For sure. Yeah. And in so doing, help increase the chance
*  that we can propagate the flame of human consciousness out towards the stars. And I
*  think another important one, if we fail to do that, for me, is propagating and maintaining
*  the full diversity and richness and complexity and expansiveness of human knowledge. So if we
*  destroy ourselves, it would make me feel a little bit okay. Yeah. If the human knowledge just
*  triggered me to say something really interesting, which is when we talked earlier about translating
*  and using machines to translate, we mostly talked about small languages and translating
*  into English. But I always like to tell this story of something inconsequential, really.
*  But I was in Norway, in Bergen, Norway, where every year they've got this annual festival called
*  Buetkor, which is young groups drumming and they have a drumming competition. It's the 17 sectors
*  of the city and they've been doing it for a couple hundred years or whatever. They wrote about it in
*  the three languages of Norway. And then from there, it was translated into English and to German,
*  et cetera, et cetera. And so what I love about that story is what it reminds me is,
*  this machine translation goes both ways. And when you talk about the richness and broadness
*  of human culture, we're already seeing some really great pieces of this. So Korean soap operas,
*  really popular, not with me, but with people. And the ability to imagine taking a very famous,
*  very popular, very well-known Korean drama. And now, I literally mean now, we're just about there
*  technologically, where we use a machine to redub it in English in an automated way, including
*  digitally editing the faces so it doesn't look dubbed. And so suddenly you say, oh, wow, here's
*  a piece of, it's the Korean equivalent of maybe it's friends as a comedy or maybe it's succession,
*  just to be very contemporary. It's something that really impacted a lot of people and they really
*  loved it. And we have literally no idea what it's about. And suddenly it's like, wow, music,
*  street music from wherever in the world can suddenly become accessible to us all in new ways.
*  It's so cool. It's really exciting to get access to the richness of culture in China, in the many
*  different subcultures of Africa, South America. One of my unsuccessful arguments with the Chinese
*  government is by blocking Wikipedia. You aren't just stopping people in China from reading
*  Chinese Wikipedia and other language versions of Wikipedia. You're also preventing the Chinese
*  people from telling their story. So is there a small festival in a small town in China like
*  Buoy Corp.? I don't know, but by the way, the people who live in that village, that small town
*  of 50,000, they can't put that in Wikipedia and get it translated into other places. They can't
*  share their culture and their knowledge. And I think for China, this should be a somewhat
*  influential argument because China does feel misunderstood in the world. It's like, okay,
*  well, there's one way, if you want to help people understand, put it in Wikipedia. That's what people
*  go to when they want to understand. And give the amazing, incredible people of China a voice.
*  Exactly. Jimmy, thank you so much. I'm such a huge fan of everything you've done. I keep saying
*  that's really great. I'm deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for Wikipedia. I love it. It brings
*  me joy. I donate all the time. You should donate too. It's a huge honor to finally talk with you.
*  And this is amazing. Thank you so much for today. Thanks for having me.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Wales. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from the
*  world historian, Daniel Borsten. The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance. It is the
*  illusion of knowledge. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
