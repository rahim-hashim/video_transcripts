# Ryan Hall: Solving Martial Arts from First Principles | Lex Fridman Podcast #169
**Lex Fridman:** [March 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHg9sfOzBbY)
*  The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall, his second time in the podcast.
*  He's one of the most innovative scholars of martial arts in the modern era. Quick mention
*  of our sponsors. Indeed, Hiring Website, Audible Audiobooks, ExpressVPN, and Element Electrolyte
*  Drink. Click the sponsor links to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note,
*  let me say that I've gotten a chance to train with Ryan recently and to both discuss and try out on
*  the mat his ideas about grappling and fighting. What struck me is his unapologetic drive to solve
*  martial arts. It reminds me of the ambitious vision and effort of Google's DeepMind to solve
*  intelligence. In Ryan's case, this isn't some out there martial arts guru talk. This is a style of
*  thinking about the game of human chess, of seeking to define the rules, and to engineer ways from
*  first principles of escaping the constraints of those rules. This style of thinking is rare,
*  but is ultimately the one that leads to the discovery of new revolutionary ideas.
*  If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe to it anywhere, or connect with me at Alex Friedman.
*  And now, here's my conversation with Ryan Hall. You're known as a systems thinker in martial
*  arts, but you also, I think, are willing to think outside the rules of the game outside of the system.
*  When you're thinking about strategies of how to, you know, solve the problem,
*  particular problem of an opponent, whether that's jiu jitsu or mixed martial arts,
*  what's your process for doing that for figuring out that puzzle?
*  I would say I don't know if I have a specific like a to b to c process for that sort of thing.
*  I try to do my best to appreciate that I think a lot of the thinking, or maybe not
*  all the thinking, but a lot of great thinking on conflict, on battle, on war, on martial arts has
*  been done already. Not that we don't have to do any sort of background investigation or reassessing
*  of these ideas or axioms that have come down through things like the book of five rings,
*  or the art of war, or you know, like von clausowitz, even anything like that really,
*  but is trying to understand the lessons of the past that I think oftentimes we don't take with us
*  problems on. We pay lip service and like, oh yeah, you know, a victorious fighter,
*  the great fighter, you know, he knows victory is there, then he seeks battle. Everyone else is
*  looking for victory in battle. Yeah, moving on. And that's why I'm going to double jab and throw
*  my left hand. And I think a lot of times our actions don't reflect our stated belief structure.
*  And I think that oftentimes you can tell what I believe really, or what my fundamental operating
*  system is based on my actions, whether I'm aware, I have an operating system internally, whether I'm
*  aware of it or not, or certainly whether I'm fully aware of it. So I guess when it comes to
*  strategy, I try to think about how things interact. You mentioned systems thinking,
*  and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist. But I think that systems have a fundamental
*  strength and a fundamental weakness. They work how they work, and that's great, but they're
*  readable. So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system of which you're not really read into,
*  then I think oftentimes I can seem like shockingly effective, particularly if my system preys on
*  certain weaknesses that maybe you're given to. But what happens when you've read the same books
*  that I have? I think that a lot of times that makes me deeply predictable. I think about systems
*  in jujitsu, and a lot of times people think that they're doing jujitsu when in reality they are
*  doing an expression of it. Let's say I'll use, there's the Marcello Garcia system. There is the
*  Hanzo Gracie current Hanzo Gracie system. There's the old Gracie Baja one. There's the Gracie Academy
*  classic Gracie Jujitsu. There's the Art of Jujitsu kind of Atos approach. There's some crossover
*  between a lot of these, but oftentimes I think when it comes to understanding how I'm making
*  decisions and how my opponent is making decisions, I have to appreciate whether or not I'm an end
*  user of something, and I'll use my phone as an example. I was thinking of this the other day,
*  and as an end user of my phone, I have no idea what it does. Edward Snowden comes up and goes,
*  hey guys, you realize your phones are listening to you. I'm like, really? What? All right,
*  I believe you. Then of course that comes out, but to what extent? I have no idea.
*  What is my phone capable of? I have no idea. I can mess with the font though. I really like blue
*  screens, not purple screens. As an end user, I can change some of the bells and whistles that
*  have nothing to do with the underlying source code of it all or how it functions. The same way
*  in my car, I'm an end user of my car. If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes. If I push
*  on the gas, it goes. I know how to fix it when it's out of gas. I know how to fix it when it's
*  out of oil. I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes, but short of that, or actually beyond that,
*  I have nothing. I think that oftentimes, I've been around in Jiu Jitsu long enough to encounter a new
*  wave of good grapplers, and it's very, very interesting sometimes how their running systems,
*  they don't realize they're running. I'm like, oh yeah, I trained at Marcelo Garcia's academy
*  for a long time. A big fan of Marcelo's was a student there, encountered a lot of the
*  Otto-style Jiu Jitsu a number of years ago. Been very, very deep into foot locking and leg attacks
*  and whatnot for a long, long time. I understand your system better than you do, or I may. Let's
*  say you understand my system better than I do. That would be a huge issue. That was something
*  that I encountered a long time ago trying to come up in Jiu Jitsu where I was trying to utilize
*  systems that were created by, let's say, Hoffa Mendez or someone else. I'm basically trying to
*  do what you're doing. I'm just not doing as good of a version of it. Not only am I not doing it
*  well, but I'm entirely predictable. I think that that can be a big issue. To come back,
*  I think of systems a lot of times now in terms of particularly end user type of systems. An iPhone
*  is a really, really fast way for me to be able to do all sorts of things. If you were to take it
*  from me, I couldn't recreate any of that. You want to be more the NSA and less the end user.
*  Exactly. Exactly. That way, I'm listening to you. You want to be the NSA of combat.
*  That's right. We're watching you pee. Basically, I guess what I would come back and say is,
*  if you understand how things interact on a fundamental level and what type of games exist
*  and what type of interactions exist, then you can transcend a lot of the systems. It's almost like
*  a cook versus if I can make certain things in the kitchen, but I am not a chef. You could give me a
*  bunch of ingredients and I could probably cook not well, but a couple of different things.
*  A master chef would be aware of the implications of all of the things that they're doing,
*  extra time in the oven, less time in the oven, putting this flavoring or spice in,
*  what you're doing with various things. Also, they could turn all of these ingredients into
*  Chinese food, or they could turn all these ingredients into Italian food, and they could
*  turn all these Italian food ingredients into chicken parmesan, or it could turn into lasagna,
*  but they're not limited to a specific thing because they have knowledge of how
*  food interacts, what it does to create taste, what it does to create texture.
*  To come back, let's take rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea
*  of a couple of different things. Actually, I'll tell you what. May I ask you a question?
*  Yeah. What's your favorite dinosaur? On three, we'll go. One, two, three.
*  T-Rex.
*  T-Rex. Me too. Man, we're going to be best friends. What's the first question when you say,
*  hey, let's play rock, paper, scissors? Is it rock, paper, scissors or rock, paper, scissors, shoot?
*  Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. You're like, okay. Because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot,
*  and I'm like, oh man, I got lucky and I won. Imagine I won 100 times in a row.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd be luck. I'd be luck if I was honestly doing that. Now, let's say, for instance,
*  I go on rock, paper, scissors and you go on shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Here comes
*  the rock, right? If you lose, whose fault is it? It's yours. This is built on a parody thing where
*  I don't get to pick second. If I get to pick second, it's like being able to investigate
*  your background before going to meet you. Then I'm like, oh, hi. I too love the New Jersey nets,
*  which is a statement that no one in their right mind would ever make when I was growing up.
*  Anyway, you'd have to have personal knowledge of somebody. Anyway, to come back, if you understand
*  how games are structured, you can start to realize that there's huge gaps and huge holes in a lot of
*  the thinking behind all of it. If you can create the illusion of choice, I'll play one more if you
*  don't mind. This is one of my favorite ones. I do this in class all the time. Have you seen this
*  before? No. Okay. May I ask you some questions, please? Sure. Okay. Fantastic. I'm scared.
*  Everybody wins. Don't worry. All right. Could you please pick three fingers and tell me what
*  they are? Your thumb, your pinky and your middle finger. Okay. Could you please pick two fingers?
*  Your middle finger and your pinky. Okay. Could you please pick one finger?
*  I'll go with the middle finger. Okay. Could you please pick one finger?
*  Pinky. Okay. Let's play again. Can you pick one finger, please?
*  Your middle finger. Okay. Can you pick one finger, please? Your thumb. Yeah. Your pinky.
*  Okay. Now pick two more fingers, please. Your middle finger and your ring finger. Okay. Could
*  you please pick one more finger? Damn it. So I thought that enhanced the illusion of choice.
*  The illusion of choice. If I'm asking the questions, provided I ask the right questions,
*  there can be no correct answer. It doesn't mean that ultimately if that's what you wanted,
*  let's say like I thought I was guiding you to something I wanted. It turns out that was the
*  outcome you wanted. Now here's now I'm going to ask the wrong questions. I might not get what I
*  wanted. Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt. For people that might be just listening to this,
*  that no matter what trajectory we took through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,
*  it was always ending up with the middle finger, ironically enough. I was surprised. So all of us
*  were surprised and we're both winners. Yeah. We all, everyone. I felt like a winner. All right. So
*  now I'm going to ask some different questions if you don't mind. Can you please pick two fingers
*  to put down? Your middle finger and your pinky. All right. Sorry. That's so awkward. That's like
*  the worst finger positions. Okay. Can you please pick a, wait a minute. That's, oh, hold on. Yeah.
*  Well, what if you pick two other fingers to put down? Your thumb and your pinky. Okay. My thumb
*  on my pinky. Can you please pick two fingers to put down? Well, whatever two you like. Okay. Your
*  middle finger and your pointy finger. Ah, okay. Can you pick two fingers to put down? What's the
*  name? Is index index finger. It's the pointy one. That's the one we usually point. It's weird to
*  point with the ring finger. Uh, sorry. What do it put two more to put down, please? Uh, the middle
*  finger and the ring finger. Ah, man. Is it, what if you pick my, my ring finger and my index finger?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I win. Yeah. So even though I'm asking the questions, it's not impossible that I arrive
*  at a good outcome for me, but it's, it's no longer guaranteed. I went from a situation where I
*  literally can't lose. Yeah. It's pretty low probability. Right. Super low probability.
*  And the second you realize what I'm doing, you would never let me win because the ball's truly
*  in your court. So I guess that that's kind of what I'm fundamentally trying to put into play almost
*  all the time. Can I ask the right set of questions? Can I develop the ability, um, skills wise,
*  understanding wise, and then discipline wise, and then have the courage and the constitution
*  and the, and the discipline necessary, the patience necessary to ask the proper questions
*  and wait for the proper answers. And if I can all assuming like the perfect world, I win period.
*  Yes. Does that make sense? Yeah, that totally makes sense. So I don't know if you know sort
*  of the more mathematical discipline of game theory, there's something called mechanism design.
*  So game theory is this field where you model some kind of interaction between human beings.
*  You can model grappling that way. You can, uh, model nuclear conflict between nations that way.
*  And, uh, you set up a set of rules and incentives and then use math to predict, uh, what is the
*  likely outcome depending over time based on the interaction, given those rules, mechanism design
*  is the design of games. So like the design of systems that are likely to lead to a certain
*  outcome. And so what you're suggesting is you want to create, you want to discover systems
*  whose decision tree, all the possible things that could happen, feel like there's choice being made,
*  but ultimately one of the parties doesn't have any choice in what the actual final outcome is.
*  Uh, you're making them feel like they're playing a game too. So it's not like you don't feel trapped.
*  It's kind of like, well, the best traps, I don't, you don't look very threatening. So I'm like,
*  oh, I'll walk over there. I guess it wouldn't that is, I guess that's kind of an interesting
*  thing. If a lion, when does a lion roar? It's an interesting thing when you watch like lions
*  hunting don't roar when they hunt. They want to, when they want to move you back. They do stuff
*  like that when they actually want to come and get you, they're pretty slinky. It's like water covered.
*  It's like furry water. And I guess like when you keep that in mind, um, it's funny how like a
*  frosted hobby, actually, you know, brilliant guy, like a, one of my MMA coaches and the head coach,
*  your tri star, um, he brought this up one time. I thought it was a really salient point. So let's
*  say we have a million person bracket, impossibly huge. Like Frank Dukes winning the Kuma Tei level,
*  huge bracket. He claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people. And you're like, that is
*  all of Hong Kong was in that thing. And everyone kept their mouth shut. But anyway, that's pretty
*  cool. But, uh, to cut, to come back a little improbable, pretty cool. Um, so let's say for
*  instance, like there's no cheating going on, no cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?
*  Someone is going to have an unbroken string of victory through that bracket,
*  which is pretty insane. How many, how many consecutive like toss ups this person won.
*  And then at the end of it all, imagine we like aliens show up and we go, hey, they want to flip
*  a coin for the not earth, whether or not earth, uh, you know, gets to, gets to continue. They'll be
*  like, Oh, I'll do it. I'm good at this. That would be tempting as a person to do. You're like,
*  I'm a lucky guy. Are you, are you sure? Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are. We could argue
*  that effectively you're incredibly lucky, but basically, uh, is that an actual ability? Is
*  that like a perk in a video game or is that just this thing that happened? So anyway, uh,
*  how many times are someone, you could go through an entire career, you know, particularly in a
*  fight sport. Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts in 15 toss up scenarios. Cause you see that
*  happening all the time in the fight game, a toss up scenario. It's not like you're mounted on me
*  and like, and that's not a toss up scenario. Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios,
*  a lot of grappling ones, but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups. And, uh, somebody
*  wins by knockout. They win five times in a row. Then they lose a couple of times in a row. We go,
*  what happened? You're like, what do you mean what happened? They were always flipping the coin.
*  And then they win five more and they go back on track. Can you imagine that you're flipping
*  a coin? I'm like heads, heads, heads, heads, tails. What tails tails heads again. Oh man,
*  I'm back on it. I'm flipping good now. That's basically what's going on. I think the vast
*  majority of the time, and then humanity's, you know, tendency to see a sign in almost anything,
*  you know, it starts to present itself. And then we build a narrative in our mind to,
*  to convince ourselves that we're in some sort of control. When in reality, I was in a marginal
*  situation at best the whole time. Yeah. Without having much control, without having a deep
*  understanding of the system, the same stories told the stock market with many of the human,
*  these distributed human systems, we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns without
*  understanding actually the system that's generating these patterns. So if we can see the system,
*  that's incredibly valuable. But then you go, well, what system is above all of the systems? And I
*  guess maybe physics, maybe something like a game theory explains these things with like, I guess,
*  what are the, what aspects of the system can I, can I put my hands on that I can touch and understand
*  and what am I, what am I missing? What, what, what's going on in the world all around me to
*  continue to lean on, on Dune that I don't have, that I don't, you know, you talk to a blind person
*  about, about the world, about sight and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone who's got
*  coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell like, this is delicious. Like, is it? So anyway,
*  you know, again, what, what senses am I missing or what understanding am I missing that's preventing
*  me from seeing the dots connect in the world all around me? And I think sometimes if we,
*  oftentimes, at least personally, I've screwed this up a lot. I'm so nose deep in the, in the
*  trench of trying to understand what I'm doing that I can't take a step back and realize, you know,
*  that I'm in a forest, not just headed, headbutting a tree. And I may be doing both, maybe both,
*  two things should be true at once. But so I would say when it comes to strategy, trying to understand
*  that, but then also you go, well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool, but how can you actually do
*  that? And then I'd say, that's a really good question, because if I imagine I say, man, I
*  should fight like Steven Thompson, I should fight like Wonder Boy, it's like, good idea, go do that.
*  I'm like, not the guy, I would fight like, even with a bag of Madoff if I could, you know, it
*  seems to work. So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop, what if I could take my time
*  developing skills so that when these strategies become apparent, they are executable to you,
*  you actually have the ability to like, in or to again, to be the person in the arena,
*  be the person required, whereas there's plenty of great ideas, like dunking a basketball is a
*  fantastic idea. Alas for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby, I'm not the guy.
*  But that doesn't make it any less good of an idea. I just don't have, I haven't developed the ability
*  or I lack the ability. So anyway, I think a lot of times, at least when I watch people in fighting,
*  I'll use an example. We're so concerned with trying to win early on, rather than develop skills,
*  that I'm going like, well, what's the best way to fight with my current set of skills?
*  And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route, like the you put on the one ring,
*  take the damage you need to take to hit that guy. And that was something I realized very early on
*  in my MMA career was like, I'm not that good at striking at that time. Not a world-class striker
*  now, but I'm way better at striking than I'm given any credit for because it helps people
*  sleep at night, I think. But I'm serious. But yeah, you're always introduced as like this master,
*  like master grappler.
*  I'm like, that's nice of them to say that. Maybe I'm not that good at grappling. We haven't even
*  seen that. And but the funny thing is, I'm like, just because people almost go like, well, Lex,
*  like, so you're really good at this, but you got to understand, like, we're equal, man, like,
*  I'm good at this other thing. Maybe you're really good at what you do. And I'm just mediocre. That's
*  also possible. So there's plenty of people that define themselves as a striker that do that just
*  because that's for lack of other options, not because they're really good striker. Like I'm
*  a grappler. I was a grappler as a blue belt. Not really. So anyway, I guess to come back,
*  if I'm constantly going, how can I win with what I've got right now, I think oftentimes,
*  I never take the time to develop the skills that I want to develop. And I also never take the time
*  to develop the strategies that I want to develop. And that has actually been one big blessing
*  of fighting someone frequently, which has been really frustrating as a result of injuries and
*  time away. And, you know, some of those people being hesitant to get in the game. But it gives
*  you so much time to be out of the trenches and focus on developing your abilities so that now
*  it's almost like developing money that you mentioned the stock market that you can now put in.
*  As you told me, Bitcoin was a great idea five years ago and I had eight bucks. Man,
*  if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea five years ago and I had, you know, 50K, I'd be like,
*  oh my God, I'd be sleeping in my bed of money that I would then set on fire later today just to do it.
*  So all the due to all the injuries, you've been mining Bitcoin all this time and now you're a
*  rich man. Well, no, actually someone told me I was trying to mine for Bitcoin actually like in a cave.
*  And then I found out recently that it's actually mining is like a figure of speech.
*  You misunderstood.
*  Not like a literal thing that you do. But I mean, in my defense, I mean.
*  English language is difficult.
*  It is. It really is.
*  Next time talking to me, I'll explain. Russian is more, is a rich language. You should learn,
*  you should learn Russian. I'll help you out.
*  I believe you. Thank you.
*  Can you do a whirlwind overview of your career in MMA leading up to this point with the injuries
*  and the undefeated record and then what's next? Since we're on the topic.
*  I did my first fight in a as a blue belt and I've been training for about a year and a half. I did
*  nine judo tournaments in 10 weekends or eight, maybe eight judo tournaments in 10 weekends prior
*  to my first fight in April 2006. I got punched in the face a whole bunch. I didn't realize it was
*  a professional fight and found that out like the day beforehand. That was great. Thanks, coach.
*  Uh, it was an Atlantic city where another place, no one ever goes on purpose. So that wasn't great.
*  I got into three, actually three car accidents in the preceding 36 hours before the fight.
*  I had my car totaled. Um, I wasn't driving for any of them. That was great. Uh, it was 2006.
*  2006. Yeah. Then I, yeah. I've been training for about a year and a half.
*  To blue belt. You're getting, I mean, if you haven't lived, if you haven't gotten punched
*  in the face in Atlantic city. That's true. I mean, I've
*  so these are, I would have loved to have it happen for different reasons. But, uh, yeah.
*  Well, what's funny is that, you know, I, I remember, you know, getting punched in the face,
*  a bunch trying to do inverted guard. I won one round, lost two rounds, definitely lost the fight.
*  So you went for inverted side to interrupt you went for inverted guard. Like, can you tell the
*  story of that fight? Yeah, sure. It was three, three minute rounds, which is not a professional
*  fight length. Although I don't know if professional fight length would have been any better. This is
*  more time to get punched. Uh, but, uh, I found out part way through. I was like, I remember walking
*  back to my corner in the first round. I'm like, this guy can't hurt me. And he's like, yeah,
*  my corner was my friend, Tom, and then someone else. And then he's like, yeah, I would still
*  encourage you to stop blocking so many punches with your face. I'm like, that's a good idea.
*  Tom, I appreciate that. I'm gonna try that. Um, anyway, uh, I remember like I was not,
*  you're not allowed to up kick. So I'm like, great. I was, I had no martial arts skills
*  it really at all. But if I had anything at all, it was Jiu-Jitsu. It was very, very little Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Uh, but definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking. Like I was basically a magnet for
*  punches. So that was your time. Uh, you know, rough neck and out in Atlantic city, as we all do
*  once in a while. Can we fast forward to when you're actually dominating the world as a black belt?
*  Well, actually it's funny cause I took a little bit of money that I, they're like, hey, we were
*  paying him like, really? Okay. Like stories with Ryan Hall. Well, then I went to, I went to the
*  casino. I went to whatever, like the traffic Canada that was right there, the casino, cause that was
*  a boardwalk hall. I'm like, you know what, man, this was, this has been a not great, not great
*  evening. I'm going to, this is, I'm going to win it back. It's going to be great.
*  15 minutes later, they had all the money that I had from the fight was gone. I just remember
*  like walking out of the casino, super pissed and like, I don't know what I was thinking, like,
*  I'm not good at gambling. Why this was not going to make my night better. I just thought that there
*  was going to be some sort of cosmic balancing and maybe it was the cosmic balancing all at once with
*  things I've done in the long term though. Yeah. The balancing we'll see. I hope so, but to come,
*  so dead in the end though. That is true. Time will get us all. Yeah. Well, that was, so that was the
*  first one. And that was when I realized I'm terrible at MMA, but I like it. I should just
*  stop this until I one day learned how to actually grapple much less learn how to fight. But I
*  remember there's this guy named Dave Kaplan, who's the reason my ears are all messed up,
*  who was on the ultimate fighter and got punched in the face and knocked out by Tom Lawler, who
*  I'll always appreciate for doing that. But anyway, I appreciate Tom. I appreciate Dave too. David,
*  David was just a huge bully and used to like rather than completely unmercifully,
*  but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of me. And anyway, the ears look good. So appreciate
*  that. I tell people it's a tumor that I got and I'm going to, if they want in on a class action
*  lawsuit with AT&T, they should, you know, send, send me an email, but anyway, you're very financially
*  savvy. I'm good. No, I just give the impression. Dave basically said, Hey, don't worry, man. You're
*  never going to be good at MMA and you're never going to be good at grappling either. But even
*  if you are good at grappling, which in my opinion, you will never be, you will never be good at
*  fighting. And I said, Dave, if I do nothing else in my life, I'm going to keep training until I can
*  make you pay for that. And now that I can make him pay for that really easily, he doesn't train
*  anymore. But I love Dave. Dave's awesome. He actually won the singing bee. What an interesting
*  dude. Super interesting guy. But anyway, uh, no, no, no, Virginia, like speaks a couple of languages,
*  super interesting guy, like shockingly good at Jeopardy too. Um, not that I'm any good, but still
*  shockingly good at Jeopardy. So anyway, years later met Faraz Zahabi, actually John Danaher.
*  I met John Danaher and he put me in touch with Faraz Zahabi. I started training at TriStar,
*  you know, immediately loved, uh, working with Faraz and learning under Faraz, started training
*  at TriStar. And I did my first real professional MMA fight, um, as someone that actually does,
*  had practiced a little bit higher, uh, in, I think August, 2012. Um, and, uh, that was against a guy,
*  he was four and five at the time. So, you know, had some experience, um, good kind of like first go
*  for me, honestly. And I won that fight by TKO and then it was a little bit of a time off. And then
*  I did another fight against a tough guy named, uh, Majid Hamo. Um, he was five and two at the time.
*  I think he was three and I was amateur. He had a good, good little bit of fighting experience.
*  Um, won that one in the first round of our rear naked choke and then, uh,
*  started to experience difficulty getting, getting fights at that point. Um, you know,
*  I, you continuously introduced as like the, the master of grappling, the submission,
*  at least that was, that was my thing. If I don't know if I was,
*  is that was the source of the fear for people? I think so, because I mean, that definitely wasn't
*  much at striking at that point. You know, I definitely am a lot, I like to think I'm pretty
*  hard to hurt, although I try not to lean on that. And I played baseball for like 16 years so I can
*  hit things pretty hard. I just wasn't able to, uh, I, I recognized pretty early on that I had no idea
*  how to actually hit things hard without becoming hittable myself. So I think that's kind of the big
*  thing is a lot of times like we almost were mentioning, uh, before, if you try to go and get
*  people too early, you can hit them if they're not that good, but you're going to get hit yourself.
*  So you're making, you're basically making a wager. You're making a trade of your own life for the
*  ability to hit them. When you watch guys like Israel, a lot of Sonia, Floyd Mayweather, Steven
*  Thompson, uh, Conor McGregor, when he's fighting really well, it's not a trade. They're not,
*  you're hitting them and they're hitting you. It's they're hitting you, but it takes years and years
*  and years to be able to learn how to do that. Ton Lee is another great example of that. And,
*  you know, my closest training partner, one of my best friends and, uh, currently now, uh, one champion,
*  one championship in, uh, in Asia, the champion of the, uh, featherweight or I guess lightweight
*  featherweight, um, 155, uh, over there now. And he recently defeated a Martin Nguyen in a really
*  great fight and, uh, Ton knocked him out, long time champion. And Ton doesn't let you hit him.
*  He doesn't let you touch him. I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Steven and Ton to go early
*  on in career and go, holy moly. I can't even, it's not even like, Oh, you'll let me walk over
*  and find you. It's like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up with a hammer and smoke
*  you in the melon and then disappears into the ether again. So the way they approach the fighting
*  game is thinking, how can I attack without being hit? So every, every strategy, every idea you have
*  about what you're going to do has to do with, uh, like that, uh, minimizing the, the returns.
*  Absolutely. I mean, that's what all good fighting is done. All poor fighting, if you know, throughout
*  the course of history, most generals, whether they saw a read or, you know, they w they did
*  battles by attrition. You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys. You've got 50, like, yeah,
*  60 of my guys die killing your 50. Like that's great for me, but, uh, that's not so great for
*  the 60 guys that died. You know, I hope it's worth it. So when you realize that not only, you're not
*  just Kobe Bryant and you're Phil Jackson too, you got to do everything, you know, if you've got to
*  run across the beach in Normandy, so be it, but that better be, you should have, we make sure we
*  thought this through and there's like, Hey, there's no way we can like, you know, walk around the
*  side, huh? Because oftentimes there, there is, and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives
*  in professional fighting to, for people to want to do that. And we come up with all sorts of, well,
*  I'm trying to be exciting. Are you, is that really what you came here to do? Cause I came here to
*  win. And I think that anyone that that's really successful came there to win. And if it ends up
*  being exciting, well, that's fantastic. I hope that people enjoy watching something and that's
*  great, but that's a qualitative assessment anyway. You know, you want to also be able to, you know,
*  live the rest of your life. I think it's easy, you know, I'll use Meldrick Taylor. I'm a big boxing
*  fan. Meldrick Taylor was an excellent fighter, came this close to a world title and was stopped
*  with like, he was in a fight that he was winning with seconds remaining, literally seconds remaining,
*  and they probably could have just let it go and he would have been world champion. And it was brutal.
*  If you ever watched legendary nights, like HBO boxing show, it's great, but it's heartbreaking.
*  It's absolutely heartbreaking. And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight changed him
*  for the rest of his life. And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before, but it
*  was one of those where you go, it's, it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name at
*  age 44 years old. And I didn't come here. What are they, what did Patton saying? Nobody, nobody
*  wins the war by dying for his country. You make the other poor bastard die for his. And I think
*  that that's kind of what we're shooting for. And you know, the lionization of absorbing damage and
*  that not being a big deal. Like you hear that all the time. So-and-so can take shots that would put
*  a lesser fighter down. What does that even mean? You know, like, so let me get this straight. Your
*  ability to absorb damage is a part of you. I mean, I guess that don't get me wrong. That is an
*  attribute that's nice to have if you, if you need it, but there's plenty of people that actually
*  have really poorest defense that are just very, very difficult to hurt for whatever reason.
*  That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing. I mean, the, the, the story that is
*  inspiring. And I know it goes against the artistry of fighting is when you have taken the damage
*  to still rise up and be able to defeat the opponent. So it's a, but that, that's a flip
*  side of a basically you failing to defend yourself properly. Right? I agree. But let's say for, I
*  think it's, it's a time that's a triumph of your, of humanity. That's a triumph. That's amazing.
*  To witness such a thing is unbelievable, but you still go, this is, there is a cost here. It's like,
*  I have been fortunate enough to spend some time working with, with the military and I've been
*  like around and read Medal of Honor citations. They're unbelievable. Like you read the story and
*  you're like, it, it's, it'll floor you. But it's not a cost and you don't want to be paying that
*  cost. And most of the time it was, the cost was everything. And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah,
*  the value here, it's worth everything. It's like, I defend your family, defend your country under
*  certain circumstances. And if that points extension of your family, you're like, Hey, this is worth it
*  to casually throw your life away or throw your health away. It's foolish. There's nothing,
*  there's nothing great about that. And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see,
*  but it's also amazing to see you not take damage as the Floyd Mayweather. It's the artistry of like
*  not being hit. And I wonder if maybe that's why people don't resonate with Floyd as much as
*  obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place a great man for so many different reasons, although
*  it was funny to remember, like there were times when he wasn't very popular. We love him now
*  because of time of context, time to move away from some of the nonsense he had to deal with.
*  But we got to see him struggle. And also he had unbelievable sacrifice both in and out of the ring
*  that we all got to witness. We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that. And granted,
*  obviously Floyd isn't like a civil rights figure like Muhammad Ali was, is different time, different
*  place, and he's a different man. But basically, I wonder if part of the thing that made everyone
*  think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest, in addition to of course, the unbelievable things that he did
*  out in the world and the stands that he made, we saw him struggle in the ring. It's almost
*  it's humanizing. It's weird when people respect Khabib, but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came
*  back stronger. Khabib is amazing. But I wonder how people feel about him long term, not like they
*  won't think of him as amazing and great. And he's been a respectable person and champion. But
*  the time he hasn't had to fall, if that makes sense.
*  And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic about sort of the way he was in the ring,
*  sort of being able to explain the artistry that he's, I mean, there's like joking as being playful,
*  but really he was able to describe the flow like a butterfly's thing like it be like he was able to
*  actually talk about his strategy without talking, without crossing that line into the floating
*  Mayweather when you're just talking about money and just talking shit. That's true.
*  Actually, Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit, is pretty good at like talking about the
*  art of the marshal and like the first one guy. And I wish could be did the same actually from
*  like the Satya brothers. There's a few, there's a culture of like being poetic about like being
*  scholars and also bards or whatever the poets of the game. And Khabib was more like just simple
*  and he lets his actions speak, which is great too. Yeah, it's great, but it's nice when you
*  can tell stories and you know, that's probably why Ali was the great catch me up to you went
*  to three fights, I think undefeated. Yep. BJ Penn. We talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn.
*  That's a, that's a, I mean, that's an incredible accomplishment, but you fought a lot of really
*  tough guys. When was your last fight and then catch me up with the injuries? Well,
*  a lot of people kept more and more and more or unwilling to fight you. Yeah, that's been,
*  that's, that was why I was out for two years following the Grey Maynard fight between
*  the fighting Grey and BJ. And the Grey Maynard fight was actually one I'm really proud of because
*  Grey was very tough. He's very big, very strong, very experienced. I had only five fights at the
*  time and I didn't have a lot of skills. I don't get to fight Grey with what I have today. I had
*  to fight Grey with what I had in December 2016. And that, it really took a lot of discipline,
*  a lot of focus, a lot of challenge, you know, to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in
*  that fight and to win in ultimately dominating fashion, just not in the dominating obvious sense
*  that you see when someone runs across and just does that to somebody. But that wasn't on the
*  list for me at that time, you know, so that was a, that was an interesting one, but the time away
*  again was very frustrating. That was incredibly difficult for me. Before that fight? After that
*  fight, well, because I beat Artem Lobov in the final of the Ultimate Fighter and Artem
*  is another guy that's tough, a lot of experience and gets, you know, he's a funny guy and he's said
*  some things on the internet, so he gets a lot of heat for that. But, you know, he just knocked out
*  three of my teammates. I'm like, he put a couple people in a pretty rough shape at the end of that,
*  so he was doing well and that was a tough fight. Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight
*  now, it would be not competitive at all. I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time, but it was
*  competitive. It wasn't close, but it was competitive. So you were improving and growing
*  fast. Yeah, and it was nice to have time away. I wish I'd have more time in the ring, but again,
*  I'd only been doing MMA for three years at that time. So the improvement from doing what the
*  Bitcoin mining was over, overriding the ring rust. I think so. I don't really believe in ring rust,
*  if I'm honest. You know, I can understand why, you know, people could feel a certain way, but if
*  anything, it's almost like you just kind of forget what competition's like and you realize like,
*  you feel butterflies or something like that and you go, oh my God, this is different versus
*  no, that's just your body getting ready to perform. It's okay. It's normal. How do you not have ring
*  rust? I think I try to practice performing no matter what, you know, like whether it's singing
*  karaoke and I'm very good, but like anything, you name it, talking in front of people. Like,
*  you embrace the butterflies? Yeah. It's almost like, I remember my last fight, I'm just staring at the
*  wall and I'm like, huh, I guess I'm going to fight in a couple minutes. All right. I mean, of course,
*  we all heard the phrase like, you can never walk in the same river twice because even if you're
*  this, even if the river's the same, you're a different man. That's, I think it's a really
*  important thing to understand because at various points in my martial arts career of thought,
*  oh man, how should I feel? I remember when I used to do well in competition, I would feel,
*  I would think these thoughts, listen to this song, think about this. I would feel a certain way. And
*  then if you don't feel that way, I would start to become stressed because I was self-inflicted
*  versus going, you'll feel how you feel. Your job is to show up with what you have on the day,
*  do your absolute best. It's like, I will never quit. I can be sure of that. I didn't say I can't
*  be beat. I can definitely be beat. I could have lost every single fight that I've ever had,
*  but I control my effort and I control my attitude. And that's, I will do my very best
*  ex-game plan and the event's not working. If I have to, I'll put my hands up and walk dead
*  forward. If I need to, it's somebody. We hope that that's not where it goes. But like again,
*  that humanizing moment where you're shooting for like just the inner, like the inner,
*  you sacrifice the outer and all you have left is will and you hope it doesn't happen. But if it
*  does, you'll be there. But I guess to come back, like the extra periods of time in between fights,
*  I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging. It was incredibly, it was
*  heartbreaking sometimes from honest man. It's like, I didn't want to-
*  It's just waiting. Oh my God, dude.
*  Is there politics involved? Sometimes, you know, like I,
*  you know, it's every single time you step into the ring, nothing's guaranteed.
*  It's, you could be hurt. You could hurt somebody. You could win. You could lose, you know,
*  throwing away, just like I said, throwing away your health or your life cheaply makes no sense
*  for anyone. And, you know, having demonstrating some degree of temperance is not cowardly either.
*  I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing. So I guess like, I was trying and always
*  open to fighting the absolute best people possible. I'm never turning down fights ever.
*  You know, if some random jabroni decides that he wants to fight him, go away. If I wanted to
*  just fight randoms, I would just start and stand on the table at Denny's and start yelling. And
*  I'm sure I would have, you know, some people who'd be willing to indulge me. But, you know, you want
*  to fight, you know, meaningful opponents, challenging opponents. And I know who and where they are.
*  And sometimes- You did fight in Atlantic City.
*  I did. But you put the Denny's behind you.
*  I did. And, you know, I'll be honest, if I'd have stood up after that fight, I don't know if I was
*  in great shape to expect to win in the other fights that evening, but I could have tried it.
*  I'm sure there were some takers in the crowd, particularly after they watched me fight. They're
*  like, yeah, I'll fight that guy. So- Okay. So when was the last fight?
*  That was Darren Elkins. That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight, which was great.
*  Because I love maybe five- He's a really tough opponent.
*  Very tough opponent. Very tough guy. Super tough dude. And that was in July 2019. And then
*  right when I was about to fight, you were ready to fight regularly after that.
*  Yeah. You were trying to find a fight. Yeah. And we got Ricardo Lamas. So no one else.
*  I was ranked in the top 15 at that point. And then people didn't want to fight. We were struggling
*  to find an opponent. And then Ricardo Lamas, a great former title challenger, you know,
*  MMA, really great history in MMA, recently retired. But we were supposed to fight in,
*  I think May, March, March, May of 2020. And then coronavirus happened. And so that scrapped the
*  whole show, you know, training. We were just scrambling to try to keep the gym alive and take
*  care of, you know, I have five or six full, five, six, I think five full-time employees that I,
*  you know, they're my responsibility. I have to, their livelihood is in my hands and it's,
*  they'd be irresponsible of me to not take that seriously. So anyway, we were able to navigate
*  through that time. And then we were able to reschedule the Lamas fight. And that was in
*  August of last year. And I got a medical flag, like, oh, hey, you have a medical condition that
*  we need to look into. When I got pulled from the fight and I immediately was concerned because of
*  course, any serious medical condition, you want to go, oh man, well, I guess I would like to look at
*  that. Yeah. It turns out it was a giant false positive. And, you know, we find that out,
*  you know, all of five weeks later and you go, you gotta be kidding me.
*  That's frustrating. And then we're still waiting for a fight,
*  waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight. People won't sign up,
*  asked for a number of different opponents, basically said, hey, I'm willing to fight
*  anybody that's tough and moving forward. Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Daniege
*  for, I guess it would have been this March. And then I was training in January, working on
*  some stuff. I was out training with Raymond Daniels in California. Raymond's amazing,
*  unbelievable, you know, kickboxing, karate style kickboxer, fantastic martial artist, great teacher,
*  great training partner and good friend. And, you know, just really bad luck, you know, kind of a
*  fall in the middle of, in the middle of training. And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur.
*  So that wasn't great. And you go like, man, right at the time where you're like, oh man, all right,
*  finally moving forward, you know, having the opportunity to fight, Dan's a really tough guy,
*  you have to fight well if you want to have a good chance to do well with him. If you don't fight
*  well, it's going to be a rough night. I'm like, that's exactly what I signed up for. That's what
*  we want with BJ. That's what we want with Elkins. That was gray. And then the universe goes, hey man,
*  I hear you, but there's also this. So anyway, unfortunately it's healing up and then hopefully,
*  went from May, I think. May of this year. Yeah. So it's been about five weeks since the injury.
*  You'd be able to heal up, you think? Yeah. I think it'll be okay by then. Like, I don't need
*  a big camp at this point. I've had years of camp. Not going to curtail my drinking or anything like
*  that, obviously. Come on, man. Life is meant to be lived. And so it's, I'm in good shape. I'm
*  always training. I'm trying to do my best to train around the injury to the extent that I can right
*  now without hurting myself long-term. So is there a particular opponent you're thinking about?
*  Yeah. Anybody forward. I asked the second that I got hurt, I sent a message to Dan and I said,
*  hey man, I just wanted you to be the first person to know. I just was pretty reasonably injured.
*  We just got an MRI. Doctor says, hey man, you're out and you need to take three weeks off, off.
*  Don't do anything or you're going to tear it the whole way and this is going to be surgery.
*  And then it's going to be an additional eight weeks on top of that to start to rehab it through PT.
*  And anyway, so I let him know, hey, if you can push this thing back, I would love to keep on the car.
*  I would love to keep the fight. It's like I respect you a lot as an opponent. And also it's been brutal
*  trying to get anybody to sign on. So if you're into it, I'm still there. Unfortunately, he turned
*  that down. I understand he had other things going on and he and his wife were expecting a child
*  coming up. So he needed to fight. And anyway, I guess we'll see what's coming forward.
*  Is there somebody like super tough in the featherweight division that you seem to like enjoy the
*  difficult puzzles? Is there somebody especially difficult that you would like to fight?
*  I would like to fight. I know that I'll need to win at least one fight before this. And I look
*  forward to coming back and giving my best effort to do that. I want to fight to beat
*  Magomed Sharapov. I want to fight Yagy Rodríguez. I want to fight a Korean zombie.
*  And B is complicated, man. Yeah, that would be fun. I would love to see that fight. That's a
*  fascinating fight. That would be fun. He would be very challenging. All those guys are very
*  challenging. And so I look forward to just staying healthy to the extent that we can coming
*  back. And I'm going to fight multiple times this year, hell or high water.
*  Hell yes. Hey, by the way, I completely forgot because you were talking about the systems and
*  decision trees and the illusion of choice made me think of Sam Harris. And I forgot to mention it.
*  So he talks about free will quite a bit and that there's an illusion of free will.
*  So it's like the claim cotton that maybe the universe constructed that little game where
*  it makes us feel like we have a bunch of choices, but we really don't. We really always ending up
*  with a middle finger. That would be hilarious. Yeah, that's it. That's what you see before you
*  die. It's a giant middle finger. It's like, oh, fuck, I knew it. I knew it. What do you think?
*  Do you think there's a free will? Like we feel like we're making choices. So you're thinking,
*  again, what we're talking about, OK, here's a system of martial arts that's hands are graceful.
*  There's different schools and whatever. And then you're thinking, OK, how can I think outside
*  these systems? But then there's also a system that's our human society. And we feel like there's an
*  actual choice being made by us individuals. Do you think that choice is real or is it just an illusion?
*  Well, OK, that's a really good question. I'm not necessarily equipped to answer this,
*  but I'll do my best. OK, I guess I would say to start with, sure, it would be interesting if it
*  wasn't real, if the choice wasn't real. It would be pretty interesting if it is real. First off,
*  I would start with facilitated beliefs versus not facilitated beliefs. It's almost like I think the
*  world's out to get me. True, not true. What next? Probably not a facilitated belief. Imagine you
*  believe there's no free will. OK, now what? Does that justify every single impulse that you're
*  going to give into? Or does the belief in free will, does the belief in my ability to work hard,
*  to focus, to be disciplined, to improve my position, improve my situation, whether it's true or not,
*  although I think that at least many of us would argue that at least whether there's some sort of
*  internal driver that allows for that. We live in a material world. Your actions do affect the world.
*  I can choose to pick that water up or not. Anyway, I would say I believe strongly in the idea of
*  picking facilitated beliefs and going, hey, I will adjust. Whether this belief system is right or
*  wrong on a cosmic level, I'm nowhere near smart enough to understand, but I can say me deciding
*  that, let's say, for instance, I'm going to walk over to have a conversation with someone in a
*  hotel lobby and I've never met them and I go over and I start with, huh, this is going to be
*  interesting and I just walk over there versus in my head, I'm like, what's this asshole want?
*  We're about to have two very different conversations. I could be right that this
*  person's not very polite or thinks negatively of me right from go, but I think that that's
*  probably not a facilitated belief. People talk about how is that going to help me
*  navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion? I think about that for,
*  let's say fighting, it's a good example, like confidence. Plenty of people believe plenty of
*  things that aren't real, myself included, I'm sure, all the time. Anyway, believing that you
*  can do something, I'm like, hey, I think I can win. Doesn't guarantee you a positive outcome,
*  but I would say most of us would probably, most of us would argue that it helps.
*  And you're thinking about-
*  Think about depression.
*  Believing.
*  What's depression if not a negative, unfacilitated belief that is not always,
*  that oftentimes is not reflected by reality, but you project it onto reality and it's understandable
*  if it makes you feel like, oh man, this isn't going to work out. I don't think the prospects
*  are going well. And then if you feel like you can't get out of that loop, that seems pretty rough.
*  And I see a lot of things out in society right now where you go, whether you agree or disagree
*  with various positions on things, you go, is that a facilitated belief? Even if that is true,
*  which is arguable, anything. So what next, man? So where does this end? When is the positive,
*  what's the happy ending here? And if they go, well, there is no happy ending. I'm like, okay,
*  so now what? So what do we do here? And I guess-
*  So choose the facilitated belief and in your intuition, believing that free will is real
*  is more productive for a successful life.
*  Absolutely. Because otherwise, how am I not, how am I, first of how can I,
*  how can society function if it's not real? So how can I blame you or anyone else or hold anyone
*  responsible for anything if free will isn't real? Well, no, that's exactly the point. But
*  at the surface level, what you're saying is true. But perhaps if we truly internalize that free will
*  is an illusion, we'll start to figure out something that transforms the way we see society. For example,
*  we are very individual centric. So believing that free will is real puts a lot of responsibility
*  and blame on people when they do something bad. Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is
*  an illusion, we start to think about the system of humans together as like this mechanism for
*  progress as opposed to where individual people are responsible for their actions, good or bad.
*  So we remove the value, the weight we assign to the accomplishments or the violence, the negative
*  stuff done by individuals and more look at the progress of society. I don't know what that looks
*  like, but it's almost like as opposed to focusing on the individual ants of an ant colony, looking at
*  the entirety of the ant colony. So that makes perfect sense. I would just say that that's a
*  reasonable thing to suggest. It's a seismic shift, right? And it's hard to say whether that would be
*  better or worse, but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me.
*  So I remember the last time we spoke, I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters in
*  certainly recent history, probably human history period, Adolf Hitler. Well, I'm a big fan of making
*  people live in the world that they want to believe in. Well, if free will doesn't exist and it's just
*  about how things move forward, when are we going to be high-fiving this guy or what? Because I
*  remember what I said and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.
*  For people who don't know, Ryan brought up, or I brought up, there's literally a giant book about
*  Hitler. So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II and Stalin recently. Oh man, this has become
*  like a meme. Joe Rogan with DMT and me with Hitler. Can I pick something more positive?
*  A cat in the hat or something, I don't know. But you brought up Hitler as an example of
*  something particular, some philosophical discussions we're having and the excellent,
*  eloquent and the full of integrity MMA journalist clipped out something you've said about
*  Hitler and said that, I forget what the headlines are, but they were the most ridiculous possible
*  implementation. Basically, NWITS intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying. I get that
*  they're stupid, but I'm stupid too. So I know what that's like. So I don't have a lot of sympathy.
*  Yeah, exactly. I can't keep you passing that. But basically, intentionally misunderstanding
*  what's going on. But what I find funny is that, hey, we got to be careful what we believe. And
*  again, back to the cancel culture thing that we discussed last time as well, where would I like
*  to apologize? No, actually something about cancel culture that we've been seeing things culturally.
*  I will be damned if I apologize for anything that I don't need to apologize for because I was
*  intentionally misunderstood in that instance. Now you could say that I'm not a historical scholar,
*  which I would agree immediately. And also that I oftentimes in eloquently or inarticulately phrase
*  things, which I'll agree as again. But ultimately going, hey, I want to make you believe, live in
*  the world that you're suggesting ought to exist. Okay, so if there's no free will,
*  is everything, how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically before we start going,
*  hey, this is good because we're experiencing a social reckoning in our country at the moment
*  for good and for other probably, I guess. And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?
*  So that's probably not something that would fly. And I think that's a fair thing.
*  That's interesting. It might not fly from the individual perspective, but if you zoom out
*  and think, you know, appreciate society as, you know, just like an ant colony as a beautifully
*  complex system, like we kind of from the individual perspective, we value progress,
*  especially progress of the individual, but in whole progress of societies.
*  But if you accept that this is just a complex system, that's not necessarily headed anywhere,
*  that this is almost like that river is just flowing. I think that removes the burden of
*  always striving of always trying of always like the struggle and so on. So it's possible that
*  if we have no control, you can like arrive at some kind of other Zen state.
*  Does that sound very human though?
*  That's that's that goes against, I think. Our current human condition as we experience it,
*  but we've communicated that to each other. Like we've taught like through these social forces,
*  taught each other that our lives matter and so on. Maybe if we convince ourselves that
*  we're just sort of like little things in a stream and ultimately none of it matters,
*  there might be some kind of enjoyment to be discovered through that process. I don't listen,
*  I'm a capitalist, rah rah like.
*  But I guess I think you're bringing up a really important point. I guess almost anything like
*  capitalism, I only get to experience it as I sit here now and I get to live, I was raised in the
*  United States, have traveled around the world a little bit, have had the, you know, good fortune
*  of meeting many people from many different places. And I'm an end user of capitalism. I don't really
*  know how it got here, whether it was, I wasn't there at the start of this idea. I wasn't there
*  for, hey, how do we come up with this idea? How do we arrive? And I'm nowhere near well read enough
*  to understand any of that really even secondhand. And I guess recognizing that communism, Marxism,
*  socialism, anarchism, anything is, these are all perspectives that all have, I guess, various
*  strengths and weaknesses. But I guess one thing I'm always, I guess I would say the burden, it seems
*  to me that if you want to make a change, the burden of proof is on the person implying that
*  there needs to be a change. And it doesn't mean that there's nothing there, but it's like, if you
*  want to create a small shift, a ripple, that's fine, but a seismic ripping shift in how we exist
*  or how we experience the world as human beings. And you mentioned fighting, why watching someone
*  undergo, take abuse on a level in the ring that's just shocking and then triumph in spite of it is
*  this is unbelievable. This is part of the magic of combat sports. Now, it's part of the magic,
*  the other side of the magic that doesn't get talked about sometimes is that the trajectory
*  of that individual's life later on is not always great or there's a limit, there's a cost for that.
*  But if we remember, you mentioned removing the struggle. I don't personally, the struggle is
*  what makes life life. And also, I guess something Firas has brought up to me on a number of occasions
*  as it makes sense to me, it's basically humans only understand things through relative comparison.
*  I only understand heat because I've known cold. I guess it's like talking to someone that's never
*  experienced any sort of hardship and then their latte isn't right and then they pitch a fit
*  versus someone that's gone through a great deal of challenge struggle in their life.
*  They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective. And anyway, and of course,
*  even is a relative thing and what I perceive to be even may not be even maybe I'm particularly
*  soft or something in the other direction without realizing because I can only understand what I
*  can understand. But the idea that we want to fundamentally alter ourselves as a species and
*  as people seems like an incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove and also like an incredibly
*  dangerous idea because it always comes back to who's going to be responsible for this, who gets
*  to do the choosing, what's a good idea, what's not a good idea. And I guess that actually brings
*  kind of to something I've been encountering recently in discussions with friends.
*  I feel like there's only two types of people that I encounter at this point.
*  People with a more or less libertarian tilt to their thinking and people without it.
*  And when I say libertarian, I don't mean that in the political party sense or even the belief
*  system. Basically, I'm like, hey, you do you buddy. What you're up to is not my concern versus what
*  you're up to is my concern. And I guess I've always watched various points in history,
*  people on this side or people on that side are more or less, I guess, problematic, I guess you
*  could say. I don't mean that in the internet sense. I mean, more of an issue. But the world
*  is always full of people that want to tell you what you need to be doing as opposed to more or
*  less do no harm. And I guess that's one of the ones, anytime I'm trying to tell other people what
*  to do, I better hope I'm right. And it's bizarre to me how many people are so confident that their
*  side or their position is the one that's not only right for them, but right enough that they
*  can enforce it on others. And that just seems incredibly dangerous to me. And I guess that
*  comes back to even Sam's point about, oh, we want to, if under trying to spread the idea that free
*  will doesn't exist, I'm not saying it's damaging, but if very well, maybe, and plenty of other
*  things could be as well. I'm not, you know, it goes way over my head as to, you know, the implications
*  of all of these. And I guess all of us are in evangelist for something. But I guess it's weird
*  that we've gotten this far as a species and now we want to take like sharp, sharp turns.
*  Well, we've been taking a bunch of sharp turns for our history. Yeah, that's what, you know,
*  that's, that's the way, you know, okay, humans love power. And one way to attain power is to say
*  everything that you guys are doing is wrong. And I have the right thing. And I'm going to build up a
*  giant cult of people. And I'm going to overthrow and indirectly what that results in me is me gaining
*  power. And that's how you get all the big revolutions in human history saying I'm done
*  with the thing that the powerful are currently doing. So I'm going to overthrow that's, that's
*  where probably all the identity politics that's happening now is people that didn't have power
*  before are looking to gain power. And they're also, you know, that's where Jordan Peterson
*  criticized identity politics is people with the right, with a good intentions, I should say,
*  are in seeking power, allow power to corrupt them as power always does. And so they lose track of
*  like the, the, the devils that they're fighting by becoming the same kind of devils, the same
*  kind of evil that they're fighting. And so that that's just the progress of human history. But
*  hopefully as these power greedy people keep attaining power with a, with a progressive
*  mindset over time, things get better and better as they can, as they have generation,
*  each iteration, a lot of, a lot of unfairness happens. A lot of hypocrisy happens. A lot of
*  people are trampled along the way by those who mean well, but over time, like lessons are learned
*  or like human, like civilization accumulates lessons and in part learns lessons of history
*  and it gets better and better over time, even though in the short term,
*  there's people acting, not their best selves. And, you know,
*  that seems to be the progress of human history. The idea of internalizing with free will,
*  not being real. You're actually making me realize that that ultimately leads to a kind of,
*  doesn't it go in a nihilistic direction? Yeah, it's, it's, it's both nihilistic or if you want to
*  make it a political system, then it's more like communist type of a system where like the,
*  the value of the individual is completely reduced, removed, or another perspective is like the
*  freedom of an individual is not to be valued or protected. And so from our current perspective,
*  the systems that seem to have worked, the United States works pretty damn well despite all the
*  different criticisms. It seems like freedom of the individual in all its forms seems to be
*  fundamental to the success of the United States. And so we should, it's, however the hell you put
*  it is like, it doesn't matter whether free will is or isn't an illusion. The belief that it's real
*  protects the individual from the group, which is fundamentally crit me if I'm wrong. That always
*  seems like the big issue of history. Hey, there's more of me than there is of you.
*  Deal with it. Yikes. Yeah. And you want to be yourself. You want to be different. You want to
*  have a different religion. You want to be a different skin color. You want to do this. All
*  the bad tribal things happen when there's more of me than you, cram me if I'm wrong. Yeah, yeah,
*  absolutely. But that's always the fundamental power imbalance though, right? Well, the interesting
*  thing about libertarian thinking, I guess I, I don't know, those words are really- Maybe they're
*  all charged. I know it's- Yeah, they're all charged. I may not scale up, but I mean, more
*  like on a philosophical underpinning where you're like, yeah, basically, hey, you know,
*  feel free to believe I'm a fool. And I mean, plenty of people do, I'm sure. But as long as you don't
*  chase me down the hall and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook, what's the big deal?
*  Yeah. So the libertarian viewpoint, which I probably espouse, like that's, I'm very much like,
*  freedom of the individual is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone unless they're
*  trying to hurt you. The thing is you also have to, I believe, put in the work of empathy of
*  understanding what others, how, what leaving people the fuck alone means to others. But isn't that
*  an interesting thing? If I believe in freedom of the individual and I take that, like all of these,
*  like you said, you take them past just their first why question, you ask why, why, why, why, or how,
*  how, how, how many times, should that not extend to respect for you, respect for your position,
*  respect for your individual lived experience, which could be grossly different than mine.
*  Yeah. This is the problem with saying I'm an individual, I'm not going to bother you,
*  you don't bother me. That's just like, that's not actionable because to be, to make it actionable,
*  you have to think the why, why, why, why, why you have to do the steps beyond. You think,
*  what does that actually mean? That means understanding how even my very existence,
*  uh, like hurts others because you have to understand that, like, I'm not, you're not
*  just sitting alone in a room. You're, uh, you're using like public transit, using the police force,
*  you're using firefighters, you're using the, like, you're using a lot of resources that are publicly
*  shared and some of those resources are, are unfairly distributed. Like we've agreed that
*  we're going to pay taxes and those taxes are going to go towards building some kind of
*  infrastructure. So that's already towards social. That's, so you're not a real, you're,
*  you're not a real sort of, I talked to Michael Ballas, like anarchists, right? Saying like basically
*  full, just leave me the fuck alone and I'm going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want.
*  We're not, that's not the American society as it stands currently. We've agreed that there's going
*  to be certain social institutions that we pay into. And, uh, some of the sort of discussions
*  about race and all those kinds of things, uh, is about those institutions being, uh, institutionally
*  unfair, whether it's race or gender, all those kinds of things. Listen, I, you know, I have a
*  bunch of criticisms of the way that conversation carries itself out, but the thing is, what's
*  valuable is to actually listen and empathize. And that's not often talked about with, uh,
*  leave me the fuck alone mindset because you're, um, it doesn't have, it doesn't have that little
*  component, which I think could be fundamental to the function of a society, which is like social,
*  like this, the, what is it though? Obama, you didn't build it or you didn't build it alone
*  or whatever, whatever, however that goes. But basically we wouldn't be, we wouldn't be able
*  to accomplish anything as individuals without the help of others and to be able to then start to
*  think, okay, so what is, what, uh, what is my duty? What is my responsibility to other human beings
*  to be respectful, to be loving, to, to help them as part of this functioning society that starts,
*  that's actually a lot of work to start to think about that. Cause then I have to like think, okay,
*  Ryan, what's his life like? Like as a business owner during COVID, what's that like? And then
*  he has, uh, there's employees that run the gym. What's that like? What's that stress like, right?
*  Or about the fighting and the injury and so on. What's that like? That empathy takes a lot of like
*  compute cycles and also a lot of energy, right? But I have to go through that computation if I
*  want to be an individual that's like, doesn't hurt you. If, if I may, I guess like to come back to
*  Muhammad Ali, one of the things he said is service others is the rent is the rent that you pay for
*  your, you know, there's these, is the price you pay for your rent here on earth. Yeah. And now I,
*  one of the things that I think that I see as a result of the internet all the time is people
*  talking about global giant problems, social problems that are society wide that are massive,
*  truly massive and frankly, beyond the, beyond the power of any of us to solve. Yeah. That's
*  certainly on an individual level. So I have, you know, I've discussed things with friends. I have
*  my father's an environmental attorney, like, uh, you know, has been for a long time and has been
*  an engineer for a long time. And, uh, you know, so I'm not, I barely know anything, but I'm read in
*  a little bit of various things, but, uh, climate change. Oh my God, I'm so concerned about climate
*  change. What am I supposed to do about climate change? I'll tell you what I can do is I can not
*  litter. I can try to conserve energy where I can. I can do whatever I want. What can I personally do
*  about some giant social problem that is, that I didn't start and I, is out of my control. I'm like,
*  well, I can be decent to the people around me. I can mention, I can demonstrate empathy and I can
*  demonstrate consideration for the people in my circle. And to the extent that I can, the people
*  outside of my circle, but yelling at the trees over things that, over problems that are borderline
*  cosmic, um, doesn't seem very productive. It just makes me feel like I'm cool and important
*  because I'm talking about something. Well, hundreds of years from now, the water will rise. Maybe it
*  will, maybe it won't. I can't, it's completely over my head. I'm, I know nothing, but focusing
*  on the problems that we can actually solve. It comes back to the same thing. I want to win a
*  fight. I would love to win a fight. Uh, I can't control that. What I can do is I can control each
*  individual step that I take around the ring and try to make the next correct move. I can't look,
*  no, it gets people's, uh, you know, they get all excited. You know, I'm trying to keep my language
*  in check, but they get all excited thinking about, uh, you know, problems that are like Superman
*  couldn't solve these problems. Like you could be that powerful and you can't make all of the bad
*  things go away, but you can absolutely change yourself. And I think a lot of the lessons that,
*  you know, like the good lessons from religion that happened, the good lessons from the great
*  men and women throughout history that we, that we were inspired by that talk about change starting
*  within. And, you know, again, treating the people around you decently and treating the people around
*  you decently doesn't even necessarily mean the golden rule doing to others as you would like
*  them to do to you. I go, well, maybe what I would like and what this person would like, aren't the
*  same thing. Well, how am I going to get to the bottom of that? Cause I could be attempting to
*  be decent to this person. And by my standard, I am being decent, but maybe I'm, uh, maybe I'm missing
*  the mark by theirs. Well, I can't possibly, if I just interacted with you, like it's like someone
*  talking about some nonsense microaggression, like, so let me get this straight. I've never met you
*  before. You never met me before. And you're interpreting some minor comment that, that I've
*  made in the least charitable way possible. I'm not saying that, that you couldn't be annoyed,
*  but your expectation for that level of consideration is you're going to be, you're going to be
*  disappointed a lot. Now, if you, if we're someone that's in your life on a consistent basis and
*  they're like, Hey, I really don't appreciate what you're saying or what you're doing here.
*  Do you realize that this is how I'm, this is how I'm perceiving you go, Oh man, I'm so sorry.
*  Of course I would hear what you have to say, but I guess trying to recognize that, you know,
*  I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general, but that level of the level of
*  specificity that, that, that, that requires increases as it gets closer to you. And I have,
*  as a person, I have a very finite amount of resources, financially, intellectually,
*  emotionally, physically, if I Chuck, you know, 0.001% of it in every single different direction,
*  what am I doing? It's like when people are like, Oh, I care deeply about Tibet. Like,
*  why aren't you over there? Go build a house, man. Get on a plane, go build a house. Oh,
*  you don't want to do that. So really what you want to do is post on Facebook and, and, and accept
*  high fives for how much of a good guy you are. I got an idea. Go help somebody in your neighborhood.
*  Go be, go play with, go play with some kids, go be a friend to someone that doesn't have a friend,
*  read a book, try to educate yourself. And so I guess to come back, it's all of these problems
*  aren't solved on a grand scale, but it's almost like by attempting to address them in our personal
*  lives, we do better, but rather than a giant airing of the grievances on a, on a consistent
*  basis, not that that isn't, you know, sometimes necessary and valuable, but after you air your
*  grievances, you go, Hey, how about we, we sort this out? What's the next step? And, and I guess,
*  again, when we're trying to address it on a giant social level, it just seems unmanageable to me,
*  even if you have the best of intentions. Yeah. I mean, but nevertheless, there's, there's a lot
*  you can do on social networks. I mean, I enjoy tweeting and consuming Twitter. It's just, I apply
*  the exact same principle that you just said, which is free will and discussion, which is like,
*  I approach it in a way that I don't get stuck in this loop. That's counterproductive. I try to do
*  things that are productive. And like, it's just like you said, that's like, like, what kind of
*  things can I do in this world? Whether that's tweeting or building things, those are low effort
*  tweeting or actually building businesses or building ideas out as high effort. What can I do that will
*  actually solve problems? And that's, that's the way I approach it. And I do wonder if it's possible
*  to at scale, encourage each other to approach like social media and communication with fellow
*  humans in that way. I don't know. How do you think that would be done? I guess like to improve the,
*  improve the quality of discourse maybe like, or even like you said, the empathy or the decency
*  of discourse. I think people should be, you know, incentivized, encouraged to do that. I think
*  most of what's we see happening on Twitter and Facebook and so on has to do with very small,
*  very powerful implementation details. It goes down to like, what is the source of the dopamine rush,
*  the like button, the sharing mechanisms, just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot. Really?
*  I believe so. So like a lot, a lot of the stuff we see now is the result of just initial
*  implementations of these systems that we didn't anticipate. So the modernization comes from
*  engagement and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing. It was not always obvious. It was not
*  obvious from the beginning. It was an obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew that there's a
*  big dopamine rush from getting more followers and likes and shares. So we've gotten addicted to this
*  feeling like how many people are commenting, how many people are saying like a clicking like and
*  so on. So that's that dopamine rush. So we want to say the thing that'll get the most likes on,
*  and like on mass and society. And then the other thing that was expected is the controversial,
*  the divisive will get the most likes. So we, it had to do with the initial mechanisms of likes and
*  shares resulting in an outcome that was unpredicted, which is huge amounts of division, irrespective of
*  like any of the basics of human connection that we've actually all come in to understand
*  that society is valuable at the individual level, like we're saying, but on mass, what results is
*  you throw all that out and it's all just divisive at scale discourse. I think it could be fixed by
*  incentivizing personal growth, like incentivizing you to challenge yourself to
*  grow as an individual and most importantly to be happy at the end of the day. So feed, like
*  incentivize you feeling good as in a way that's long lasting, long-term. I think what makes people
*  actually feel good is being kind to others long-term in the short term. What feels good is
*  getting a lot of likes. And I think those are just different incentives that if implemented
*  correctly, you could just build social networks that would do much better. So do you think it
*  comes from a structural perspective? I guess at what point does he mentioned like you mentioned
*  free will and also you mentioned feeling good and again working hard. I know that you have the,
*  I guess the, was it a race or? No, it's the Goggins thing. It's four by 40,
*  four by four by 48 challenge where you run four miles every four hours for two days.
*  That's awesome. Yeah, it's a bunch of, the challenge of it isn't just the running.
*  The running is very tough, but it's mostly the sleep deprivation because you're just
*  training every four hours. But it's a struggle, right? And that struggle gives meaning.
*  And ultimately, I guess, so how can we, because you mentioned, like you said, adjusting things on like
*  a, I guess like a programming level almost based programming level so that the interface is
*  different for the user. But at what point does the user have a responsibility to, you know,
*  as a man or a woman or a person to just behave more decently? How can we, I guess, utilize,
*  what can we do? It seems like, you know, we're like our society is so grossly missing,
*  like a Martin Luther King right now, like the great inspiring characters throughout American
*  history, throughout world history. Where are the great leaders? So leadership is part of it,
*  but I, you know, that's definitely where the great leaders is a very good question. That's,
*  that's more of a question of our political systems, why they're not pushing forward the
*  great leaders. But there's also just, okay, there's some just basic engineering shit, which is
*  when you and I, when you, Ryan and I are in a room alone and we're talking, even if we're strangers,
*  the incentives are for us to get along. Like just when we're together in person, that's what I'm
*  saying. I'm not even saying some kind of, but when you, but when you remove that, when we remove that,
*  the, the, the implementation of, of the, of social networks as they stand right now in the digital
*  space, a very different set of incentives. It's more fun to destroy others, to be shitty to others.
*  And that, and it becomes this loop, endless loop. Like you were saying, that's ultimately destructive
*  and not productive. And I think it has to do with just the interfaces of making it feel good to be
*  nice to others. Cause currently it doesn't feel nearly as good to be nice to others on the internet
*  and it's, it doesn't feel nearly as bad as it does in real life to be shitty to others on the
*  internet. So the incentives are just wrong. I think there is a technology solution to this,
*  or at least the solution to improve this, this communication mechanism. It's not obvious how,
*  I have a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas, but this is fascinating because I've gotten the
*  chance to talk to Jack Dorsey quite a bit. This is the CEO of Twitter and he is legitimately has,
*  you know, in this conversation, he would agree with everything and he's a good human being and
*  he has a lot of really good ideas how to improve things. The question when you're a captain of a
*  ship, whether even it's a question, whether a CEO is even a captain, how much can you actually
*  steer that ship once it's gotten large enough? There's so much momentum, there's so many users,
*  there's so many people who are marketing and PR and lawyers. It's very difficult to change things.
*  Is it difficult because of the fallout or is it difficult because it's actually like literally
*  out of his power? So power is weird when you have a large organization. This is why the great leaders,
*  this is what great leaders do, whether it's presidents or leaders of companies, Steve Jobs,
*  I would argue Musk is that way, is to walk into a room full of people who don't want you to create
*  drama. It's weird, man, when people just kind of want to be nice, the niceness creates momentum
*  and nobody wants to, it's the systems thing. Everybody just behaves in the way they were
*  previously behaving in the way they're supposed to behave and nobody wants to raise a fuss.
*  It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say, what we've been doing is bullshit.
*  Okay, you're fired, you're cool, what is it that? I'm out.
*  I think you have to create constant revolutions within a company. It's very difficult to do
*  structurally and psychologically. It's very difficult to do to be able to constantly
*  challenge the way things have been done in the past. Another way it's often done is a startup,
*  like a small company, basically a small company becomes really successful and then no longer can
*  turn the ship. So a new startup comes along, a new competitor that then challenges the big ship and
*  then that starts out the winner. That's like Google came to be, that's how Twitter came to be and
*  Facebook and so on. That was the dream of Steve Jobs is it would succeed for many decades,
*  for like centuries. That was the idea that you would keep creating revolutions. Under Steve Jobs,
*  Apple successfully pivoted a bunch of times, just like reinvented themselves, which is very
*  difficult to do. At least I don't know if this is accurate because I wouldn't know anything,
*  but I've heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs. But in reality, the reason that all
*  of these amazing things were done was because this person was willing to, obviously brilliant,
*  and then also willing to rattle everyone's cage periodically and say, hey, what's going on is
*  not what we need to be doing. That's a really interesting thing. So he would rattle the cage,
*  but he was also, I don't know if those are intricately connected or always have to be
*  connected, but he would just be a dick. So maybe by his standard, I am lazy and worthless.
*  Well, does he say that to you? Is he being a dick though? If by his standard, I mean,
*  like again, it's like everyone's stupid compared to somebody. You know, I guess.
*  So you apparently are able to take that kind of thing. Sometimes you just,
*  there's ways to cross the line. And I mean, this is okay. The fascinating thing about being a leader,
*  especially leader of companies is it's a people problem. So each individual in a room,
*  so as a leader, you're only really interactive with a small number of people because there are
*  leaders of other smaller groups and so on. But each of those individuals in the room have their
*  own different psychology. Some like to be pushed to the limits. Some, some like, like to be screamed
*  at. Some have a heart, are very soft spoken and almost afraid to speak. And they have to be
*  you have to, you have to hear them out. Like there's a, and those, those could be all superstars.
*  We're not, we're not talking about like the C students, not about the A plus students.
*  Well, it's funny that, yeah, but the thing to man, the skill to manage all of those people
*  is completely separate from the skill to innovate something. I mean, not that they're not connected,
*  but it's funny how it's, it's almost like, you know, why do we have shitty, why do we have shitty
*  representatives? Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing that you do to get elected has nothing to do with
*  governance. Yeah. So well, that's exactly it. But the great leaders have to have both skills.
*  So like you have to have the boldness of if you look at the great presidents through history,
*  you know, usually it's in a time of crisis is when they step up, but they basically say, okay, stop
*  this old way that Congress works of this bickering of this like compromised bullshit. Here's a huge
*  plan that costs billions of dollars in today's age, trillions of dollars, no extra pork, no extra
*  additions, just like here's a clear plan. We're going to build the best road network the world
*  has ever seen. We're going to build some huge infrastructure project. We're going to revolutionize
*  internet. Oh, we're going to for coronavirus. We're going to build the largest like testing
*  facility the world has ever seen in terms of the, we're going to get everybody tested several times
*  a day, all those kinds of things, huge projects and say, fuck all this. The details that everybody's
*  bickering about, we're going to give everybody $2,000. We can give everybody $3,000, like huge
*  projects. And at the same time, so that's the boldness and the leadership and saying throw out
*  all the bullshit of the past. And at the same time, be able to get in the room with the leaders of
*  both parties or for the powerful individuals and smooth talk the shit out of them in the way they
*  need to be smooth talk to. So like both of those skills, it seems to be when they're combined in
*  one person, that's that creates great leaders. Musk appears to have that Elon. I don't know if Steve
*  Jobs, it's interesting. So the criticism of Steve and a little bit on Elon is he misses some of the
*  human part. But maybe it's impossible to have a really, you have like Salyan Nadal, who's the CEO
*  of Microsoft, you have who's really good on the human side, really, really good on the human side,
*  like everybody loves them. The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way. So like,
*  I don't know if it's possible to have both. You only get so many stat points. Yeah, you only get
*  in this in this RPG of life. Yeah. You got very good at jujitsu very fast. So you went, I mean,
*  you told the story of blue belt and so on. But you went to black belt really quickly.
*  And not just in terms of ranks, but in terms of just skill level. I mean, you didn't go to black
*  belt nearly as fast as your skill set developed. You were like doing extremely well at a high level
*  of competition. So you're a good person to ask, how does one get good at jujitsu? We talked about
*  solving problems at the elite level. But when you're a beginner at the at the martial arts,
*  how do you get good? How much training should you do at the very basic stuff? Like how much
*  training, how much drilling and then the mental stuff like where should your mind be? How should
*  you approach it from a mental perspective to that's just telling my perspective on this one. I guess
*  I would say I feel step one, I feel lucky to have found a, you know, a good training situation,
*  particularly for the time, you know, in where I was at and I drilled a ton. I drilled and drilled
*  and drilled and drilled and drilled. And one thing that's really important to understand though,
*  is that I was able to, in a relatively brief period of years, go from zero to reasonably good.
*  But I think I probably crammed more hours in those small years than most people did
*  training, let's say in two or three times the length. So it may not, it may masquerade as
*  something else other than it is, I could say. You have to put in the hours. Yeah. There's no way
*  around that. I think so. What did you put in those hours? So when you say drilling, can you break that
*  apart a little bit? Like what does drilling look like? Is there any recommendations? Absolutely.
*  Step one, I would say your choices matter. Like there's a, I think one of the really important
*  things that I think we should consider about jujitsu is that there's a lot of junk in the system right
*  now. It's like jujitsu has exploded in terms of the number of positions, techniques, strategies,
*  this, that, rule sets. That's really cool on the one hand. On the other hand, there's probably a
*  just metric shit ton of suboptimal things that are out there that are being taught.
*  Myself included, I've taught things that are looking back five years, three years, two years,
*  one year, I'm like, oh, I would not do it like that anymore. Straight up. Sometimes I wouldn't
*  do it like that. Other times I would literally never do even that particular movement.
*  I don't think the shrimp is a real move. It's, I mean, it's a giant spiel and Caesar to show in
*  person, but long sort of is there's a lot of things that are, we think of as fundamental
*  that I think that are really pretty negative. And also, you know, that's heresy and jujitsu,
*  isn't it? The shrimp is like the holy, we all worship the shrimp. We love the shrimp. We love
*  the shrimp. Now for people who don't do jujitsu and you should, the shrimp is, you scoot your butt
*  away from your opponent. Yeah. And it really, it's like a really athletic looking position
*  where you look like, like someone that's trying to stick their butt out on Instagram. And then
*  you push your hands away and you expose your face and then you lay on your side because someone told
*  you to do that. And you look like a, I guess you look like a shrimp. Yeah. It's like that time that
*  someone really credible told me to drink unleaded gasoline. I did it for a while. And then it got
*  to the point in my life where the next best, the thing that I needed to do to really improve my life
*  was stop drinking unleaded gasoline. And I would say that there's like a lot of stuff that's in
*  there that step one is like, it's junk. It's actual junk. And it's not only will it waste your time,
*  it will be like an albatross hanging on you because it affects how you think about things
*  going forward. So although it was, it's funny, like the operating assumptions that we work under
*  have a huge, huge, huge influence. You mentioned like growing up in the United States or this being
*  a capitalist society, like woohoo. All right. Now, of course I think that I don't really know
*  any different otherwise. And I think that a lot of times people go, oh, communism is better. I'm like,
*  haven't seen it. I haven't read any books about it would be better, but it's possible. I mean,
*  I haven't experienced it much myself either. So I can't dismiss it outright, but I guess I would
*  say it's a fundamentally different operating system underpinning and all of my choices, all of,
*  if I honestly believed in that thing, many of my choices on a moment by moment, on a day by day,
*  and certainly on a lifetime basis would be very different. So I would say that it's tough when
*  you're young in the martial arts. And I mean, all of us are always trying to do our best to learn,
*  but when you're young in the martial arts, you always go, if you're a reasonable guy,
*  what are they? What do they call it? Like Dunning-Crew, Rame-Nija, I can't remember if
*  this is the right one, but basically you go like, oh, I know what I'm doing here. So I can say,
*  that's not right. But then I read a new story about baseball and I'm only going to think about
*  baseball sounds credible. And it's, it's bullshit, but I can't call bullshit. If you're a reasonable
*  person, you can't call bullshit on things that you don't understand. Even if you suspect it's
*  not right, you're like, well, I've got a reserve judgment. You never ever, ever set aside your,
*  your need and also obligation to understand why you were doing what you're doing. And don't ask
*  why once, ask why over and over and over and over about the same thing. Oh, well, I want a shrimp.
*  Why to make space? Why do I want to make space to get away from the guy? Well, why do I want to
*  get away from him? Well, because he's dangerous. Well, why is he dangerous? And you can oftentimes
*  get down to, wait a minute, I didn't even need to move. Three quarters of the time, you're actually
*  acting in the other person's self-interest. And I guess a lot of times I can't, this kind of goes
*  beyond what we can demonstrate here, but I would just say, trying to understand what my base
*  operating assumptions are and consistently reevaluate them, which can be fricking exhausting,
*  frankly, and also constant as confidence destroying. But you mentioned that I, that I did
*  pretty well relatively quickly. I was at, I started in 2004 and I was at Abu Dhabi,
*  ADCC for the first time as an alternate in 2007. I won a match there against the Black belt world
*  champion. And the fact, frankly, the fact that I was able to beat someone like that was neat,
*  but at the same time says a little bit more about what Jiu-Jitsu is and some of the issues with it
*  than it does about how cool I am or was because that shouldn't really happen when you think about
*  it. You're like, okay, you're a champion at ostensibly a very high level of the sport.
*  You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage and a 35 pound weight advantage,
*  and you just got beat. Like that should not exist. I'm dead serious that should not exist.
*  If that happens, you're doing it wrong. Is it that I'm doing it right or is it that you're doing it
*  wrong and there's enough variance in the way that you're doing it that you're allowing me to win.
*  Now I did happen to win that with the 50-50 heel hook, which was one of the early examples of like,
*  hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs. And that was something like we mentioned
*  John Danaher, mentioned myself, Dean Lister, a lot of the guys from the Hensel Gracie team that have
*  had amazing success. They've gone and done great things. Craig Jones in the competitive grappling
*  world, basically taking advantage of being very, very good in what they're doing, but also a
*  glaring, glaring, glaring issue with the operating system of Jiu-Jitsu, which was a huge
*  vulnerability in the lower body and not only not attacking it, but having no idea how one does
*  attack it, which means you can't understand how someone will assail you. So anyway,
*  I guess to come back is if in the absence of knowing what to do, I try to polish what I've
*  got. So if I've got a knife and I'm like, I don't know how to use them, I'm like, okay, I'm just
*  going to sharpen the edge and polish it and make sure that when I need to use this dang thing,
*  I'll be able to do it. Because trying to put together a system when you don't have an idea
*  of what's going on, a lot of times you end up making sub-optimal choices, but as long as you're
*  consistently reevaluating what you're doing, and that's something I've tried to do over time,
*  over and over and over again, and try to seek out the best and also most articulate or insightful
*  instructors or people of various levels, doesn't matter if they're well known or not, that could
*  say, hey, Ryan, I think you should do this, I think you should do that. And I think all I've
*  ever done in martial arts is try to treat people with respect, honestly, try to demonstrate
*  appreciation for the many, many people who have helped me over time and be the type of person that
*  they want to train with. Because we've all trained with people that make us think about beating the
*  ever loving crap out of them. I never wanted to be that guy. And I was basically saying,
*  like, if I train with a black belt when I'm a blue belt and this person enjoys training with me,
*  that's in my interest. Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up, but selfishly,
*  I should, you mentioned being decent to other people, you want to incentivize being decent
*  to other people, right, with the structure of what you're doing. Selfishly, I'm incentivized
*  to be a nice guy, even if I'm internally a scumbag, which I like to think that I'm not,
*  but basically going like, hey, this guy's way more likely to help me or this person's way more
*  likely to help me if I shake their hand, say thank you, I really appreciate you helping me out. And
*  that thing that they tap me with four or five times, I'm going to ask them about it. And then
*  they don't have to tell me they're under no obligation. But I'll say, and whether they tell
*  me or not, thank you so much for your time, really appreciate it. And that's it, you know.
*  Okay, so to summarize, so the way you brilliantly described, I just want to make sure we're keeping
*  track of- I went all over the place. No, you didn't. You're pretty on point. But so the first
*  thing is basically, which is difficult, I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit, is don't
*  trust authority, essentially, keep asking why. Be respectful without trusting authority, right?
*  Which is- and then the second thing is be the kind of person that others like training with
*  or like being around sort of being a good friend. So many people just enjoy being around. So one is
*  completely- which is, yeah, you're right, it's attention, which is like completely disrespect
*  the way that things are done. So asking why constantly. One of it is your own flaws and
*  not understanding the fundamentals of what's being described. And then once you get good enough,
*  not understanding, like going against the fact that the instructor doesn't understand.
*  And my inability to understand what you're saying, though, doesn't invalidate it. And that's
*  something like you mentioned, like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws. And then also,
*  again, the flaws that any of us have as the instructor, to your point. And I guess
*  I can speak to being kind of weird. I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner. But so everyone's
*  a little bit different. Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular in high school. I, you know,
*  like I didn't like high school very much. But anyway, yeah, I would not going to be rude to
*  people though. I was never going to bully anybody. If you said hello to me, I'd say hello back.
*  I would hold the door for you if you walked by, you know, and I would just say like simple things
*  like that go a long, long, long way. And that actually takes us back to our, to our social
*  discussion where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at Jiu Jitsu? It's like, well, I'll start by
*  not pissing off this person who can beat the crap out of me and not disrespecting the person who
*  is probably the clearest, the closest thing to a font of knowledge at that time for me. So, and then
*  recognizing that I should do that for its own virtue because it's the right thing to do and
*  I should try to treat people decently. But beyond that, even selfishly, it's in my interest to do
*  that. But see, the thing is, this is interesting is there's a culture in martial arts, a culture
*  that I like where the instructor legitimately so carries an aura of authority and it's not
*  comfortable to really ask why I'm not, it's, it's a skill to be able to have a discussion as a white
*  belt, the black belt instructor of like, why is it done this way? Like, and saying why again,
*  uh, like with, I mean, it's a skill to show that you're actually a legitimately a curious and
*  passionate and compassionate student versus like somebody who's just being an annoying dick,
*  who saw some stuff on YouTube. There's a line between to walk there. I, I just wonder, because
*  like, it's the drilling thing. And, you know, I, um, for example, like in my, when, when I was
*  coming up, there was so much emphasis placed on like clothes guards, for example,
*  and you might, you might actually teach me now. I don't know, but to me it was like, why do I need
*  to master the close, like why is the closed guard on top or the bottom, but the bottom really,
*  this is the fundamental basics of jujitsu. Who decided that my body is not, my body says this
*  is wrong. I'm like this, like I have short legs, but it doesn't even matter the length of the legs.
*  There's something about me that just, I don't understand how leverage here works for my
*  particular body. Like, so it's just, it's a feel thing too. Like it feels like in my basic
*  understanding of leverage and movement and timing and so on, it feels like these certain like
*  butterfly guard or even like half, basically every guard except close guard. I can play,
*  I can dance. Closed guard feels like you're shutting down, uh, like the play that I-
*  Is that wrong? Or is that make sure that's what you want because that's almost like an innate
*  characteristic of this guard position, but it's not sold that way, right? It's like, hey, this is a
*  good guard. It's like, hey man, here's a bow and arrow versus, and you know how to use this thing,
*  right? Like make sure you're far away and like up on a hill or something because you can take that
*  bow and arrow, run up on something and try to use it. But if nobody told you not to do that,
*  and they told you it was foundational, it's very foundational, it's very important-
*  To everything else too, right?
*  That's back to the shrimping thing. How many things are we taught that even if it's not,
*  let's say itself is not a garbage thing, it might be effectively garbage. You could give me a Ferrari,
*  but if I try to make it fly, it's not going to work. If you're like, oh, but here's a plane,
*  here's another plane, here's another plane, here's another plane, here's a Ferrari. I'm like, oh,
*  it must be a different type of plane. Like you can be forgiven for leap if we're going there,
*  you know, like, oh, maybe the wings come out or you just go fast enough to take a bullet.
*  I'm like, you can make these crazy leaps in your mind and people are doing that all the time.
*  So if you don't provide the context for me, or worse yet, you provide improper context,
*  like how, how much of a problem is that going to be?
*  Well, I think the skill of the white belt should be just be nice. But so in the complicated human
*  space of when your intention, at least in the big picture view is good. The question is,
*  it's not always when your intention is good. The actual implementation of it is good. So you might
*  be just almost and that's much. It's not the case for you. It's much more a case for white belts.
*  They don't even know their intention might be good, but they don't know all the lines they're
*  crossing all the right. So they're not actually able to and like interpret all the ways in which
*  they're being totally insensitive to the requests of others, explicit requests of others.
*  So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener of those social cues.
*  Well, it's like a desert foreign country, right? Yeah. Like you're a representative of people that
*  look like you, people that talk like you, people that have your passport and you're like, man,
*  I'm going to go over here. I've got my foot up on my knee. Well, if I was in certain conscious
*  world, that's rude. I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry. But can you imagine if someone says, hey, I really
*  appreciate if you take your foot off. That's pretty rude. And then I want to tell them, well,
*  not where I'm from, man. I'm in your house. I better, again, I may go that direction, but let's
*  say I could get away with that. Now I'm a bully. And if I can't get away with that, well, I'm about
*  to maybe be on the wrong side of something. But I guess, like you said, if we have positive intention,
*  that's fine. But I also have to recognize who I am. And I think that that's one thing that
*  I tried to do and continue to try to do over time. Like we're, oh man, hi, I'm the one that's asking
*  for a favor here. If I spar with Raymond Daniels, Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor. I ain't doing
*  him a favor. Let's not get it twisted. So thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate.
*  These are not, and this is not like some effected nonsense. This is serious. I'm like, thank you.
*  If I spar with Stephen Thompson, I'm the one being done a favor. George St. Pierre takes his time to
*  spar with me, which he has in the past, and not even kill me, which is really, I appreciate that
*  because that's why I can sit here. George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off or see what's
*  going on. And also I'm going to do that and then expect him to just take it. And I've seen, he's
*  a gentleman. I've seen people get nuts with George and have him just be like, he has a, he's a patient
*  of a saint. I don't have that level of patience, but I would just say to come back, figuring out
*  like, Hey, so what role am I here? And that comes back to like, at least what I see people on the
*  internet. Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan. You're like, no, you don't, Ryan, you're some goof.
*  I'm like, I'm some random dude, Joe, like people want to, they almost want to like elevate so that
*  we can somehow be level with peers here. If I go into Faraz Zahabi's gym, I'm not a peer of Faraz
*  Zahabi. I am a student of TriStar. I am a guest in the academy. And if Faraz asked me for something,
*  short of him like, you know, telling me to try to do a triple backflip so I can break my neck.
*  The answer is yes, sir, I can do it for you, Faraz. No, man, in no words. And it's, and hopefully it
*  should come with, I guess, a level of graciousness. But I guess that's kind of one of the things that
*  I see nowadays with how accessible people are. Because I grew up, you know, being a big, huge
*  base sports fan of all kinds. I couldn't send Darajit or a message and even much less have a
*  possibility of reply. And if I do, it's like, you know, I have people send me messages. It's very
*  nice that people send messages. Some people, again, and everyone, not everyone is coming from
*  the same place. But I've had plenty of things that are like, Yo, dude, I need you to do this for me.
*  I'm like, well, I'll tell you what's never going to happen. That I have no idea who you are. And
*  that was how I was addressed. And I don't need, oh, man, you're the greatest one, because that's
*  weird. And two, because I'm not. But just, hey, Ryan, how are you doing? Hey, do you think you
*  could do the following if you get a second? Like, if I get a second, you're dang right I can. Why
*  not? It's easy ask. But it started with some level of politeness. And I guess like that's
*  maybe being semi southern, like I grew up in Virginia. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Like,
*  yeah, well, there's all different kinds of implementations of play. I mean, all most of
*  the successful people I've met, it's been surprising to me how much of you mentioned peers,
*  like the like I could think of Joe Rogan, you mentioned Joe Rogan, but you know, Musk,
*  they don't like they almost treat me like I'm the superior. You know what I mean? Like, it's not
*  even it's that's the politeness. Like, you know, that's the approach. The feeling of it is like
*  I'm the student, I'm the beginner. I'm like approaching a situation like it's it's it's
*  almost like method acting of like you're better than me. That and that's how I approach a lot
*  of interactions like I have something to learn from this, even if it's like a young. Do you think
*  that they're on genuine? They're totally genuine. But it's not a funny thing. Like in spite of who
*  they are, they're incredibly genuine because they respect correct me if I'm wrong, they respect you
*  obviously for what you bring to the table. No, no, they approach everybody like that.
*  That's right. They don't. But I'm sure they respect what you bring to the table. Beyond that,
*  though, there was the treatment with dignity as a human being as a human being, which is right,
*  people. And when they could probably get away with treating most people without a whole heck
*  of a lot of dignity. And I guess what does that always say that like, you know, again, like you
*  can always tell someone of quality because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.
*  But that's what we're seeing a lot like that was, I guess, I don't mean to like to nitpick,
*  but that's where we take issue, I guess, a little bit or disagree with you.
*  You're going to criticize with the Internet again?
*  I know. Man yells at clouds. But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like the way that
*  people address each other because it's so casual now. Yes. You know, and it's great. On the one
*  hand, it's nice. On the other hand, you go, Hey, I just why can't do am I somehow diminished? Am I
*  worried about diminishing myself? It's like the way that I'm sure that people talk to like talk
*  to women sometimes. And words. What's up, girl? Man, she's bitch, you know, versus like,
*  how am I that was supposed to get a good response? What about that was going to elicit a favorable
*  response? You know, versus being anything anything other than than just, you know, man, what's going
*  on? And I guess that doesn't make any sense. It makes total sense. And that southern thing
*  that you're referring to, I feel like that's an important. That's an important part of human
*  communication. Let me ask you this. Sure. Your new back attacks instructional. First of all,
*  awesome. Yeah. Second of all, you drop, you drop a lot of fascinating insights in there, but you
*  quote Galileo out of all people in saying that you can't teach a man anything. You can only help
*  him find it within himself. So we talked about how to start in jujitsu. What about if we zoom out
*  even more and how do you learn how to learn? How do you optimize the learning process?
*  I don't know the answer to that, but I can tell you what I like to do. And I would say like,
*  I can't step one. I don't I'm not maybe this is a little bit easier for me because, you know,
*  I've never had a ton of friends. Honestly, I've got my close friends and people that I know,
*  but I've never had tons and tons of people. So I spent a lot of time thinking. And anyway,
*  I can't I can't control you. I can't control anybody else. I, you know, I
*  all like it. I want to take my it's a Marcus Aurelius thing. It's like, you know, I guess
*  the trick to life is figuring out what's in our control and what's not and focusing on things that
*  are in our control, I guess. And so step one is figuring out both internally and then also
*  out in the world as it pertains to jujitsu. What is actually in my control and what is not like
*  passing someone's guard is not in your control. People think it is. It ain't if I can't just do
*  an activity and be unchecked, then it ain't in my control entirely. I can always breathe. I can
*  always, you know, be calm. I can always no matter whether I'm concerned or not concerned,
*  have whatever you want to call it nerves, you know, I can step forward across the line and say,
*  I will I will face the challenge ahead. That is all entirely. No one can stop me from doing that.
*  That's entirely in my control. And that's why I know that every single time that I walk into the
*  ring, I'll walk in and out of there with my head high because there's I will fight with everything
*  that I have. I can't promise that I'll win. I would say I take that same first principles,
*  you mentioned last time we talked, you know, with Elon and the importance of that and going,
*  what are the first principles? And I guess to come back a lot of times, in my opinion,
*  things that people think are the basics are not the basics. You can't learn if you think you're
*  reasoning for first principles, which are actually like level six, you're actually like layers up.
*  You're making so many there's so many baked in assumptions to what's going on that you're
*  going to struggle to understand why anything is actually happening internally, externally,
*  you name it. So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning is first principles
*  and trying to understand what's going on. But then also simple things first, I can control my
*  posture. I can control my breathing. No one can stop me from doing that. I can control where I
*  place my frames. I can control where I place my limbs. I can move my feet. I can develop the
*  ability to do these things better, of course. And I do that through practice, through drilling,
*  through watching people. I've been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts to train
*  with many of my heroes, to train with many of the people that I looked at. And I was like,
*  that guy is amazing. I want to train with this person. Like Steven Thompson, Kenny Florian,
*  George St. Pierre, Raymond Daniels, Faraz Zahabi, you know, I mean, like Bruno Frizzato, Marcelo
*  Garcia, all of these guys that are just unbelievable. And I go, well, they're moving in a way that's
*  different. Well, how do I do that? Well, sometimes you can ask them and they can tell you directly.
*  Other times people, part of the genius of what they do is that it's intuitive. And maybe they
*  don't think and understand and see the world the same way that I do. That was something that I
*  experienced with Marcelo. He's amazing. But in a different way than his, it just, we see things
*  fundamentally different. We experience the world differently. It seems to me that we do. And again,
*  that taught me a really important lesson because I was wanting when I trained there to have someone
*  go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this, and this, and then that's how it works. And I was like, all right,
*  because that's how I understood martial arts at the time. I wasn't ready to have someone tell me
*  like, hey, it feels a little bit like this. And I just kind of do it, which is kind of what Marcelo
*  would do at the time. He was less experienced as a teacher, but that is what he was doing.
*  I was completely, I couldn't separate in my mind, performance and understanding. I thought that if
*  I understand, I could do it. And I would also struggle sometimes to wonder why I couldn't
*  execute things that I thought I understood and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.
*  I mean, in like the lightning wind, like that type of thing, like it's just so in touch with
*  what they wanted with their capabilities. They could summon their powers at will.
*  I couldn't always do that. And I guess so recognizing that there was more than one way
*  to the top of the mountain. And also I had a lot of science, but I didn't have a lot of art,
*  or I had some science I should say, but I didn't have a lot of art. Meeting people like Marcelo
*  taught me and then Josh Waitzkin actually brilliant guy, chess champion, former owner, maybe owner of
*  Marcelo's Academy, really great friend. I think he has a book on learning. He does. Yeah. The art
*  of learning, but yeah, he knows a thing or two about it, but a great guy. And anyway, he sat me
*  down one time was like, look, man, you're doing this wrong. You're missing what the missing,
*  the genius, the brilliance that's right in front of you. And it took me a long time. What did he mean?
*  That I was frustrated with my inability to grab certain things. And sometimes the teaching style
*  being different, not wrong. It was tough for me at the time. You were trying to replicate
*  what Marcelo was saying as opposed to understanding the fundamentals from which it was coming.
*  Right. I couldn't see where it was coming from. And also sometimes I'm like, well, why can't you
*  explain it in the way that I would want you to explain it? And he's like, well, why can't I meet
*  him where he's coming from? So anyway, it was a really important time and lesson, very, very
*  frustrating from modest, but it's not, I'm so thankful for that time. And anyway, you know,
*  I guess- Always first principles, trying to understand the basics first starting at the
*  place where you can control things, the very basic elements of what you can work with.
*  And then when there's other mentors and teachers to-
*  Meet them where they're coming from.
*  Meet them with- To the extent that I can rather than I'm not like, again, it's like, why are you
*  not talking to me the way I want you to talk to me as opposed to, hey, where are you coming from?
*  Back to your point. But I know that's not entirely specific, but like if you can focus on that and
*  back to the whole, you can't teach a man anything. Marcello didn't teach me anything, but he taught
*  me in so doing and other people like that to find it within. And it's like, I guess something else
*  that I've heard before is that all learning is self-discovery, but all performance is self-expression.
*  And I always thought that Marcello was a brilliant master of letting what's inside out. He was so
*  consistent in his performances. And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there personally,
*  particularly at the end of Jiu Jitsu when I was very, very results oriented and I wasn't,
*  I think my focus was not ideal. It was definitely not in the place that I would like it to be.
*  And whether I would have won more or lost more, hard to say, but I know that I would
*  have performed better if I'd have adjusted that. And anyway, that recognizing that, again, Jiu Jitsu,
*  I think I've said it before, Jiu Jitsu studies as a science, but expressed as an art. It doesn't
*  matter if you can articulate what you know how to do. What matters is if you can do what you know
*  how to do. It only matters if you're, I guess, if you're teaching in a verbal fashion, whether or
*  not you can articulate it, but recognizing the difference between learning on an intellectual
*  level or conceptual level and being able to translate that into the physical. And I guess
*  that's been the thing that I feel fortunate over time in my own academy to be able to fiddle around
*  and learn on my own and practice my students. And sometimes I've struggled to have great training
*  partners. When I say great training partner, I mean other world-class people to spar, to roll with,
*  but I've gotten a lot more, honestly, than I ever would have thought out of being able to practice
*  and learn and fail and try and succeed in my own, without my own little sandbox, figuring out how I
*  can take an idea and then come up with drills and drills to practice it so that I can actually
*  practice putting it into play. Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling, what's the
*  point? I'll never have it. It will never see the light of day. So in that DVD, in that instruction
*  DVD, sorry, it's an online instructional DVD. I keep saying DVD though. Nobody has DVDs anymore.
*  Do they not? It's like VHS. I don't know. Who has DVDs? Or like Blu-ray? I possess some DVDs.
*  I mean, I've never watched them. What do you use them for? Like a cup, like a cup, like a
*  thing you put a drink on? I mean, in a pinch, yeah.
*  What's that even called? Coaster? Yeah, my matrix coaster. The matrix coaster, zeros and ones.
*  Okay, so in that instruction that people should get, I've been watching, I'm really enjoying.
*  It's, I don't even know when it came out recently, right? Like December, something like that? Yeah,
*  it's part one. It's actually like ended up being like 18 hours long and I was like, oh my god,
*  we got to chop it in half. And when it comes together, the whole thing, I think,
*  I hope people will like it. Yeah. Well, it's even part one is really good. It's like, yeah,
*  people on Reddit were really excited for part two as well. Really? And you also have a back.
*  Oh, the old one. The old one that I, that was really helpful to me to understand some very basic
*  aspects of control from the back. Yeah. That was, you know, that clicked with me. There's very few
*  instructionals. There's very few things I've watched that ever clicked with me. And that was
*  definitely it. It taught me one thing. I don't know. It's, you drop a lot of sort of bombs,
*  you drop a lot of really interesting details. And it's funny that there's only specific things that
*  really click. Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in and it's like, oh, that's
*  interesting. Okay. Yeah. But there's certain things that really click. And I remember that first
*  instruction will click with me is like the importance. I don't, I don't remember any more
*  like how you communicated it because I've now integrated. It's now mine. You know what I mean?
*  But it was more about you just describing upper body control and the importance of the upper body
*  control from the back. And just like the, there's certain grip, like the, the, the, you did describe
*  different details on the grips and so on. And as I started trying it, I realized how important
*  upper body control is versus like me. I mean, maybe as a blue belt or something was I thought like
*  you have achieved victory when you got the two hooks in. And then I realized like, at least for
*  me that the hooks were not even for my body type, for my style, for the way I approach things,
*  they were not even important at all. Supplemental for the most part. Yeah. So they were there for
*  the points, but I can establish a huge amount of control. In fact, the hooks were, you were talking
*  about like illusion of choice. It's, it's, uh, it almost made people panic a lot more when you were
*  like fighting for it or establishing that kind of control. They weren't a lot less panicked when
*  hooks weren't involved, even though they should be a lot more panicked. Anyway, I realized a lot of
*  those kinds of things, especially that had to do with judo because so much of judo on the ground
*  is centered around aggressive, efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds of clock chokes and
*  all that kind of stuff. What a brilliant thing that is only going to start to make its way into
*  jiu jitsu coming up. But like the judo style approach to like clock choking, triangling from
*  the top of the turtle and stuff. So powerful. Yeah. And the, the, there's something about judo
*  that emphasizes obviously due to the rules, the urgency. So there you only do techniques that go
*  fast. And then the other thing is, which I guess, uh, jiu jitsu emphasizes too, but judo really does,
*  which is, um, the transition. So like while the person's flying in the air is the easiest time,
*  I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit, which is like,
*  why not put in your submissions or positional control while they're in the air? And they have,
*  if you could, why would you not? Right. And so you should be, oh, well, I don't throw well.
*  We'll learn how to throw and then do it. And so you should think, I mean, in a transition
*  when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff. And that's when you think about chokes,
*  as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke and then everything becomes a lot easier.
*  You ever see Flavio Canto? Uh, yeah. Man. Brazilian judoka is so cool. Like with stuff like that.
*  Yeah, exactly. But, but that has to do with the first starting principle of like,
*  stop thinking this as a two phase game of, uh, standing and then ground,
*  start thinking about like the standing and the standing comes before and the ground comes after,
*  but everything happens in a transition. Well, unless you're attacking, what is,
*  what is the art of war? Like we all like everyone's like, oh yeah, the art of war.
*  And then they immediately throw it away and then fight like a fricking barbarian. But, uh, yeah,
*  I mean, like, but, uh, you know, how many people quote stuff and then like, you know, it's like,
*  what is it? The family guy joke where they're like, you know, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in,
*  he's like, you know, I was doing my work. What are you talking about? And anyway, uh, basically, um,
*  you know, like, what do you like the art of war? You know, one of the things is like the only thing
*  that you can be sure of being successful in attacking is something that's undefended.
*  We're like, yeah, but you know, in a fight that they're defended. Well,
*  are they, there's moments all the time where I'm borderline defenseless. And if you were to attack
*  at that moment, if you could see it and then seize the moment, if you were capable of both,
*  you should not only expect to be successful, you should be damn sure you're going to be successful.
*  And more, more important than that, you'll be successful. And even if somehow not, you won't
*  be countered. And I guess like, uh, that's the trick of almost all, all like conflict, right?
*  It's like showing up when the other person's, you know, taking a nap. And then it's so funny,
*  like we take like a protracted war. It's like, oh, it takes five years and there's, you know,
*  lulls and there's a battle this month, but then there's a couple of weeks in another battle.
*  It's like, well, if you just shrink that down, it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea.
*  That same thing, that whole war is taking place in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes.
*  And there's moments of lulls of person effectively going for a snack, you know, being like, you know,
*  in a horror movie, like, Hey guys, I'm gonna go get a beer from the, uh, from around the way. Like
*  I'm dead for sure. So anyway, um, is there, uh, on this particular instructional,
*  if you can convert it to words, uh, you talk about finishing the submission,
*  is there some interesting insights that you find beautiful or profound about finishing the rear
*  necky choke or just finishing submissions from the back control? Is there something like,
*  you know, you talk about the squeeze and the crash and all these kinds of principles,
*  is there something about control, about the process of finishing that, uh, you find especially
*  profound about this position? Absolutely. The opposite of one profound truth can be another
*  profound truth. So like, uh, it's, I, I, I do, uh, Jesus say that, no, I don't, I actually was a guy
*  on Tumblr. Um, but, uh, yeah, um, yeah, it was really, really cool. There's like a, like a tree
*  in the background, but anyway, uh, um, but so let's say like, I'll use, I'll use examples.
*  Like first off, um, I saw someone finishing a 50 50 heel hook in the UFC one promo that it was
*  like some chubby dude in a karate like inside heel hook and another dude. And you go, huh?
*  Well, I didn't know they were doing that back then at least. And whether they were doing it all. How
*  many times does someone do something and then that works? And then we go, okay, cool. Versus,
*  Hey, maybe we should do that all the time. So anyway, how long do we all talk to do the seatbelt
*  the way we all do the seatbelt in Jiu-Jitsu like long time? Why works? In fact, it works so well.
*  And it was so, it was then the people who used it were so prolific that we went,
*  well, solve that one. Good to go. All right. No more thinking. And then you go, imagine you were
*  to like the Merkel and Merkel flip all those positions that were showing in the, uh, in the
*  DVD, which is pretty much or the whatever the heck it is in the digital VD. Um, no, not VD.
*  Don't want that digital digital video, something, but basically, uh, recognizing that doing it on
*  the wrong side is at least as effective. It doesn't mean that the other side wasn't good.
*  There could be something that's the literal borderline opposite of that. And you go, huh?
*  Well, that's something like imagine, like I would say almost all of these things, all the tactics
*  and all the strategies. So I guess that was something that we came to like training in the
*  gym like a year ago, maybe I've been playing with since and it's just, it's huge. I'm like,
*  always. So let me get this straight. First, if I can use my strong side seatbelt, my right arm over
*  the shoulder and all the time. Well, that's, that's really helpful because that's a lot better than
*  my left. You do both sides of my left. But if I had to bet my life on, on being able to finish it,
*  I would want my right arm over, huh? Everything that's a tactic or a strategy evolved from an
*  idea. Like capitalism's an idea, you know, anarchy is an idea. And then it becomes, well,
*  what does that all mean? What are the, what are the consequences? What's the fallout of all this?
*  Right. So what if we start with Jiu-Jitsu, the idea of the guard, right? And we go, well, I mean,
*  when do you, why do you use the guard? No other martial art really has developed the guard
*  in the same way that Jiu-Jitsu has. Well, what is the guard? A guard is a defensive idea where
*  you're kind of on your back to some extent or another, and you're using your legs as a wall
*  between you and the other person and the other guy represents danger. And you're like, yeah,
*  that's a great idea. Is it? I mean, it clearly works at least to a certain extent, but what have
*  where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up? Not on the other dude. I'm trying to put
*  them down things on the floor. If I want to generate a ton of power, what's the first thing
*  I do with my feet? I anchor them to the floor, drive for a punch, you name it, move away, jump,
*  dark, you name it. So does it mean that that's a terrible idea to be on your back? No,
*  clearly it works. And clearly it's a little bit of a phrase, has function. But what if the function
*  that we're giving it and we're in the, how much, how much focus we're assigning to it is
*  disproportionate to its effectiveness. Maybe what if it's not a good idea? I'm not saying it's not
*  a good idea, but what if it wasn't? That's a foundational idea of jujitsu. And then how much,
*  because no one questions that foundation, how much innovation is built on top of the idea? Well,
*  of course I want to be, my being on my back is an okay position. So now they're innovating,
*  but they're innovating within a closed system that they don't even, they think they're innovating in,
*  like in this open space of, oh my God, it can be anything. When in reality, it could be anything
*  within this little set, but you don't realize that you're in a set. You don't realize that you're in
*  a box. There would be answers that would become so immediately apparent to you if you were willing
*  to look outside of that, but you'll literally never even look over to your left because
*  you don't even realize the left exists. Do you think there's a lot of places in jujitsu,
*  whether it's back control or generally guards and all the different positions where there's a lot of
*  space, like a lot, a lot to be discovered by questioning the basic assumptions. Maybe if you
*  can give examples of like back control, like, is there something you've discovered that's like
*  Merkel versus seatbelt? What's Merkel with seatbelt? Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder,
*  left arm under the arm. I'm on the, I'm on the same side as my choking arm. Merkel is just,
*  I do the same thing. I'm even just my hands. I walk myself over to the left side. I'm on the
*  opposite side. It's actually a more powerful position. Yeah. For people listening or for
*  people who might not know jujitsu is a seatbelt is a control. We're talking about when one person is
*  on the back of another person, which is a really dominant position in jujitsu, seatbelt is a,
*  I guess, widely accepted way of holding your arm. This is almost best practices. Yeah. And it's
*  worked so well. So it's a one arm over one arm under, and there's a certain side you're supposed
*  to be on when you're on the back, you know, everyone teaches there's a choking arm. That's
*  the arm that's over your body is supposed to be in a certain side relative to that.
*  And then Ryan is describing questioning these like basic assumptions of which side you're supposed
*  to be on. And let's say that's even just like a mid-level assumption. It's not even a first
*  principles assumption, but it's pretty close to it's getting there. But let's just say for
*  sake of argument, it goes a lot deeper. Maybe. I think most of the innovation that I see is not
*  innovation. It's like basically changing the color of a car or polishing like the window a little bit.
*  We're like, Hey, you made it. You made it a little bit different. You made it a little bit better.
*  It's like, Oh man, what if I did the same guard and then grab the lapel? I'm not saying this bad,
*  but you're not fundamentally changing anything. I think most of the big seismic shifts that we see
*  in almost anything come from, Hey, that thing we thought was right was wrong rather than
*  not only is it right, it's even writer. And you're like, it's not wrong. It's not bad,
*  but that's you're in. It's like, Oh man, let's say for instance, I didn't make the triangle
*  better, but let's say I made the triangle a little bit better than it was or than it was taught.
*  I mean, you can call it innovation. I don't know, man. It's not like the person that said,
*  Hey, have you guys ever heard of a triangle before and came up with that? We like that is,
*  I feel like that's, that's on the list. You can do this thing to people. Are you kidding me?
*  Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand? You'd be like one punch man. You can walk
*  around and just, just lay low every single person you got into a fight with because it
*  didn't even occur to them to hit you with their backhand in a world full of jabbers. You throw
*  your backhand, you're going to kill people. So basically, by the way, I mean, just to pause on
*  that, that first of all, somebody did invent the triangle probably, right? It's not a trivial thing
*  once you think, how many of these giant things that we all go like, Oh yeah, we all use that now.
*  Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks and we're naked chokes and I don't have those.
*  You're on your borderline. I mean, like that's, that's why that's, we all experience every single
*  one of this, particularly those of us. I mean, when did you first start training? Like 12, 13,
*  well, let's not count wrestling, but 13 years ago with Jiu-Jitsu. Right on. So let's say,
*  let's say about that time where particularly it was still like kind of kind of undergroundy,
*  and you're like, Hey, we all experienced being like a relative, like a mid-level white belt
*  and being able to easily beat up all our friends because everyone wrestled other buddies. And it
*  was one of those ones where like, they don't have weapons to end the fight. You have weapons to end
*  the fight. That's so, that's such a crazy, you know, asymmetric advantage that if you lose,
*  it's on you now, man. Like you get like, you had the next time it's like, I've got this rifle
*  and you have nothing. And I decided to put it on my back and then run over and try to karate chop.
*  You're like, okay, next time just make sure you use the rifle, but I'm like, oh yeah, I should do
*  that. So yeah, it's kind of fascinating to, I mean, everything you're describing as a, there's a
*  fascinating tension between like, whatever I show people for the first time, what a triangle is,
*  just like regular people. Uh, it's like they're discovering is like, oh, okay. That's interesting.
*  I mean, MMA has changed that, but people haven't watched MMA. That's an interesting move. It
*  doesn't make sense why that would be a choke. And they kind of quickly accepted that's a thing
*  and they accept the basics without questioning, wait a minute, what's actually being choked?
*  How is it that a shoulder of a person can do the choking? Like I'm, I'm not sure I fully
*  questioned the fundamentals of all of that. Like what exactly is the blood supply that's being
*  cut off? Like what, what is the anatomy and the physiology of all of that? Why does this work?
*  And if you understood all that, what else could we do here? Yeah. What else can we do here? That's
*  the really important thing. But if we know, if I'm an end user, which almost everyone is of almost
*  anything, I'm serious where I'm like, I think about stuff in my life. The only things I really
*  think about are like martial arts and martial arts strategy and like, I don't know, some other
*  couple, couple other things, but not much. And anything else in my life is, is borderline
*  unexamined. And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort in something, I'd like to think
*  that I could figure at least some things out about it. But I figured out almost nothing about
*  anything in my life because I haven't even looked. And you know, if you're an end user,
*  what are you capable of versus you can literally alter the source code. You are Neo in the freaking
*  matrix. If you can alter the code and I can't, and it's like, we think, ah, but imagine you are a
*  world-class anything or even not even world-class. Forget it. Like a purple belt compared to a white
*  belt or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones or Marcelo Garcia. You're going to
*  beat them up comparably bad. So it's a, that's, that actually is a common thing where people
*  can't tell the difference in levels. They're like, oh man, I've trained with my black belt
*  instructor. How much better could so-and-so be like so much better. You're going to have a hard
*  time wrapping your head around it. I remember when I first trained with Marcelo Garcia in 2007,
*  I was a decent purple belt. And of course you Mollie walked me very gently and then a train
*  with him again in 2008. I was definitely better. I won the Gia Nogi worlds that you're a purple belt.
*  So definitely for the record, I'm definitely not a Jiu-Jitsu world champion. I wanted the purple
*  belt, but like that's not the same at winning a black belt and a tough accomplishment, but not,
*  not in the same thing at all. But anyway, I was definitely better. He beat me up just the same.
*  I'm like, okay. 2009. I was a lot better. Got a medal at ADCC that time. Won the trials, crushed
*  everybody. Like no, just submitted everybody like bop, bop, bop, bop. Training with Marcelo Garcia.
*  It was worse. And 2010 training with Marcelo Garcia. Same, same. So the idea was,
*  I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference. And the outcome difference was the same in all
*  of these rounds. I was significantly more experienced and more, more adept each time,
*  each time that this occurred, but it was like, how many number of times did this person submit
*  you or pass you guard in the round? I'm like, I don't know. Probably like, let's say five each
*  one, because it's a brief period of time, unless it was three on one, six on another, whatever,
*  it's comparable. It's six one, half dozen. Would I be able to easily tell the difference?
*  No, I would just say, I know in concept that he's way better, so much better, but there's
*  plenty of other people that could have beaten me just as bad as Marcelo did when I was a purple
*  belt or when I was a brown belt. Then maybe I would watch Marcelo walk through like their borderline,
*  not there. So it's neat. Like if you, that's back to kind of what I was talking about, about certain
*  people beginning to really like peel back some of what's really special about the martial arts or
*  any activity I presume, is they get to a level of understanding and depth that they're playing with
*  almost the reality of that thing. And I'm playing by rules that are not rules. I'm not even one of
*  the, to use a matrix analogy, I'm not even an agent, which is the best version of something
*  playing by the rules. I'm like one of the regular people or one of the regular people that got out
*  of the matrix. So I'm like, oh, I'm cool. But when I fight an agent, I lose because we're both in
*  the rules, but they just play them to the bone and I'm just here. And then the agent encounters Neo
*  and they can do nothing. You're like, why? Because he's operating outside of what the rules are,
*  but not really what the rules are, what they perceive to be the rules are clearly. So anyway,
*  I guess that's kind of my point about Marcelo or certain other people that are doing things where
*  you go, that doesn't even seem real. It doesn't seem real to me because I don't understand what's
*  going on. And I guess if we can get down to base assumptions, but like if we can constantly strip
*  away, strip away, strip away, let's say we always thought that turning left was right, it was
*  correct. And it turns out that turning right was correct. Change your life.
*  Yeah. It's a, what is it? Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living. So you just
*  basically have to rigorously just constantly examine every assumption over and over and over.
*  But doesn't that give your life meaning to come back to the struggle, to come back to free will,
*  to come back to what if we could strip all that away? All right, cool. All right, let me just stick
*  the needle in my arm. And that's that. Yeah. No, I mean that, that constant striving
*  for understanding yet another lower layer of the simulation we're living in is, is,
*  is something that's actually deeply fulfilling that I don't know if it's genetically built in,
*  but there's something about that striving to understand that seems to be deeply human.
*  It's funny. What makes a human, we don't talk about the soul anymore, man. I went to Catholic
*  school as a kid, whether you buy into all that stuff or not, you're like, what, what about the
*  soul of a person, the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation anywhere, the spirit of humanity?
*  We don't, we don't even, we talk about everything like it's this quantifiable thing when maybe
*  certain things are, maybe everything is, but then what happens if there's things that just
*  aren't quantifiable that nothing in our understanding can or will ever explain?
*  And that doesn't mean that that should be our assumptions. If you are assumption that we can
*  explain everything and let's get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel. But what if there is
*  actually something that like that you, that we need challenge for. And we could be looking in the
*  wrong place by going, ah, where is it in the genes? Maybe it is. I, again, I'm not saying we're looking
*  in the wrong place. Like I wouldn't know anything. I do karate, but basically, uh, not even well.
*  But, uh, yeah, we do karate mediocre. Just ask Raymond Daniels or Steven Thompson. But, uh,
*  I guess the, to come back though, you just- Are you a yellow belt yet or are you-
*  Man, I actually have, let's see, you ever see the, yeah, Seinfeld episode where Kramer fights the kids?
*  Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels school under the kids, kids wanting class as in addition to the,
*  uh, the alleyway. Oh, yeah. But, uh, yeah, exactly. When I was on my last legs, but, uh, but yeah,
*  I would just maybe it's funny. I feel like there's something deeply missing from, you know, from
*  public understanding and more that it's almost like the idea that we can figure everything out,
*  which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility that there's some things that we'll never really
*  see and some things we'll never understand. And there's something, like you said, uniquely human
*  about the human experience that even if I had the power to change, I don't want to fuck with it,
*  man. I don't want to change that thing. Oh yeah. Well, I wouldn't it be great if we just immediately
*  knew the outcome of everything and you just press this button, you're like, oh, that's kind of,
*  what's the point of living life then? Even if you could do it, it's the, it's the, you're seeing
*  Jurassic, I'll leave you to be sorry. I know I'm talking about Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park,
*  Jeff Goldblum, right? Life, life finds a way, but we were so concerned with whether or not we could,
*  we didn't stop to think whether or not we should. Maybe. I think there's an, I mean,
*  it's a deeply human thing, but it's also a really useful thing to always kind of assume that there's
*  this giant thing that you don't understand. So you can forever be striving to understand
*  because that process gives you meaning, but also keeps making you better. Like thinking that
*  actually even just thinking that you can't understand everything will lead you to stop too early.
*  So like, I think there's something to whether it's the soul or whether it's like religious stuff,
*  like assuming that there's this thing that you cannot possibly understand is a really good
*  assumption under which to operate and under which to do this first principles kind of thinking,
*  because you can just keep digging and keep digging, keep digging, even when it seems like
*  you're at the bottom, because you don't fucking know if you're at the bottom or not. And back to
*  your original, back to one of our, I guess our other kind of tangents was that comes back to everyone's
*  a human being. The smartest human being in the history of humanity is so hilariously weak,
*  like short-lived and not intelligent. I understand. I didn't say, no, I'm not saying comparison to me,
*  in comparison to me, everyone is awesome, but that's why I don't do the goat thing. But basically,
*  it's just on a cosmic level. Can you imagine if you were a vampire, you're like 900 years old,
*  like how much you would seem, you would seem like a lowercase G God to people. You'd be like,
*  how can you know so much? How can you have such a long view perspective? It would be insane.
*  So I mean, that it seems like we're talking about AI now, right? Where we're creating things that
*  are infinitely smarter than us effectively and live all this time. And it's probably going to
*  do what we tell us to do, right? No, it's probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.
*  Do you, by the way, think about AI and the existential threats? Like speaking of gods,
*  are you, is this whole technological world, we talked about social networks and this increasing
*  power of technology around us. We ourselves are becoming less human because we keep becoming,
*  we keep relying on technology more and more. So we're becoming kinds of cyborgs, but also there's
*  a future that's quite possible where the technology becomes smarter and more powerful than us humans
*  and, you know, starts having a life of its own in ways that perhaps we don't imagine as human
*  beings. I don't just mean like two legged robots walking around and being humans, but smarter.
*  I mean like an intelligent life that's beyond and fundamentally different than our human life.
*  It's infinite. It's a new species. Yeah. Yeah. And you kind of species, not even just a new species.
*  You're talking about systems, but like it lives in the space of information. It lives in a different
*  time scale and a different scale of all sorts, spatial scale. It operate like we spoke about
*  individuals. It doesn't operate in the sense of a single individual, like it's not embodied. So it's
*  not like a thing that walks around and it like, it looks at stuff and it consumes the world. It's
*  able to do much larger scale sensing of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff.
*  I can barely even try to, I can barely even conceive of what that would be like. Are you scared
*  or are you excited? I don't define scared or excited. I feel like I tend to define them like
*  the same way. I guess I'm kind of like before karaoke. It's the same. Well, that's actually
*  kind of my happy place. It's not so much everyone else's. Everyone else is probably heading for the
*  door at that point, but it's a while you're doing it or leading up to the karaoke session. Well,
*  it depends whether or not they know it's me. If they know it's me, that's before I start. If
*  they're like, who's that guy? Then they're like halfway through the song. They're already
*  throwing their beer. What categories of song or particular song are we talking about in terms of
*  like your happy place? Oh man, are you kidding me? I mean, obviously Bohemian Rhapsody. I mean,
*  there's no question because I don't have to sing it here. It's that. It's like, you remember,
*  can I be, can I be, oh yeah, of course. Is he here? No? Yeah, then yeah. Yeah. All right. If you hear,
*  no, then I can't. I have torn feelings about Bohemian Rhapsody because I like the beginning
*  part, the sadness, I like the solo heartbreak, but the second part, I understand it, but it's
*  so ridiculous. It gets ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. It ruins it for me. But it's more
*  about flexing on people. I think if you can actually hit that, hit that near the falsetto.
*  Yeah. So it's, it's not okay. So you appreciate enough for the musical beauty and complexity of
*  the song. You just like to flex on people. Cause like for all, yeah, like what's the purpose of
*  anything except for just to let everyone know that you think you're cool.
*  And there's no better way of doing that than karaoke. So I'm not sure why.
*  But I have a captive audience. Yeah, exactly. Oh, about fear and excitement of artificial
*  intelligence. I mean, like, you know me, I don't know anything about it. I just,
*  basically I don't, I don't understand the implications of any of this. I would just say
*  that like radically altering what it means to be human in such an unbelievably short period of time
*  just seems like such a crazy thing. And also it's not like we're, I can't remember who said
*  this to me recently. I can't remember. So this is definitely not my idea, but we're, we're not even
*  going, Hey, would you like to opt in everyone? Everyone is being opted in, you know, and
*  particularly when you want to talk about like large scale robotics, a large scale AI, like the
*  world is changing. People in Senegal are opting in right now without realizing it. It's not even
*  like, and again, I don't mean to pick on Senegal. It's just this, whatever country comes up to mind,
*  but that's in the developing world, but basically, you know, recognizing that this huge shift is
*  coming. We have no idea. This is a decent idea. And also something else I've always been considered
*  is, you know, you think about most of the really awful, awful, awful things that have done in
*  history, large scale slavery, Holly, you name it. It didn't, if people say that it came from this
*  motivation or that motivation, maybe it did, maybe it didn't fundamentally the issue, at least in my
*  mind, and again, I'm not a historian, power differential. If you and I can't contest,
*  we don't contend. It's not like you, we fight and you might win or we fight, even you'll win
*  comfortably. It's you are so unbelievably powerful compared to me that there's nothing I can do to
*  stop you. That seems like a recipe for something really, really not great happening. Because if
*  you think about like, you know, European countries encountering each other, and I'm just speculating,
*  I don't know anything about history, but let's say countries that can contend with one another,
*  versus countries that can't. Let's say an alien species, alien race shows up, you know, right now,
*  we don't want that. I think Stephen Hawking said that, it makes perfect sense to me, we don't want
*  that. If you can come here, we better hope you're nice. Because what are we going to do? What are
*  we going to hope that you invade the water planet like they did in, you know, one of the, Lord of
*  the, yeah, War of the Worlds. So I guess what I'm trying to get across is like, shocking levels of
*  power differential between groups makes the world ripe for horrific abuse in the event that someone
*  decides to do it. It's like, like, like you imagine an adult hitting a child, like hitting,
*  hitting a child, no one in their right mind would ever go like, oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
*  Because it's such an it's so grossly imbalanced, you're like, this is wrong. But it's also on the
*  table only because of the gross imbalance. So I guess to come back, it's like, whether we create
*  AI, and it's on some crazy level of its own, or it's, I'm in charge of it. Or I just, it seems
*  like we're creating, you mentioned like game theory and nuclear war, what prevented nuclear
*  war? I mean, presumably mutually assured destruction. I mean, hopefully also humanity and
*  the humanity and the reasonable, you know, cooler heads prevailing and going, hey, I can, I can
*  understand the veil of ignorance. And I, I don't go, oh, yeah, let me kill those guys. Because I
*  can't, I go, this is wrong, period. And in concept, this is not an action I should take. But it's also
*  nice and easy to keep me honest, if I know that I can't get you without being got myself.
*  But what happens when I can get anyone, anything, and I'm more or less untouchable? Like that seems
*  to me to be like, like various times in colonial history, you know what I mean? And what happened?
*  We know what happened. But so the possibility of really bad things are plentiful, the possibilities.
*  But are the possibilities of really positive things are plentiful?
*  Like what though? I'm not saying wrong. I don't actually know.
*  So I can give a million examples. One is just the examples of the parent and the child.
*  You said there's a power differential there. And we don't like a parent hitting their child.
*  What about not just hitting, like beating?
*  Beating, yeah, great. Beating their child. How often percentage wise do you see that happening,
*  even though that power differential, first of all, other people's kids,
*  let's just put this on the table. I love kids, but other people's kids can be annoying sometimes.
*  Sometimes you got to deal out some justice. I get it.
*  But we don't practice. We don't take advantage of that power differential.
*  There is ethics. There's moralities that emerge that allow the power differential to be used for
*  good versus for bad. So like you're one of the assumptions with Stephen Hawking or with
*  if Russia became much more powerful than America or America much more powerful than Russia in the
*  Cold War, your assumption that immediately that power differential, not your assumption,
*  but it would express itself, right? Would express itself in the same way that it was trying to
*  express itself when there was a more level competition. But it's also possible when the
*  power differential grows, the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms that
*  made sense when it was at the same level, the incentives become very different.
*  It's not as fun to destroy the ant colony. You start becoming more the kind of a
*  conservationalist like one hopes. That's an evolved perspective though. Yeah.
*  Well, I don't know if it's evolved or not, but it's definitely a possibility. It's unclear to me
*  that something that's many orders of magnitude more powerful than us will want to destroy us.
*  Well, I mean, how did mass slavery occur? How did like big dogs playing with not?
*  I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities in history happened when the power differential
*  was not as great as we're talking about with AI potentially. Is that not somehow worse than
*  it's not obvious to me. It's not obvious that things that are way more powerful.
*  That's fair. Okay. So I think you're-
*  I guess how do you restrain it though? There's a lot of different discussions of how to-
*  I assume and restrain each other. Because let's say I go and decide to strike someone's child,
*  which I'd like to think I wouldn't do. I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.
*  And so I feel like there's a lot. Can you imagine how many people used to get murdered
*  just in the woods? I mean, I would just presume it's a lot. I don't think most people are
*  lunatics like that, but I would just say- That's the point.
*  If you're given though, if you're given to that, your ability to get away with it was
*  greater in the past because of chance of detection was less. So that doesn't allow-
*  Yeah, yeah. So this is what is called an artificial intelligence AI safety research
*  called value alignment of ensuring as you build the systems that become smarter and
*  smarter and more powerful and powerful, make sure that their values are aligned with the entities
*  over which they're becoming powerful with humans. So if you were to talk to an AI that's becoming
*  smarter, first it's dumber than you, but then it's becoming smarter and smarter, you have to
*  create mechanisms where you both value the same things. I guess one thing I wonder, so I guess
*  I'm probably not sharp enough to grasp this if I'm honest, but I guess I wonder, I use the
*  chess programs. What was it? Deep Blue, Stockfish, and then AlphaZero and AlphaZero teaching itself
*  to beat Stockfish without any help in four hours. It becomes orders of magnitude more
*  intelligence than us in effectively an instantaneous period. I guess what I always wondered,
*  if you were that much smarter than me, I feel like your ability to manipulate me would be pretty
*  significant or at least potentially, no? But manipulation implies that the incentive is
*  to overpower everything around you. There's implied incentives. If your value is to actually,
*  it depends what you want in life, what you want in your system. It's not clear that the goal of
*  an AI system that's all powerful is to destroy all humans. No, I don't think that it is either.
*  Or even enslave all humans. That's fair. I guess what I'm trying to suggest is that
*  something adequately powerful, these actions are on the table. Yes, they're on the table and that's
*  scary and that's why a lot of people are really concerned about it and are working on it. I'm
*  just trying to make the case for AGI because if they're watching this, he's the one to kill.
*  No, actually I was thinking I was, yeah, I wash toilets like really well.
*  No, I mean, that's the main concern for all the people in the AI state to research.
*  People talk about AGI is it's kind of disturbing how little people are working on
*  trying to create mechanisms that keep AI's values aligned with ours. That's completely
*  unshocking. Yeah, we humans seem to do only good when like, you know, you even look at like
*  coronavirus, it's like when the water has to be leaking from the ceiling, you have to be there.
*  Fine, fine. Blood everywhere, fire, just destruction. We just seem to ignore completely
*  writing all over the wall. Writing all over the wall. This is fine. I'm sure nothing to see here
*  will be okay. But we do all right, especially in the United States, you figure out even when
*  this becomes a really serious problem, taking actions last minute, there's something about the
*  innovative spirit that results in a solution last minute, right before the deadline. Well, I mean,
*  I don't know how you did school, probably a lot better than me. That's exactly how I did school.
*  I couldn't be more, I was no motivation up until like the last, if you're like, we have 22 hours
*  to do the entire semesters of work. Like, let's do this. Yeah. And you had like 19 freaking
*  Mountain Dews and then, yeah. Well, that's why you and I are failures in life because I just
*  talked to, I mentioned Cal Newport with his book, Deep Work and so on. He is of the variety of these
*  creatures that basically does everything ahead of time. That's shocking. Because he dislikes the,
*  he thinks it's unproductive to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline
*  because you're just, you're not going to be your best performance wise and you're not going to do
*  the best work. So it doesn't make any, it's completely irrational to a function based on
*  the deadline. You should have a system, a process that gets stuff, a little bit of stuff done every
*  day. So like you should be and constantly be systematically honest with yourself. If you say,
*  I'm going to get this stuff done today and this week at the end of the day, at the end of the
*  week, you have to then reflect on what you did, who you planned and improve that plan, update it,
*  constantly update every day, every week, every quarter, whatever those durations are. As I'm
*  listening to this and reading his stuff, it's like, oh yeah, I agree with everything. I'm like, yes,
*  I'm clapping. But like the reality is, and then I go back and just eat Cheetos and like, don't do
*  shit until like last night.
*  It ain't cheesy.
*  Actually, I don't eat Cheetos, but yes.
*  But actually, again, not that it'll ever matter, not that it's ever going to matter because he's so
*  shockingly productive and well thought out that whatever I've decided to think about trying to
*  monkey wrench in there is definitely going to be able to deal with. But it's funny that again,
*  because you're a human being, not a God, all of your strengths are your, have a corresponding
*  weakness. The less you practice working under the gun, the less comfortable you are working
*  under the gun. The more practice you have working under the gun, the better you get at it. The
*  downside is you're always working under the gun, so you're less productive or it's like your work
*  quality maybe drops. So it's an interesting thing. It's like, it's almost like, hey, I wonder if this,
*  I wonder if Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart and I say the answer is almost certainly yes.
*  But you go, well, he hasn't struggled a bunch. Maybe he doesn't struggle well. And it just so
*  happens that he can also work under the gun really well. He just doesn't like to do it.
*  But yeah, but it's an interesting thing. It's like, I guess, what is it, the
*  Aristotle, we are what we repeatedly do. We are all, we're all practicing something all the time.
*  So I guess it's funny. I guess that's a question that I have, though. I would love to ask him.
*  It'd be really neat is in certain jobs. I mean, obviously you want to have preparation,
*  always, always, but certain things have like a degree of like entropy in the system. And you go,
*  I need to practice working under the gun. I'm not saying that's what I need to do because the
*  fighting, it should be for the most part, it's a really sterile environment in the grand scheme
*  of things like fighting in a cage is very sterile compared to most other things in life. Right. But
*  dangerous, but sterile. And unless of course, like, you know, like the other guy, the ref decides to
*  hit you hilarious. But anyway, I guess just going like, okay, so at what value do you get out of
*  adding a degree of, let's say you can even be planned by someone else, but junk in the system,
*  and you just have to work under the gun to make it happen. Let's say for instance, like police or
*  something like that, the situation turns left hard at some random point in time, and that could
*  happen to any number of people. So I guess it's interesting things that allow for perfect planning
*  or quasi perfect planning versus things that are inherently unstable. And then what are the,
*  what's the psychological fallout of comfort with that? Because I think a lot of people that are
*  really comfortable under the gun, let it happen a lot for all the good and the bad of that. Does
*  that make sense? No, that totally makes sense. And it was, I mean, his answer would be that you have
*  to be honest with yourself if it's valuable for your success to practice being under the gun,
*  and then you should schedule that. Yeah, he's smart. You should plan that. You should systematically,
*  and then as opposed to doing it half-assedly, because it's as opposed to letting the environment
*  choose the randomness, like control the randomness to where, like you optimize it. I would say it's
*  so efficient, it's shocking just to hear about it. Yeah, no, he's, he's, I mean, the same way
*  you are, he's annoying in the same way, which is like he, he drops truth bombs. It's like, yeah,
*  yeah, that's so true. Yeah, we're probably comparably, yeah, doing that. No, he does.
*  But he's, so he, his profession requires that. So he's not just like a motivational speaker,
*  whatever he, he's a computer scientist, theoretical computer scientist, and he needs the long hours in
*  the day of doing like serious math. So it's mostly math proofs. And for that, you have to sit and
*  think really deeply. It's like really hard work compared to like, uh, what most people do, like
*  even what I, I mean, what I do, like programming is way easier than rigorous math proofs, because you
*  have to basically have this machine and you have to, uh, your brain to churn out logic in a focused
*  way while visualizing a bunch of things and holding that in your brain and holding that for
*  10 minutes, 20 minutes, hopefully several hours. And you're not just like doing homework,
*  you're doing totally novel stuff. So like stuff that nobody's ever done before. So you keep running
*  up against the wall of like, fuck, this is a dead end. I know, wait, is this a dead end? And like
*  that whole frustration, that's serious mental work. That's like incredibly difficult mental work. So
*  he knows what he's talking about. It's amazing. But like you said, he's like, this seems like the
*  standard for the quality of work that he needs is so high, so that almost anything less than this
*  level of systematization and organization would preclude it. Right. He can't afford the kind of
*  bullshit that I don't know about you, but that certainly I do, which is like last deadline kind
*  of stuff, because you can't do that kind of work. Uh, last minute on that kind of stuff. So my,
*  my question for him in general is like, and for you and I is like, well, here's these negative
*  patterns that we do of like doing shit last minute and so on. Is this just who we are now?
*  Or are there some, I don't think I'm really big into a free will. You know, I was thinking that
*  it's mostly predestination, at least in this regard, it's the same with like communism,
*  like as long as it fits my, uh, whatever is the lazy thing to do, I'll just not believe it.
*  I'm not a congressman opportunist.
*  I'm an opportunistic communist and capitalist. I just do whatever, whatever is cool at the time.
*  Exactly. Uh, let me ask you, um, to examine some fundamental principles of a particular thing that
*  Joe Rogan brought up to me several times online and offline, which is that he thinks that the tie
*  that I wear is something that makes me vulnerable to attack that you should be. The reason he
*  doesn't wear a tie is because he can get choked very easily with a tie. It's a big concern.
*  Okay. My contention, and by the way, he wore a suit last time too. Uh, he didn't wear it on
*  the podcast. He wore it for dinner later. Yeah. I wore a suit the other day and I had, uh, no socks
*  on. I didn't realize. Yeah. You're supposed to wear socks. Yeah. That's, that's my understanding.
*  Why'd you wear a suit? You go to court? No, no, not in that one. No.
*  I don't know. I just wanted to play. I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day. Okay, cool.
*  So, uh, so my contention is like the jacket. Everything is more dangerous than a tie. That's
*  kind of where I was going with that. That's kind of where it was. It was my first thought too. Like
*  if the, once the tie becomes an issue, like, yeah, everything else is already an issue. It's already
*  an issue. Yeah. Because the tie to me now without like messing with it now is, is to me has some
*  of the similar problems that a belt does. So like, for example, I don't know about you, maybe you
*  can correct me, but I'm not sure you can use the belt as tied. Uh, you know, I know there's some
*  kind of, um, guards you can probably utilize the belt with, but the belt, sorry, when it's tied
*  around the waist, it'll be talking about a belt belt or a Giba. So a Giba. Okay. Sorry.
*  Giba importantly, he built, it's, it's not that great of a thing to use in most cases, I would say,
*  cause it slides. It doesn't, you can probably invent a few interesting ways to use it as leverage,
*  as control and so on, but there's just so many more things around that are better, better,
*  and so for me, the tie with people don't realize, are we trying to sell a DVD here and have some,
*  some widgets and bells and whistles? Cause in that case, the belt is really important part of what
*  we do. And I would really encourage you guys to look into it. Uh, if we're trying to actually
*  like learn something and say, like you said, we're surrounded by better options. Well, that's the
*  thing. I mean, it's not obvious to me that the belt, maybe there's actually undiscovered things
*  about using the belt. You know, I think people have used like, like putting a foot inside the belt,
*  somehow inside the key belt. There's some, this is a no punches,
*  key grappling situation. Yes. Okay. I guess so. It's already fairly contrived, right?
*  But with punches too, like, is there, okay, let's, let's talk about a street fights with a belt.
*  That's like a jeans belt, like a belt clothing belt. Okay. So I get to take it off and whip them in
*  the face of the buckle. How serious is this street fighter? We talk, they're not, they're not,
*  no, a hundred percent serious or are we talking like, no, like death, like one of you has to die.
*  Oh, yikes. Whoa. Okay. Oh, you, you ever like, I, I'm in this situation all the time.
*  Okay. And there's a reason I'm still here. I had something, I had somebody start fighting
*  the Starbucks kids were talking about power differential. Yeah. I beat up kids all the
*  time. Just pick the easy W's. You gotta get the easy W's. You want the horrible. I'm undefeated.
*  Come around the playground. Watch what happens. No, like to the, to the death,
*  what is their clothing that's useful? You know, from my perspective, for your use or their use?
*  Both. My use, their use. No, like I like how you want to take the belt off
*  and use the buckle to hit them with. But first of all, how are you going to take off the,
*  like the belt? Well, there's a lot of effort involved in unclothing. Well, what I was figuring
*  was when they started to see me take my pants off in the fight, they were like, what they're going
*  to pause and rethink the situation for a second. Yes. I'm making dead eye contact. Obviously. Yeah,
*  exactly. Notting. And then, you know, by the time they realized you took a belt off until you could
*  whip them with it, you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead. Okay. So fine.
*  Let's not talk about your own clothing. Let's talk about their clothes. Okay. I'll take off
*  their belt and hit them with it. No, but that's, that's much harder. No question. But if you can
*  do it while maintaining, I know, but the point is there's alternatives that are perhaps more
*  effective. Yeah. In my perspective, this might be clueless. There's almost no clothing that's
*  more effective than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling. Like I feel like clothing
*  particularly when you start to add hitting, like every single time I start grabbing your clothes,
*  if you start, you start hitting and suddenly nothing could work. But most of the time you're
*  like, why am I not using my arms for something better than what I'm doing them right now?
*  Right. Yeah. It's very difficult for me to, I don't know, in terms of just distance,
*  I can't imagine a case of different distances, even like situations where
*  let's not talk about like, like a situation where you haven't both yet agree that a fight is
*  happening. Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then. Solid clothing. Oh yeah. Like something
*  like a good jacket because you can snatch somebody on their face. Snatch, snatch down.
*  If you took mine, like, you know, like you snap down in judo, like how easy it is to snap down
*  a beginner. Yeah. So I agree with you actually a tie in that sense might be a really effective way
*  to snap down. So like the snap down is really powerful to change the, like disorient the
*  situation and give you a lot of different opportunities for, you know, taking their back,
*  taking them down. Doing hilarious stuff like snapping them down with a tie into your knee.
*  And then when they come back up doing this, you're already. So yeah, in that sense, I agree,
*  but not as a choking mechanism because the concern Joe had is choke. I think you probably choke me
*  with your tie more easily than I can choke you with your tie. Probably. I'm serious. Because like,
*  if you get, you can get, like you get my back and you can put it around somebody's neck, you know,
*  like, like, like you ever see a diehard. Yeah. Yeah. You remember when the super Swedish looking
*  blonde dude or whatever was, was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the, with the chain. Yeah. And
*  then he ended up getting choked himself with the chain, if I recall this properly. But anyway,
*  yeah, like, like that. But, yeah, I don't feel like, I feel like if I start grabbing your tie,
*  you have too many other great options. I mean, I do like the snap down that you actually made me
*  realize. No, I think you're good there. What's that? I think you're on the right path with it.
*  Yeah. Particularly if you start with like one of these, like, you know, like, like you like,
*  you poke your finger in my chest and then snap down real quick. Oh, yeah. Because it also,
*  socially speaking, it's not a threatening thing to, you know, to, to reach for the tie. It's not
*  particularly like a business setting, you know, I mean, they'll never see it coming. Yeah. Because
*  I was thinking choke, but it's not, it's a really good leverage point because like grabbing a jacket,
*  the jacket will slide. If you try to snap down, you really have to get a whole, like a really good
*  hold. That's a good point because it's around the back of the neck. But what if it's clip on?
*  How much of a jackass would you look like? You feel like, and then they just, they stick you on.
*  But you ever see the Japanese politician or I think it was Japan. The judo throw? Yeah, it was,
*  the guy is so, he was so calm and cool. Had like, it was every, it was beautiful technique. The,
*  the level of, of actually the throw was even gentle. Yeah. But yeah, it was perfect. It's
*  amazing. Well executed. Yeah. More of our politicians just toss the shit out of each other. Yeah,
*  we need more Teddy Roosevelt. Exactly. I like our politicians like talking about fighting when
*  it's clear that none of them even, it would ever have been in a fight ever. Yeah. Somebody was
*  saying Teddy Roosevelt is interesting. I didn't realize this is he's one of the greatest presidents
*  this country's had. And he was one of the greatest presidents, even though he faced no crisis
*  whatsoever. He literally willed himself like nothing happened during his presidency. He's just
*  a bad motherfucker who made really great speeches. So you're like, you know, this made me realize,
*  I was just talking to a historian that like, most of the people who we think are great need also a
*  good crisis that they've, that reveal their greatness. But Muhammad Ali, right? This Muhammad
*  Ali, I mean, in sports. But, but you know, I mean, like the circumstances, what is greatness? You
*  know, I mean, it's like, you have to, it's not just your capacity, it's what you, what you face,
*  right? So quality of opposition circumstance, what you overcome. So I guess what you're saying is Joe
*  Rogan is wrong about the tie thing. You know, I don't want to go so far as saying he's wrong.
*  I, you know, the man's not here to defend himself. Maybe he has some things that I'm not understanding.
*  I'm willing to get. He has not deeply thought that this is my main criticism of Joe. He's not deeply
*  thought to this. And the MMA journalists will be like, Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong and hates
*  ties and hates ties. They'll integrate hit there back in there somehow. Nice. What's,
*  you're talking about greatness and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time. Can you
*  like reflect back and think what are some of the hardest, if not the hardest thing you've ever had
*  to do in your life? Well, you know, I think I've had a, had a bunch of things, you know, I've had
*  a lot of things not go my way. Um, you know, I've been incredibly fortunate. I've had a lot of things
*  go my way also. Um, but, uh, leaving, leaving team Lord urban in 2008, which I firmly believe
*  was the right thing to do. Um, is one of the, uh, uh, that was very difficult at the time,
*  not like, not a difficult choice, but it was, uh, because of why I was leaving. But, um,
*  psychologically, first of all, loss in general, leaving, yeah, team, a family of all kinds.
*  It doesn't matter what the circumstances. I didn't lose any friends, but I lost a lot of people. I
*  thought were my friends and I, uh, I lost training. I lost that. I'd also had like a really serious,
*  my wrist only does that. So like, uh, I had a really serious, uh, wrist surgery, like that.
*  I didn't know if I was going to be able to compete anymore. After that, I just got my brown belt.
*  That was, uh, it was a tough time, like, uh, psychologically, physically everything, but I
*  was very, very motivated to do my best and to push through it and to, uh, it was to carry on in a
*  positive direction, no matter what, in a different direction. And, uh,
*  Were you lonely? This is the thing about family, even if it's an abusive family, leaving
*  is tough. People are complicated. And even people that I, that I don't think very well of,
*  that I think on the whole, I don't think very well of, it's, it's unfair to paint them with one brush.
*  Um, you know, obviously there's greater and lesser examples of that, like the person we discussed
*  last time, who's an infinitely, you know, beyond almost anyone that we could ever imagine meeting
*  in our own personal lives. Yeah. Yeah. Bloody elbow. Yeah.
*  In terms of forgiveness and hate, I mean, do you, do you have hate in your heart for,
*  for people in your past for that process? No, I mean, there were definitely times when I've
*  been negatively motivated to prove people wrong or to accomplish things. And I think that
*  some of that is valuable if I'm in line, if I felt differently, I think particularly, uh,
*  I do really well in conflict. Um, I'm useless without the usual deadline thing. I'm useless.
*  Yeah. I'm like the chaos. I'm usually, I do. I'm useless. I'm antagonist. I like fighting.
*  I like competition. I like being pushed. I like feeling like if I don't play well,
*  I'm going to get hurt. I have no choice but to play well or play with everything I got at the
*  very least. And I guess I would say though, is, uh, you know, as I've gotten, um, you know, more time
*  and, you know, lived a little bit longer, you see, you know, various situations for, uh,
*  you know, you know, with increased, uh, increased color, I guess I would say increased clarity.
*  And, uh, you know, there are a lot of lessons to be learned even from, from times in history or bad
*  experience that we have. And the question is, can we take those lessons and move forward?
*  And that's again, what I think we're seeing in sometimes socially right now,
*  we're forgetting important lessons of the past and that's not good. Not saying, Hey,
*  I don't get why we, why we could be going in this direction or that I understand entirely, but,
*  Hey, let's not forget the lesson. So we don't have to learn them again because
*  that doesn't really serve anybody. And anyway, I guess I would say I'm thankful for all of the
*  experiences, difficult and otherwise mostly difficult. Honestly, most of the times I remember,
*  I'm thankful for every loss we've ever had, particularly the tough ones. I'm thankful for,
*  you know, for all the relationship. I've, many people have taught me many things and continue
*  to teach me many things. Some of whom are still some of my closest friends, some of whom are
*  people I really don't get along with at all. And some of whom are people I think really poorly of,
*  oh, there's not many of that last group. What I guess I would say is, uh, there's, there's been a
*  lot of things and opportunities to learn and, uh, you know, throughout that. And also it's not as
*  if I've never done made any mistakes myself. Now, again, there, there are magnitude differences.
*  I like to think, and I can definitely say that none of the mistakes that I've ever made have been
*  mistakes of intention. You know, I've screwed up a lot of things in my life, but I can confidently
*  and easily say that I've never had ill intent towards people as I've done it. So we sit there
*  and like, man, it's just the right thing. It's the right thing. And sometimes I've been wrong,
*  but, uh, you know, you never sit out with malicious intent. And I think that when I find that I think
*  people do things differently, when I do think that there is malicious intent, I have a difficult
*  time forgiving that. How does love win over hate? Ryan Hall in this world, we're talking about
*  social media. We're talking about forgiveness of, uh, some of the more complicated people in your
*  past. Uh, if we scale that to the entire world before the AI destroys us and the other, the
*  human race is lost to history. How do you think love wins over hate? Well, I like to preface this
*  by saying I tried to make pancakes the other day. Yes. Didn't work, but I'm happy to comment on this.
*  So, uh, basically, uh, I think like, I think most of the times that, that I can think of
*  that I've struggled, you know, it's, uh, and can, and the times that I've read about is being unable
*  to see the humanity in other people. And also even in sometimes our enemies and the people that have
*  done awful things and you go, what would allow people to do this, that, or the other? And that
*  doesn't forgive what they've done depending upon, you know, some things are forgivable, some things
*  are less so, but you want to understand why it's like to our knowledge, demons don't populate our
*  world. Neither do like literal angels walking around being actually perfect. A lot of times
*  the things that it's, I find it deeply amusing watching, you know, people hoisted by their own
*  batard on Twitter, even though it's gross and it's really unproductive, it's actually like equal
*  parts amusing and like awful because you're not, you're not happy that someone's being raked over
*  the coals, particularly unjustifiably. But it is funny when it's the exact same thing. They were
*  raking others over the coals for not like a week or two prior, and that's happened repeatedly and
*  will continue to happen. And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, you know, a, uh, prior, you know,
*  like a recognition of the humanity of others of that, all of us make mistakes, that it's difficult
*  to understand intention. I've had arguments with close friends of mine over text message where both
*  of us ended up super pissed because we were completely misreading what the tone, the intention
*  of what the other person was doing. And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn't, it's so
*  easy to, uh, ascribe the most negative possible, you know, the least charitable assessment of what
*  they're doing. And I think that that's such a dangerous way to live your life. And it's also
*  just a fruitless way to live your life. You know, it's one thing to go, Hey, why did you do that? I
*  was pissed. Did you, what did you do? You just, you did that to make yourself feel better. Like
*  you're damn right. I did. And have I done that plenty of times in my life? Yeah. I would lie.
*  If I said that I didn't, you know, uh, why did, why did you punch that guy in the face? He was
*  going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop. And then I gave warning and I'd put him on
*  his ass. I'm like, no, I'm not sorry. But then looking back now with years to sit on them, like,
*  do I understand why I did what I did? Absolutely. Would I like to respond differently now? Yeah, I
*  would, you know, and it doesn't mean that I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.
*  Doesn't mean understandable. Doesn't mean correct. Understandable doesn't mean that you go,
*  Oh yeah, that's great. You go, I could, I could see someone doing such a thing,
*  but I guess just wrecking, trying to understand and see the humanity in others.
*  Cause if I can't see the humanity in others, how can I see it in myself? And also, you know,
*  how am I meant to interact with everyone? As, as you said, whether, you know, even if we're a society
*  of individuals for at least for the time being, hopefully, you know, in perpetuity, we still come
*  together as a whole and watching it's weird. Like you said, it's, it's, if I only ask why once I
*  start with stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, leave me the fuck alone. You're like, okay,
*  that's fine, Ryan, but that's easy for you to say living in a society that doesn't actually function
*  like that. So it's a little bit cheap. But if I recognize that that's step one is I don't hurt you
*  and you don't hurt me, but then we go, well, but how can I help you? That's step two. And then it
*  goes way beyond that and a lot further than I've thought about it. But I guess what I would just
*  say is again, recognition of the humanity and others and that we all have different strengths.
*  We all have different weaknesses and it's, he can never really be sure where the other person's
*  coming from. But if we approach things charitably as charitably as we would hope others would
*  approach us, I think we'll do a lot better. And I guess one thing that I read that I liked that I
*  thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing was everyone is a great, uh, you know, jury or
*  rather, I'm sorry, a great lawyer for themselves and a judge for others. And I think that's a
*  terrible way to live life, even if it's an understandable one. Yeah. I don't know.
*  Probably flipping that is the right way to live. Being, uh, being constantly judgmental of yourself
*  and a defender of others. And that results ultimately in interaction that deescalates
*  versus escalates. Right. Yeah. And you can, you can, we can all live in a world like that. And
*  sometimes you're like, Hey man, people that deserve punishment won't get it. Like, okay, hey,
*  what do they say? Better to have, you know, 10 guilty people go free than one innocent person,
*  you know, burn. And ultimately that is, I think that is a better world than the other way around.
*  And if all else fails, uh, join the team that builds the AI that kills all humans.
*  Yeah, obviously. I mean, if you have to be on a team, pick the winning team,
*  what that's been the, uh, that's my hiring pitch. Actually, it's a good hiring pitch.
*  You want to be on the team that doesn't die during the great apocalypse. Not immediately.
*  You want to be on the one that that's a, you know, eventually long suffering and stepped on.
*  Right. Yeah. Life is suffering. Ryan Hall. This was an amazing conversation. I really enjoyed
*  talking to you. I could probably talk to you for many more hours. I hope I do as well. Ryan,
*  I love you buddy. This was a great conversation. Thanks for talking to me. Thank you so much for

*  Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my
*  fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the
*  inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone. There will be nothing. Only I will remain.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
