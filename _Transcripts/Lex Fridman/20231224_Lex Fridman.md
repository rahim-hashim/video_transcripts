# Teddy Atlas: Mike Tyson, Cus D'Amato, Boxing, Loyalty, Fear & Greatness | Lex Fridman Podcast #406
**Lex Fridman:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVx9IB_U9X4)
*  That's all that matters, that he got there, that he got to the place to act like a fighter,
*  to do what we want him to do, to be ready to persevere, to go beyond the comfort level,
*  to do another round.
*  He didn't want to, Dan Wrighty didn't want to, but he knew we want him to, and he knew
*  in order to pass the test, he had to do it.
*  He goes, now it's going to be your job to get him in the gym, make him mentally stronger,
*  make him face things, and teach him how to slip punches, and create holes, and fill those
*  freaking holes with devastating punches.
*  With punches with bad intentions.
*  The following is a conversation with Teddy Atlas, a legendary and at times controversial
*  boxing trainer and commentator.
*  When I was going to this conversation with Teddy, I was ready to talk boxing, styles,
*  matches, techniques, tactics, and his analysis of individual fighters like Mike Tyson, Michael
*  Moore, Klitschko, Usyk, Pawekkin, Lomachenko, Triple G, Canelo, Muhammad Ali, Chagre, Leonard,
*  Hagler, Duran, Floyd, and on and on and on.
*  Like I said, I came ready to talk boxing, but I stayed for something even bigger, the
*  Shakespearean human story of Teddy Atlas, Custamato, and Mike Tyson.
*  It's a story about loyalty, betrayal, fear, and greatness.
*  It's a story where nobody is perfect and everybody is human.
*  To summarize, in the early 80s, young trainer Teddy Atlas worked with his mentor Custamato
*  in training the young boxing prodigy, now a boxing legend, Mike Tyson.
*  Mike was a troubled youth, arrested over 40 times, and at age 15, he was sexually inappropriate
*  with Teddy's 11-year-old niece.
*  In response to this, Teddy put a .38 caliber handgun to Tyson's ear and told him to never
*  touch his family again or he would kill him if he did.
*  For this, Custamato kicked Teddy out.
*  Why?
*  Well, that's complicated.
*  In part, I think, to help minimize the chance of Mike Tyson, who Cust legally adopted, will
*  be taken away by the state, and with him, the dream of developing one of the greatest
*  boxers of all time.
*  Of course, that summary doesn't capture the full complexity of human nature and human
*  drama involved here.
*  For that, you have to listen to this conversation, the things said and the things left unsaid,
*  the pain in Teddy's voice, the contradictions of love and anger that permeate his stories
*  and his philosophy on life.
*  Like I said, I came to talk about boxing and stayed to talk about life.
*  This conversation will stay with me for a long time.
*  The people close to you, the people you trust, the people you love are everything.
*  And if they betray you and break your heart, forgive them.
*  Forgive yourself and try again.
*  Happy holidays, everyone.
*  I love you all.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

*  And now, dear friends, here's Teddy Atlas.
*  You wrote in the book that your father had a big influence on your life.
*  What lessons have you learned about life from your father?
*  When you ask that question, you know, I remember Customato when I was with him up in Gatsby
*  for all those years.
*  He used to say to me, Teddy, you learn through osmosis.
*  I believe that's true to that if I know what osmosis is.
*  But it sounds good.
*  But I learned through osmosis with my father.
*  He wasn't a big talker.
*  He was a doer.
*  And when you're around someone who lives a certain kind of life and does certain things,
*  it penetrates.
*  He was a doctor.
*  I'm going to sound like an idiot right now because I'm being a son.
*  But he was the greatest diagnostic doctor.
*  I mean, if I say I ever knew, what's that mean?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Are you a doctor?
*  You know what I mean?
*  What does that mean?
*  But other people have told me this.
*  Like just legendary stories.
*  He would do house calls and help people.
*  And like you said, a lot of people have spoken about the impact he's had on their life.
*  He built two hospitals.
*  And he built a hospital before the Verosado Bridge in New York connecting Brooklyn to
*  Staten Island.
*  And he built it so people could get proper hospital care that couldn't afford it, period.
*  And everybody looked at him as eccentric.
*  Yeah, nice.
*  Yeah, because he would literally sneak patients, not sneak them in.
*  He was Dr. Atlas.
*  He could do what he wanted to a certain extent.
*  But he would bring patients in without administering, putting through administration.
*  So there was no charge because they didn't have anything.
*  There were street people.
*  I remember being, my only way to be with my father was to go on house calls or to go to
*  the office.
*  And so I went on house calls with him.
*  And he did house calls, by the way, too.
*  He was 80.
*  And three dollars.
*  I mean, it was better than like McDonald's.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I mean, the deal.
*  Three dollars and you got medicine, you got everything.
*  But he used to, right around the holidays, there was just certain things that I didn't
*  understand but I understood later where we would just drive certain areas and he just
*  all of a sudden open his door and he would pick up these homes and, you know, I'm 10
*  years old.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, move over and move over, you know.
*  It's just you, him and a homeless guy.
*  A couple.
*  Yeah, a couple.
*  Yeah, whatever he can fit in.
*  Three, four, you know, whatever it was.
*  That's a big heart.
*  And then he took him to the hospital, dropped him off.
*  So you know, I would ask questions after it was all over.
*  I'd say, Dad, they're sick.
*  He goes, well, not in a way.
*  Well, you put them in the hospital.
*  So he said, yeah, and he tried to explain things to me.
*  You know, he would try.
*  He didn't talk much unless you asked him something.
*  That kind of works.
*  And, you know, don't talk unless someone asks you something.
*  And he explained to me that he said, I said, well, why are you putting them in the hospital?
*  And, you know, and of course the sickness was they were alcoholics.
*  But why are you putting them?
*  He's, it wasn't an alcohol rehab, you know.
*  And it wasn't for the purpose to dry out.
*  He wasn't trying to cure them.
*  Let's put that for before we anoint him for sainthood, you know, like by Teddy Atlas.
*  So I was like, we finally get to the point.
*  Why you put them in there?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, because it's the holidays.
*  All right.
*  Why you put them in there?
*  Well, the holidays, you know, are good for certain people and bad for others.
*  And it was always before the holidays.
*  It was before Christmas or whatever.
*  And New Year's, whatever.
*  And so I said, why?
*  And he said, because they remind people, certain people, of what they don't have.
*  That other people enjoy the holidays because of what they have.
*  Family, you know, whatever.
*  And it reminds them their mind is that.
*  That's pretty profound.
*  Yeah.
*  And then.
*  I don't remember because he didn't use the word suicide, but I got it.
*  Like he basically I forget how he said it, but like I just got it.
*  I don't know how I got it.
*  I don't know.
*  But I just got it like so they don't hurt themselves.
*  That's what came across in every way.
*  I don't think he ever articulated that I ever verbalized that.
*  But yeah, they don't hurt themselves.
*  So and well, how does that work?
*  Well, it just basically they're going to be around people that are going to be alone.
*  They're going to be around people.
*  They're going to get fed.
*  They're going to be warm.
*  Right.
*  And it's going to be for three days, two, three days, whatever.
*  And basically it's a bridge.
*  So the funny thing is a 10 year old, I wanted to I want to be connected to.
*  So I enlisted myself in the chop when he used to drop them off.
*  He would take them and get them in.
*  Right.
*  And.
*  And then the thing that I know, again, he didn't say none, but you notice things.
*  And if you care enough, you don't you don't know there's nothing if you don't care.
*  But if you can't, it's important you notice.
*  And this guy was important to me.
*  I just was I didn't know what a hero was.
*  No clue.
*  I love Mickey Mano.
*  I love Willie Mays.
*  I loved I love Muhammad Ali.
*  I I never ever connected with my mind as heroes.
*  Never.
*  My father.
*  I didn't connect it that way, but he looking back now, looking back, he was he was my first
*  connection to a hero.
*  The two of you ever talk about how much you love each other.
*  So one thing is one thing that was not allowed.
*  The greatest memory I have, my father showing me love was we were down in Florida at an
*  airport and and we were I was born in Miami.
*  Don't ask why I was passing through.
*  And the rest of my family is born in New York.
*  So now.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I was supposed to go back home.
*  Right.
*  And I wanted to stay with my mother for whatever reason.
*  And so he you know, he of course conceded to it.
*  And he's OK, you know, whatever.
*  And very quiet.
*  And there's a man who never showed emotion to anyone.
*  I mean, for the most, you know, well, all of a sudden.
*  He just turned, kissed me on the forehead and left.
*  And I was I was like.
*  That's different. Yeah, you still remember that.
*  Yeah, like, that's weird.
*  You lost them 30 years ago.
*  How did that change you?
*  It made me realize that some of the deals I used to make for God
*  were unrealistic.
*  When I was a kid, I used to make deals with God.
*  Let me die before my father.
*  And then, you know, you get older, you have kids, you're blessed.
*  Why did you make that deal?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, you know, I'm not going to lie.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like.
*  Thank you for not taking me up on it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, yeah, you miss them.
*  I miss them in moments when I'd like to know what to do.
*  And, you know, I remember when I would drive for them on the house calls,
*  he didn't listen to music.
*  He was a guy, he read books to his...
*  When he got older, he read books
*  to Blood Fells was Broken His Eyes.
*  He only read nonfiction books, science.
*  He loved science, wars, generals.
*  I mean, I cheated on a couple of book reports because I didn't do
*  the reading of the book.
*  The night before, I had a freaking book report to put in that.
*  I got a book report to do on the War of Stalingrad.
*  Really, the War of Stalingrad.
*  And who the freak could tell you where you get an A?
*  I got an A.
*  Yeah.
*  I just wrote what he told me.
*  He told me generals, he told me times, he told me strategy.
*  He told me about the winter that came and destroyed the Germans.
*  And the Soviets were tougher than the Germans.
*  And, you know, the Germans picked on the wrong opponent.
*  I was already in the boxing business.
*  I didn't even know it.
*  I didn't even know it.
*  Matchmaking, very important.
*  They mismatched.
*  They made a mistake with picking the opponent.
*  And so when we would be driving in the car,
*  my father would be in a trance.
*  And dad, he wasn't ignoring me at all.
*  He was just with his thoughts.
*  He was wherever.
*  He wasn't even here on the radio no more.
*  I always wondered where he was.
*  I did. So I asked him one day.
*  And just so we're driving, I said, I want to know.
*  So I said, dad, what do you think when you're basically in this place
*  that I know you're somewhere?
*  What do you, where are you?
*  What do you see?
*  I actually said, what do you see?
*  And he said to me,
*  I see what could be.
*  I see what could be.
*  And I'm like, oh,
*  what?
*  I got to ask you, when did you discover boxing?
*  What?
*  When did you first fall in love with boxing?
*  When it saved me.
*  How did it save you?
*  I was I was a stupid, violent kid
*  that was angry, not exactly know why he was angry.
*  I'd fit in real good in today's society
*  because there's a lot of angry kids out there that I don't think they know
*  why they're angry.
*  I was I was just out there getting fights and I got this stupid thing from that.
*  Can you tell the story of how you got that?
*  I was just running around doing stupid things, bad things.
*  I heard people, some people physically, but I heard I heard my my my family.
*  You know, that's BS.
*  You only hurt yourself.
*  You know, that's a good way of, you know, alibi in it.
*  Um, you know, just put it at some point, the truth usually finds its way.
*  I'd like it to look like I was just hurt myself, or was it?
*  Obviously. So I was just out on the streets
*  with kids that didn't grow up in the neighborhood.
*  I grew up, I grew up in a neighborhood where father was a doctor.
*  And I walked down the street.
*  The funny thing was down, down the hill was a very tough neighborhood
*  called Stapleton.
*  And most of the people down there on the corners
*  wish they could get up to hell.
*  And I wished I could get down the hill.
*  So I went down the hill
*  and I hung out with all these friends that became lifelong friends.
*  And I gravitated to that because I figured out later a little bit.
*  But, you know, I wanted family.
*  We were destroying it. Family.
*  We were, you know, my father was a doctor.
*  He didn't have time for nothing but being a doctor.
*  You know, I think when you created something, you sacrifice something too.
*  You know, when you really created something so great that maybe God made you great
*  and and you're too great for your own good.
*  And and I don't know, it took me to these stupid,
*  dangerous places, dangerous for me, but dangerous for other people, too,
*  because I got to the point where I was doing robberies on the street.
*  I was I was fighting everybody.
*  And and you know what the most dangerous part about it was?
*  And I came to this realization on my own or by myself.
*  I figured out I was really as dangerous.
*  You know, these kids from the project, someone they got nothing.
*  First of all, I learned you don't have to be poor to be poor.
*  You don't have to be deprived of certain things to be deprived.
*  And because you at least think you're deprived.
*  And I was poor in a way that I didn't have the only thing I wanted to have him.
*  So here I here I am where I'm out there doing these things.
*  And what made me more I was more dangerous than some of these psychopaths.
*  Well, I was a psychopath, too, I guess, the way it was behaving.
*  But some of these psychopaths, they really had nothing.
*  You know, really, you know, they obviously would kill you.
*  I was dangerous in almost the same way, but for a different reason.
*  I know it's ridiculous what I'm about to tell you, but I figured it out.
*  Because I felt it. I thought I was on a righteous path.
*  I thought I had a right.
*  Because it was going to get me my father back.
*  Why? Why?
*  I mean, you know, you're a scientist.
*  You couldn't figure this one out because.
*  All the people that had them were injured people, fractured people,
*  screwed up people in some ways, but but hurt damaged people.
*  So if I get damaged. I get them.
*  So I was on a crusade, really a righteous crusade where I thought it was OK.
*  I had permission.
*  I had permission to do these terrible things, quite frankly,
*  and to fight everyone and do I.
*  And then it came almost to a crash
*  of doing all that, you know, winding up in Rikers Island like an idiot.
*  Not understanding the damage I did to this poor man that, you know, he
*  he was a great doctor and he's got to see his son and hear about,
*  you know what I mean? Like, God.
*  I was out on that day, you know, with the guys that I grew up with now,
*  you know, the guys from the projects from the as I described.
*  And I was with one of them who he's dead now.
*  So I was I was with him and we were
*  we were in a neighborhood, the neighborhood we grew up that I hung out.
*  And he grew up in Billy.
*  He came from the from the project.
*  And we got into a thing where we could somebody comes off.
*  We cut them off, you know, jumped out to fight.
*  And, you know, it
*  turned out there's like five or six of them and two of us.
*  And, you know, we fought,
*  you know, right on the side, right there,
*  only about a block from where I used to hang out.
*  And maybe a block and a half and right in front of like a Spanish bodega.
*  And it really does happen in slow motion.
*  I actually saw the guy was fighting the guys that that I had to fight.
*  And then all of a sudden, I was able to get one guy out of the way a little bit.
*  And I really I noticed the guy go into his pocket.
*  And I knew why he was going in his pocket, you know, and.
*  When he came out of his pocket, I knew what it was right away.
*  It was weird because in the neighborhood guys used to hang out.
*  They were they went to this, you know, they get into fads like right on the streets.
*  And they went to at that time, they went to this cheap knife.
*  But it was they thought it was we thought it was cool.
*  It was a double seven.
*  And and and the cool thing was whatever
*  was that you could flick it, you can learn.
*  And I learned how to flick, you know, but I never carried a knife.
*  But but when my friends would have it, I would just
*  you learn how you could flick it open, not a switchblade,
*  but flick it with your wrist.
*  And I was like, here I am in the middle, just freaking fight.
*  And all of a sudden, oh, it's a double seven, you know.
*  And and so I'm like,
*  I you got to make a decision, you know, and.
*  I got to split.
*  I can either not do nothing, which
*  wasn't didn't seem like a great, you know,
*  a great option.
*  I couldn't run away.
*  Why not?
*  Because you got to live with yourself afterwards,
*  and and and that's more difficult to live with
*  than whatever it is at that second, because that don't go away.
*  You couldn't live with yourself running away.
*  It just don't go away.
*  I think I'm not going to do being brave.
*  Yeah, and then none of the do being brave.
*  Really, it's got to do with just common sense in life that
*  for me, whatever you deal with, it's over.
*  It's done like, like, OK, deal with it.
*  Good or bad, whatever.
*  But you you do that, you know, that other thing is you can't.
*  You that never that never ends.
*  This thing ends.
*  Memory of you being, let's say, a coward in that moment.
*  That never ends.
*  The only thing I had at that point in my life
*  in my stupid mind.
*  Was a reputation that I would do, stand up to certain things.
*  That was like for me was was worth something, whatever,
*  because I didn't feel any worth to anything else.
*  That was the only thing I felt a connection of worth to.
*  So I stood your ground.
*  So I say, no, I made a decision.
*  Yes, I still my grandpa.
*  I I actually things do slow down.
*  They do. And I actually said it's a double seven.
*  He's got to flick it.
*  And I didn't say, but he's got to flick it.
*  I got a split second either.
*  Like I said, either I do nothing, whatever, or I get to him before he gets it.
*  Flick. I went to get to him before he got flicked.
*  And I and I just as I got close to right, I did him a favor.
*  I walked right into a counterpunch.
*  Yeah. Because I cooperated with him.
*  I went right to him.
*  And and just as I he he he practiced more than I did with the double seven,
*  apparently, because he was like, well, well, well, well.
*  And and. Anyway.
*  What did you think?
*  What did you think that happened?
*  I was all slow motion.
*  Did you think he might die?
*  Yeah. Well, not immediately.
*  Took me a minute.
*  I'm a slow learner.
*  I put my hand up.
*  Right, wouldn't you? I guess so.
*  And it went into my face. Yeah.
*  And that was it. It was gooey.
*  It was warm and gooey.
*  And I was like.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what this means, but I don't want to know.
*  But I think I know. And and.
*  And.
*  Do you think about your dad in that moment?
*  No, you know, what I thought about him was.
*  You don't know who anyone is into that test, and I learned that
*  because she used to tell me, but I learned it.
*  He said, I remember one time because I was a 17, 18 year old kid up there
*  and, you know, thought I was whatever I thought I was.
*  And he said, you got a lot of friends.
*  And I said, yeah, because, you know, I was on the street
*  of hanging out with 100 kids at night sometimes on the street corner.
*  So I was like.
*  I don't know too many people that hung out with 100 kids on the street
*  on a corner on a Friday, Saturday night.
*  And I was like, yeah, I got a lot of friends.
*  He goes, really?
*  Yeah, really? He said.
*  How about if I told you, you might not have any?
*  Most likely, you don't have any.
*  And he goes, and then he just started this thing.
*  He said, everyone's got to be tested. You.
*  Me, everyone, because you don't know about nobody to their test.
*  Because you know nothing.
*  Because you know nothing until you know until something happens
*  to test if they were really a friend.
*  And they told me this story about a guy, a guy came to him and he was upset.
*  Who are you upset about?
*  He goes, I'm upset because I I just I just lost a friend.
*  You know, after 20 years of friendship, we're not friends no more.
*  So because looks at me goes.
*  May I ask you a question, what made you think you have a friend's room?
*  Now the guy gets insulted because did you hear me?
*  Because I just told you 20 years I've been friends with this guy.
*  Why would you say that to me?
*  He said, well, I'll say it again.
*  What makes you think he was your friend? He goes.
*  What ever happened in the 20 years other than chasing girls?
*  Figured that one out fast.
*  Chasing girls and drinking together
*  and whatever else you're doing out on the street,
*  what ever gave you the inclination that.
*  He was a friend.
*  He goes, what ever.
*  When did he risk himself to be your friend?
*  When was it dangerous to be your friend?
*  When was friendship tested?
*  When was it uncomfortable to be your friend?
*  And you know what the guy said?
*  You can figure out your scientist, he said.
*  He said today. Yeah.
*  And and and today came for me and today, today, today, today
*  kept coming for me today.
*  And and that day, my friend Billy had turned out
*  while I was fighting these whatever five, six guys.
*  And where was Billy? He was on the roof.
*  He was on the roof.
*  He was on the roof. He was my best friend.
*  And so anyway, they take me to the hospital.
*  And here's the thing with my father.
*  But one thing Billy did do for me when he got off the roof.
*  Thank God he did.
*  He he dragged me, dragged me into this bodega,
*  laid me on the floor and started putting towels.
*  Right. And the towels, I vaguely remember this.
*  They filled up with blood.
*  I mean, completely like drenched, like like you put them under a shower.
*  And and I heard the bodega owner screaming,
*  screaming, you know, like, well, you know, whatever.
*  And everyone's screaming in this chaos.
*  And I'm like, I don't know. I'm calm. Weird.
*  I'm like, real calm.
*  And I'm I'm just in this place.
*  Things calm.
*  And all of a sudden, I hear Billy, he's screaming,
*  call the call the ambulance, call them.
*  You know, and nobody's doing none. Everyone's frozen.
*  I'm starting to understand already.
*  People get frozen in situations.
*  People, the fear, fear, fear, fear, fear,
*  just paralyzes people.
*  And and I was going into a fear business.
*  I was learning. I was learning.
*  I was getting a learning early PhD.
*  And and he fear.
*  Yeah. And all of a sudden, genius, Billy, genius, really
*  street kid. Yeah.
*  He jumps up on a frigging counter, jumps over the counter,
*  grabs the phone, calls 911, says a cop's been shot
*  and forget about it.
*  It was crazy.
*  All I remember after that, I tell you a couple of things.
*  I remember lights
*  being put onto a stretcher, bounced around, you know,
*  rushed. I felt everyone's anxiety except mine.
*  I had none, but I felt everyone's anxiety.
*  Everyone's fear.
*  Like it was all around me. It was like, oh, this is interesting.
*  It's kind of I know that's stupid, but like, well, this is interesting.
*  You really have an eye for fear. That's fascinating.
*  You're really studying it.
*  Well, they I had no choice.
*  I got introduced in a crash course and they they put me in ambulance
*  and this is what I remember to your point.
*  I'm sorry it took so long to get to it.
*  I am. Although I'll probably do it again before this conversation is over.
*  But I journey.
*  Yeah, I will get there. We'll get there, pops.
*  So I I hear the cops.
*  They were I we might lose them.
*  And I'm like laughing to myself.
*  I'm not laughing because I'm not again.
*  I'm not John Wayne.
*  John Wayne would have laughed, but I'm like, hey, lose.
*  You guys are stupid.
*  You know, I didn't say that.
*  But I'm like, lose me.
*  My father's the greatest doctor in the freaking world.
*  Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.
*  You people, you people all up tight and whacked out here with fear.
*  And there's nothing to worry about.
*  Dr. Atlas is my father.
*  So anyway, so they're they're they're taking me to the and they said,
*  we don't have time. I hear a couple of things I remember.
*  Don't have time.
*  Take them to and they take me to the US Public Health Hospital.
*  Marine Hospital was called at the time, but US Public Health.
*  And it's in Stapleton, so it's close. Thank God.
*  So they're taking me and I hear them on the radio, you know,
*  but saying this stuff about we got to we got to move, we got to move.
*  And I start talking.
*  And they're telling me, don't talk.
*  But I like to talk a lot, you know, and so
*  again, fear, there's no fear.
*  But a fear has been removed.
*  It's the only time you're really free in life.
*  And I know that sounds absurd, but really, it is.
*  It's the only time you're really free in life.
*  I was when you close to death,
*  when you're devoid of of of things that that normally hold you back,
*  that normally influence you in ways that that, you know, that are
*  not of the influence that always positive influence where you're
*  where you're in a pure place, where you're you're in a purely free place
*  from all inhibitions, from fear, from anxiety, from from joy.
*  Joy can screw you up.
*  And you're free from all these things.
*  And I'm in this place just in the back of an ambulance.
*  You're free. Yeah.
*  I'm like, I said, just get me the doctor atlas.
*  And they say, we don't have time.
*  No, no, no, no, no. You don't.
*  You have to get Dr. Atlas.
*  You have to get him. This was the dammit.
*  This was so, you know what I mean?
*  I finally freaking hit the number and I'm not getting paid.
*  And then all of a sudden, I'm out.
*  I said, well, I think it was four hundred, two hundred inside,
*  two hundred outside, whatever it was.
*  A lot. And look, after after after 50,
*  the number doesn't matter no more.
*  I don't whatever 60, 70, 80, 90, whatever.
*  You know, so I was fortunate.
*  I was fortunate.
*  And of course, they I was fortunate.
*  They told me afterwards that miss my jugular literally by like
*  like a centimeter.
*  I mean, whatever.
*  And so then I'm then we wouldn't be having this conversation, obviously.
*  I'm glad you made it. Yeah.
*  I'm kind of glad, too.
*  And then it just missed my eye, which thank God.
*  It's bad enough. I have a scar.
*  Match me with a patch.
*  I mean, I mean, it's enough that I get this freaking thing.
*  And and look, it goes all the way.
*  You know, I mean, it's you know, it's pretty long.
*  And.
*  I don't know, I was out and then somehow
*  I sensed like they had the curtain closed, you know,
*  and it's amazing how vivid this is.
*  And the curtains close and I see a shadow.
*  I felt the presence.
*  I did. And I felt him.
*  He's a he's a powerful guy.
*  And I felt him.
*  And I just see like a shadow, you know, and all of a sudden
*  the curtain gets pushed back.
*  And I can't really see it's dark and, you know, out of it,
*  but not completely out of it.
*  And pushes the curtain back, comes in.
*  Comes in.
*  And his hand, even though it's all bandaged, you know, whatever.
*  But his hand surveys.
*  It felt safe.
*  And it felt it felt warm and safe.
*  I was happy.
*  And he got there, you know, he say something.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Remember, I gave you a little bit of introduction to my father.
*  You know him now a little bit, right?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you say about the job?
*  He just said this is what he said.
*  I remember to this day what he said.
*  Yeah, that that I do remember.
*  I know it was six or five people, but this I do remember. Yeah.
*  He said they did a good job.
*  You're going to have a scar the rest of your life.
*  And he left.
*  Oh, man, they did a good job.
*  You mentioned custom custom model legendary trainer,
*  and you also mentioned it turned out he really cared about you
*  in the book you write about a testimony he gave.
*  I was hoping I could read it because it speaks to your character,
*  speaks to his. It's just powerful.
*  The testimony goes, Your Honor, I realize you might not know much about me,
*  but I spent my whole life developing young men as a boxing manager.
*  I trained in boxing.
*  As a boxing manager, I trained two world champions,
*  heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and light heavyweight champion Jose Torres.
*  I've also helped a lot of other young boys straighten out their lives
*  and build character.
*  I know things about Teddy Atlas.
*  This court doesn't know things you won't find on his arrest record.
*  This boy's character, he has loyalty.
*  He'll hurt himself before he led down a friend.
*  These qualities are rare and they shouldn't be lost.
*  He's made mistakes.
*  We've all made mistakes, but I've come to know this boy.
*  And if we lose him, we'll be losing someone who could help a lot of people.
*  Please don't take this young boy's future away.
*  It could be someone special.
*  Let's not lose him. Please.
*  Those are powerful words from a powerful man.
*  What have you learned about life from from Mr.
*  Kusumato?
*  He gave me a quote and he drilled into my head.
*  I became his guy, you know, he loved me.
*  I loved him.
*  He he said to me.
*  Teddy.
*  No matter what a man says
*  is what he does in the end that he intended to do all along.
*  That's why I learned from Kusumato.
*  That's BS.
*  And.
*  A lot of people.
*  Say things you just have to give them a minute to.
*  Let them show you eventually.
*  What they really meant by it.
*  I also learned from him that.
*  Everyone's afraid.
*  Because this way of saying
*  of another great saying, you'll get kick out this
*  anyone who's in a situation where fear should be prevalent,
*  where fear is actually necessary to survive the situation.
*  Anyone who says that they're not afraid, they're one of two things.
*  They're either a liar or they should go to a doctor.
*  Find out what the fix wrong with them.
*  He was right about that.
*  You know.
*  We live in a taboo society where that word to a certain extent
*  is taboo because it invokes weakness.
*  You know, we we.
*  We are just layers of what we
*  saw and learned since we were kids.
*  We all are products of those layers.
*  I learned that on my own, but for some help at the end of the day.
*  You know.
*  Fear.
*  People will find their way of avoiding that term,
*  so they use the word anxiety.
*  They use the word, you know, butterflies.
*  Apprehension, you know.
*  Many of them write words.
*  I find all those other words to be cousins of fear.
*  And fear.
*  Fear causes a lot of things in life.
*  It causes a lot of problems, and it also solves a lot of problems.
*  Without it, we couldn't be great.
*  If we are great, we ever have a chance to be great
*  or at least to aspire to be great.
*  How does fear connect to greatness?
*  That's a that's a profound statement.
*  Without fear, we wouldn't be able to be great.
*  And you couldn't be great without fear because
*  fear allows you to be.
*  Brave.
*  The most important word for me in this whole,
*  you know, conversation, right, neighborhood would be selfishness
*  and allows you to be for a moment less selfish.
*  One of the things I learned, I guess, partly on my own.
*  Everyone thinks my greatest teacher was Cuss.
*  He was a great teacher, mentor.
*  My greatest teacher was my father, the one who never talked.
*  And I realized one of the things to be better towards great
*  is if you can submit less than we submit.
*  See, one of the things that I'm afraid of, one of the things
*  I was always quitting in my business, it's kind of not a good thing.
*  Every business, I think.
*  Yours, yours is just more clear.
*  Yeah, it hurts more.
*  In the moment, at least.
*  Yeah, in the moment.
*  You're right.
*  100 percent, because some things hurt for a long time afterwards.
*  And something like regret.
*  Regret is the worst thing in the world because it's the solitary sentence.
*  And that's a powerful phrase.
*  Regret is a solitary sentence.
*  So, I you're full of good lines.
*  You know, it wasn't easy to to to accumulate them.
*  And it was a little bit hurtful.
*  It was a little bit hurtful.
*  But so submit less because we submit every day.
*  And if we can get to a place where we submit or compromise ourselves less,
*  we'll get to a better place.
*  You know, again, one of the one of the words for me that attaches
*  to things that give you that wind up hurting you in life
*  and have hurt me in life.
*  One of those boogie men words is the word of convenience.
*  That's attached to everything.
*  You know, people people disappoint you, not because they want to disappoint you
*  or let you down or betray you because they want to betray you.
*  They do it because it's more convenient to do than the other thing.
*  An old man once told me, he said to me,
*  I was trying to I was trying to rationalize something.
*  I was trying to make someone excuse for something.
*  I was trying to make myself better than I was.
*  I was trying to say it was OK.
*  And and he just looked at me and he he liked me.
*  And he said, Teddy,
*  there ain't no such thing as being a little pregnant.
*  I was like, yeah, because you're pregnant or you're not pregnant.
*  Either you're real or you're not,
*  either you're, you know, truthful or you're not truthful.
*  Either you're tough or you're not tough.
*  Either you're either you're, you know, committed or you're not committed.
*  Either you're in or you're out.
*  That applies to a lot of things.
*  Yeah. Including loyalty.
*  That's quite a statement.
*  But the life of humanity for me is loyalty.
*  It's what goes through the veins of
*  it's what goes through the veins of, you know,
*  everything has to have some veins in some form.
*  And if humanity has veins, what runs through the veins of humanity
*  instead of blood to keep it alive is loyalty without loyalty.
*  Without loyalty, we're dead.
*  We're freaking walk with vessels.
*  I never understood what a ghost ship was.
*  You know what? As I got older, I know what a ghost ship is.
*  It's people, people that empty.
*  They got no loyalty.
*  Therefore, they got no humanity.
*  Therefore, they get nothing.
*  Therefore, freak them, freak them, because and you know why they don't have loyalty?
*  Convenience. And you know why?
*  Because it takes it's hard to be loyal.
*  It's actually hard.
*  I'll be a son of a gun.
*  Yeah, you're telling me, yeah, it sounds great.
*  Give it to me. Give it to me.
*  Paint me with it. Yeah, it's great.
*  Yeah, I'm loyal. Yeah, I'm great.
*  Yeah, this is good. I'm ready. I'm on that team.
*  I'm ready. Put me in, coach. I'm ready.
*  OK, now you have to you're going to have to get hurt here.
*  What do you mean get hurt?
*  Oh, it's going to be painful.
*  I mean, to be loyal, you know, you're going to be in danger
*  because the person that you committed to your loyalty to for a reason,
*  because obviously you did something in your life, whatever, whatever.
*  You're actually going to get hurt to be loyal to him.
*  You're actually going to hold on a minute.
*  Wait, hold on a minute, coach.
*  Hold on. Call time out here.
*  Let me think about this, coach.
*  I might need more practice.
*  I'm not ready for the game.
*  I'm not ready to go in the game yet.
*  Give me a little more practice, coach.
*  And it hurts to be loyal.
*  It freaking hurts.
*  But without loyalty, we're ghost ships.
*  We got no strength.
*  We got nothing.
*  We got nothing. We got we got nothing.
*  I agree with you in a deep fundamental sense, but there is
*  pain that comes with that.
*  I have to ask you to
*  introspect on this part of your life
*  because of your value for loyalty.
*  As people know, you and custom auto
*  trained young Mike Tyson
*  and the interaction there
*  between the three of you led to the three of you parting ways.
*  Given your value for loyalty, can you tell the full story
*  of what led up to this?
*  And maybe. The pain you felt.
*  From that.
*  I guess it was the second time in my life I felt betrayed.
*  The first time was when I.
*  I was whatever young 17 and I got arrested.
*  I was with all these older guys, tough guys, whatever.
*  And supposedly.
*  And I was with all these older guys, tough guys, whatever.
*  And supposedly.
*  And the detective separated us.
*  That's what they do.
*  And, you know, they they asked me who did whatever,
*  whose gun this that, you know, all that.
*  The particulars of obviously what we did.
*  And, you know, it was me.
*  And I said, you sure you don't want to change that, you want it?
*  Because your friends changed it.
*  And and these cops, they were nasty,
*  but they were cops, they were the way, you know, you're going to wind up
*  in Rikers with and they're going to be doing this to you.
*  And I won't even say the things because then why say them?
*  You know, figure it out.
*  But, you know, they're trying to get what they're trying to get.
*  And, you know, you want to change it?
*  And no.
*  And but I felt very betrayed, you know,
*  and especially when I was standing in the cell
*  and Rikers looking at the airplanes, leave LaGuardia Airport
*  and then hoping I was on one.
*  You know, I was making like a deal with God that let me be on one of those planes
*  and let it crash.
*  I'll take a shot.
*  Was part of you proud that you didn't give up your friends?
*  No, because I didn't understand what proud was.
*  I didn't understand nothing.
*  I just understood that rules are rules.
*  You're just loyal. And that's it.
*  I didn't even know there was an option.
*  I didn't think I know the cops said you could do this, but there was no option.
*  My father never had an option.
*  But the betrayal, the private betrayal was like.
*  And so when because.
*  We were partners, me and cause
*  because we retired.
*  This stupid kid goes up there and all of a sudden I start training fighters.
*  First, I want the gloves because put me in the gloves.
*  I want the gloves that I had injury, whatever.
*  But bottom line is, I still want to fight.
*  I want to turn pro. I want to fight.
*  That was the plan. And.
*  And because I had a different plan.
*  Because because it was like you can't and he had to set up a little bit, whatever,
*  without getting into it, he did me a favor.
*  And I like to think he knew he was doing me a favor.
*  And you know what? I do think he was.
*  He was doing himself a little bit, one, too.
*  But but he was doing for the greater cause because he believed
*  in this thing of boxing.
*  He believed that it changed lives.
*  He believed that it was worthwhile.
*  He believed that there was a power to it beyond the left hook.
*  The big picture of box. Yeah.
*  He believed it. Yeah.
*  He believed that to be a champion, you had to be special.
*  You had to be smart. You had to have character.
*  Yeah, that you had to be a better person
*  and that you couldn't make a champion if you didn't make them a better person first.
*  And that that this, you know, this could strengthen people.
*  The sport could strengthen people in those ways. So
*  he he was married to it and he he was old and he needed
*  there was no one in the gym.
*  It was empty.
*  And it was above a police station, which was crazy.
*  And he needed an answer to the throne.
*  He needed to pass it on to someone.
*  And he saw some and all of a sudden he said
*  he saw that my career as a boxer was less important than having me
*  become his answer to the throne and become his trainer, his man, his guy
*  to continue that we could do a lot more for him and for everyone,
*  not just for him, but for everyone.
*  It was more like to keep it going.
*  Like it couldn't die.
*  It couldn't die.
*  And the customers are afraid that it would die with him.
*  And he committed his whole life to it.
*  He didn't get married because of boxing.
*  So he didn't.
*  So he saw me as as, you know,
*  the the little bit of, you know, the seed to plant
*  from from more things to grow before that plant died.
*  And so he all of a sudden he says you can't fight.
*  And I had people tell me that I could go somewhere else and fight.
*  And I could. But I couldn't.
*  Right, because I'd be disloyal.
*  Loyalty is everything.
*  Yeah. So I couldn't leave because yeah.
*  And he kind of knew that.
*  And and so, you know, I couldn't leave.
*  And he said, you have an ability to teach.
*  He said, knowledge means nothing.
*  He said, see these for Canada, he had for Canada,
*  for Tanaka, the Psychopedias, the whole set in our library.
*  He said, you see these? Yeah, I see them.
*  All the knowledge of the world, whatever, is in these.
*  All right. Means nothing.
*  If you don't have somebody to convey it to people,
*  otherwise it just sits on a bookshelf and looks good.
*  Because you have the ability to convey knowledge to people.
*  You're a teacher. You were born to be a teacher.
*  You'd lessen yourself by only being a champion fighter
*  because you'd only take care of one person.
*  You could take care of all kinds of people.
*  And you could do this and you could do that.
*  You could do this. So we go on this venture.
*  Took a minute because I didn't believe them at first.
*  But finally, I am. I'm there. I'm training fighters.
*  And then he gets me to buy in.
*  And I was a teacher and I start teaching these kids.
*  And there's no one in the gym that's dead.
*  And all of a sudden, there's 10 kids, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.
*  Catskill Boxing Club, which was never there.
*  Now it's there. And I'm training fighters.
*  I'm taking them down to South Bronx to get experience.
*  One of his former fighters, Nelson Quervis, down to South Bronx.
*  I'm taking them down there to get smokers to get fights when they're ready.
*  I'm wearing out dungarees. I'm getting holes in my dungarees.
*  I was fashionable before it was fashionable to have holes in my dungarees.
*  I could have made a lot of money with that
*  because I was on my knees with these little kids, nine years old,
*  10 years old, eight years old, 10, 12, 13, 14, all these kids.
*  And I'm teaching and I'm building a gym.
*  And Cus only came once a week because he was semi-retired.
*  And when he would come once a week, he knew he couldn't give me money,
*  but he gave me more than money. He gave me praise.
*  And he said, look what Atlas is doing.
*  He's creating champions.
*  And I was like, well, yeah, wow, I'm doing good.
*  And then all of a sudden, after four years of that,
*  because I was up there seven years, eight years, eight years,
*  after about three and a half, four years of that,
*  we get a phone call that they get this kid in prison and try on prison
*  from one of the guys that knew Cus, Matt Baranski.
*  And there's a correctional officer named Bobby Stewart
*  who used a box and Cus had helped him out a little bit, a little bit.
*  And they knew we had this gym now that was really starting to become something
*  because we were winning tournaments and everything else.
*  They call him, we got this kid, Mike Tyson, he's 12 years old,
*  he's 190 pounds, he's a mess.
*  But probably Stewart got involved with him, you know, the former fighter,
*  and he's taken a liking to it.
*  And now where he didn't behave at all and he didn't listen to anyone.
*  Now he's listening because Bobby's got a carrot and the carrot is hit.
*  He teach him boxing.
*  And now he's at the point now where we want you to take a look, you and Teddy.
*  Bring him down.
*  What would you think when you first saw Mike Tyson?
*  Well, I want to I want to see his birth certificate
*  because he's 190 pounds, 12 years old and all solid.
*  Yeah. You know, really?
*  But yeah, just physically, just as a physical specimen.
*  And and yeah.
*  And listen, Cus was right, I was a teacher.
*  He was right. And he was testing me even that day.
*  So what do you think?
*  So I said, well, we ain't going to know nothing in the bag.
*  Who the fuck cares about that?
*  He knocked the bag down.
*  Yeah, we got to put him in with who we got to put him in that way.
*  I didn't have anyone that way.
*  We got to test them.
*  Everyone's got to be tested.
*  And so you got to put them in responsibly.
*  But let's put them in just respond.
*  But let's put them in with Bobby Stewart, former pro fighter, 14 profiles,
*  smaller than Tyson.
*  He was when he was fighting, he was 175.
*  But still, he's 28 years old.
*  Tyson's 12. Come on.
*  And he'll work with him.
*  Right. So we do we put him on Tyson.
*  He recognized the moment he understood this was an audition.
*  This was a chance.
*  You know, this was that TV show, Change Your Life.
*  And he understood that if he passed the audition, he could change,
*  possibly change his life.
*  He wasn't sure what.
*  How could he be sure what exactly?
*  But it was better than what he had.
*  And so he was on a day.
*  So he wanted he innately understood what we would want to see.
*  Ferociousness, toughness,
*  character, desire, you know, and of course, ability.
*  Well, we saw the ability power speed, but it was it was unbridled.
*  It was untoward. It was it was raw.
*  You didn't know really much at all.
*  At all. But we saw that.
*  But he wanted to show more.
*  He knew that wasn't enough. Again, innate intelligence.
*  He he had to show desire.
*  He had to show toughness.
*  And so I was being responsible after two rounds.
*  That's enough.
*  Normally, I don't put a guy into boxing to maybe four months, five months,
*  six months, eight months.
*  It depends what it takes to learn on the floor
*  before it's responsible to put him in a ring to actually take on
*  incoming real live shows instead of blanks.
*  And so normally I wouldn't have men.
*  And I knew after today, he wouldn't be in the ring again if I trained him.
*  I would teach him first and then he'd get back in a few months.
*  But for this day, it was the only way.
*  It's kind of like I used to make this analogy and because loved it.
*  I said, what's training a fighter?
*  What do you what do you look for training a fighter, Teddy?
*  You know, he asked me this ridiculous question just to test me.
*  And I say, it's like going to Macy's.
*  He loved it.
*  I said, it's like I said, it's like go to Macy's window.
*  He goes, what do you mean Macy's window?
*  You know, because it's like, boom, boom, boom.
*  So what do you mean Macy's window?
*  You go to Macy's window and they get the window where everything you want to see
*  everything in there and it looks great.
*  Oh, everything.
*  And yeah. And then what?
*  Well, then you ask what's in the warehouse and they tell you nothing.
*  And then because that's that's it.
*  That's a trainer. Yeah.
*  And I wanted to see what was in the warehouse.
*  Because they saw what was in the Macy's window.
*  I saw the power, so to speak.
*  So he goes two rounds and he gets a bloody nose.
*  Here's the weird thing. Not weird.
*  Very telling. We knew what we were doing.
*  Not bragging, but we knew what we were doing because
*  he got a bloody nose because he got hit.
*  After that bloody, he never got another bloody nose.
*  You know why he didn't get hit?
*  Because he learned he was still strong, but he was smarter now.
*  Anyway, he goes two rounds.
*  And I saw and I'm being responsible because if he goes more, it's not responsible.
*  I saw what I needed to see.
*  I saw a speed. I saw power.
*  I saw athleticism.
*  And I saw I didn't believe him.
*  I thought he was lying to me.
*  I'm just telling you, I thought he was lying, trying to act tough
*  when he wasn't really feeling tough.
*  It didn't matter because question me on it afterwards.
*  What did you see?
*  And when I said he goes, young master, you know, again, he wasn't paying me money.
*  So he had to give me something right.
*  And that was better than that was currency.
*  Young master master.
*  Oh, you know, young master.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I felt like that guy Kung Fu, you know, like in the movie, like Kung Fu grasshopper.
*  When you're ready, when you could take this out of my hand, you can leave.
*  And that's powerful.
*  Yeah, it was. It worked because knew how to work me.
*  And he did. And it worked.
*  And and so but you know what?
*  I didn't mind being worked.
*  I kind of knew I was being shuffled a little bit.
*  Well, you're making it sound a little bit negative, but it's also extremely positive.
*  That's a teacher instilling wisdom into you that you carried forward
*  and impacted a lot of people.
*  Yeah, because you get the job done, but he did it his way.
*  And he did it for a lot of a myriad of reasons.
*  And but at the end of the day, it was all good.
*  And I just had to understand that eventually later on.
*  But you do the same.
*  You do things your way and carry some of him in you, some of your father.
*  And yeah, that day, you know, that day was funny because when Custer,
*  what did you see, Teddy, when him after two rounds, I got up in the ring.
*  I knew I was going to train him.
*  Obviously, we were going to say no.
*  And he still had about four months to serve and we were going to work it out. Yeah.
*  And when I got up on a ring apron, that's my job.
*  I'm the boss.
*  You know, people later on in life call me a dictator.
*  You know what I said? Yeah, you're right.
*  I didn't deny people. You mean I'm right?
*  Yeah, I'm a dictator.
*  I'm a trainer. I'm the boss.
*  I'm in charge. If I you wouldn't be here if I was.
*  What the freak you need me for if I'm not freaking in charge?
*  You idiot. Yeah. Yeah. Damn right.
*  Well, what do you think?
*  It's a it's a shared responsibility.
*  No, it's my responsibility.
*  That's why you're here. Yeah, I am in charge.
*  And you shouldn't be here if you don't understand that.
*  So I get up there and I know that I'm going to be training them.
*  I got to show them who the boss is.
*  You know, I'm being really frank about this.
*  So I get up there and say, that's it out.
*  No, no, no, no, no, let me go.
*  I want to do another round. I want to do another.
*  I said, how did you hear what I said?
*  Because I knew that, you know, he was going to test me.
*  He was testing me. I said, I said, get out.
*  He got out. But were you impressed with the fact that you want to keep going?
*  Yes. And I recognize what it really was.
*  So because they asked me, what was that?
*  Because I want to know what the young master saw.
*  So because what was that?
*  I said it was some.
*  It was an act.
*  He goes, you saw that?
*  Did he really want to go? I said, no, I said, he really want to go.
*  But he knew that we want him to go.
*  But he knew that we want him to go.
*  And he made himself ready to go in order to satisfy.
*  And that's just as good.
*  Because that damn right, it's just as good.
*  All that matters was not not not how he got there, but that he got there.
*  That's all that matters that he got there,
*  that he got to the place to act like a fighter, to to do what we want him to do,
*  to be ready to persevere, to go beyond the comfort level, to do another round.
*  He didn't want to.
*  Damn right, he didn't want to.
*  But he knew we want him to.
*  And he knew in order to pass the test, he had to do it.
*  And he said, you're right.
*  He goes, now it's going to be your job
*  to teach him to make him a fighter that don't get bloody noses, that don't get hit.
*  And we'll get to that place without being coerced to get there,
*  to get to that place on his own.
*  Instead of using the things that he had to use to get to that place today,
*  those things are not going to be available one day when you and listen to this.
*  You talk about a man being prophetic, because it's pretty good.
*  You talk about man, you know, the job on money.
*  Lex, he says, how do you think he finishes the sense?
*  He goes, because someday, because, you know,
*  you're going to have to make sure that he learns these things,
*  because, you know, he'll be your first heavyweight champ.
*  What did you just say?
*  He's 12 years old.
*  Yeah, he's been arrested 30 times.
*  He's getting out of jail, out of juvenile detention, try on.
*  He's a mess in a lot of ways.
*  There's a lot of things we find out later, a lot of problems, weaknesses.
*  He goes, and you're that's part of your job.
*  That'll be part of your job.
*  And but he really said that.
*  And then he turned to me, goes, you want to come live with us, young man?
*  You want to be a fighter?
*  Yes. Even that, because said to me later, what do you think about that?
*  I said, hey, we said yes.
*  Yeah, the way he said, yes.
*  Yes, sir.
*  He said, what do you think about that?
*  And we're talking.
*  I said,
*  it ain't going to be that polite in a little while down the road.
*  Again, he knew that that's what he felt, that he needed to to project himself
*  as to to present himself out to get to where you want to get to.
*  He goes, you know, yeah, yeah.
*  Did you see what Cuss was seeing in terms of the heavyweight champion of the world?
*  No, again, the easiest answer would be yes.
*  Teddy, Teddy, genius.
*  Wow. Wow. Teddy.
*  Wow. No, no, no, no.
*  But again, it was my job.
*  And I just.
*  I my job, it was simple, simpler than Cuss's.
*  Cuss knew too much. I knew nothing.
*  I just knew, you know, rudiments of boxing, I knew what it took to be a fighter and
*  and how to execute it, the steps of executing it.
*  So I took those steps.
*  The rest of it, you get blurred by those other things.
*  I wasn't blurred by those other things.
*  It was it was just get them in the gym.
*  Make them mentally stronger, make them face things
*  and teach them how to slip punches and create holes and fill those freaking
*  holes with devastating punches, this is a cuss.
*  And what are you going to do?
*  I'm going to teach them to fill holes and fill them with punches with bad intentions.
*  Yeah. And and that became the moniker.
*  And I would say that I'm throwing punches with bad intentions.
*  Yes, you are. And, you know, how do you make it mentally tougher?
*  So that part of the job, the you said
*  don't get a bloody nose, but the part of the job where makes it mentally tougher.
*  How do you do that?
*  Most important part of the job.
*  To make a face things,
*  make them face where he's lying to himself, where he's submitting.
*  When we start this conversation with submission, submit less, submit less,
*  submit less, submit less because only come to the gym once in a while.
*  And if I had him spawn, he would come because that was his that was his project.
*  That was the heavyweight.
*  Now he came, you know, put life in cause cause that life he was losing a little
*  life, but that made the light bulb bright again.
*  It did. And it was great to see.
*  I felt proud of that.
*  I felt connected to that.
*  And that's why when when when it all went bad and cause to decide that the only
*  side he could take the side of the next heavyweight champion of the world.
*  But he but he left me.
*  His partner, the young master and.
*  Of the second time I get betrayed and I'm like.
*  For a while, I thought everything cause taught me, said to me was a liar and want
*  to be any part of it anymore until I got a little more mature and I got a little
*  past that.
*  Where I was able to understand.
*  I was able to understand.
*  That.
*  Just because somebody that you perceive as great in every area is you find to be
*  weak in certain areas.
*  Does it mean.
*  That they can still be what they want to you?
*  It's it's something that.
*  It's something that can be understood or forgiven.
*  It's hard.
*  Is hard to get to that place and forgive somebody in that kind of way that I felt
*  betrayed because cause told me the most important thing was loyalty cause told me
*  he loved me because I was long cause cause told people that the reason that he went
*  to court was because I didn't give up anybody, even though it meant put me in the
*  risk of going to jail for 10 years and and cause felt that he admired those
*  traits. And so I assumed that he he would show the same traits and he took a deal.
*  He took a deal. He took a deal.
*  He he signed the papers that those that those so-called feds of my signed.
*  You know, he he took a deal to to, you know.
*  To have the future heavyweight champions
*  turned out and to let me, you know, to let me go to sign the deal, to to let me take,
*  you know, take the weight for people who don't know.
*  Mike was inappropriate with a young girl and you pulled the gun on him.
*  I don't know if there is deeper things to say about that situation,
*  but why do you think us made the decision
*  to cut you off from both Mike Tyson and from custom custom auto like to break that
*  when he valued loyalty? I serve my purpose.
*  I got him to the way he needed to get
*  for life back in the gym.
*  If I wasn't in the gym at that particular time, Tyson never would have been in the
*  gym. There would have been no gym to bring him to when they called up and made
*  that phone call to bring him to the gym.
*  There would have been no activity.
*  There would have been no boxing program.
*  There would be, you know, no trainer training him 24 7 the way I was,
*  where a customer wasn't capable of doing that at that point in his life.
*  But then again, it's not poor Teddy.
*  I get the benefit of a career.
*  I get the benefit of knowledge.
*  I get the benefit of a life.
*  I get the benefit of learning, of becoming hopefully a better person.
*  I get the benefit of being betrayed again.
*  But that's a hell of a statement right there.
*  I don't know what the benefit of that is.
*  You can learn to forgive weakness.
*  You know.
*  When you.
*  Realize how.
*  How easy it is to be weak.
*  And and when you realize that somebody asked me, how did you get to the point
*  where you you could forgive?
*  Right. It's a pretty good question, pretty simple,
*  pretty basic, pretty important, right?
*  And I didn't I didn't understand.
*  I understood, but I did understand immediately for me.
*  I said, how can I not forgive somebody?
*  It becomes easier to learn how to forgive.
*  When you're still trying to forgive yourself.
*  When you're still in the process of trying
*  to forgive yourself for your own inherent weaknesses
*  and betrayals of people like my father.
*  And different ways that we forget very easily because it's handy.
*  And it's a way of surviving.
*  It's a lot easier to to figure it out,
*  rationalize it, to to to to find forgiveness when you realize that you still
*  haven't figured out completely how to forgive yourself.
*  I'm still trying to figure that out.
*  And.
*  So that helped me figure out how to forgive costs.
*  Because to figure out how to forgive me,
*  I had to understood why I did these things, where the where the weaknesses came
*  from, where the selfishness came from, where the convenience came from,
*  that they really existed, but they didn't exist for malice.
*  They existed for me not being prepared
*  to understand that I could be stronger.
*  To want to be stronger.
*  And then I looked at Cuss.
*  He wanted to be stronger, but he got to a point in life where he had been strong
*  for a lot of his life, he was strong with me, he was strong with a lot
*  of things in his life.
*  And does everyone deserve a past in life
*  where.
*  He got he got to a place where everything was in one basket, the basket of boxing.
*  He once told me that he never got married
*  because it would be it would be selfish to a woman to have gotten married when his
*  whole life was boxing, that he couldn't give to a kid, he couldn't give to her.
*  He could. And and then I thought about it.
*  He had no money, really.
*  And Jim Jacobs and Bill Caden took care of the bills,
*  so he didn't really need money that way.
*  But.
*  The one what was the payoff for that kind of life, that kind of commitment,
*  that kind of sacrifice, really, what was the payoff?
*  The payoff.
*  Was to have champions.
*  To have a champion that would keep your name alive.
*  You know, that word legacy, like, what does it mean?
*  Sometimes it's it's just a word.
*  Sometimes it's it's more than a word.
*  It's it's it's a reprieve.
*  It's a pension plan.
*  It is being given a pension on your way out for the rest of your life,
*  for you, for your life, wherever you're going, you're going to wherever you're
*  going for eternity, it's it's it's the only thing that you take with you
*  as what you left behind.
*  And for us, it was all about leaving behind a mark, a mark that of champion.
*  Yeah, it was attached to ego.
*  We all have it. Yeah, it was attached to some selfishness and all.
*  But yeah, it was also attached.
*  To wanting to leave something great behind.
*  To know that you were part of it, that you existed for a reason, that that that you
*  sacrificed for a reason and all that freaking pain I brought my father.
*  I was searching for something.
*  Yeah, I made it into a righteous search.
*  I made it into I did.
*  And I made it into I was OK because it was righteous.
*  And I but it still did damage.
*  It still did damage.
*  It still hurt people.
*  It still betrayed my father's trust.
*  And.
*  Cus betrayed mine, but he didn't do it maliciously.
*  He he did it out of again.
*  My father came home.
*  This is how I'm going to connect it.
*  My father came home from from work one night, 12 o'clock, and I was waiting on
*  and like I said, it was over nine, 10 years old, and he got mad at me.
*  He goes, go to bed. What are you doing up?
*  I said, I'm waiting for you.
*  Waiting for you.
*  And.
*  He said, we'll go to bed.
*  I said, no, I
*  what were you doing?
*  I said, I was at the hospital.
*  You were there.
*  Why were you there so late?
*  You know,
*  he answered me, he said there was a patient, it was a sick patient.
*  I said, he must be better now because you're his doctor.
*  You know, because my father could fix anything.
*  My father, nothing got in the way of the truth.
*  Nothing, nothing, even blown his son's bubble.
*  Matter of factly, he said to me,
*  no, he's not going to get better, he's going to die.
*  And.
*  So as a nine year old kid, you know,
*  your kid, your selfish, you know, not in a bad way, but, you know,
*  you want would you and I said.
*  I said two things.
*  First, I said, how you're his doctor.
*  How?
*  It can't be.
*  And then I said, I just said it almost angry.
*  Then why were you there?
*  Like, you should have been here with me.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what he said to me?
*  Because you don't give up on life.
*  Go to bed.
*  And give up on life.
*  And that's I finally connected the dots.
*  This idiot that didn't graduate high school.
*  I finally connected the dots.
*  I was asking Custer give up on life.
*  You know, you don't give up on life.
*  You don't give up on aspirations of life.
*  Life is all forms of life.
*  Doesn't have to be a physical form of it.
*  It's life. It's having a reason to be alive.
*  It's having a reason to have tomorrow.
*  And Custer's only reason to have tomorrow was to have another heavyweight champ.
*  And Teddy Atlas, even though we were together all those years and we were
*  partners and we trained together and we would we would, you know,
*  the only thing we didn't do was what they did in the Indian movies where they cut
*  the finger and they became blood brothers.
*  That's the only thing we didn't do.
*  And I felt like we did that without cutting.
*  And and now here we are.
*  And he freaking betrayed me this and and and then all of a sudden I connected the
*  dots, I was like.
*  He didn't betray me in that cold sense.
*  He didn't give up on life.
*  Years later, Mike Tyson apologized to you.
*  What what what's meaningful to you about that?
*  How does that fit the story?
*  I want to be the great, gracious guy right now.
*  Say, oh, I'm so human that that, you know,
*  a man's man enough to say, sorry, that's it.
*  We're good. I want to be really that that's that's that's the that's the best
*  presentation of Teddy Atlas I could put out there.
*  He's a good guy. He forgives.
*  He's a good guy.
*  He's a he's a he's a standup guy and he's a good guy.
*  I'm not sure.
*  If he truly did it
*  for himself, that he really did it.
*  Because he felt that.
*  It was true.
*  But but if he's persuaded by other things, he was in the middle, I know I'm taking
*  it too deep, I know, but what am I going to do?
*  He was in the middle of 12 steps with the,
*  you know, getting out of drugs, alcohol, 12 steps, which is a commemorative.
*  Really, it is.
*  And he's taking the steps.
*  A part of the steps was to admit or to apologize to all people you offended in life.
*  OK.
*  But.
*  Are you doing it for the 12 steps or are you doing it because you really, truly.
*  I've come to terms with believing what you did.
*  Was that hurtful to me and that it matters to you that it was that hurtful to me
*  and that you were wrong in doing it? Did you do it for.
*  I know that's deep. I know that I'm a freaking idiot.
*  Yeah, you're you're a Teddy.
*  Freaking you're you're you should be better than that.
*  He's better than you.
*  Yeah, maybe he is better than me.
*  Maybe he is really seriously.
*  Maybe he is. And I took it.
*  He put his hand. I took it.
*  We hugged. He said, I love you.
*  I I.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I but I want to believe.
*  But what did because tell me, no matter what a man says, is what he does
*  in the end that he intended to do all along.
*  So to this day today.
*  Was it really genuine or was it reflexive of that moment for him to get what he
*  needed to, you know, for that step or was it truly.
*  For what I needed to really that he really cared
*  that what he did to me caused me to do what I did because I did something that
*  was pretty damn bad to him, too.
*  Is he able to.
*  Deal with that and put that where it has to be put, is he able to put that or is
*  it just he did something he had to do and maybe he's sorry he did it?
*  I know.
*  Look, I appreciate it that he.
*  I would rather have been in a private place.
*  Yes, so people don't know you were in the middle of commentating a fight and he
*  walked up behind you and he said he was sorry he shook your hand, gave you a hug.
*  I didn't know he said, I love you.
*  Yeah, he's emotional.
*  I get emotional a little bit, too.
*  But but he he's emotional and he could be and he can be.
*  I can see why people have a fascination and a love affair with him right now,
*  because he was.
*  Because, you know, he was.
*  He was the media, the media that went across the sky that is if they didn't see
*  their parents told them about it, there was a media that came across the sky one
*  day and the media is walking around in the room now and that's the meteorite.
*  And then it actually landed here.
*  And that's it right there.
*  And and and now he's come a long way and now he's, you know, he's more human and
*  he's lovable, you know, and and compassionate and he cries.
*  And and I get the fascination.
*  I get the love affair.
*  I get it because we're inherently we're people that want to forgive.
*  We're people that we want to be good.
*  And part of being good is to forgive people and to to show compassion to people.
*  And so and when somebody's been damaged,
*  to acknowledge they've been damaged, to
*  acknowledge that you know they've been damaged and you care about them being
*  damaged and how do you show care to admiration, you know, in some ways,
*  almost through adulation and he's getting adulation from people like, you know,
*  which is to an incredible level.
*  And it's because it's a phenomenon.
*  But but I get it.
*  I understand it.
*  And
*  I don't know if he gets it.
*  I don't know if underneath all of this, he's a complex guy.
*  He's a sensitive guy.
*  I don't know. And I am, too.
*  And one complex guy talking about another complex guy.
*  I don't know if underneath it all where he's really truly at as far as that
*  day that he said that to me.
*  Is that part of you that's sorry to Mike for pulling the gun on him?
*  Yeah. And that's listen, that's fair.
*  I I know dimensions of human nature too well to not know that he still has to have
*  certain because I have those strong feelings.
*  What? It's not fair for him to have them.
*  They're right. It's fair.
*  Now, now he could look at it if he was to be held to his word that night,
*  that he just acknowledges that what happened, he deserved because of what he,
*  you know, the position he put me in and he put himself in what he did.
*  And I wouldn't change that.
*  You know, still, you're you don't regret pulling the gun on him.
*  I regret that I had to.
*  Yeah, I regret very much that that I had to that.
*  I regret very much.
*  He crossed the line.
*  I hated him for putting me in that position.
*  That that, you know, how dare he think that that somebody feels that trivial.
*  That the way I would feel about myself
*  and the way the girl would feel about herself, that was 11 years old at the time,
*  how she would feel about herself, how dare that he think it's that trivial
*  that, you know,
*  that I shouldn't be ready to freaking to both die and kill for that.
*  Why didn't custom auto
*  see it in a deeper way and talk through it?
*  The word came back to me.
*  But of course, what does it mean?
*  But the word came back to me that said you were right.
*  But if he took the side of Teddy, he would destroy potentially a great,
*  a great fighter.
*  Why do you think that?
*  OK, if you were to try to understand the point he was making, why?
*  Why is that true?
*  Is isn't the part of greatness that you said is building the character of knowing
*  what is right, what, you know, because he was afraid to to go there
*  where he used to not be afraid because it's kind of like you're never afraid of
*  going up and I get it.
*  You know, when I train a fighter now,
*  if I come out of retirement, I train a fighter now, I feel in camp like
*  I feel like I'm on death row every day, that every day I try to retrace my memory
*  and say, did I feel this way when I was younger?
*  I don't remember feeling this way.
*  I feel every day a dreadful feeling that if I don't get this right,
*  I I betrayed everything.
*  I betrayed the fighters trust.
*  I betrayed what I'm supposed to be.
*  And then one day I tried to figure it out.
*  Why do I feel this way? So intense.
*  I was in camp for two months training a guy for the world title
*  a couple of years ago fighting the hardest puncher in the world at the time.
*  And Adonis Stevenson and the fighter was Ukrainian.
*  And I was brought in to train him for that fight.
*  And he trusted me and changed his whole style.
*  Trusted me.
*  Oh, my God. I went to bed every night like praying,
*  dread, waking up, dread my stomach down to here every day saying,
*  what what if I fail?
*  What what what if everything that I told him was going to happen?
*  Don't happen.
*  What if I fail him?
*  What what if he trusted me?
*  And I I betrayed that trust.
*  And the thing was the because was, you know,
*  he used to be stronger than that.
*  And then I tried to figure it out why I got this way and why it was so dreadful
*  to me and why I felt like I was on death row every day training a fighter.
*  Like, did I do enough?
*  They do. Well, well, well, we accomplish what we will.
*  We accomplish what I promised him we would accomplish.
*  Would I keep my word?
*  And and then I started thinking, how did I become this week?
*  How did I think and become I was a pretty strong guy.
*  How did I become this week?
*  And then finally, I think I figured it out.
*  You know why? Because I was always working to get up.
*  But once I finally got up, now I was looking down
*  and I finally hit me.
*  I said, I didn't want to lose.
*  I said there was nothing to lose on my way up.
*  Now, all of a sudden, there's something to lose when you're up there
*  and you're looking down.
*  That's where he was.
*  And that's where because because because was at the end of his rope.
*  He was he accomplished two world champs.
*  All this stuff, right?
*  Everything he and and and he did it right.
*  Now, all of a sudden, it wasn't about moving forward.
*  It was about not falling down.
*  Holy cow.
*  I was like, I got it, because I got it.
*  I got it.
*  You didn't want to fall down.
*  Oh, my God. You don't want to fall.
*  And he this was his last chance.
*  You don't give up on life.
*  This was his last chance to live forever.
*  To make everything he did worthwhile, to have the youngest.
*  It wasn't just heavyweight.
*  You got to remember he was the youngest heavyweight champ ever.
*  And to have that, it was OK to die now.
*  And.
*  How's loyalty?
*  Someone named Teddy Atlas going to get in the way of that.
*  That's a tidal wave that they ain't no war that's been made high enough
*  to stop that tidal wave, and now I'll stop myself.
*  Yeah, there is.
*  But but it would have to be an awful big one.
*  And you know what?
*  Who are we to say that we could ever build that wall that big?
*  Who is any of whom? I just say, do you think if you were to put yourself
*  in the shoes of custom auto?
*  Can you see yourself having the big enough wall or you choose loyalty?
*  Now, if I answer the way I feel,
*  then then I'm, you know, I'm making myself John Wayne again.
*  You don't have to answer that.
*  I think loyalty, loyalty is important.
*  No matter what a man says, what he does in the end that he intends to do all along.
*  I didn't make that up, because it
*  and when when this all went down.
*  Those words came freaking echoing into my freaking ears.
*  I didn't want them.
*  Cotton doesn't help.
*  And they freaking kept coming into my ears.
*  And what do you think?
*  Still an immature kid at the time.
*  You know, I was young, still an immature kid at the time.
*  What the freak do you think my response was?
*  You were full of.
*  Yeah, and but I got past that.
*  Do you do you forgive us?
*  Have you found forgiveness?
*  Listen, I forgive him because.
*  He gave me more than he took away from me.
*  If I can, what kind of man am I to if I can't at least acknowledge that
*  and be grateful for that, he he gave me more than he took from me.
*  And I'm grateful for that.
*  I'm also grateful for what I gave him.
*  That I had, you know, that I I did give him some.
*  And at that point in his life, you know.
*  Place, a place to still
*  to still have test tubes and chemistry experiments, you know, a laboratory
*  where you could still create great fire.
*  And I helped give him that I helped.
*  I helped. I was part of that lab and making sure that lab was there.
*  And just that there was the existence of test tubes
*  in the place because you can't freak into experiments without test tubes.
*  Now, you're the scientist with the test tubes.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  And I I just hope that.
*  What I said earlier is really
*  is really my thread through this whole thing.
*  When you say, can you forgive?
*  Because I.
*  I'm still trying to forgive myself.
*  And.
*  If I can have hope that I can forgive myself,
*  I think that hope has to start with the power to forgive someone else.
*  How can I ever forgive myself for all my failings and figure it out?
*  If I can't start and practice it.
*  By forgiving someone else for some shortcomings.
*  And for me,
*  that's that's that's the only sense of sometimes a very
*  hard thing to make sense of.
*  That that that's my North Star.
*  That's that's my compass, because just to make me laugh,
*  you know, me and him did everything together and we drive and we get lost in
*  the city, we get lost in the Bronx and he get all frustrated.
*  And he's Atlas, you know, great trainer,
*  but you turn you around, you spin you around and you're lost.
*  And I said, me or we?
*  Because I was the only one who would argue with him.
*  And it was really funny sometimes.
*  And I said, we or me? You were we or it goes, I don't care.
*  Cause you're lost.
*  I'm lost. What are you talking about?
*  And then all of a sudden, cause couldn't give in.
*  He just couldn't admit he couldn't give in.
*  You know what he said to me?
*  All of a sudden he goes, when I was in the army,
*  if I had a compass, I could get out of the woods.
*  I said, we're not in the woods. We're not in the army.
*  We don't have a compass, cause, cause
*  just don't argue with me.
*  One time we're driving.
*  I want to get back to Catskill.
*  We just finished at the Bronx.
*  It's been a long day.
*  You know, visiting the murderers,
*  houses and everything else that he took me through for the 1800 time.
*  And I'm and he would fall asleep.
*  You know, he was getting older and he
*  and he would just fall asleep in the car.
*  So what do you think? I went a little faster, right?
*  Because before he went to sleep, he said, don't speed.
*  So I don't consider myself.
*  I try to be an honest guy and I try to be a freaking.
*  But yeah, you know, it was the five or six guys.
*  What did I say earlier? Try to do less submitting.
*  Yeah, really, in all faces, try to submit a little less.
*  Try to lie a little less today.
*  A little less.
*  Try to get stronger, try to get a little better.
*  So here we are.
*  And we're driving and all of a sudden he's
*  what did I do? 80, 75?
*  Probably, probably did.
*  You know, whatever.
*  And all of a sudden he wakes up.
*  You were speeding.
*  I lie. No, I wasn't.
*  Don't lie.
*  I'm not lying.
*  You lied again.
*  You were speeding.
*  Now, come on, this guy, he's, you know what I mean?
*  He's he's
*  he's unbelievable.
*  So I got a freaking, you know, he's the he's David Copperfield.
*  I want to know the trick.
*  I want to know how he freaking he made this thing disappear.
*  So I said,
*  what are you talking about? How do you know?
*  He goes, because I timed you.
*  I looked at the post number and I'm like,
*  what? I looked at the post number on the side of the road where we were,
*  whatever miles. And I never knew they even existed.
*  I look and I said, yeah, there's little numbers.
*  You start timing and he goes, yeah, he timed it.
*  And he looked, he goes, we couldn't have got from here to there.
*  And that amount of time, unless you were going 75 miles an hour.
*  And I'm like,
*  all right, I'm with my man.
*  All right. I'm impressed.
*  Don't try to get the mileage, the mile per hour part right.
*  It's enough that you got me.
*  Yeah, that's enough.
*  I'm
*  yeah, I said, and I'm not going to do that.
*  No, I'm, you know, and just
*  he helped me in crazy ways where there would be times where I wanted to be,
*  you know, where you wanted to be, whatever, right.
*  Convenient week submit.
*  Right. And then all of a sudden,
*  all of a sudden, because in my mind, because was there with the stopwatch.
*  And
*  I'd be like, you know,
*  no, you know, where I was about to say yes to whatever that particular
*  situation was.
*  Somebody up there.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  Yes, great. Thank you.
*  Just for the record, never had a phone call like this.
*  It's hotel security.
*  The question is, he asked me, is, are you OK, sir?
*  Are you OK? Are we OK?
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  So far. Yeah.
*  You know, I can only go like so far.
*  It's kind of like that old joke, you know,
*  where the guy jumps off the Empire State Building.
*  Yeah.
*  He's falling down.
*  He's going, you know, 80th floor, 74, 64, 50.
*  He gets past the 50th floor and they're looking out the window and he goes,
*  how am I doing so far?
*  So good.
*  I don't know where it's going to end.
*  But
*  so Mike Dixon is considered by many to be one of the great boxers,
*  one of the greatest boxers of all time.
*  Heavyweight boxers.
*  What do you think on the positive side made him great?
*  I don't know if he was ever great.
*  I know he was just great.
*  I know he was sensational.
*  I know he was the greatest mix of maybe speed and power ever.
*  I know he was one of the greatest punchers from either side of the plate, left or right.
*  There's been great punches with just the right hand like Ernie Chavis and Deontay
*  Wilder and Max Baer.
*  I don't know if there's ever been anyone who could punch as good as he did on
*  either side with either hand other than Joe Lewis and a few others.
*  I don't know if there's ever been such a
*  combination of speed and power to that pure level that he had.
*  And it was a pure level.
*  I don't know if there was ever as good a fighter as Tyson was.
*  Maybe one night he was great.
*  When he wasn't tested, but he might have been ready to be tested
*  that one night against Michael Spinks when he took him apart 90 seconds.
*  I think I saw a great fighter that night.
*  I don't think you can be great
*  unless you have all
*  the requirements of being great.
*  What does it take to be a great fighter?
*  Truly great.
*  To not rely on someone else's weakness to be strong.
*  To be strong on your own.
*  Too often he relied on other people's weakness, whether it's to
*  by being intimidated or whether it was
*  because his talent was so much greater than theirs that it was like putting a
*  monster truck in there with a Volkswagen and the Volkswagen was going to get
*  crushed no matter how much horsepower the Volkswagen might have had under the hood.
*  And you put under the hood.
*  It was going to get crushed.
*  The monster truck was not going to allow it to be a contest.
*  And.
*  To be able to find a way
*  when your talent wasn't enough.
*  He didn't find a way when his talent wasn't enough.
*  And I'm not making statements if I'm not ready to put some evidence, you know,
*  like if we were in a courtroom, exhibit A.
*  When he fought, when he fought Buster Douglas,
*  Buster Douglas matched his will and didn't get intimidated, stood up to him.
*  He didn't do what most people did.
*  He didn't submit even a little bit.
*  Not that night. He had in the past.
*  But that night didn't. Why?
*  Because Buster had Buster had a secret weapon that night.
*  His mother.
*  Buster's mother died a few months previous.
*  He loved his mother very much.
*  Buster had always had talent, big, heavyweight, talented, could punch
*  technically solid.
*  It was all those things.
*  Always was.
*  But he quit in fights.
*  He did less than he should have done.
*  He never lived up to his ability.
*  He gave in. He submitted.
*  He wasn't strong enough.
*  He never had a reason to be strong enough.
*  When his mother died, he had a reason.
*  Nothing could hurt him as much as his mother dying hurt him.
*  Mike Tyson included.
*  That night, Mike Tyson
*  could not hurt him as much as his mother had hurt him by dying.
*  That night, he had a reason to be strong for his mother.
*  And he was strong.
*  He was everything he was supposed to be and more.
*  And he stood up to Mike and Mike, for the first time, maybe ever,
*  was in a fight where he had to overcome something, where he had to be more than
*  talented, more than a puncher,
*  more than a guy with scintillating speed.
*  And he wasn't.
*  And then that night got followed by another night with Holyfield.
*  Holyfield wasn't as talented as him, as big as a bunch of puncher.
*  But Holyfield had the character.
*  He was strong in ways that Tyson wasn't strong.
*  He was strong in a way where.
*  He could find a way.
*  He was willing to find a way.
*  He's willing to go to the cliff
*  to truly die before he submitted.
*  You know, a lot of stuff is just worth.
*  They're going to have to carry me out on the shield.
*  Yes, sure. OK.
*  Yeah. Until it comes time to be carried out on the shield.
*  Sometimes there's people that actually mean it.
*  You think Mike didn't have that?
*  Well, all right.
*  He let's just say arbitrarily, I don't have his record for me.
*  Let's say it was fifty five and five.
*  I know he had about five losses.
*  All right. Let's say it was fifty five and five.
*  Right. A lot of knockouts.
*  I have a say.
*  A fight's not a fight until there's something to overcome.
*  Until then, it's just an athletic exhibition contest.
*  Yeah. Who's a better athlete?
*  Who's got more quick twitch fibers?
*  Who's who? Who's more developed?
*  Who's a better this?
*  Who's who's more developed than those physical areas?
*  But a fight is not a fight until there's something to overcome.
*  OK.
*  So if you go by my definition, not Webster's,
*  my definition, which I think means something.
*  Mike Tyson was only in five fights in his life.
*  The five fights where there was something to overcome.
*  And he didn't overcome it.
*  Now, I know people hate me for this, including Tyson.
*  I understand hate me.
*  Oh, you're a hater because you weren't with them.
*  You didn't make the money because this, because that, because you got betrayed.
*  I think I'm better than that.
*  I hope I'm better than that.
*  I believe I'm better than that.
*  I'm not a hater.
*  I broadcast fights for 25 years on ESPN
*  where there was some people in the corner I did not like.
*  And if they did a good job, this guy's doing a great job.
*  And then there were guys that I liked and I had friendship.
*  But he messed up and we weren't friends no more.
*  Friendship got to be tested.
*  Remember that?
*  So we weren't friends no more.
*  But why did I do that?
*  Because it was my job.
*  It was more important for me
*  when it's all over with the only thing you're left with is.
*  I mean, we're going to be dust, all of us, right?
*  The only thing we're left with is what carries on a reputation.
*  You know, legacy, whatever that is, but our reputation.
*  That's all we're left with.
*  And that's all our kids are left with.
*  I wanted to be as good as it can be.
*  I've always had an ability.
*  I've done a lot of things wrong and I've had a lot of lackings.
*  But the one strength I've had, if I had a strength,
*  is to understand somehow
*  through osmosis, I guess,
*  to learn the lesson
*  that was important
*  is not what's in front of you for those five seconds,
*  for that moment in life.
*  It's what's left behind you when those five seconds are gone,
*  when whatever it is that you're dealing with,
*  you know, whatever that moment is, whatever that moment,
*  what you do in that moment.
*  The action of that moment is going to stay with you
*  and be you. It's going to become you.
*  What you face for that moment,
*  it's gone.
*  It's gone in the air in an instant.
*  It's gone. It's done.
*  Whether you stand up there and you get shot in the head
*  and the guy blows your brains out or you stand up
*  or you're fighting a guy who's like a scary guy to fight,
*  but you fight him and you beat him or he beats you up.
*  But how you
*  represented yourself in that moment
*  is all that matters.
*  That's going to live. What happened don't matter.
*  It don't matter that you got shot in the head.
*  I know that sounds absurd.
*  But if you believe that was important to stand up and take the chance
*  to get shot in the freaking head rather than to live like an empty vessel,
*  you know what?
*  That's all that freaking matters.
*  And somehow that got freaking wrapped into this freaking head of mine.
*  Like, that's what matters.
*  That's all that matters.
*  You know how many times I went and I
*  did things whether it was with this one, with Tyson, with that.
*  I didn't want to be there. I was scared to death.
*  But I was more scared.
*  I was more scared.
*  Living with regret.
*  How I would have felt.
*  I don't want to be in solitary confinement the rest of my life with that freaking
*  guy in the cell next to me called regret.
*  I don't freaking want to be next to that guy.
*  If I want to freaking go down that road,
*  I'll watch Papillon, you know what I mean?
*  And I'll get my fill from that.
*  But I don't want to freaking live it.
*  I'm afraid of what my children would think of me if I fell in those areas.
*  Why? Because
*  that's forever.
*  When I'm closing my eyes for the last time,
*  I don't want to have that fear.
*  I don't want to have that fear.
*  Whether I'm going down there or whether I'm going up there.
*  I laugh because
*  I was around guys years ago that used to when we talk about that,
*  and just, you know, and I would get a kick out of this one guy who'd been
*  around the block a few times when he'd say, Teddy, I ain't worried about that.
*  I got friends in both places.
*  That's a good line.
*  And I thought it was a I thought it was good.
*  Listen, Mike Tyson, you want me to say he was a great fighter?
*  Then you want me to betray what I really you know what I mean?
*  You want me to do that?
*  I ain't doing it for listen, I could do it to be a bigger Teddy Atlas.
*  And I know it would work for me.
*  I know it would be it do great promotional work for me.
*  I know it would it would make me more popular in certain areas.
*  I know it. I'm not that dumb, not that dumb.
*  But I also know what else it would do to me.
*  And I don't want it to do that to me.
*  I think he was a great talent.
*  I think maybe the night with Michael Spinks, maybe the night with Mike,
*  maybe he could have been that fighter, maybe.
*  But he didn't never really get tested.
*  But he might have been ready no matter what I have to be tested that night.
*  That's how good he was.
*  That's how even though it was a guy who used to be a light heavyweight.
*  I get it.
*  But we're still a guy who beat Larry Holmes, who still had something left.
*  Michael Spinks.
*  So and a great puncher and an Olympic gold medalist.
*  But and a special fighter, one of the great light heavyweights of all time.
*  You know what Mike Tyson was?
*  He was a meteor.
*  He was a meteor that struck across and not too many meteors.
*  And we still talk about him.
*  And and and unlike Halley's comment, he came back.
*  And he's walking around and he's he has become greater after his career,
*  more loved, more beloved, more awed.
*  And he's been forgiven.
*  He found the fountain of forgiveness.
*  I don't know. I wish I could find that
*  where he has been forgotten for all his shortcomings, all the things that he may
*  have done, may not have done, we don't know, only him and God know.
*  But he's been forgiven of all that.
*  And he's been not only forgiven.
*  He's raised above it and and above that
*  and been brought above that.
*  He's been brought to the pyramids of.
*  Of the greatest athletes that in the world
*  and in every in every way, in every way as a person, as a fighter,
*  as a historian, as a figure, as a celebrity.
*  I mean, even a philosopher.
*  Everything.
*  So I will take it back.
*  All right. All you guys out there, you forgive me.
*  He's the greatest of all time.
*  If you encapsulate all that, if you
*  encapsulate everything I just tried to describe and explain, if you put that all
*  he's the greatest of all time. Yeah, he is.
*  But he still might be 0 and 5.
*  In a record of 55 fights, he might in Teddy Atlas's book.
*  Again, I got friends in both places, so it's OK.
*  Wherever I go, I have company.
*  Somebody there will like me.
*  Despite me saying this, he might be 0 and 5 because of five fights where there was
*  something to overcome which really defines a fight.
*  He came. He he didn't find a way.
*  Let me ask Teddy Atlas to introspect on the human nature here.
*  It's part of the complexities of your feelings on this whole thing
*  is that you know to some degree that if you were coaching Mike Tyson, he could be
*  truly great. I know I'm going to cut you right off because you asked a million
*  dollar question. I wish you did, but you did.
*  You did.
*  Because that's why I get paid.
*  That's why you get paid. I get it.
*  You took the words out of my mouth.
*  That's why you are where you are.
*  And that's why I'm here.
*  The humility I'm going to I'm going to again, full disclosure, it's important,
*  right?
*  I'm going to cheat.
*  I'm going to take some of Cuss's wisdom.
*  All right. A little bit of mine.
*  Yeah.
*  Cuss told somebody that.
*  Teddy Atlas got his way.
*  He might have been a better person, but we would have risk of not being a great
*  fighter.
*  Now, I believe and I thought Cuss did, and I think he did up to that point in his
*  life, that part of your strength of character made you a great fighter
*  and truly a great fighter and part of that battle to be a better person, that
*  fight, if you will, to be a better person, to overcome the things, to be a better
*  person, part of that fire you have to go through to be a better person.
*  I really, truly bought into it and I'm in for life.
*  That is really the only way to be a great fighter.
*  And
*  I don't think that's what Cuss meant.
*  I thought he meant I think he meant that Cuss knew more than I did of what was
*  about to come and what would come and what the world was, how people would try
*  to steal him, how people would take him, how people would steal his guy.
*  The last thing he had to really
*  the thing that he lived for, because he lived to have another heavyweight champ,
*  the greatest fighter ever, Cuss, and Cuss is fine.
*  He could be. And I believe that Cuss knew that he
*  could put forward a guy that had the ability to be the greatest fighter ever
*  without fully completing the mission of what it takes to really be great, but that
*  he wouldn't he wouldn't be around to have to witness it
*  and that he wouldn't.
*  He was wrong. He would.
*  Man, this is awful.
*  He's willing to concede that he might be dead
*  in order to have eternal life, in order to have greatness,
*  and which Cuss does have greatness and part of that greatness is attached to Tyson.
*  And he deserves it. He deserves it.
*  Cuss was a great man.
*  And I wouldn't be here partly without him.
*  But that was part of the calculation.
*  I know that's deep, but I know that's well, God, I hate myself right now.
*  But
*  but Cuss, he knew he was getting out free.
*  He knew he was going to not have to be there.
*  He was he was getting off easy.
*  Teddy, how do you say someone's going to be dead?
*  They're getting off easy.
*  Well, I'll say it again in case you didn't hear me.
*  All right.
*  He was going to get off easy and not have to face where he came up short
*  because he did his job.
*  He was going to get off easy.
*  He was going to get off easy.
*  He came up short because he did his job
*  because he put forward the greatest fight of all time.
*  And you guys screwed it up.
*  And he knew that that might happen.
*  But you guys screwed it up.
*  And whatever.
*  That's your fault.
*  That's on. I tell you, Tyson will be mad at this, but that's on Tyson.
*  How can you say that, Teddy? He loved me.
*  I'm not saying he didn't love you, but he loved him.
*  He loved some other stuff, too.
*  And I don't know if Tyson could ever come to grips like with that.
*  And it's not his job to.
*  But it's my job not to hide from it.
*  I know custom dimensions that other people just
*  only think they know.
*  Did Cuss know? Did Cuss know this about himself?
*  Did he reflect? Did he introspect?
*  He sent a message to me.
*  Cuss sent a guy to me.
*  My wife was pregnant.
*  We were living in an apartment in Catskill on Cordeskill Road.
*  We went through all this, you know, and I was getting ready to move to Staten Island.
*  And we still were there for a little while before we did.
*  You know, after all this went down.
*  He sent a guy to me.
*  To the house.
*  Secret, whatever you want to call it.
*  My wife, me.
*  So I listened to him.
*  Cuss said, if you leave, I'm a messenger, you know, whatever.
*  If you leave.
*  This was in the aftermath of what the gun, the whole thing.
*  You got to remember Tyson was a ward of the state.
*  He was put in Cuss's custody.
*  Cuss was looking to adopt him.
*  For obvious reasons. So he had control and he loved him.
*  How dare I say anything less?
*  I won't.
*  But it made sense, too.
*  But he was a ward of the state still.
*  Do you know what that means?
*  There's rules.
*  Means the state's still overlooking it.
*  If he ain't living the right life, you know.
*  You got to remember, he came out of a jail.
*  So reform school.
*  But if he ain't living the right life, he could be taken away from Cuss.
*  What's not living the right life?
*  Well, he wasn't in school no more.
*  They didn't know about it.
*  He had some things that were going on.
*  We won't get into that right now in school and different things, whatever.
*  And he had his trainer put a gun to his head.
*  That is so good.
*  If a report came back to them that that happened.
*  He would have been taken away from Cuss.
*  That couldn't happen.
*  Look, nobody knows this.
*  I talk about it a little bit, but never probably.
*  Because why would I?
*  I don't know. Why am I doing it now?
*  I don't know. Because I don't know.
*  Because I am. Because it's now.
*  Because it's now, maybe. Maybe because it's now.
*  I don't know.
*  So he sent this man
*  that, you know, obviously we both knew.
*  And he said, here's the deal, Teddy.
*  If no talk about this wants it to, you know, disappear, basically, you leave.
*  And he will give you five percent his word.
*  Can you imagine?
*  He will
*  he will give you five percent of Tyson's earnings for the rest of his career.
*  And but I don't regret it one bit because it wouldn't happen anyway.
*  See, that's where I I could be honest with my people.
*  Oh, stand up guy, because I told him to shove it with, you know,
*  you know, in that place and and until Cuss to shove it in that freaking play.
*  You know, I was mad.
*  Teddy, Teddy, don't get angry.
*  Don't get angry.
*  Are you out of you serious?
*  Get out of here and tell them to go shove it over.
*  And, you know, my wife is like, huh, but
*  and then people like it, why did you take the deal?
*  It wasn't a deal.
*  It was an escape clause.
*  For Cuss, it was it was a it was an insurance policy that is, you know,
*  this kid wouldn't be taken away from and thank God he wasn't.
*  I wasn't going to go and say nothing.
*  They didn't have to worry about because forgot who I was
*  because forgot why he went to court for me
*  because of those because of those characteristics that he said he loved
*  and he noticed and that he admired.
*  I didn't lose those characters.
*  He forgot that that was me.
*  He forgot who he was talking to.
*  He didn't have to do that.
*  How about that's why I told him to shove it up his ass, not because of the other
*  insult.
*  And then and then when people said to me, oh, you would stand up because it was
*  around a little bit, it was around in the circles.
*  And then when people stand up, Teddy, he didn't care about the money.
*  I said, stand up, Teddy.
*  What are you talking about?
*  How about how about just realistic, Teddy?
*  How about I live in a real world that I was never going to get that money?
*  So I'm saying I'm standing up to something that I knew never existed.
*  So I ain't stand up.
*  Not in that way.
*  I am in other ways, maybe.
*  But not don't don't put a medal on my chest for that because because that never
*  existed and it was never meant to exist.
*  But he didn't even understand.
*  That was the one thing that that really disappointed me.
*  Because I was like, because you really allowed this to get to you.
*  Well, you know, you've allowed it to.
*  Really fog up your thinking to the point where you're smarter than that.
*  You're better than that.
*  That you would actually think you got a
*  freaking offer me a freaking pieces of silver.
*  Yeah, you really think that that's what you think you like.
*  All that you told me that you love me and that we were I was the young master and
*  all this and you think you were going to buy me.
*  And I was going to and that was going to keep me quiet.
*  How about I would keep quiet because I would always keep quiet.
*  So he thought maybe you might betray him.
*  Isn't that interesting? Yeah.
*  And why did he think that?
*  No, no, really, fear.
*  Yeah, but yeah, fear is at the essence of everything is connected with everything.
*  Fear of losing what he was going to lose.
*  But it was more than fear.
*  It was him not believing in the things that he told me he believed in.
*  He didn't even know that.
*  He believed in me because I was a
*  standup guy, because I because I didn't sell myself, because because I, you know,
*  I didn't freaking turn evidence, I didn't make a deal, I didn't do it.
*  And that's why I went to court.
*  That's why he stood up for me.
*  And I appreciate it.
*  And that was what he lived by.
*  And that was his, you know, those were the blocks of being a man.
*  Well, so much for those blocks.
*  Well, it's like you said, loyalty
*  requires, you know, he would have had to take a risk.
*  I'm losing immortality that he achieved by creating a great heavyweight champion.
*  100 percent.
*  But the only way you ever find out if somebody is hard, that's hard, is to test.
*  And it was cut.
*  This is Shakespearean, you know, the story
*  because it's homing because it and it just come in different forms.
*  Yeah.
*  I said, all right, because this was his test.
*  And some people face this test because they're able to pass that test because
*  it's not really a test, not for them, because it doesn't speak to their weakness.
*  But it's the test that speaks to the weakness.
*  That's the one.
*  So this one, I get it.
*  I get what it spoke to, because you know what?
*  At the end of the day, I forgive you.
*  And I feel bad for you.
*  I feel bad that you were put in that position after you lived your life that way
*  and that you that you taught that and you preached that from the mountaintops
*  that that you had to be.
*  That you had to be.
*  I'm not going to use the word, but.
*  That that you had to fail yourself
*  and that you had to somehow know that before you died,
*  I just pray that you didn't know that and you still don't know that because you
*  were great, you were great.
*  And.
*  And you've given me some.
*  And you've given me some to.
*  To aspire towards.
*  To try to.
*  Try to be less weak.
*  Try to be better.
*  And try to be.
*  As good as you.
*  Want it to be.
*  I wish I can someday.
*  More importantly, I wish I could make my father.
*  You know.
*  Feel.
*  Just feel good up there.
*  Your grandfather now.
*  Yeah, for grandchildren.
*  What if you give them advice on how to live a life?
*  They can be proud of.
*  Just.
*  Do everything you can.
*  To the best of your ability every day.
*  To like yourself.
*  Give yourself a reason to actually say I'd like to be friends with that guy.
*  Is loyalty one of the reasons?
*  One of the things to aspire to.
*  Loyalty is your chance.
*  To have a fulfilled life.
*  Loyalty is your chance to.
*  To have strength.
*  To have all the things you need to have a good life.
*  To be a good parent.
*  Be a good husband.
*  Be a good grandfather.
*  Hopefully be a good role model.
*  Loyalty.
*  This.
*  Loyalty is if you could find something to drink.
*  To take into your body.
*  To make you prepared for life, to to be all the things that you want to be.
*  To be strong enough to be those things.
*  Loyalty would be the thing you would drink.
*  And and when I say loyal.
*  I mean, unequivocally, I mean, you know, unconditionally.
*  Not conveniently.
*  Obviously, you know that.
*  If you could be loyal.
*  You could be a good person.
*  You could be a person that you would actually like to be around.
*  Because you could be a person you could rely on.
*  And I think that's one of the greatest.
*  Assets that a human being can have.
*  And what do you do when you're betrayed?
*  How do you overcome that?
*  You think of what you learn from it.
*  Use it as a road map.
*  To remember and to think back of how you got there.
*  And how you got to the place where you got
*  betrayed and how that person got to that place.
*  Try to remember that in your own journey.
*  Has it for you made you cynical?
*  How do you try?
*  How do you take the leap of trust towards.
*  People again and again after that,
*  just by remembering that I'm still trying to forgive myself for the things that I
*  came up short with, and if I haven't figured that out yet,
*  it's probably OK.
*  To say.
*  They didn't figure it out yet.
*  They didn't get it.
*  They didn't figure it out.
*  And if I couldn't figure it out and I'm still trying to figure it out.
*  Maybe I could get over that.
*  Initial stabbing of
*  where it feels like it does feel kind of like a stabbing
*  that you that you feel when you betrayed initially and that you could only think
*  of anger,
*  revenge, hatred,
*  and those things, I'm not I'm not proud of that, but I'm but.
*  I felt all those things, you know, and I still feel sometimes.
*  And then I go back and say, hey,
*  you still work and forgiving yourself for some things.
*  Try to remember that kid, you know.
*  That is an important thing.
*  Forgetfulness is pretty important, too.
*  And.
*  Try to remember why we forget.
*  Why do we forget?
*  Because it wasn't something you felt proud of.
*  You think about your death.
*  Are you afraid of it?
*  You know, it's funny you asked that.
*  I never used to think about it.
*  I know people in both places, you know,
*  I know they're not a cover.
*  You're going to be all right.
*  Don't forget that.
*  I know people in both places.
*  Yeah.
*  Both neighborhoods.
*  I
*  I am.
*  I've been I've been given credit for being brave in certain spots in life.
*  I hope I can.
*  Be brave when it comes time to leave life.
*  I hope I can be, you know, and that's, you know, that's just
*  that's real and honestly, I'm not proud of it.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  That's real and honest as you can be about it.
*  I hope I can be, you know, so far so good.
*  You know, when when I've had to be
*  certain things that was scared to freaking death,
*  I found a way to beat them for the most part.
*  And so I figured when
*  that day comes,
*  I figure that out, too.
*  It's gonna be another test, maybe the last one.
*  Teddy.
*  It's a huge honor to talk to you.
*  It's my pleasure.
*  Thank you for being the human you are, for being honest,
*  honest about the full range of human nature.
*  And thank you for talking to me.
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me.
*  And
*  thanks for listening.

*  and live the rest of your life as a champion.
*  Thank you for listening.
*  I hope to see you next time.
