# Mark Normand: Comedy! | Lex Fridman Podcast #255
**Lex Fridman:** [January 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzsivT_Ap1w)
*  The following is a conversation with Mark Normand, a New York comedian who has a way with words that
*  is often both dark and hilarious. Let there be a warning, dear friends, to proceed with caution
*  and to wear protection. You may, in fact, need it. He has a special on his YouTube called Out to
*  Lunch and a new special on Netflix as part of the stand-up season three series I recommend you watch.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now here's my conversation with Mark Normand.
*  I asked him, Dylan, about Bukowski first. So let me continue on that tradition and ask you about
*  something that Charles Bukowski said about love. Wait, are we rolling? Yes. Oh, geez. No, hello.
*  Nothing. Nope. I thought I was robotic. Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away with the first
*  daylight of reality. So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love. What are your thoughts about
*  love? You talk about your relationships quite a bit. Do you think love can last? I do, but I think
*  it's work. Everybody wants love to be this pre-packaged, perfect, euphoric thing, but you
*  got to, it's like a good body, you know? We're all born with a good body, but you got to keep it in
*  shape. And it's the same with a loving relationship. I think you, nobody wants to do the work. That's
*  the problem. You talked about, I think you told a story about being unfaithful to a previous
*  girlfriend or something like that. I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart.
*  Who are you talking to? Bert Kreischer maybe or something like that? Oh, yeah. High school
*  sweethearts dated for like 12 years and then... So that wasn't love anymore. That was more like
*  relationship. That was like... It was comfort. It was routine. And we just slipped into that kind of
*  married life, autopilot world. And I tried to break up, I think, and it didn't take. It was one of
*  those things. Our lives are just so baked in. And then I think I cheated and she caught me and it
*  was ugly. And then we went to therapy to try to work it out. But it's much like a car that gets
*  into a wreck. The door just never closed the same. You know what I mean? Yeah. So what are your
*  thoughts about the commitment outside of love marriage? I think it's an antiquated idea. I
*  think it's kind of silly and unrealistic. And I think we're coming out of that as we get all
*  polyamorous and non-binary and queefy and all this stuff. I think we're slowly moving away from that.
*  I think a lot of the ladies, more majority women, like marriage, like the idea of it.
*  Like I'm a fianc√© now or whatever you call it. I'm engaged. And I mean she is just going hog wild.
*  She's loving it. She's got the dress thing, pick a venue, flower. And she's deep in whereas I feel
*  guilty because I'm just like, ah, geez. Is it planned already? What's the wedding?
*  You see Squid Game? I'm just living life. Yeah. It's planned. It's in New Orleans. I'm from there.
*  And it's next year. Are you married? No, single. Virgin? Of course. Yeah. I can't imagine. I bet
*  you'd be great in bed. You're ripped. You have the best hairline in podcasting. Yeah, I don't know.
*  I haven't tried yet. So we'll have to see. All right. Well, let me know. Pretty big hog on you.
*  Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown. That matters to girls. Apparently,
*  yeah. That's all I hear about. Okay. New Orleans. You grew up in New Orleans? Yeah. Born and raised.
*  Treme. Outside the French Quarter. You ever been? Yeah. Don't remember it. Oh, you drink? Yeah, I drink.
*  Of course I drink. I don't know. I can't tell if you have fun. No, not really. But Russian, I mean
*  Russian, of course I drink vodka, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yes. I don't know. Vodka. Beer was
*  just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011. Fun fact. What do you mean? In Russia. It was just
*  drinks. It was just like apple juice before. It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic
*  beverage. Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing. I guess so. Yeah. See, that's where
*  your brain goes. Yeah. I just go, oh, these fucking Russkies are- I didn't even know there was rules
*  about drinking. This is good. I'm learning about Russia from you. So what's the difficult memory
*  experience from childhood in New Orleans that made you the man you are today? I don't know if it made
*  me the man, but geez. I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood. I was the white kid in the
*  neighborhood. So I was automatically the odd man out, the minority, the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb.
*  The honky. So just a lot of memories of getting slapped in the face by guys and just having to
*  take it because there's like five guys there. And they'd be like, oh, look, you don't even fight back.
*  And you're like, well, what am I going to do? Hit you and then get beat up by these guys. So a lot of
*  that stuff was a big bummer growing up. Got robbed all the time. Lost a lot of bicycles.
*  Had a bicycle taken from under me. That was pretty brutal. These kids pulled up. They're like 17.
*  And I was 13 and I had a face paint on. Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp
*  and I had a rainbow face painted on me. We were helping kids that day. So I let them put paint on
*  me. And so now I'm riding home. What a mark. What a goober I am. I'm riding home and these guys see me
*  a mile away. I'm a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike. He's got a rainbow on his cheek.
*  So they just go, hey, you know, like cutting front of you. They go, let me try your bike. I go,
*  I'm good. I'm good. I knew what they wanted. And they go, let me try the bike. And then
*  just pushed me and took the bike. The stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity, the self
*  worth. They did. Cause I've been mugged when I was younger too. Really? Yeah. It changes your view of
*  human nature a little bit. For sure. You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean. Yeah.
*  Cool. Yeah. Inconsiderate. I'm always worried about it. Did I fart too much? Am I annoying?
*  Am I pissing this guy off? But what a way to live. Just I want the bike. I'm taking it.
*  Fuck his feelings. For me, that quickly turned into realizing that that's just a temporary
*  phase that those folks are in. Like they have a capacity to be good. Sure. For some reason,
*  for me, that was a motivation to see, can we discover, can we incentivize them to find a
*  better path in life? I wasn't all Gandhi about it. Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of
*  things, but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing you might do when you're younger.
*  You hope. But this is adult crime, obviously. Yeah, I know. But yeah, exactly. And then it
*  solidifies and then you'll be on saving at some point. But there's always an opportunity to
*  make a better life for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.
*  Yeah. And I remember coming home crying with no bike and my parents were like liberal to a fault,
*  where they were like, oh, well, they need it. They're poor kids in the neighborhood. And you're
*  like, all right. But I also have a bicycle that I ride around. And I also like to live in an area
*  that's not just riddled with theft and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it. And
*  then it was a moot point, we just moved on. So I remember very young being like, all right, I got
*  to figure my shit out. Okay. So you said you were beat up quite a bit, like bullying and stuff?
*  Pushed around. I was never hospitalized or anything, but you get a black guy here and there
*  and a bloody nose, stuff like that. And it was just the outnumbered thing. The violence didn't
*  really bother me because you're just kids, you're boys. But it was the predatory, let's get him.
*  We can take him down. He's an easy target. That's what kills you, the mental part.
*  Yeah. Until you actually said it, I didn't realize. I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles.
*  And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah.
*  Let's hear it, fatty. Bring it on. And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right? Yeah.
*  You can see the guns through the suit. You're like John Wick. All right. Well, I used to have,
*  now you're going to start making fun of me. I used to have long hair for like a couple of years.
*  I was in a band playing music and stuff like that. And there was, like most of the fights I've been
*  in were basically one-on-one, maybe a little bit like a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.
*  And this one particular time, I've learned a lot of lessons, but one of them was,
*  there was a fight started between me and this other person. And then his buddies, I guess,
*  were there. And they, as opposed to like breaking it up or letting it happen, one of them grabbed
*  my hair. It's the first time anybody grabbed, like used my hair in a fight, which I've since
*  then realized that that's actually a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon. Oh, very
*  vulnerable of you. And then my head got pulled back and they pulled me down to the ground.
*  I couldn't do anything. It was so, I remember being exceptionally frustrated. Yes. That was
*  the feeling like I can't do anything here. I'm like trapped. And then they were just like, yeah,
*  kicking me and hitting me and stuff like that. And the outnumbered part of it,
*  because I always kind of remember the trapped part because I just hated from a fighting,
*  grappling perspective, how like the feeling was this isn't fair. Yes, that's what it is.
*  It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't, you can't win. The mob wins. Yeah, the mob wins.
*  Scary stuff. But it makes a man out of you in a weird way. They build character. You realize life
*  isn't fair early and you go on from there. So there's something there. And look at you today.
*  They're probably eating out of a dumpster at a Krispy Kreme and you're here, got eight podcasts.
*  You're doing great talking to giant titans of the industry. No, I do remember returning home that
*  night. I mean that you said you were crying. That's really formative. Like, oh yeah, that's the point
*  in which you get to decide what do I make of this moment? I mean, especially when you're younger,
*  maybe it's not presented to you that way, but like some of the greatest people in history
*  were bullied in these kinds of ways and they made something of themselves in this moment,
*  bullied by life in some kind of way. It's like an opportunity for growth. It's weird, but like
*  hardship, even in small doses, is like an opportunity for growth.
*  Totally. I mean, look at Richard Pryor. They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time.
*  Grew up in a whorehouse, watched his mom get plowed by these guys in the middle of Indiana,
*  I want to say. And who had a harder life? He would suck dick for drugs, all this stuff growing up,
*  beat up. And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry, that's my birth control alarm.
*  And then the whole world is like trying to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying,
*  but now it's accepted bullying. It's very strange. So you're a proponent of beating kids up?
*  Yes, and sex with them. All right. But no, I just think it's part of life and it's horrible. It's
*  like rain. You got to have it. Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it. And I think it's
*  similar to that. What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad? What are some memorable
*  moments with them? What did you learn from them? Good parents, the giving, thoughtful,
*  a little out to lunch. They were workaholics, so it was hard to get a lot out of them.
*  My dad was kind of an angry dad. I think he just had a weird childhood and he's just trying to
*  make it and he's trying to provide, but it's hard. We live in this horrible neighborhood and we're
*  getting robbed all the time. So life was kind of coming down on him all the time. So then he'll
*  take it out on you or whoever he would snap. But great parents, they cared, they put us first.
*  But there wasn't a lot of... You ever go to a friend's house as a kid and there's a
*  picture of a ski trip and you're like, ski trip? What the hell is that about? It wasn't a lot of
*  that and very smart people, but I don't know how well they were at socializing. So you never
*  bonded with them on a deep human level? Some bonding, but rarely deep. Yeah, it was just
*  almost co-worker. It called out. What? It's called out, huh? Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff. Yeah,
*  yeah, yeah. Got you. Get there a little bit, but my parents have done it. I hope they never do this.
*  But they would do a thing where my dad especially would do a thing where he would...
*  He knew how to cut you down right to the bone. And so after a while, you're like,
*  I'm not even gonna interact with this guy because he can get you so well. One time we were at a
*  Thanksgiving, some kind of family event, and all the cousins are there. And I remember I was holding
*  court. I was a young boy finding my comedic legs in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family
*  and I was killing. And my dad comes out and he goes, what are you holding court? And I was like,
*  ah, and I felt like I was this big. I just shrunk down. He just nailed it. Because in my head,
*  I'm like, I'm holding court. Look at me. I got the whole room. And he goes, what are you holding
*  court here? Who the hell do you think you are? And I was like, he's right. I shouldn't be holding
*  court. Who the fuck am I? I'm nobody. So stuff like that. Was he aware of that, you think? He
*  wasn't. He wasn't. I don't think he was. But
*  do you give parents a pass when they're unaware of the destructive? Like, is it better when they're
*  unaware? Because it seems like that's the way that's true. That's the way parents often fail is
*  they're not intentionally malevolent. They're just like clueless. Yeah. It's a bittersweet thing
*  because you're like, well, okay, he's not malicious. He's not trying to hurt me. But also,
*  he doesn't know he hurt me. I don't know. It's tough because if he was trying to hurt you,
*  I guess that would be worse. So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point. What do you
*  fruit salad, you know, the sense of self worth you mentioned.
*  And I think in your comedy, there's a sense like you hate yourself.
*  You think I didn't know if that came through. Shit. I was trying to hide that part. God damn
*  it. I mean, when you like in the privacy of your mind, are you able to love yourself or is it mostly
*  self hate? Geez, what happened to this podcast? I didn't know it was on a Mr. or Dr. Phil,
*  Dr. Phil. I thought we were going to talk about engineering and climate change and rockets.
*  Okay. Starts with love goes to rockets. All right. I like that. I like that's a t shirt.
*  I mean, like what's the question? Sorry. Do I feel love? No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. So are you
*  like this engine of being self critical of just being constantly anxious about how the world
*  perceives you, these kinds of things? Is this something that you just go to for comedy or is
*  this who you are as a human being? I think I don't want to explore it. I think I get around it.
*  You know, I tap dance around it, but I get it out a little with my act maybe because I can't do it.
*  I'm not doing it in real life. So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself. I don't know
*  who wants to love themselves. Everybody always like, you got to love yourself. And then when
*  you meet somebody who does love yourself, you're like, I fucking hate this guy.
*  Don't you hate the guy who's upset? I'm great. I'm awesome. Life is good. Like, ah, this guy sucks.
*  I'd rather an insecure guy. So maybe I want to stay insecure. Maybe I don't want to find this
*  love for myself. Well, okay. So self love, like just appreciating who you are, or like appreciating
*  the moment of being grateful doesn't have to express itself by the guy saying, I'm awesome.
*  True. It's more just like humility. It's just like walking calmly through the world and just
*  being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing. And just, and like, oh, being appreciative of all
*  the accomplishments you made so far. I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical
*  in everything I do. And so, uh, and I kind of enjoy it. I think it's a nice little engine that
*  it makes it fun. It makes life fun. Cause it's like, if you hate everything you do, like you've
*  done in the past, that gives you like, all right, we can do better. Yes. But that's the key is
*  making yourself critical. Always trying to get better. I could change this. I could tweak this.
*  I can improve this. When you just go, I hate that I do this. I suck. You just shut down. So that's
*  the key is, is always being productive with the, uh, with the criticism. Yeah. And the basics of
*  life. I'm just like grateful for it to be alive. That's nice to be a couple, like couple that with,
*  two legs, again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles, the, the, the world, you got a good brain on you.
*  I mean, you're, you're lucky. You're in the top, you know, most people are fat as shit at Burger
*  King right now, hitting their kids. Yeah. You're in a Ramada hotel sitting with, uh, you know,
*  a low level comedian for the record. I ate McDonald's last night. Well, you're human.
*  Well, just so you know, this is not me defending. I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly
*  eat meat and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have. It's actually one of the easiest ways
*  late at night. I think it's worse. I don't know if it's actually, it's actually rats. Yeah, you're
*  right. But Hey, it's just meat. I'm a meat guy myself. Uh, they say in 20 years, we're going to
*  look back and go, uh, can you believe people ate meat? It's gonna be like slavery. Yeah. There's
*  some ethical difficult things with factory farming. Yeah. So let's ride it out now while we still got
*  it. And now it's on record. Tom Waits says something about New York. You like Tom Waits?
*  I think he's underrated. I think he's got great. He's got a great, uh, he's great equips and quotes.
*  Check him out on, on YouTube. He's got some montages and super cuts of him being hilarious.
*  What does he say about, um, I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.
*  That was the one that was the one that sold me. I was like, this guy's awesome. Yeah. But
*  his music is, he's just a genius musician. Yeah. Anyway, he was talking about New York.
*  I was walking around these, I'm in New York right now. We're in New York right now. It's still a
*  magical city to me. A lot of people are quite cynical about it, about the state of things, but
*  not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine. They're just a lot of folks in San
*  Francisco, New York, there's something about the pandemic where people have become quite cynical
*  about the place they are and they tried to escape. It's interesting. I mean, they're asking some
*  difficult questions about what they are in life. They're having like a self-imposed midlife crisis
*  is good. I think for everybody to go through this process, but I think I hope New York re-emerges
*  it will as the flourishing place for the weirdos. Anyway, the Tom Wade said New York, of course,
*  is to be in endless surreal situations where a $50,000 gun metal Mercedes pulls up in a puddle
*  of blood and outstops a 25 karat blonde with a $2 wristwatch. He keeps going on.
*  That's like bars. He's like a rapper. Yeah, he's good. But basically, just the absurdity of it all.
*  Lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates and dreamers and the whole mix of it. Do you think
*  that's an accurate description of what New York is today? Is there still place for the weirdos
*  and just the interesting artists, the edgy, the comedians, the creators, the entrepreneurs,
*  as opposed to Wall Street, as opposed to rich folk and then hopeless folk?
*  Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot. There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.
*  New York used to be where you went to make it as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer,
*  and there were all these dives and shit boxes and all these places you could go.
*  Now it's more pink berries and Subway sandwiches and Chase Banks. So it's definitely lost a lot of
*  its creative edge. It's just money. Money keeps coming in and now you see all these comedians
*  move to Nashville, Austin, Denver, whatever. So it doesn't have the power it used to have of like,
*  you got to be here if you want to make it. That's definitely gone. So that hurt the city a lot. The
*  city is way more soulless. When I moved here in 07, I mean, not only did I get mugged three times
*  in the first year, but it was a hub of like, it felt like things were happening here. It was an
*  energy. It was electricity. And we still have the electricity, but it's also maybe just because
*  it's Times Square, there's SoHo, there's Wall Street. So we got the staples, but there is a
*  little bit of that. It's almost like a marriage. Like, yeah, we're in love, but it's not as
*  passionate as it once was. That's how I would equate New York. What gives you hope? You're
*  pretty hopeful about it though. I'm hopeful just because I know it's magical and I think it has to
*  be. I mean, it's the epicenter of America. Like this is where the immigrants came and this is where
*  the stock market is and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here. So I think it's
*  going to happen, but something like the bottom has to fall out and then people have to move back
*  here and all that. So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us. They're just buying
*  everything. Well, that's true for everything. It's true for Austin probably as well. People
*  are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff. You always hear of Hemingway and Dali and
*  all these guys went to Paris in the 20s or whatever that was. I get it now. I just be like,
*  why do these guys go to Paris? Why are these artists? And now I get it because it's freer
*  there. That's why Austin became like that Paris where everybody's like, I got to get out of LA.
*  I'm going there. But we came back from that. The 70s were wild and 90s were cool. So maybe it'll
*  come back. I just take a decade. Well, there's always, that's how stories are told. There's
*  always pockets of like Paris within New York. There's just an opportunity to let your weird
*  flourish is there in New York. I'm sure there. I mean, it's there. You got to find it before it
*  was front and center. What's your favorite thing about New York? Like what kind of things just like,
*  I mean, how long is this pod? I could go on. It's too much to put into one hour. We've got
*  other questions, but I love that one neighborhood is wildly different than the next. I'm in little
*  Italy and then you take four steps. Now I'm in Chinatown. I mean, and then the history there
*  and then the stories and the food and the culture and all that. And then you go 10 feet over here.
*  Now you're in Brooklyn and this is insane. It's the whole other world. And it's almost like a
*  little America in one, you know, a city and it's great. And just the fact that they pulled it off,
*  like Fifth Avenue goes way up and you're like, there's a billionaire's house next to a hobo.
*  And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy and an Asian guy is trying to get in
*  the middle of them. And the cabbies from the middle East. And there's so many beautiful women here.
*  And there's so many brilliant minds here. And the pace is great. It keeps people moving. I mean,
*  it just, you can't beat it. And the city will fuck you in the ass too. Don't get me wrong.
*  You landed JFK and you're like, Oh God, I got mugged. My Uber driver called me a homo. I stepped
*  in human shit. Where the fuck am I? So yeah, it's bad news, but that bad news, it's almost like the
*  bullying. It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger and you build more layers and layers
*  and layers. That's why some new guy, some hayseed from Milwaukee shows up. You've been here 10 years
*  and you go, let me, let me help you out. Cause you're, you, you got to adjust. You're going to
*  get your ass kicked for like six months, but I know the rope's a little, and I think you need a
*  little of that. If the treadmill's not on, you're not going to run. New York, the treadmill's on.
*  So it just makes you run and it makes you better. And look, it wears on you. You probably lose 10
*  years of your life living in New York versus, you know, Indianapolis, but it's a, you know,
*  it's a better life. Have you seen 25th hour? Yeah. It's been a while. Spike Lee joint.
*  Yeah. Spike Lee joint. I mean, at Norton, there's a, there's a whole like monologue there about New
*  York. They're talking about just, he has like a mix. There's like melancholy music, I think,
*  or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing. But there's an anger and a disgust with the city.
*  But through the anger and the disgust comes out like a love for the city. Same with,
*  was taxi driver in New York? Oh yeah. Yeah. So like that, there's something about the,
*  what is that? What is that, that grit of the city that like pushes you down?
*  Well, that's the beauty of the city is it's this tribal human nature, like the sex shops and fist
*  fights and racism and all tension, but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance and
*  sophistication on fifth avenue. So you get that juxtaposition. It's kind of like in Boston,
*  you go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Hobbit, they got all this shit. And then they got the
*  fishermen, the blue collar douchebags, the Irish guy, the immigrants, you know, and you get that
*  mix of like insanely smart with wicked piss and these, these two worlds. And that's,
*  that's a good thing. It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady, that's a good looking kid.
*  You get a mix, you know, we're mixing two totally different things. They're coming together and it
*  makes it, it's like peanut butter and chocolate. Peanut butter and chocolate. I've never tried
*  that. What? Maybe I have. I'm talking about Reese's. Like Reese's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  The best candy. Yeah. Without the fakeness of LA, without the, without the kind of,
*  um, with the facade. Yeah. LA is tough. What's the difference between, uh, LA comedy,
*  New York comedy to you? I think one place you kind of go to make it and be discovered
*  and be loved. And one place you go, you can, you can get all that in New York too,
*  but I think in New York, it's more of a, a school, a bootcamp of comedy. Let's make great
*  comedy. Let's make original comedy. Let's watch the other guys and gals who were at the show,
*  at the clubs and learn from them and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them.
*  And in LA it's like, when am I on? I'm next. Get out of my way. I'm the star here. I'm a bigger star
*  than you. Oh, this guy's actually a big star. I got to outwork, you know, it's just a lot of that
*  instead of like, damn, that was funny. I got to be that funny. Damn. I wish I had a joke. And look,
*  I don't want to speak for LA comics because there's, you know, Bill Burr, Anthony Jezelnik,
*  brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth in New York. Just saying. Then they moved to LA.
*  That's a good point. You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics, but New York,
*  started New York, moved to New York. There is something about comics that's
*  staying in New York for a long time though, like Dave Attell. Oh, you know about Dave?
*  Yeah. He wants to do this podcast. He does? Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Dave Attell. But it's like,
*  he'd almost like he doesn't want to make it. I don't know. I mean, you probably know him,
*  but like, it feels like you just, maybe it's romanticizing it, but you're like,
*  you almost just love the art of comedy. Of like becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,
*  becoming funnier than the other comics, like competing with each other kind of thing,
*  not over like money or fame or any of that. Just purely the comedy of it.
*  Totally. That's Dave. That's him in a nutshell. He's like that guy in the movies in the 80s,
*  action movies where they're like, they go up to a creek in Montana and some guys live in a cabin
*  and he's sharpening a stick and they go, the Russians are coming. They're invading. We need
*  you. You're the best commando. And he's like, I gave that up, man. I'm done with that lifestyle.
*  They're like, but you're the best. We need you. And he has to suit up eventually. He looks at a
*  picture of his dead wife and he goes, fuck it, I'm going. And then they fight the Ruskies. But
*  he's that guy. He just is gifted. He's like got a gift from Allah and he's the best.
*  Yeah. A lot of comics give him props. It's so surprising to me. I didn't,
*  surprising to me because he hasn't really made it like big.
*  Well, he did in the 90s. He was huge. He had his own TV show. He was the-
*  Yeah, that show was awesome. But I mean, as big as I think he deserves to be.
*  Well, that's art. The mainstream shit is always the worst. It's like McDonald's versus some hole
*  in the wall. I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good. And certain comics we could
*  name are good, but the delicacy is going to be less talked about and less household namey than
*  the mainstream hacky shit. Yeah. It's funny because he hasn't,
*  I think he was on Joe Rogan's show once maybe. Yeah, once or twice.
*  And he was with somebody else. Jeff Ross?
*  Yeah. He might've known Jeff Ross. Oh yeah. Cause they did that like two mics thing.
*  With mics, yeah. But he's the quickest guy. There's no one funnier.
*  Yeah. Him and you, you're super quick. Your appearance on recent appearance on Roblox
*  hilarious. Oh thanks.
*  Just so fast. You're on with Ari and- Shane Gillis.
*  Shane Gillis. Yeah, that was fun. We're going back in January.
*  This will never come out. Neither will you.
*  We're having fun. Yep. All right. So what does it feel like
*  to bomb in standup comedy? Like to fail? Maybe the psychology of it first. Like
*  just take me through it. Cause you were talking about being outnumbered in a fight,
*  just being beat up. Very similar. By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I like catching clips.
*  It's great. It's kind of nice to be with my people. But yeah.
*  Do you need a sheet of paper to look at? I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there.
*  Yeah. It's a nightmare, but it's part of it. It's the validation too is the worst part.
*  Whenever you do comedy and kill, you can be a great comic, but even David Tell,
*  all these brilliant guys, they feel like you're getting away with something.
*  I don't have a day job. I'm telling jokes for a living. I'm talking about my dick up here and
*  they're loving me and they call me a genius and all this. I'm talking about my sack.
*  And it's great. It makes people happy and it's funny. But that bombing, when you bomb,
*  you go, your first thought is like, yeah, you're right. At first you're like,
*  fuck you guy. What? You don't like this shit? And then you just start going in. You're like,
*  man, maybe it isn't that good. Maybe they're right. I do suck. I knew I sucked. I should
*  become a mailman. And it stinks and you feel alone and you feel like you wasted their time.
*  And then you're like, what was I thinking? I could be a comedian. What the fuck? Who am I?
*  Eddie Murphy? What am I doing here? So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.
*  But I also love that it hurts so bad. Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn't do
*  it. I think a lot more people could do comedy probably and figure it out. But the bombing is
*  so brutal that it keeps a... One time I went to Minneapolis. I was like, this is a great city.
*  Sun is shining. Why isn't this city packed? And they're like, because the winters are so bad.
*  And we love it because it keeps everybody out. And I feel like the same about comedy. The bombs are
*  so brutal. I've had bombs where I'm in bed. I'm just staring at the ceiling like, what the fuck
*  was that? You have PTSD. I bombed at an arena once. 20,000 people. I did 30 minutes to silence.
*  So it's not just like one joke fails. It's like they start piling on. It's irrecoverable.
*  Yes. And one joke failing is very common. A lot of audiences don't even notice that bomb.
*  Because you get so many jokes in a row. You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one, then a good
*  one. But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose, we don't like you. Nothing you say will
*  redeem yourself. And it's hard to get out of. It's like being pulled down by your hair. You can't get
*  back. I can't win this fight no matter what. Can you get him back by acknowledging the
*  elf in the room? That helps, but they're still going to go, that was funny when he made fun of
*  it, but he sucks. He still sucks. He still sucks. That's the worst part. You're going, no, this is
*  good. You guys just don't like me. Just because you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad. Yeah. I
*  like going to open mics a lot. Just listening because first of all, I think the audience in
*  open mic, at least the ones I've been to, is most I guess other comedians. Or at least people who
*  don't seem to want to laugh at anything. And so I just love it because it's human nature and
*  perseverance that is best. Here's comedians. Clearly, this is mostly in Austin. They have a
*  dream. Why would you get up there? Maybe some weird New Year's resolution bullshit, but for the most
*  part, it's people who want to be comedians. A lot of the open micers are people who have clearly
*  have done this for quite a long time already, at least a year or two, maybe five years.
*  They're often not very funny. Just bombing in front of an audience of like 20, where they're
*  just sitting there, almost mocking them with their eyes. And I don't know, and they still push
*  through. They still, as if they're doing an arena and everybody's laughing. They still got that
*  energy trying, almost like to an audience that doesn't exist. An audience of their dreams,
*  because I guess you have to do that to keep the energy of the act going. And it's just so
*  beautiful to watch them try it. And also what happens, open mic, I don't know, five minutes,
*  whatever they do, they walk off and then walk back off stage. Who do they look at? Do you
*  make eye contact with people? Do you? You look at your phone, you look at your feet,
*  you just zone out. You kind of go white. You just hear white noise and go out. It's tough.
*  But you need a little delusion to be a comedian. To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.
*  Like, you think you can do this? You got 10 years ahead of you of hell and you're up for this?
*  And most comics, we see a horrible crowd and we see our friend bomb and we go,
*  yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him. I'll get him. And then you don't get him. But that's
*  human nature too. It's like, they don't like him, but they'll like me. And you need a little of that
*  to keep going as a comedian. But you don't want too much delusion because then you're a psycho.
*  But you need a little. Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy. That's true too. I mentioned
*  to you offline that I talked to Elon and we talked about doing stand-up that he's thinking maybe do
*  a few minutes of stand-up. I would say if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha. Well, maybe you should
*  move to Austin to coach him full-time. Hopefully he can fly me in. So what advice would you give
*  to somebody who wants to try to do five minutes? Like the early steps of trying to go to an open
*  mic and say something funny? Well, that's the irony of comedy is, I don't know if it's irony,
*  but it's like the beginning is the hardest part. Usually the beginning is the easy part. Hey,
*  I'm playing this level of Mario. I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever. And then the end
*  is like, Jesus Christ, I got 30 guys coming at me. Comedy is the opposite. The beginning is like,
*  it's a gauntlet. It's just obstacles. And it's like you said, open mics. I watch these famous
*  comedians on Netflix and you go, this would all bomb an open mic. They're killing in Radio City.
*  This would bomb an open mic. That's the weird part. So it's almost you have to go through hell
*  just to get to the promised land. And I would say rehearse the shit out of it because you're
*  going to get frazzled up there. Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material. But you also forget
*  about the other part of delivering it, having confidence, being likable, having timing, having
*  a cadence, figuring out who you are, figure out what the audience thinks you are or how they
*  perceive you. Because you can go up there and say all this, but they go, why is the guy, he's clearly
*  gay. Why is he acting like he's not gay? That's all that now they're not listening to the joke.
*  So you got to know how you look. And it's just repetition, repetition. And bombing is not failure.
*  That's what you got to remember. I mean, look, if you do a killer hour and then you take it to
*  Netflix and bomb, you fucked up. But bombing is not failure. It's just data. It's going, oh,
*  okay, I got to retool that. That didn't work. Something's wrong there. I missed a word there.
*  So you got to treat the act almost like ingredients in a cooking, in a dish. Like,
*  oh, I put too many eggs in. Take an egg out. You got to treat it like that. And look, when you pull
*  a bad cake out of an oven, you go, I fucked up. But it doesn't hurt your feelings. But when you
*  bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings. So you got to factor that in too. Your feelings
*  going to be hurt. And just almost be a robot and just keep going towards that open mic.
*  You know how scary an open mic is? Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians
*  is way worse because they know what just happened and they could have saved you and they didn't.
*  So it's way worse. And they're going to be your quote unquote friends for this journey.
*  Yeah, no, these are evil people. Twisted, fucked up, hurt people.
*  Can you tell, like in those early days, let's just talk about that, like at the open mic level,
*  that a joke is going to be good on paper. Like I'll give you my experience because
*  maybe you could be my coach in this particular moment.
*  Please. You're like Larry Nassar. That's fun, huh? Joking, everybody. I hope nobody takes it seriously.
*  I now have an amazing team of folks who helped me with editing and they're now currently sweating.
*  You got to leave that one in. That was quick. I'll eat that one.
*  That was good. All right. So, you know, going in front of an audience, just even to give a lecture
*  terrifies me, which I've done. But open mic, I mean that to me, perhaps that's why I like
*  going open mics and listening is because I just, it terrifies me so much. That idea of going up
*  there and bombing, I mean, it's scary. And to do even like one minute, to be honest, is scary.
*  And five minutes. I'm also watched enough open mics to realize that five minutes is a long time.
*  I mean, it depends on your comedy, but if you're doing fast stuff, five minutes is a really long
*  time. Oh, it's eternity. I guess with a long story, two is a long time because if the story's not
*  you're building up to something, if the story's going to fail, you just spent all that time telling
*  the story that completely went flat. Completely. You got nothing. I guess if you have a series of
*  jokes, you can at least try to recover and like do the Mitch Hedberg thing where like,
*  all right, I'll cross that off. Yeah. Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things
*  and I'm able to tell that it's really bad. Well, that's better than most. Most people's egos kick
*  in and go, no, this is good. No, see, I'm able to introspect that like, it seems funny. I mean,
*  I guess the thing I'm looking for is original. Like there's easy stuff that you think is funny,
*  but to me, originality is the thing you should be looking for because then, because then that's
*  what's actually becomes funny. Like, or rather if it's original, even if it bombs, that feels like
*  more a beautiful art creation that you did. Like at least you swung for it. Like you did something
*  unique because there's like even with open mic, your first five minutes, there's so many,
*  just go to enough open mics, you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes that you
*  can just go to. First of all, you can make fun of the fact that you're at open mic, that you're like
*  doing this the first time and so on. You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun of your appearance
*  in some way and so on. But like, yeah, you could do that. You know, that takes actually,
*  that's way harder than people realize to do in an original way to present who you are as a person
*  very quickly enough to then put that person down in front of everybody else. So you have to reveal
*  the audiences like that because they go, he knows what we're thinking. Yeah, exactly. But do it again
*  in an original way. And so like when I'm trying to write stuff, not that I've tried long, it's like
*  30 minutes, but I was enough to see like, oh shit, to write something original is really difficult.
*  It is. What do you, you got a bit, anything? No, you didn't write any one line or anything? For this?
*  No. Well, just in general, ever in your life, ever written a joke? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh,
*  okay. No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up. So the jokes that I've written
*  have more like, for some reason, my mind goes to like dark places. So, you know, like,
*  and not actually dark in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark to where it's like,
*  almost absurd. Yes. My natural inclination is to go to like a dark historical like place,
*  like Hitler and Stalin. Yeah. And almost, so go to that place and then
*  talk about something absurd there. So like, don't go like,
*  like all the way, I don't know, I don't want to give examples because it'd be clipped, but the,
*  but the Mark Norma style, look it up. He has a special on as you do.
*  Yeah. That kind. I want to almost explore the dark aspects of human nature more kind of
*  connected to actual historical figures. That's the inclination. Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal,
*  the Instagram channel that explores like the darkness of nature. Yes. Like something there.
*  See, that's good that you already know that you've kind of gotten to the core of your
*  comedy already. And that's interesting. That's a step ahead. Yeah, I can hear,
*  I mean, with most things I do in life, I can like hear the music from a distance, like in myself,
*  like, okay, if you have anything, this is the direction it'll be without actually knowing
*  exactly all the steps. And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right, well, if you do this for a
*  long time, maybe you'll have a chance to get there. Right. But you have to, I mean, that's where the,
*  it's a feature to be super self critical, I think. Yes. But then that's why it's fucking terrifying
*  to walk up to the stage, stand there and probably forget everything. Yeah, that's the other part
*  nobody thinks about just goes right out of your head. You go fight or flight. It's ugly. My first
*  years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering, horrific not remembering the punchline. Like
*  you got to maybe you got a setup going and they're kind of on board and you're like,
*  how's that? I can't, I can't remember how it goes. And you just hate yourself. It's, it's a nightmare.
*  But you've already kind of, maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever, you kind of know your
*  voice and that's, yeah, that's pretty advanced. So you're not trying to be somebody else, I guess,
*  yeah, just for having done like podcasts and lecture and so on. That helps. You've, I've embarrassed,
*  I've already done some of the work of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself in front of others
*  for prolonged periods of time. Yes. Yeah. So I've done that without actually developing the funny.
*  Right, right, right. But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop. No, it's super
*  difficult, of course, but I mean, maybe the essential work of a standup comedian is just
*  the embarrassment of like finding who you are. Yeah, that's a part of it for sure. You know,
*  in the beginning, you're like water bottle. What's funny about water bottle? I'm a funny guy. I can
*  make this funny, but that ain't, that's not it. You know, it's, it's your shit, your shit, like
*  your dark stuff. For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark, but in a weird way where, you know,
*  people will say like, hey, don't objectify women. But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful.
*  And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here. Why can you objectify her, but not
*  the supermodel? So what's going on there? And I like to play with that. So I have this joke where
*  I say, Caitlyn Jenner, oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful, beautiful woman. I go,
*  well, you look like her and they go, fuck you. And you're like, there's a lot of truth there.
*  But I like exploring that kind of, oh, you're trying to get one over on me or you're lying
*  to yourself or what are we doing here? And I like, I like that kind of comedy. I don't see color.
*  Well, I'm black. No, you're not. Ah, you know, that's fun because you're, you're lying.
*  Uh, yeah. Okay. So like big time comedians, it's just yourself. Don't like to think of yourself in
*  this way, but yeah, this is like, were you overphilosophize comedy, but yeah, definitely.
*  It seems like comedians. Don't say important. Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're
*  important. Yeah. So I was going there. I was trying to find, as I was trying to say these words,
*  I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is. So I'm going to just, but there is something,
*  uh, I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting. I'm like, who cares about comedy? There's like six
*  comics on the planet, but nobody cares. Okay. I trust you in the, in the pilot seat. You know
*  what you're doing. You got, you got listeners. They've tuned out long ago. Dan Carlin on here.
*  Huh? Is he around? Yeah. We're just going back and forth on Twitter. Just now as a huge fan,
*  he was on here before he'll be back. I've been actually really, uh, trying to volunteer myself
*  aggressively with Dan Carlin for, for, for like a Russian episode where I could speak Russian.
*  There's certain documents saying, I talked with Jaco about this too, certain things.
*  I mean, I just love the challenge of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian
*  and then can translate and can try to capture the, uh, the depth of the writing in, um,
*  in the Russian language and communicate to an American audience. So much is lost in translation.
*  Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language. It's just connected to the
*  culture. Every language, not every language, but many languages are uniquely able to capture the
*  culture of the people. I mean, in some way there's a representation of the culture of the people.
*  And so Russian is definitely that like represents the full history and culture of the 20th century
*  with all the atrocities, all the, all the broken promises, all those kinds of things. Norm says,
*  uh, Russian literature is it's the most tapped into human existence than anything else.
*  Uh, Norm. McDonald. Yeah. Big, big Russian literature guy, Dostoevsky, all that shit.
*  It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too. There's a culture of Russian comedy,
*  like standup comedians that are totally, yeah. I don't know these Russians. I mean, uh,
*  I don't know today. I mean, more from the eighties and nineties. And so there was a,
*  Yakov. That's all I know. That's not, so there's like a force that's, that's,
*  I've never seen you that offended. No, no, no, it's not offended. There's a different, uh,
*  uh, there's, there's a, there's like the kinesons and the, there's the edgy. Is that Russian?
*  What do you mean? I thought you said there was Russian comics. Yeah. Russian. I mean,
*  I'm comparing that. I'm giving you, I'm giving you like a style of darkness. Uh,
*  like that's the kind of people that kind of challenge, uh, they, they give again,
*  this is to how important comedians are is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet union,
*  you really can't like express your opposition to the government. And so comedians are exceptionally
*  important there for just, just, I don't know, channeling the anger, even when sometimes it's
*  not the actual opposition to the government, they're just channeling the anger, the frustration
*  with the absurdity of life. Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food, shortage of jobs,
*  the, the, the absurdity of the bureaucracy, like the top heavy government, just all of that can
*  only sometimes be expressed with like dark, absurd humor. And that actually why there's a
*  culture of that kind of humor, you know, you gather around the table with vodka and all you
*  can do is just talk shit and just be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust. I mean, I make school
*  shooting jokes and people go, how do you do that? I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it.
*  You know, like how come I gotta, I gotta empathize the way you do, maybe we're different.
*  All right. So now let's skip the whole open mic thing and crafting jokes.
*  Oh, yeah, that's tough. Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words and they will be simple.
*  When do you know the joke is done? It's perfect. You're somebody that does like,
*  really sharp, like fast jokes. Wow. Thanks. So like there's somebody, I don't know, I don't know who
*  you see yourself in the same school as like had your, your, your darker and faster than Hedberg,
*  I think in terms of like, just, I don't know, the turns you take it very,
*  Thanks. I appreciate it. I think I got some Norm McDonald and maybe, that's right.
*  You know, obviously Norm, but Chris Rock was huge for me. Chris, old like 90s Chris Rock was like,
*  I didn't know you could do jokes like that. I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx and
*  Bill Murray. There's so many different types of comedy, but when I saw the bigger and blacker
*  bring the pain, I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me. So that was big. And then Norm's just
*  like the funniest guy on the planet. So him, him being the smartest guy in the room, but acting dumb
*  was great. So, yeah, I, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the, the bullshit, which I mentioned
*  earlier. I like that cutting through the bullshit kind of style of comedy because you kind of go,
*  oh, I'm not crazy. That's what I thought too. I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.
*  And he's saying it in a room of people are laughing. Maybe I'm not an idiot. So that helped me.
*  So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld observational. It's like look,
*  go into the darker thing. Yeah. Great. But I like him too, but seeing it, doing it about stuff like
*  in your life, society, yeah, race, gender, government politics, all that kind of stuff.
*  Sex, human emotions, jealousy, whatever it is that that's the good stuff.
*  How'd you feel when Norm passed away? That was a bummer because he was, you know, what, 61.
*  And I just didn't see it coming. And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff and I've met
*  him and he's like, he was like this comedic bar, like, Hey, we got Norm, you know, there's so much
*  shit comedy. Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level. This is savant type shit.
*  And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years at least of just content and content and
*  thoughts and his point of view. And that's, we'll never get that. And that sucks.
*  Yeah. There is something about artists like Jimi Hendrix dying too early. It's like, you wonder
*  what was next? Yeah. What was next? But then part of it is like,
*  you know, it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early is,
*  it's kind of admirable. It's almost like I did a pretty good job.
*  Yeah. I'm good with that. And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody.
*  I know, nine years, his best friends didn't even know. And in this world of like victimhood and I
*  need clicks and I need people to love me. He could have, he got, you know, canceled and yelled at and
*  in trouble and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did. I mean, the integrity on
*  this motherfucker. Did you get a chance to interact with him? Like what, how often did you meet him?
*  I met him once at the Comedy Cellar and we chatted for five minutes and then he went on and did the
*  Letterman set that he did. He was running the Letterman set and sweet guy, nice guy. I didn't
*  know him that well, but I mean, he's just brilliant. And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid
*  stuff. That's a fun, fun little combo there. Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.
*  You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid. And you're
*  like, that's great that he's still finds farts funny. And he's also this comedic genius guy.
*  I like that. And doesn't really acknowledge the genius. Yeah. Yeah. I like, I like smart people
*  there silly. Yes. That's a good combo. Like you said, Elon is silly. Yeah. Yeah. That's great.
*  Yeah. Cause we, we taught, we teach kids like, Hey, put that down, stop that,
*  quit cutting up, quit horsing around. But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.
*  Yeah. Being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom. I feel like those people are way wiser
*  than the people that no offense to me wear a suit and take themselves way too seriously.
*  No, but you got a spark in you. You got a little, what's the word? Not elf. Imp.
*  Little imp in you. Give that a go. You know what imp? Yeah. It's like a little,
*  is that a Tolkien character? Imp. Yeah. And imp is the European mythological being similar to a fairy
*  or a demon. He called me a fairy frequently. No. Okay. Similar to a fairy or a demon.
*  I feel like that's a big leap. Big leap. Yeah. That's not a great info bio there. Frequently
*  described in folklore and superstition. The word may perhaps derive from the term imp,
*  spelled with a Y. Used to denote a young grafted tree. Oh. It's a little mischievous. You got a
*  twinkle. You're this serious buttoned up guy, but there's a twinkle. There's a twinkle.
*  Oh. And the audience can see the twinkle and that's why you resonate, I think.
*  Oh, sorry. Deep analysis by Mark Norman, psychological analysis. Okay. But then back
*  to the crafting of the joke, you said Chris Rock and Norman Donald, like what for you,
*  how do you know when the joke is like done? Are there some jokes that you're like, are proud of?
*  Like, wow, that's well done. Yeah. Yeah. The joke is done. It's a tough question because there's so
*  many different kinds of jokes. There's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea with a bunch of
*  jokes in the middle of it and then a big crescendo at the end. Or there's a one-liner or there's a
*  tag of a joke that's also a joke. So the jokes come in different, like I have a joke where I say
*  I met my girl on that Jewish app. What's that Jewish app called? PayPal. Nice.
*  That's the hell, that's what they're asking you want from the crowd. But it's a fun turn because
*  you say your thing and then I hit you with a misdirect and that's what a joke is. A joke is
*  basically me saying something that makes sense, but you didn't see it coming. Yeah. And that's a
*  perfect example of that. So that joke took forever to figure out by the way. You know, and-
*  You have to go through different services like PayPal, what's funniest.
*  Exactly. And I figured PayPal is funny because it has the word pay in it.
*  Yeah. You know, Venmo, it's also not really a good word. Venmo, PayPal, it just hits better.
*  Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow. It's funnier somehow and that's the beauty of comedy. There's
*  a weird little magic into it. You can get technical all day and formulaic, but there's still that
*  little bit of fairy dust that you don't know why this is funnier. Or imp dust.
*  Imp dust. Yes. Or the why. Okay.
*  So you know a joke is done when it kills and it- there's a roundness to a joke when you feel like
*  this is buttoned up. This is done here. Yeah. Is simplicity the right word there?
*  Yeah. Is it like you're chopping stuff away or you're adding stuff? Like what does it feel like?
*  Simplicity is always the best angle. I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke and still
*  make it work, but the simpler the better. I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once and Chris Rock and
*  Demetri Martin were in the back watching in awe. And Dave Chappelle, I can't remember the joke,
*  but he said something about sex or women and Demetri Martin goes, ah, it's a little easy.
*  And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good. And I remember hearing that as a young comic like,
*  I'm getting this like, you know, comedy lesson right here for these two titans.
*  And so that was fun. Simple is key. So the easy is okay. That's such a weird,
*  I think I remember reading or hearing Eminem say something about maybe the song, some shade,
*  one of the songs, he's like, I knew it was going to be good because it got like really repetitive
*  and annoying very quickly or something like that. I mean, that's the sort of the music equivalent of
*  it's too easy. Like if it's like super catchy as a musician, you might get very quickly bored of it.
*  As you're creating it, no, it's too easy. It's like there needs to be some more complexity to it.
*  But I like complexity, but the best guys who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.
*  Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story where he's talking to his friends, his friends like,
*  I'm going to start a hat store. So he puts a sign out says hats for sale, $12. And Ben Franklin
*  looks at it goes, well, you don't need the $12 because you know, all they need to know is that
*  you got hats for sale. He's like, all right. So he loses the $12 makes a new sign hats for sale.
*  And he goes, you don't, you don't really need for sale because it's a business. People can put that
*  together. So he just goes, all right, he makes a new sign, it says hats. And then Ben Franklin's
*  like, you know, you don't really need the word hat. You can just put a picture of a hat. And he
*  made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat and it like helped the business or something.
*  This is like some old life's tale or whatever. But I think about that all the time when I'm writing.
*  I thought this was going to like, there was no sign. It went like super like,
*  that could work too. What like as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours. I enjoy, I really enjoy
*  you in conversations like, cause you're getting nothing out of this. All right. I can't like
*  emotion. You're tough not to read cold inside. I mean, just the quickness you have,
*  obviously you also a great standup comedian. What's your favorite medium to shine in? So you have
*  a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast. You're often the podcast guests, which is always fun
*  to listen to how you're going to deal with the different people. You're great on Rogan.
*  I'll say.
*  What do you enjoy most?
*  Podcasts are great because you can stretch out a little more. You can breathe a little,
*  you know, with a standup set, I like to be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  But podcasts are great because it's conversational. So you can be, it's almost like you're being funny
*  with your friends. Whereas the stage is like, this is a piece, this is a presentation.
*  But I think the podcast is great, but you don't get the reaction. Unless the host is laughing,
*  you can't hear the guy in his car in New Jersey driving to work on.
*  Every now and then I'll read a comment like I spit out my coffee when you said this and I'm like,
*  but it's not immediate. You want the immediate. So standup will always be number one, but there's
*  no better feeling than killing in a room of people who don't know who you are. Strangers,
*  you're in the middle of nowhere. You left your wife at home. You left your kids. You left your
*  house. You're in the middle of bumfuck Dickville and murdering for these hillbilly, nobody,
*  whatever it is. And they're slinging their beers and cheering you on. And they carry out and you
*  fuck some fat lady and you leave and you get back to your hotel and you go, holy shit, what was that?
*  No one will ever know about it. Just lost in the ether. That's the best feeling. Yeah. Killing
*  in obscurity is Bill Burr would say. Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks about giving lectures
*  like at universities or giving lectures in general is when you look at the audience,
*  you know, several hundred students, they're all have a board look on their face. Yeah, of course.
*  Like even like my, my face now probably looks bored, but I'm actually excited to be talking to
*  you, but there's something about just, uh, there's something about a comedy club. Maybe this is the
*  contagion of laughter, but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh, to like,
*  to remove that facade of like, you don't have to, you don't have to pretend like you don't care.
*  Like if you care, you can show it and have fun with it. A lot probably liquor is helps out too.
*  Yeah, it helps for sure. But there is a, especially, and that's why comedy, I think is so popular
*  right now because HR is up our ass. We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.
*  What did I say on that interview? Uh, even people at offices are like, I put something on Facebook
*  in 1999. That was about fat tits that I liked. Should I get rid of that? Even people say like,
*  there's no cancel, whatever. There is something in the air right now that wasn't there before.
*  Yeah. It's the video. I'm a Karen. I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is. This people rat on
*  each other. Now everybody's tattletaling because they want the clicks. It's a horrible society.
*  But standup comedy gets you to come out and now people do it at standup shows too, sadly,
*  but it gets you to come out and let that inhibition down. Like, cause we're all human. We've all had
*  the fucked up thoughts like, man, that guy's fat as shit. It doesn't mean you hate the guy.
*  That doesn't mean you hate fat people. Doesn't mean you're fat shaming, but you can't say that
*  at the office. You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit. You'll get fired for body shaming. But at
*  the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit. And the crowd goes, he is fat as shit. And it's just weird
*  cathartic thing. Cause all we do is tamp shit down. It's kind of like you ever meet a girl who's
*  like all prim and proper in the bedroom. She's like, put a lamp up my ass, you know, whatever it is.
*  It's cause we got to get it out. We're all repressed in some way.
*  So I guess what you're saying is a comedy is important.
*  Yes. Call back. All right. Well played, sir. Yeah. What do you think about Austin? What do you
*  think about the comedy scene? Also talk about LA and New York. What do you think about what Joe's
*  trying to create there? So I, I'll, I should say that the reason I moved to Austin, I have this
*  dream of, uh, it wouldn't be funny if I said this dream of becoming a comedian.
*  An audience at least. Yeah, that's true. You know, I always said you can hear the music in the
*  distance. I, you know, I have this dream around robotics and artificial intelligence, whether
*  it's a company, whether it's something else that, uh, it was just pulling me to do. I actually
*  wanted to move to San Francisco and then all my friends in San Francisco said, no, it's the wrong
*  place to, to, uh, it's no, it's at this time, the, the, the cynicism there is just not conducive to
*  like taking big leaps into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing. And, and Austin
*  was that, uh, with, um, for me in particular with Elon Musk, but also just the energy that everybody
*  had, including Joe, the excitement about the future. I don't, I don't care if Austin burns to
*  the ground and it actually is a complete failure. Uh, being excited about the future seems to be
*  like optimism about the future. It seems to be the thing, uh, that actually makes that future
*  happen. It makes a great future happen. So it's always cool for me to see, uh, like Joe super
*  excited about creating like, um, a culture in Austin, like a, making it a comedy hub. Like,
*  I don't want to overstate it, but he, I mean, I think he really believes it'll be a very
*  big place for comedy in the United States in general in the world. And so just even believing
*  that that's powerful. Like you start to make it, you start to make it happen. That energy, uh,
*  is there anyway. So, but that's for me from just an outsider watching, uh, the fun of it. I should
*  also mention for less of an outsider, more inside of in the martial arts world, partially probably
*  because of Joe, I'm not sure. Like John Donahar, uh, Gordon Ryan, the B team, all those folks,
*  those are, that might be gibberish to you, but those are like some of the greatest grapplers
*  and martial artists of all time. So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts. So the whole,
*  the whole thing is, it's just beautiful. Anyway, what, uh, what are your thoughts about that scene?
*  Well, there's a lot, lot here, a lot of things to mention. One, I think Joe did do that to an,
*  uh, a degree, you know, like all these people with Segura lives there now, a lot of comics live there.
*  He's opening clubs, other clubs are opening. I think it's happening. That's the other thing is
*  people go, everybody's moving to Austin. Austin's the new hub. And then they look at their watch and
*  they go, five minutes went by, nothing changed. It's going to take years, you know, but everybody
*  wants it now, now, now. Um, what? Austin, there's no industry there, you know, there's no Netflix,
*  whatever. And you're like, yeah, I know, but it, it needs a minute. You can't just do this overnight.
*  So people forget that. So it could happen huge. Just give it some time. I mean, he's opening a club.
*  I went and saw it. It's incredible. Like it's so perfect for comedy. It's every detail. It's
*  incredible. But, uh, so it could happen still. I do think where there's a little biting off more
*  than they can chew with Austin because it's not that big. So like, yeah, it's not big and the,
*  the infrastructure is not quite there to support it, but it has a lot of, uh, you know, comparing
*  from my front, the tech side for, uh, it has a lot of land to expand into. So it might become this,
*  uh, like you basically establishing, it's kind of like when New York, you're establishing these
*  whole neighborhoods and you have the freedom to do that because there's a lot of space on all sides.
*  Yes. Okay. So that helps. So again, maybe some time. Uh, I do agree with this, that new hope
*  that's kind of built into human beings of like, let's go to America, let's go to the utopia. We
*  even have it with space. Let's go to Mars. We got to see what's over there. And it's just red,
*  dusty bullshit, but you still got to go. So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land.
*  And I think that is beautiful. And I think there's a lot of haters. I think there's a lot of
*  naysayers who hate change, who hate anything new. And then I think you got to go, Hey,
*  that hurts. That sucks, but blow me Dickless. I'm trying something. You're a loser. Stop hating on
*  me. I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk, you know? Yeah, it's hilarious. I mean, there's, uh,
*  some of the criticism on Austin would be, it's like a fad. It's like a lot of people are really,
*  are really, people are excited about Austin and somehow that's like, uh, it's like when green day
*  became famous, you no longer want to be a fan of green day. But to me, like this, uh,
*  also was already a cool town. Like every comic five years ago was like, Ooh, I got Austin this
*  week and I can't wait. So it already had a buzz, but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool
*  part. The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city and now I get to visit it and then leave.
*  But I think it could still be this comedy tech booming place. It just will take some time. And
*  people want it right now. Well, on the tech side, it's, uh, it's already there. It's, it's,
*  it's getting there very fast. So, I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory.
*  It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs. Like you're already starting.
*  And then the opportunities to launch new companies is just incredible. I guess it's not right now.
*  It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing, but like it's an opportunity to just
*  start to build shit in a new place. And it's cool. It's kind of like, you know, go to Mars.
*  It's like, we get to start over. Yeah. And I like the hope aspect. I think that's huge for people.
*  And, uh, I'm, I'm all for it. I hope it works out. I don't know if it will,
*  but I don't know anything about economies and city scans, planning and all that shit. So
*  it might be too early to say, but I hope it works. Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?
*  Austin. Mars is, there's nothing there. There's no vagina there. There's no food there. There's
*  no water there. I don't know. It seems I get space travel. I think it's important, but I,
*  I don't know. Mars is really going to move the needle.
*  So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX and launching rockets into space?
*  I think it's all good because you could say, Hey, we could just feed everybody. And I was like,
*  yeah, that's true. By the way, these guys give a ton of money to like philanthropy shit that
*  nobody cares about. By the way, you know, it's weird. Like he could feed the Nigeria and with
*  pocket change of his. And you're like, well, maybe he has, you know, like I heard Bill Gates gave
*  back so much money to save 6 million lives. But that's a reverse Holocaust by the way.
*  That's pretty good. What have you done? You're a barista. So, uh, you know, I just think, uh,
*  I think space travel is good because you learn about the place you're living in from going to
*  space. It kind of helps you learn about this more. You could say, what's the point of going
*  to this other there, but it, it does help. I think. Yeah. Doing difficult things in the
*  engineering space seems to be a way to develop like as a, as almost like an accident as a side
*  effect of doing a really difficult thing in a team of brilliant people. You develop things like the
*  internet and you can argue that the internet maybe is not so good for society. No, I'm just
*  getting good and bad. Yeah. But it's like a pull up. You're trying to get your bicep going, but
*  Hey, but before you know it, you got decent forearms, but you weren't working on the
*  four arms. You wanted to buy, but you got the four. And I think that's kind of what space travel is.
*  I like how this like pivoted into a, to a workout routine advice.
*  Trying to get an analogy going here. All right. They work pretty well. I'll take it. All right.
*  What are your thoughts about since I'm a robotics person and be curious to see like what,
*  do you think about the space at all about, first of all, autonomous vehicles with a Tesla autopilot
*  and a Waymo self-driving car. I'm not sure if you're familiar with all the autonomous vehicles and
*  so on. So those are robots on wheels and then there's also legged robots. So next time you're
*  in Austin, you get to meet some of the legged robots I've been working on. And I find those kind of
*  a fascinating way to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers, but also
*  explore our own intelligence and also explore our own, like what makes us connect to other
*  living beings, whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans. Like there's some magic there
*  that's beyond just intelligence. And I, like when I have the robot dog, there's some aspect to it
*  that, I don't know, brings me joy in a way that a dog does in a way that a good friend does. Yeah.
*  That's interesting. And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism, like
*  where I'm projecting my hopes for this, what this thing is, but it's kind of built in. I mean,
*  it's just a source of joy. Maybe it's connected to the fact that there's just like a loneliness
*  within all of us, within me. And it's just nice to have other things in your life that move,
*  that recognize you, that kind of thing. I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant.
*  Yeah, it is. Plant goes a long way. You see a guy with plants in his apartment, it changes the
*  apartment because they're alive. You got to water them. You got to put sun on them. So yeah,
*  I think there's something there. And I think you can see people's reactions when you show them
*  advanced technology, like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit. People are like,
*  what the fuck? Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear or you want to fuck them
*  clearly, whatever it is, but it does connect with you in some way. So I'm with you. And I think
*  this is why I don't think robots will take over. You always say that robot, they're making them
*  too advanced. They're going to wipe us out. Blah, blah, blah. If robots get at human emotions,
*  that is scary because they could get mad at us and kill us and they're stronger. They don't
*  need sleep. They don't need food. They don't need water. They don't get jealous. But if they have
*  emotions, then I think we can dominate them because who knows emotions better than us?
*  We've got thousands of years of evolutionary emotional bullshit. We can go, hey, robot,
*  I heard you, your wife fucked that black and Decker, huh? They're going to crumble. We can
*  bully them. Emotionally manipulate robots. Yes. That's when we'll win. Right now, they could kill
*  us. They could just, we'd all die. Then we shoot them back. Bing, bing, bing, bing. That's no good.
*  But if they do get emotions, then we can go, hey, you look like hell. What is that? A rusty bolt?
*  Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you know, you loser. I think we can win if they do get
*  emotions. This goes back to your father being able to undercut you with a single word.
*  You're right. Yeah. So we're the creators of the robots. And then the robots will just,
*  you would say the exact thing where the robot will be like, that son of a bitch. And then he
*  goes back to his hole and just sits there miserable. Right. Yeah. Hardware looks more like software to
*  me. You can't get it up. Yada, yada, yada. Yeah. But I'm not worried about robots. And I think
*  self, what do you think about the self-driving cars? Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?
*  Isn't that just progression of technology? Yeah. So I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla,
*  for example. I have. I rode in the passenger and I drive it. Yeah. There's several stages in that.
*  I think it's the problem is way harder than people realize. And for quite a while,
*  it'll just make driving more pleasant. It'll make it less stressful. It'll take over some of the
*  boring bits for you and make it easier. Like there's something that happens actually when the car
*  is driving for you in the following way. Like it's staying in the lane. It's keeping distance
*  to the car from you. Maybe it's changing lanes. It allows you to relax a little bit. Like, yes,
*  you become, you still have to be alert, but you become like a passenger and you get to like
*  take in the world. I mean, somehow that's more relaxing without making you necessarily like
*  bored more. It's energizing more. So I just think it makes the driving experience more pleasant.
*  But when you actually fully automate cars, when you can just completely tune out and start reading
*  a book or go to sleep, that might change society like in ways we don't even understand because
*  you'll have, I mean, the, the, they'll probably change the nature of roads because the cars,
*  cause now you can be super productive. And so no longer quite matters to you as much how long it
*  takes to get from point A to point B because you're not wasting that time. You just continue
*  working. It's like public transit that comes to you. And so they, there will be maybe less
*  roads and bigger roads and it will just change the nature of how we get from point A to point B.
*  I think you're right. But that then coupled that also with the fact that we seem to be
*  more and more comfortable existing in the digital world. So like maybe we won't want to go outside
*  more and more. We will just interact with each other virtually. And I don't mean Zoom meetings.
*  I mean, just in other ways that's, that's, that's more fulfilling than a Zoom meeting.
*  But then maybe not because like there's something deeply uncompelling
*  about Zoom meetings. Like podcasts that are remote, unless they're super information dense,
*  at least to me as a podcast fan kind of suck. They suck. There's no connection. It goes back
*  to the dog thing. With the Zoom, there's no connection. Yeah. And we're not, you know,
*  I don't understand why we're not even making eye contact. I know. But it's something there. It's
*  in the room. There's pheromones. And that's like out of our understanding probably. It's just some
*  kind of weird biological, you know, you ever have Cheerios in a bowl? The Cheerios tend to,
*  they tend to go together. You see a cluster of Cheerios. They're never really hanging out
*  on the other side. And that's kind of how people are in real life. I wonder what the physics of
*  that is. So they come together and they stick. There's so many with molecules. Yeah. I don't know,
*  I can't remember what it was, but it was fascinating. And I think that's how people are. And I think
*  you try to write a TV show or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there. It's like
*  phone sex versus penetration. One day you'll learn that. I know nothing of either the, I look forward
*  because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary. Oh yeah. There's a show or something
*  like that that is really popular. I want to go watch. At least I can learn about that.
*  I could send you some links. Oh, on the internet? Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, self-driving car, I think
*  it's just inevitable. It's coming and these truckers are going to have to figure something out.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's an under understood industry actually, because there's not,
*  there's a lot of trucking jobs and people don't want to, well, people don't want to actually take
*  them anymore because it's such a difficult job. So it won't have, or a lot of people believe it
*  won't have as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate. There'll be other automation. I think
*  they'll have a huge impact. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you already see it in McDonald's. You go to the
*  beep beep beep. Why do you want to get yelled at by the heavy set woman of color, you know, for making
*  a bad order when you can just, you know, hit the screen. But those interactions, I think are human.
*  I mean, that's part of life. So it is scary taking away everything. How long till we're not fucking?
*  That's common too. Yeah. Then there's going to have two types of people. Are you a
*  fuck in real life or are you a digital fuck person? I'm a digital. I like real fucking. Sorry,
*  we can't date. That's common. Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex, which is like with
*  genetic engineering, you'll be able to specify a little bit of details. I talked to Jamie Marzo
*  about that, like where you can specify like what, you know, it'll start with like, I want my child
*  not to have like a high likelihood of diabetes or something like that. And then you get to specify
*  like intelligence is get to specify those kinds of parameters until you're like, basically trying
*  to create a perfect human and you lose some of the magic of the flaws that make us who we are.
*  And, you know, I, I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans, like the, so
*  let me give you some information. I'm sure you researched this thoroughly, but a male of the
*  human species of the homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells in a lifetime. So that's all
*  some more than others. That's all uniquely, genetically unique humans that you could produce.
*  So even across those 500 billion, you can select. And so mean like abort some or no,
*  you can choose which of them you want. I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities that
*  are there, like all the possible, like you won the race. Yes. Shocking. This is all the 500 billion.
*  You have to imagine what the competition was. Oh, just tarts all day long handicap.
*  Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm or like it's, I think a lot of his timing and luck
*  what it seems like there's actual papers on this and I've actually been reading them.
*  I hope so. So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg. Okay. There's a timing thing.
*  So you were just lucky. All right. I believe that. So it's interesting to think about like,
*  once you're able to specify some parameters of what your child is like, how that changes the
*  nature of even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together and making,
*  creating together a child. Yeah. I mean, it changes it. It's almost like, I don't know,
*  it becomes like a factory line of some kind. If you don't meet naturally. Yeah. If you don't
*  meet naturally and then you don't and you get to optimize your child, then it's, then it's some
*  like, you have to consider utilitarian type of things like what's good for society. And then
*  it'll probably be regulation about what kind of children you can have and not like your child
*  cannot have an IQ below this or above this or something like that. Your child cannot.
*  We already kind of do that with VIP clubs. Like, ah, you're kind of ugly or women go,
*  hey, he's not tall enough. We kind of do it a little, especially sexually. Yeah, we do.
*  Can't get on the roller coaster if you're this short, whatever it is, we do it in some capacity.
*  But here this would be like fully transparent and to a degree that it's hard to imagine.
*  The way we currently do it, you can at least get around it. Yes. You can at least trick your way
*  onto the roller coaster, even if you're short. Right. Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get
*  laid. You know, there's other ways. At the risk of asking the totally wrong person this question,
*  what advice would you give to young people today in high school and college about how to
*  have a successful career or career they're proud of or maybe have a life that they're proud of?
*  Ooh. Well, first of all, you got to be, you got to want a life you're proud of. Not everybody has
*  any integrity. A lot of people just want short money. I want to feel good, look good right now.
*  I want to do Molly. Boom, I'll feel good. You know, but you should space it out. You should,
*  it's almost like saving money so you can use it later. Nobody wants to save money. What do they
*  say? Like 11% of America actually has money saved a thousand dollars or some shit. It's wildly low.
*  Everybody wants it now. Now, what do you call it? Immediate gratification. I think the key to
*  happiness and satisfaction is working for something. Even if it's, it's like a baby.
*  If you could have a baby in five minutes, if a woman you got a you jizzed in her and she
*  had a baby, five minutes, boom, newborn, healthy. I think you'd be more likely to throw it away.
*  If you could make it that quick. It's the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking the labor,
*  the lactating, the ripped placenta and the hymen or whatever the fuck. That's what makes you love
*  it. And I think it's the same with comedy or making money or whatever. Look at these kids who like
*  child stars, they all become heroin addicts at like 22 because they've just, their sensors are
*  burned out. They're pleasure sensors. You didn't have to earn it. I think earning it is a big part
*  of life and always try to do better, try to do more, try to learn new things. Hey, I'm bored.
*  Life sucks. Play the piano then you chooch. But you won't do it because it takes effort and failure
*  and all that. But that's the good part. And I know it's hard to see. So I think that's a good key to
*  life is work hard at something you care about and then love the result. The hard work, the journey is
*  actually way more important than just getting something. Everybody wants to go on Amazon.
*  I got a package. Then you feel good for 10 seconds and all right, let's go on Amazon again. And then
*  it's just a dumb cycle of you being disgusting and gluttonous. So work for it. Everybody wants
*  to take steroids and just poop, I'm buff. Why'd you point at me? Because I'm Russian or what?
*  I saw the Icarus. But no, I'm not saying you're on Roids. You'd be way bigger. But I'm just saying,
*  work for something. And then I would also, young people, eat shit early. Eat shit early. I know a
*  guy who kind of got canceled or whatever and he had an out early, but he tried to get by and he
*  tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down. But if he had eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked
*  up. I did that. Whatever it was, he would have just kind of been shit on for a month and then it
*  would have gone away. But now it's his whole identity and that sucks. So eat shit early.
*  And I know it's hard to see. What do I mean early? I'm in the present. But look ahead. Look back.
*  This time will pass. I mean, look at high school. High school is the biggest thing in our lives. Oh
*  my God, this exam. Susie Q hates me. The football player beat me up. I'll never recover. Now you
*  don't even think about high school. It's just a blip in your dumb life. You know? And that's what
*  this is now. This will just be a blip. So remember that and work towards something and work hard and
*  care about the result. If the result isn't good, try it again. And failure is not always bad.
*  Failure, we look at failure as this end all be all. My life's over. I failed. But failure is
*  really just learning. So that's something. So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.
*  Yes. All right. Mark Norman. Eat ass. That escalated quickly. All right. I have a list of
*  random questions for you. What activities make you lose track of time? Oh, just have that,
*  go into that zone. You have this happiness, contentment about you that you just truly enjoy.
*  Yeah, I think a good conversation. Like I'll sit at the Comedy Cellar with friends, maybe a little
*  whiskey's flowing. And when you're really just vibing and inhibit, inhibit, inhibit, inhibit.
*  You can do it. What is it? Inhibited. Inhibited. Uninhibited. Uninhibited. When you're just vibing
*  and you're uninhibited and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing and you're not worried,
*  am I seeming cool right now? Am I seeming likeable? When you're just you 100% and it's all coming out
*  of you and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth and you feel that excitement. Oh,
*  they're talking, but I want to say my thing. And you know, you get all keyed up. I love that. And
*  I look at my watch like fuck, it's three in the morning. We've been talking for five hours.
*  So I love that. That makes the time fly by. Also, I bought a speaking of self-driving cars,
*  I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty.
*  And it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it. Bucket of bolts. Yeah. You and Tom Waits are poets.
*  Have you taken like a long trip anywhere, like road trip in your life or with this BMW?
*  Not with it. It's pretty new, but I will. It's a new 1970. Yeah, it's new to me. And it just,
*  it goes in the phase of everything we're doing now. Everything is digital, everything is automated,
*  everything is hands off, everything is delivered. And this is the most hands-on thing in the world.
*  And I am dialed in, man. I got the tachometer. I keep an eye on that. Oh, I put the wrong gear
*  in. Oh, it's about to stall. Put some gas, put some clutch. And it's all just brain power and
*  staying in focus and all that. And it's the opposite of tweeting and texting and watching
*  porn or whatever. So I almost needed that in my life. So I bought this car just to have this
*  little exercise. I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out random questions I wrote. I knew
*  that are completely, they're like completely insane. I'm a guinea pig. Jizz in my face.
*  Bring it on, baby. This would be edited down to five minutes. If everyone on earth disappeared
*  and it was just you left, what would your days look like? What would you do? That's tough because
*  I'm already an introvert and I try to avoid people mostly. Like I like a one-on-one,
*  but crowds and all that is tough. So basically unchanged. Yeah, that's what I was going to say,
*  but then that's the irony is I would be so sad to not talk to anybody. So it's this weird
*  bittersweet thing, but I don't know what I would do, man. I guess it's kind of like when you're
*  hungover, you just go into the primal survival mode. I got to get food. I need water. I'm horny.
*  Jerk off. You're not playing the piano or painting or at the gym. So I think I would just go into
*  urges, man. Primal urges. Find food. Store food. Am I safe? Make weapons. Build a shelter that I
*  can't get attacked in. I would go all survival mode and then once I maybe realized if I was safe
*  or not, there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring and maybe somehow get a vehicle.
*  I would try to expand and that would be it. And maybe a journal. Exploring to try to find new
*  experiences. New life. Maybe there is another guy out there. Oh, so always there's a possibility.
*  Yeah, hope. And then maybe there's a better place I could live. Let's find that and then moving on.
*  Maybe there's more food over here. So yeah, the hope would drive me, but it would be bleak and sad
*  and horrible also. So what you're saying is you really want other people to be there so you can
*  hide from them. Yes, yes. Well said. All right. What's an item on your bucket list that you
*  haven't done yet? Think about something you'd be very upset if you died and you haven't done.
*  Well, I'm terrified of having kids, you know, just because I'm a child myself and I'm selfish
*  and lazy in a way. So kids are like, this is your whole life now. This is it. You got to not let
*  this thing die. You got to love it. You got to raise it. So kids scare the shit out of me, but
*  I also feel like if I don't have them, I'll regret it. Well, you've seen so many people like you who
*  are fundamentally changed by kids. Like it's a source. It's a source of like a deep source of
*  happiness, even though you didn't anticipate it. Yeah. So you like you penciled it into your bucket.
*  Yes, yes. You're it might be on there. Okay. And you want kids? Yeah. Well, I want kids.
*  I want to get married. I want to have kids. I kind of I don't like choice. So in the following
*  way, like I appreciate the value of scarcity and the power of scarcity. Like I don't like the modern
*  dating culture. It's not some religious thing, whatever. I just like one girl for a long time,
*  or at least swinging for that always like swinging for the fences. And I could be swinging right now.
*  I mean, you're there's a different use of the word swing. Sure. But I'm saying you could be clear.
*  You look great. You're handsome. Yeah, thank you. Muscular. Thank you. You get the job done. So I
*  feel like you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her. Yeah. But I just like to, you know, about
*  furries, I like to dress up as animals. And I just have trouble finding others who are up there. I
*  could show you some chat rooms. You're also my coach for the internet. Okay. What are you most afraid of?
*  I guess on Unlived Life. I'm a I was a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know, like these
*  Teddy Roosevelts who would go out and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys. I was obsessed with
*  the Hunter S Thompson types. And look, this is what I love about guys like who's a good example,
*  like Hemingway. Hemingway was the manliest guy. He had the rifle and the elephant and the
*  whiskey and the writing and the women and the fistfights. But people forget that the other side
*  of that coin is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping. I'm sure he was lonely as fuck.
*  I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers. I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake. So obviously he
*  was dealing with something. So the key to me is having this adventurous life, living to the
*  fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself, but also not killing yourself. Like also not hating
*  killing yourself. Like also not hating because I used to party a lot hard. I used to
*  bang a lot of gals. And this is the flip side is like, this girl hates you now or you got herpes
*  or you're hungover or your mom is like, where are you? You never call me anymore. You're like,
*  oh, my mom, my father, let let ties go with my mom. I got to connect. So there's a horrible
*  side to the party animal. The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty. I mean, he's already
*  weird looking, but he's party smoking. He's living, but there's another side of that coin.
*  And I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy, awesome, badass life. And also
*  having some, you know, meaning and a little bit of a what's the word, not just not killing
*  yourself, not going sad, not being depressed. There's a medium there, a sweet spot. Does that
*  make sense? Yeah, yeah. So taking big leaps and Hemingway grabbing life by the balls,
*  but at the same time, not crushing the balls. That metaphor work at all. Perfect. Evil Knievel,
*  we all know him. What a badass, fearless. Oh man, what a cool dude. He's got balls of steel,
*  but he also lived like the back half of his life in a fucking, you know,
*  Barca lounger where his legs were made of steel and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't
*  work. So, you know what I mean? You've got to have a balance, but you still want the balance.
*  I'm willing to take a little bit of shit for a little bit of fun, but you don't want to go
*  too hard because you got to still risk it. I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well.
*  Yeah, that's quite a ride. Quite a ride. What small act of kindness were you once shown that
*  you will never forget? Wow, that's a great question.
*  I just wrote these for the guinea pig. You're the guinea pig. That's great. That's a keeper.
*  Okay, that's a keeper. This is where like workshopping questions are. All right,
*  I'll take it. Now you're open-miking. This is your version. Let's see, there's a couple
*  ladies in high school who were kind enough to handjob me. That was nice, which I really
*  appreciate. I don't think women know how much that means to us. You know, women are like,
*  oh, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever. And you're like, I know, but if you just gave me
*  a handjob, it would make my world. It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved.
*  See, most people mention like a math teacher in middle school that would inspire them to get into
*  science. Give a shout out to the- Well, that's part of it. That's not the nicest,
*  but I'm just saying that goes a long way. All right. Let's see, kindness. That's a great question.
*  I want to give you a good answer. I got lost when I was like six. I was walking around my dad and I
*  zoned out and went away. And next thing you know, I don't know where I am. I'm in a neighborhood.
*  This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere and he goes, come inside. And he tried to call
*  my parents and nothing came of it. Eventually they found me after like nine hours. Cops were there,
*  the FBI's out there, fucking helicopters. And I guess, you know, that's nice. This old guy took
*  me in for a couple hours and just sat me down and kept me safe. That's something. Yeah. Oh,
*  how about Enis, my transvestite nanny? Very kind. Did you hear about this? No. Okay. We had this
*  transvestite nanny. He was like a drag queen, but it was in the nineties. It was weird. It was new.
*  And my bike got stolen and he, you know, my parents were like,
*  what are you going to do? They're poor kids, you know? And he was like, fuck it. Let's,
*  we're going to go get that bike. And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels, big black guy.
*  And I'm like, ah, what are you going to do? You know, it's gone. And he's like, no, we're going
*  to go get it. So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood, saw the kids, fuck with
*  the bike, you know, five street Tufts. And he goes, all right, you want to come out or should
*  I just do this? And I was like, you do it. I'm terrified. What are you crazy? And he got out of
*  the van in full, you know, heels and wig. And he went up to these guys and they went off. Oh my God,
*  look at this fucking guy, homo, faggot, all this shit. You know, it's the nineties. And he just
*  stared at them long enough to where they were kind of like, all right, well, I guess we're going to
*  fight you now. And he goes, that's not your bike. And they go, what are you going to do about it?
*  And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike and they didn't do anything. And he just
*  picked it up and said, that's what I thought. Put the bike over shoulder, slid the van door open,
*  threw the bike in and we drove off. Somebody stuck up for you. Yeah. And I mean, he could have got,
*  I mean, they had tools. They could have fucking tuned him up two seconds. That actually like
*  takes courage. Oh yeah. Real courage. And then that, the reason you do an act like that is that
*  makes a kid like you feel like there's somebody on your side. Yes. That's powerful. Someone on
*  your side is big. It's big. That goes a long way. Especially when they have the risk of getting
*  their ass kicked or their job taken away or whatever it is. Now we're going to get
*  a little bit philosophical, maybe a little bit emotional.
*  Would you rather lose all your old memories or never be able to make new ones?
*  It's a tough one, but I go easy answer, make new ones. But don't you think all the shitty
*  things that happened to you? Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean. It's not,
*  is it memories or is it how every memory affected me too? I mean, this is a very,
*  or do they go hand in hand? I think the reality about memories is you replay them often. You go
*  back to them even when you're not aware of it. You really go, you go back often like that.
*  And they change. You change them too. Yeah. You change them to suit your understanding of the world.
*  Yes. So the dark view you have, both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world is
*  so deeply grounded in the memories that you're basically, I would say if you erase all memories,
*  I think you're really starting over with maybe the wisdom of how the world works, but not
*  your, so much of your personality is gone. You would really,
*  I did be interesting how your comedy would change. Maybe you would have a good sense of timing. You
*  have a good sense of like the writing process maybe, but like. Now you're making some good
*  points, but let me ask you this. Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.
*  Now, like I wiped the memory or I keep my old memories. Let's say I go to, you know,
*  the Tuscany with the lady. I just won't remember that. Yeah. But you get to experience it in the
*  moment. You'll get to enjoy it. Can I look at a photo of it? Yes. But I was like, what the hell
*  is this? Yeah, exactly. Oh, fascinating. It's exact. The rules are pretty simple. I think everyone
*  knows how the rules go. So you would, yeah. So what. Well, I was going to say start new ones,
*  but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them. That's what you're saying. So
*  I guess I'd keep them because I am 38. So I've gotten a good chunk out of life. Yeah. And let's
*  be honest, how many years do you have left? I know, right? I got AIDS. Is it better to have loved?
*  Okay. This question is ridiculous. Is it better to have loved and lost or to have never loved at all?
*  The sound, it sounds cliche, but there's a question. Definitely better to loss.
*  So you enjoy the ups and downs. Yeah, that's what that's life.
*  For sun and rain, baby. I kind of like both the whole thing, the loss.
*  Every time you lose something, it really makes you distinctly realize how much you valued it.
*  Yes. Like am I, when I'm sad, like when I'm feeling alone and I'm sitting there alone at home
*  and I wish I could hang out with somebody, that's like a realization how awesome people are.
*  Yeah. So it's like the missing, the, yeah. We don't have a lot of that in life anymore
*  because we can have anything we want immediately. So the missing has gone away, which again
*  drives down the joy of having it. So I think you're right. You need both.
*  So like you said, you have a condition that a terminal condition, not much,
*  many years left. Do you think about your mortality? You think about that?
*  All day, every day. Are you afraid?
*  Not afraid because it's inevitable. So it's more like, what do we, how are we going to handle this?
*  It's like the winter is coming. Let's stock up on some nuts.
*  The existential nature of it, like the fact that this ride ends, like what the hell are you doing
*  any of this for? Like, cause it, your satisfaction, happiness, short term, but like the,
*  there is a presumption there that it kind of goes on forever. I think if you truly think about the
*  fact that it ends, um, your brain almost shuts, shuts it down. Yeah. There's some kind of like
*  protective, like a switch that just goes off. I mean, that's why the stoics, you know, encourage
*  people to meditate on death because it somehow reorganizes your priorities. It helps you like,
*  holy shit, this ends, make the most of the day. Yes. It's just a nice thing, but still you can't
*  quite comprehend that the thing ends. Uh, little things too. You know, people go like, oh, we got
*  a layover between our flights. It's an hour. What are we going to do for an hour? It's like,
*  what do you mean what are you going to do for an hour? You're going to kill an hour. Let's kill,
*  how are we going to kill this hour? This is part of your life. You're just trying to get rid of it.
*  You're just trying to kill it. That, that always blew my mind. Like, Hey, let's go hit the airport
*  bar. Let's get a, you know, a candy bar or something. Yeah. Anything with bar, but, uh, it's just,
*  you've got to live. I hate this. Like, how are we going to burn? Oh, the bar didn't open for 15
*  minutes. What are we going to do? Well, we got 15 minutes. We got the world is our oyster. Yeah.
*  Make the most of it. Yeah. And like the, like you said in modern day, actually the boredom is a gift.
*  The, when you're waiting for something, that's, that's, that's a gift. You get to be with your
*  thoughts. Yeah. Those are the same thoughts you'll have when you're in your deathbed.
*  There won't be a, uh, uh, you won't be scrolling tick tock on your deathbed. I hope not. Jesus.
*  You'd be a lot more. Actually, maybe you would be what a sad existence, because it would be a good,
*  uh, like content creators would be like, Ooh, I'm dying. This would be good content.
*  Yeah. I want to be able to sure fill in the exact moment. It goes,
*  be last words. I wonder what my last words will be. Yeah. Good way to like
*  end the, the account with a bang. Yep. I like that. Well, you know,
*  that you ever seen that meme where the old guy in bed, he goes, I wish I had tweeted more,
*  you know, and then he dies. It's so true. Could be the future. Uh, what do you think is the meaning
*  of life? I don't think there is one. Everybody always throws that out there. There isn't a meaning.
*  I think we're here. We're lucky to be here. I think there's no afterlife. There's no heaven.
*  That's, that's all shit. We tell ourselves to feel better. And I think you gotta just,
*  it's like saying, what is the meaning of this, uh, food I made? Well, it's just, you enjoy the
*  food. You try to get the most out of it. Yeah. You built the food, you've prepared it. So just
*  get what you can out of it. Don't die and try to make it last as long as possible.
*  But you look at earth, it's like 4 billion years old and, uh, life started early on, like,
*  like simple cell bacteria life, like a 1 billion years in. And then it started like having lots of
*  aggressive interaction. Eventually there's predator and prey and there's sex, lots of sex,
*  lots of sex, lots of violence. Uh, and then, you know, through natural selection, there's just the
*  whole evolutionary process of, of animals that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten
*  murdered and all that kind of stuff. And it's somehow led to human civilization. We're super
*  busy trying to create things and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.
*  Yeah. Uh, just always creating something new. It feels like it's tending towards something like
*  it's, it's not dying. If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods. So it's kind
*  of, you're thinking of cheating death in a subconscious way. I think. Right. You know who
*  Ernest Becker is and heard the name, uh, book called the now of death. This idea that, uh,
*  if you don't acknowledge what's on my show, uh, girls love it. Like just the F ski. Uh, no, I'm
*  just saying you want to bring toll story. Does the S Russian literature, it's the back to norm. It's
*  good to bring to, uh, cause cause, uh, no American has read any Russian literature,
*  but they all appreciate it if you bring it. And it's not like they're going to ask you
*  any legitimate questions cause they haven't read it. So you can always pretend like you've read it.
*  So it's a little dense. Can we get a shortened version? Cliff notes. Yes. Or make a movie with,
*  uh, you know, Ben Stiller that I, that I can just go, Oh, this is based on,
*  what is it? Uh, life and death. No, what's the one war and peace. War and peace. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So Ernest Becker's theory, and there's this whole terror management theory that basically says that
*  like our terror of death, our fear of death is one of the central creative forces of the human
*  condition. It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death. We're trying to dilute ourselves.
*  That somehow we can become immortal through our art. That's why you've uploaded your special to
*  YouTube because you think you think your special will outlive all of human civilization. You think
*  YouTube will outlive all of civilization. That can go away tomorrow. All of this can go away. So I'm
*  truly grateful, Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend your, uh, very valuable time with me today,
*  even though it could all go away. This could be the last day of our lives. And won't you be quite
*  upset? This is how you spent it. Ah, yeah. Your hotel room. What am I? Yeah. You're like Harvey
*  Weinstein here. You heard me up and now I feel fucked. Just wait. What we, uh, have ready for
*  you after the podcast is over. All right, brother. Thanks so much for talking to me. Thank you. It
*  was great comedy. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Norman to support this
*  podcast. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
*  words from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter, which you should definitely follow because it's
*  hilarious. The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas is you know, it was re-gifted.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
