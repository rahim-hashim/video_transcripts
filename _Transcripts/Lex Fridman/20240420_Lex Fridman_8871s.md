# Neil Adams: Judo, Olympics, Winning, Losing, and the Champion Mindset | Lex Fridman Podcast #427
**Lex Fridman:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXabC2Ave74)
*  When we go to the dojos there, we all get thrown by people that never come out to be world champions.
*  You know, they're just in the mix, or they're going through three years of university,
*  and then they go, we had a guy that came in, he was a business guy, he came in with his suitcase
*  and his tie up like that, and he's in his lunch hour, he's in his lunch hour, right? So, got to be
*  quick. So, he comes in and he goes through, he's working his way through the whole of the British
*  team. We're all lined up, right? Ten minutes later, he's just tying his tie up like that,
*  you know, and back to work. Imagine him sitting behind his desk in his computer.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm glad he didn't get out.
*  Who do you think wins, Yamashita or something?
*  I think Yamashita, but you know-
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do you think Yamashita would be staying there?
*  I think so.
*  Strong words.
*  The following is a conversation with Neil Adams, a legend in the sport of judo. He is a world
*  champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist, five-time European champion, and often referred to as the
*  voice of judo, commentating all the major events, world championships and Olympic games, highlighting
*  the drama, the triumph, the artistry of the sport of judo, making fans like me feel the biggest
*  wins, the biggest losses, the surprise turns of fortune, the dominance of champions coming to an
*  end, and new champions made. Always speaking from the heart. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To
*  support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neil
*  Adams.
*  Seven-time European champion, world champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist. Let's first go to the
*  1980 Olympics. Where was your mind? What was your preparation like? What was your strategy leading
*  into that Olympics?
*  That was my first Olympic Games. So my preparation was a little bit different to how it was the
*  84 and the 88 Olympic Games. And I'd kind of done part of the preparation as well for 76 Olympic Games.
*  I wasn't quite old enough for those, but I was first reserve. So in 1980, I'd had four years build
*  up and I was hungry and I was one of these young athletes and I see them so often now that was
*  developing and full of, I won't say full of myself, but I was certainly confident of my ability and I
*  wanted to conquer the world. And I'd had a couple of really tight matches with the current Olympic
*  world champion. So I knew that there was a possibility that I could get there for the
*  80 Olympics. So building up to the 80 Olympics was quite interesting because I was kind of coming
*  through the weights and I was halfway in between the 71 kilos weight category and the higher weight
*  category of 78 kilograms. And I got third place at the 79 world championships, the weight below.
*  For the whole year at the higher weight category, didn't lose a contest. So I'd beaten everybody in
*  the world. And then I had to make the decision as to whether to drop to the weight below because I
*  was seeded in the weight below. It was a different seeding then. So I decided to drop into the
*  weight below because I was seeded in the top four. And as it happens, I think it was probably the
*  worst decision I made. Well, because, simply because, I mean, it was the only contest that I
*  lost was the final of the Olympic games in that year. So you're a young kid, what, like 1920 at
*  that time, full of confidence, vigor. So the decision to cut weight, how hard was it for you
*  to cut weight to the 71 kg division? I've got to say that it was the hardest because as I was going
*  up, I was, you know, it was 73, then it was 74 kilos, 75. So I was moving through the weight
*  category. It wasn't like I was stuck in the middle and then I dropped the odd time to compete.
*  It was literally going up in weight by a kilo every month. And then by the time I came to a
*  month or two before the Olympics, it was really hard. Fought the European Championships at the
*  higher weight category and won that. And so everybody that was on the Olympic rostrum
*  at the Olympic Games was on my rostrum at the European Championships. So was it a mistake?
*  Yeah, because I didn't have my diet sorted out. My nutrition was appalling. And when I, you know,
*  it wasn't as kind of readily available as it is now for the nutrition. And I would say that
*  if anything lost me that final, other than the fact that I was fighting somebody was terrific,
*  you know, he was an excellent, brilliant athlete, but definitely didn't help that my nutrition was
*  not very good. Okay, so you lost to Ezio Gama. There's probably a lot of that we could say about
*  that particular match. Maybe let's zoom in. What were your strengths and weaknesses judo wise in
*  that Olympics? You said you haven't really lost the match. You won the European Championship leading
*  into it. But if you had weak spots, okay, you already said diet, but specifically on the mat
*  in terms of judo. I think that none of the fights lasted time going into the final, you know, so
*  I won fairly quickly and every match by Ipon, you know, way before time.
*  Do you remember how you won the match? I won them by throw a couple of throws for Ipon and then
*  armlock for Ipon semi-final was an armlock against the East German Kruger. And yeah,
*  just I was flying through, you know, or the throws. You remember Taiyotoshi Uchimata,
*  my favorite kind of taku was my favorite throws. And then Jujikutami as well,
*  which was a Jujikutami role against an East German who I'd beaten before, but always had a
*  really tough match, but managed to beat him well. So you had a beautiful exhibition of Japanese type
*  judo in the first two matches. You threw people and then you also did the niawaza. You unbarred a
*  person. Great. So you're going into the final. What are the weaknesses going into the final
*  against the Italian? Like I say, taking nothing away from him as a great athlete and a brilliant
*  judo man and left, which wasn't good for me. That was definite no, because I hated fighting leftists,
*  still do. But I'll tell you why in a minute. I just did. It's one of those. But I think
*  as I went through the contest, we had an eight hour break from the semifinal to the final.
*  They took us back to the Olympic Village. Then we had to come back in and then we had to start a
*  warm up again. You know, so I kind of lost my momentum. I had to start again and I never,
*  I didn't. I just didn't. I had a job to get going. I got halfway through, started to rescue a dying
*  match and you know, I was kind of one step, half a step behind all the way through. So never really
*  got into it. So why do you hate fighting lefties? And lefties are, we should say, overrepresented
*  in terms of the high ranks of judo. I don't know why that is.
*  Well, you know, the thing is about a lefty is a lefty will have more opportunity to fight right
*  is, you know, right-handers. Because I mean, 70% of the population are right-handers,
*  30% left. So they get to fight more right-handers. And it's just a fact, you know, that happens.
*  So the thing that they hate is fighting left against left. They don't like it left against left.
*  Whereas a right-hander will go right against right, you know. But the opposite is awkward
*  for me because just simply I like to go onto the sleeve and then I like to dominate the grips.
*  But the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted, you know. So I had to work hard,
*  really hard against it. What happened in that match?
*  It was a split decision in the end. And so to lose an Olympic final on a split decision is pretty,
*  you know, it's something that's still on my mind. And, you know, I think that it's a strange one
*  because I can still wake up that one and four years later at the Olympics because I was silver
*  medalist at the Olympics four years later as well. And yeah, it still haunts me.
*  Do you sometimes wake up and think like, man, I should have eaten better? Or like,
*  or maybe like a specific grip that you're like, I shouldn't have taken that grip.
*  I do, you know. I mean, the diet side of it is it's difficult to, you know, to really admit that,
*  isn't it? That you went to an Olympic Games and the one thing that you really sucked at, right,
*  was one of the most important things now at world level sport, you know, where you've got the
*  nutrition, you know, we've got it. You would think that most people have got it sorted,
*  but there's still people making mistakes and still people that haven't got it totally sorted.
*  And then there's people like Travis Stevens who I think doesn't care. He'll just have atrocious
*  nutrition and he just makes it work. I think the way he spoke about it is you can't always
*  control nutrition. So it's best to get good at having crappy nutrition.
*  It's a good way of looking at it. I never, yeah, maybe that's what I did.
*  Exactly. Do you remember what you were eating? We're talking about like candy or?
*  Yeah, well, I got a sweet tooth, you know, but I wasn't, it wasn't really, I mean, I didn't have a
*  lot of money at that particular time either, you know, so the diet wasn't steak and, you know, good
*  nutritional salads and things like that. You know, I did what I thought was best without,
*  you know, proper advice. And the crazy thing is, is that I had such good advice as well, you know,
*  when it came to kind of fitness training and things like that, we're quite ahead of our time and,
*  you know, we've really had it nailed as far as the air conditioning was concerned.
*  The judo training as well was a way in advance because I was a good trainer and I trained more
*  than most. I would, I can honestly say that. It probably got me away with, you know, a lot.
*  Where was your mind, so mental preparation, going into that Olympics? You said you were confident,
*  but is there some preparation aspect behind that confidence?
*  I think in the early days, I didn't think I was going to lose. I never thought it was possible
*  to lose. And I think that I went into every contest expecting to win. So when it didn't
*  quite go my way, I didn't lose that many contests, you know. So the only ones I lost were in the
*  final of the world championships or in the final of the Olympic games. So I didn't lose that many.
*  I never lost a European title. You know, I had seven golds at European championships, you know,
*  five seniors, two juniors, under 20s. And I never lost the final, you know. So it was,
*  and then I only lost two on a split decision, you know. So it was, I didn't lose that many.
*  And my attitude was that I wasn't going to lose and I couldn't lose, you know. So I was
*  always surprised when I did, when I, you know, something happened.
*  In Neil Adams, A Life in Judo, written in 1986, you wrote,
*  ever since I can remember, I have wanted to win. It wasn't the ordinary feeling that children have
*  when they take part in their first primary school sack race on a grass track or even the
*  keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order
*  to make it into the county side. With me, the desire to win was and still is as much a part of
*  me as my arms and legs. In other words, it wasn't something I learned as I grew older, but rather,
*  was deeply rooted in me. Perhaps this competitive instinct is the greatest difference between my
*  public image and the view from the inside. So people see the kindness, the warmth you have,
*  the charisma, the excitement, but there's this big drive to win inside you. So what's behind that?
*  Can you just speak to that, that drive to win and how that contributed to your-
*  When I look back now-
*  This is a lot of years ago, we should say.
*  It is a lot of years ago.
*  Is that true or were you just being poetic?
*  It's not far off. No, it's not. When I think about it now, because I'd like to think that I'm a
*  different person now and since I've calmed down, I see athletes now and I see them,
*  their arrogance, their walk and it's a strut. It's a confidence, isn't it?
*  And as we're older and as I've become older, I've calmed down. But it doesn't matter what I'm doing,
*  it's still that will to win and I'm much better at masking it now if I don't,
*  but it still bothers me as much.
*  You're talking about, I don't know, even just stupid silly things like a game of pool or
*  something like this or just anything.
*  I'm still trying to win. My son loves to play me at bowls because I'm useless and I just can't
*  throw a straight bowl. So he loves playing me at that, but it bugs me that I'm not better.
*  Yeah.
*  And there are certain things that I do. It really bugs me when I'm not good at it.
*  And I guess it's one of the reasons that long after I'd finished competition, judo,
*  people still want to train with you. And even at an older age, even now, if I do a seminar,
*  do you still do? Do you want to still go? Can I feel it? And one of the things that's in me is
*  that I just all the way up to 40 years of age. So from 30 when I finished competition up to 40,
*  I could still train with the best and I could still go with anybody. And then when 40 hit,
*  things started to fall off a little bit. I used to get either my hips or my legs and my knees.
*  And I realized that I had to pick my practices and that rankled as well. And I had to then just calm
*  it down a little bit. Otherwise I was going to be injured and I was going to be... It's not a good
*  thing when you get an older and you've still got the same competitive mind, but things change.
*  LW So it's still there. You get on the mat,
*  probably even now, right? You get on the mat with a world champion, the current world champion.
*  There's still a little part of you, like, could I still toss this guy? Kids these days are soft.
*  DF Well, you know what? Some of these athletes, I mean, like I give you a prime example, right,
*  is Ilias Iliadis. I mean, he is a monster, right? And you just, of course you couldn't,
*  because at 60 something, you couldn't. But you like to think that you could.
*  LW You could. You never know. You got to find out.
*  DF You know what you would do? What you can do is you can cause them problems,
*  and they feel it immediately, but you'd last a minute.
*  LW So you've trained with Iliadis Iliadis. I've gotten a chance to train with him as well. He's
*  a really nice guy, really great guy. DF He trained with me. We were training
*  together. Every hotel that we used to go into, we'd end up in the gym together and we'd train.
*  And this one time he was in there and he just wanted somebody to grab and grip hold of him.
*  So we ended up doing this kind of grappling in the middle of, you're like, the people doing
*  weight training and much, you know, the different things, watching these two madmen doing, I'm glad
*  we weren't on a mat at that particular time. But good fun.
*  LW What do you think about that guy? He, like you,
*  achieved a lot of success when he was young. DF 17, you imagine that, 17, 18 years of age,
*  and he's able to compete with the men. There's not many men can do that, you know, and it doesn't
*  happen very often. It happens later with the men. And often they're not physically as developed as
*  they, you know, so from me, for example, I fought Nevzorov, who was world and Olympic champion. He
*  was the current world and Olympic champion. And they sent me to the European championship,
*  senior at 17. And so that doesn't happen very often. And I fought, I pulled Nevzorov.
*  So I fought Nevzorov and I had him really worried, you know, because he expected,
*  without a doubt, to come out, throw this kid, you know, and junior.
*  LW And he was like thick and shredded, like, he's a man.
*  He was shredded. There's a picture of him in his judogi and his judogi is just cut, you know,
*  and he looks the business. And there's me in this baggy, like, skinny kid inside this baggy thing.
*  And the thing was, is that the more he tried and the harder he tried and the more he panicked,
*  the further it went away from him. And so, you know, of course, he got the decision at the end
*  and deservedly, but I worried him, you know, and so, and, and so for me, that was a massive
*  step forward because year later, I was, you know, starting to fill out and two years later,
*  I was competing for the Olympic title. So.
*  JL I don't know if I remember, but Ilias Iliadis is interesting because even at 17,
*  I feel like he was doing big throws, like, literally lifting them with his hands.
*  It just rips them out the ground, you know, and I was saying to Nikki, you know, my wife, and
*  she said, what would you do now that was different than the way you did then, you know?
*  And I said, I never had any pickups, you know, I didn't, that's not what we did,
*  you know, but you have a look at the young Ukrainians or the, you know, the young Russians
*  or the young Eastern Bloc Mongolians and they're ripping people out the ground. I mean, it's just
*  different style of judo and it's, it just looks different, but now they're starting to do
*  traditional style judo as well. JL So can you speak to that with the
*  different styles of judo? So for you, you mentioned Uchimura, Taitoshi, these, these,
*  how would you describe them? They're like these effortless, less lifting off the ground and power
*  and like strength and explore and more timing and position, movement, momentum, all this kind of
*  stuff. That's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo because like for Japanese judo,
*  the traditional judo, like you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort.
*  JL And of course we, 1990, we saw the introduction of all these Eastern Bloc countries,
*  you know, the, there were so many more. I mean, it was Soviet Union when I was competing. And then,
*  of course, in 1990, everything changed. And then there were so many more of them out there,
*  different countries, you know, that their wrestling styles were introduced into judo,
*  put a jacket on them and let's get into judo. So judo kind of changed shape. It changed shape from
*  this upright standing, you know, and having to know the technicalities of how to get a body that's
*  weighing 40, you know, 14 stone or, you know, whatever it is up into the air and using the
*  momentum and the balance and the direction and the skill to do that and knowing how to do it,
*  you know, and how to use movement. And then you get, you know, the wrestlers and the leg picks
*  and the double leg, single leg, double legs and, you know, and it kind of, by 1995, you know,
*  judo was bent over. And so it was the IOC that went to IJF, International Judo Federation,
*  and they said, you got to change this or we're just going to have one wrestling style. It looks
*  like wrestling with judo, with judo jackets on. So you either change it or we're going to take one
*  of you out. By the way, we should sort of clarify, when we say people are bent over, that's usually
*  how you see freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers are more bent over to defend the legs and so on.
*  And traditional judo, people are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do
*  the big throws and all that kind of stuff. But I think the other case to make for bending leg grabs
*  is, you know, a lot of people are using it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and
*  all that kind of stuff. So it's not just not to make it different from wrestling. It's also like
*  you want to maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch.
*  Yeah, win by judo, not by wrestling. And I think that the ones that were shouting about it
*  were the wrestlers, right? Because they like to compete with both. They want to do both. They want
*  to do their wrestling matches and then come into judo. So basically, I mean, what we've said is
*  they learn to do judo and there's nothing stopping you then from doing both, right? But not from the
*  other way around. All right. So rules always dictate development. They'll always dictate
*  which direction it goes. So if you introduce a rule that states that you cannot dive at the legs
*  and just pick up, then you'll have to do it standing up. And also it increases the possibility of
*  defense with the hips because actually good defense judo-wise, standing up is with the hips
*  as opposed to sticking your arms out and then sticking your backsides out there just to defend.
*  All right. So if you attack me and I move my body in the wrong place, so I'm in the wrong place at
*  the right time, so you don't hit the right target. And then also I use my hips. So again, it's a form
*  of judo that was being lost. So now we've got it back. So let's go there. Let's speak about judo
*  as if we're talking to a group of five-year-olds. So what is judo? What are some defining
*  characteristics of judo as a sport, as a way, as a martial art, as a way of life, all that kind of
*  stuff? I think when you say it is a way of life, I mean, I think the great advantage that we have
*  in judo, my young grandson, so I got two little boys that are three and a half years of age,
*  love going to our dojo. They love it. So dojo was the first word that they used.
*  It was one of the first. So when they come see us, so as I see my wife and I, it's like,
*  dojo. It's not grandma, granddad. It's a dojo. So dojo, they take their shoes off going into the
*  dojo. So they have respect for where they're at. And I think it has that kind of feeling that,
*  like I tried to build my dojo with a feeling of reverence. It's kind of almost peaceful.
*  So I'm not religious. I'm not a religious person, but I like going to old churches because
*  when I go into an old church, it doesn't matter what the religion within the church, but there's
*  a reverence in there. Reverence is a good word. It feels like a really special place, no matter
*  which dojo you go to. It's just you bow and there's calmness before the storm of battle
*  or whatever it is. Yeah. And respect, you know?
*  Yeah, respect. Look at the respect. We were just talking about it just before we came on air. We
*  were just saying that we very, very seldom do we have a situation where there is animosity
*  other than them fighting. So I'm not saying that they don't fight each other because sometimes
*  it does turn into a brawl. And at the end, two people bow off and show their respect.
*  And one of the things that, you know, like so a champion, I see people
*  winning events and they're good judokas. They're excellent. They win world championships,
*  might even win the Olympic games. But a great champion for me is somebody who treats,
*  who does the right thing when they lose. So when you see them lose, that's when you see the true
*  them. And actually that was one of the biggest things that I had to really cope with. So when
*  I lost the Olympic games in Moscow and also the one in Los Angeles, the hardest thing is when the
*  microphone's in there and you've got to be respectful and nice and the hardest thing is to smile.
*  But actually some of the great champions, you know, they'll go, that's just one match. You know,
*  I remember we've got one great champion, Agbegnenou. She's a five-time world champion,
*  Olympic champion. She's got, she's favorite as well to get this Olympic gold medal, French.
*  What a great champion she is, you know, because she lost one of the matches. I mean, she'd come
*  back and she'd given birth, come back after giving birth and everybody was going, well,
*  was she, you know, but then she, and then she lost one of the matches on the way through.
*  And she said, well, don't be upset. You know, it's just one match. It's just one contest,
*  you know, next time I'm going to put it right. And she did put it right. And now she's back up
*  there and she won the world title back. So, you know, these are great champions for me.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's the right way to see it, but it's also tragic to lose the Olympic games,
*  you know, twice. Yes, it is tragic. And I do say I do have sleepless nights. I mean, that's the magic
*  of the Olympic games. Anything can happen. And your 1980 Olympics were very different from 1984.
*  But if we just linger on the 80 and just your, we were talking about
*  how much you wanted to win. Do you love winning or hate losing more?
*  I hate losing more, but I love winning. When I won the world title the year later,
*  and I had no doubt when I went in that day that I was going to be world champion. No doubt.
*  So you won the 81 world championship.
*  At the higher weight.
*  At the higher, the 78.
*  Yes.
*  KG. Actually, can we go there? What was going through your mind? You ended up arm barring
*  a Japanese fighter. I talked to Jimmy Pedro, a friend of yours, somebody who said you were
*  a mentor to him for many years. And he's told me a bunch of different questions to ask you,
*  but he said that was a really special time. That was a really special, like, dominant
*  run you had. And especially finishing with an arm barring as a Japanese player. So
*  take me through that. What do you remember from that?
*  I think that it was, so my weight was better. I didn't have to lose weight. That was one thing.
*  So the nutritional side wasn't as important, but probably, you know, it still wasn't as good as it
*  could be, my nutrition. Although it was getting better and I was trying to eat the right things
*  at the right time. But I still trained really well and I was so confident there going into that world
*  championships that I could win it. I had no doubt in my mind that I was going to win. But,
*  you know, obviously, corner of your mind, you're thinking, just don't make mistakes. But, you know,
*  this is the incredible thing is that once you start to ask you, once I see contests change
*  direction when I'm commentating, so I can see somebody who's in there just going forward,
*  trying to win. Right? So, and that's a difference to somebody who's trying not to lose. And there's
*  two different ways, you know, so sometimes when you, so when I was world champion, then I had a
*  period of time where every time I stepped out there, I was really afraid of losing. And I think
*  that that's what happens later on in your competitive career. You know, the great champions
*  managed to come through that. Teddy Rene is one of those, you know, he just, he puts it out there
*  and he keeps beating them, you know, so they can't take it away from him. You know, it's fantastic.
*  Just stepping on the mat every single encounter, you're trying to win, you're looking for the
*  grips and the, with the intention to throw, throw big, even when you're ahead on points,
*  all that kind of stuff. That's a really good point is that if you go ahead in a match and you look at
*  the clock, it depends when you go ahead. So sometimes you can go ahead in the first minute
*  and you've still got three minutes to go. So I see the ones then that go into, I don't want to lose
*  because they go into defensive mode and then sometimes they can lose it on penalties or
*  something can go wrong and the other one comes on strong and then they can sneak the contest.
*  And so it's, it's really difficult, but what, when I was coaching, I was trying to always encourage
*  that positive attitude for the full four minutes, five minutes then.
*  I've competed a lot in judo and jiu-jitsu. I've always hated that part of myself. When I'm up
*  on points by a lot, you look at the clock and it's what you do when you look at the clock.
*  A minute and a half, you're really tired and you kind of quit. You just defend.
*  I hated that part about myself.
*  You're saying don't do it.
*  Well, as opposed to just go out in judo, that's for a big throw. Just keep going for the throw.
*  In jiu-jitsu, it's go for the submission. Like throw a caution, like win in the real way versus
*  on points. I hated that part of myself. I mean, mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by
*  exhaustion.
*  Exhaustion's the one, isn't it? But it is, isn't it? It's a mindset as well. So actually,
*  trying to get your mind positive all the way through. So I mean, if you listen, when I
*  commentated now is I say, I hope that they don't change the mindset and that they keep on,
*  and they are going forward all the time. And actually they're then more difficult to catch.
*  We had won just a couple of weeks ago and he lost in the final second of the contest.
*  He was the only one to score. He got penalized all the way up, two seconds to go and stepped out of
*  the area. But he went like that thinking the bell was just going. And the bell went one second
*  after he actually stepped out. So he got penalized, lost the match and lost all of the points for
*  qualification. So it was, you know, that's paying high price. That's paying high price.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's, there's a thin line between a triumph and tragedy in those competitions,
*  but especially at the Olympic games. So let's just stick on 81 world championship. What did it feel
*  like to win that world championship? Like, and also getting an arm bar is the Japanese player.
*  Jimmy told me your arms were exhausted. Yeah. I mean, you just, I, the thing is, is sometimes,
*  you know, when you're going, when it's competitive as well, you know,
*  ours is a different intensity to like, you just, where you can take time a little bit, ours is bang.
*  It's transitioning from standing down. You've got 10, 15 seconds to go in there. You go in a hundred
*  percent. It's a bit like running a full out for 10 seconds. Like, and then you've got to decide then,
*  especially if they're defending it, whether you let it go, because when you get up and your forearms
*  are blown, you know, and you've got lactic acid in there and you've still got to grip up. Because
*  remember ours is about gripping as well on the jacket. So if you can't grip up, then you can't
*  gain the advantage, then they can throw you, you know, so you have to decide. So I had a massive
*  attack on him and we changed directions four or five times and then I wasn't going to let him go.
*  But I still, you know, when I was turning him there, I had to decide, am I going to go all out
*  for this and just, or, you know, like there has been occasions when I've kind of released it
*  to just, you know, I forgot a minute to go and just lock out.
*  Yeah. So, so what you're saying on the feet, there was a change of direction,
*  all different kinds of attempts and then you went to the ground. And so what was that? Do you remember
*  that decision of like, okay, am I going to finish this?
*  Yeah, I knew it. I just, as soon as I climbed his back and then I thought he's not going,
*  he's not going, I'm not going to let him up, you know, so I was just changing,
*  voicing your head.
*  A little something in my head was going, don't, don't, you know, just stick on him. And then
*  it's always about pressure on the arm. And, and I just, you know, and of course he was like that,
*  you know, defending, you know, he was almost total bridge trying to get out of it.
*  Did it start in turtle and then like, did you flip him?
*  Started in turtle because I did an attack, came back out of the attack and then he went onto his
*  front. And then I was on his back and then I started the whole time.
*  Saw an opening and you just went for it?
*  It was an automatic transition. So I mean, the transitions are what we teach, you know,
*  because the ones that are quicker down with the transitions are the ones that catch it.
*  That's our newaza. You know, our groundwork is the transition from standing down to ground.
*  It's very, you know, we don't have a situation where you can kind of work your way in. You are
*  in or you're not in, you're standing, you know, so you've got to make sure that you're in. And so I
*  had, I was just on his back like a leech and I never let him go.
*  So you see, I mean, yeah, so that's where the arm bars, that's where the attacks on the ground,
*  which is called newaza happens in the transition at that level, at that high world-class level.
*  Yeah. I mean, he was no muggy though. I think he just got third,
*  third place in the all Japan championships, which is all weight categories. So he was,
*  he wasn't a mug, you know, he was, he was strong and I'd fought him once before and I knew he was
*  a lefty as well, which was really awkward for me. Did it feel good? Better for me than him.
*  It did. It felt amazing, you know, because it was almost like all these things, disappointments and
*  everything had kind of come to this one point where I was at last kind of champion of the world.
*  It's everything I said as a kid that I had no idea how difficult it was going to be, you know?
*  So as a kid, as a 14 year old kid, I remember saying, I'm going to be world champion. I'm
*  going to be the best in the world. I had no idea how difficult that was going to be.
*  Well, there's wisdom to that, right? Like there's power and stupidity of youth.
*  I like that.
*  Right. Just like I'm going to be world champion. I'm going to win this without knowing how hard it is.
*  And then once you go after it, you're trapped. You're going to have to do the work.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, you still have a lot with parents as well. You know, parents, you know,
*  our little Johnny is, you know, he's amazing and he's this, that and the other. They have no idea
*  what's out there. I remember the very first time I stepped out in 1974 into the European cadets.
*  And I remember that we were fighting. I'd only ever fought in Great Britain. I was the top,
*  you know, I was unbeaten in the juniors, kids, and went out there and there were these
*  different fighters out there that were treating me with total disdain. And I remember thinking,
*  how dare they, you know, that, you know, and I realized when I came back from that event,
*  there's other people out there. There's just a whole, you know, and there are different levels
*  of, you know, the majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different
*  levels that there are out there. Do you remember like a certain opponent that for the first time
*  you felt like, holy shit. Yeah. There's like somebody just gripped you up and you're like,
*  this is, there's another level to this game. Ezio was, Ezio was one of them. And I fought him,
*  I beat him in the European championships. I beat him in, you know, two times and then lost him in
*  the Olympic games two months after I'd beaten him in the European championship. Yeah. So it wasn't,
*  that made it even more difficult, right? So that made it more difficult. And so he,
*  Ezio was one and getting hold of, I remember getting hold of Nishida of Japan and he had me
*  going up and down and I just, I thought, wow, this guy is amazing, you know, and I'd never fought,
*  first time I ever fought Japanese in a major tournament, you know, and I felt the danger.
*  I always talk about the danger when we go out to Japan to train. I could go probably months
*  without getting thrown in training here in Europe and I go to Japan and, you know, everybody's
*  throwing you, you know, and that's difficult to accept. And the reason that kind of danger and
*  that kind of feeling of danger is something that puts a real edge on, you know, and so that was
*  first time when I got hold of Nishida, I thought, oh my God, you know, this guy, you know, it didn't
*  matter which way he was turning like that, he had me stretched out and I thought this, I want to do
*  this, you know, and then I ended up fighting him again in Japan. So that feeling of danger is really
*  interesting. It's like I've, you know, did randori with a lot of world-class people from different
*  parts of the world, including Ilias Eliades and like there's a certain part like Eastern
*  European Judo, you feel like you're screwed the whole way through, like the gripping, you really
*  feel it in the gripping. It's the gripping that does it. But in with Japanese, like really good
*  Japanese style Judoca, you don't, it's like, it's a terrifying calmness, at least the experiences
*  I've had, you don't really feel it in the gripping. You just feel like anywhere you step,
*  you're getting thrown. It's a different. It's a different thing, isn't it? It's a different thing.
*  So, I mean, mine was kind of a mixture. I liked it to be a mixture because there was,
*  the gripping is definitely the key point. So if you get high level guys that are gripping up,
*  and I always used to put this to the referees when we were doing referee seminars, when we first
*  started them. And I'd say how many, because like they would referee to their understanding of the
*  match. So they were penalizing for certain grips that were, and actually, so as an ex-athlete,
*  high level, I would say, have you ever gripped up with high level? All right, because if you haven't,
*  you need to do it because then you will understand why they do certain things with the grips,
*  because these guys are like, when somebody grips you and you think, you know you're going to go,
*  when Iliadis puts his arm over your back, all right, and you know you're going to go up and over.
*  You know you're going to go over. That's it. It's a cool feeling. It's like whatever-
*  Not for me.
*  Well, I understand. But it's like, I mean, because it's not, it feels way more powerful than it should.
*  It's weird. I don't know, you want to attribute it to strength and all that kind of stuff.
*  People say you have immense upper body strength, but it's probably something else. It's like
*  technique. It's some kind of weird-
*  It's a mix of everything.
*  Just like something hardened through lots of battles and randorian, that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's cool that humans are able to generate that kind of power. It's cool.
*  When I was 84 Olympics, but I'm just going to go there now just quickly, but there was,
*  we had a freestyle wrestler. He's American, actually, but he had English nationality.
*  So he competed for Noel Loben, his name is, and he competed for Great Britain. He got
*  third place at the Olympics in 84. But he was training. We were training at Budokai and he
*  came to do some judo and put jacket on. Of course, he was training with some of the lower levels and
*  he was really handling himself well. Then he said, I need to feel, you know, when we did randori,
*  you know, so he did some randori with me. And I immediately thought, I got to catch it. I
*  got to stop single leg and double leg because he was really quick, right? So strong as well,
*  90 something kilos. He was like, you know, he's a big guy. So I caught a sleeve, immediately caught
*  and controlled him and then he couldn't start, right? So he said, I needed to feel the difference.
*  So then I thought, I better reciprocate this. So I said, well, you know, so we did the randori
*  and I threw him a couple of times. He said, I'm really glad we did that. So then I said,
*  I need to feel the difference as well. So we take the jackets off. So we took the jackets off and he
*  was a nightmare. This guy was a nightmare and like a monster, you know, and he was like single
*  legging me. And, you know, it was just totally different, you know, so it was like the jacket
*  makes a massive difference, huge difference to something, you know, and people think it's just
*  the jacket that we're wearing, but it isn't. It's our only tool actually.
*  Yeah. And it's control. I mean, it's a way of establishing control over another body.
*  And it's a whole art form and a science. And I don't even know if you understand it, really,
*  you understand it sort of subconsciously through time. Because like there's so much involved,
*  because pulling on one part of the jacket pulls other parts of the jacket. And like the physics
*  of that is probably insane to understand. It's absolutely insane. And then, you know,
*  they changed the rules for a little while and they changed the rules so that you couldn't hold,
*  you know, certain grips were not allowed, you only allowed certain amount of time and there
*  were a lot of penalties for them. And then, you know, they had some of the ex-fighters into the
*  referee commission. And so we were pushing for just let them grip, you know, because that's
*  our game, you know, that's what makes us different. You know, again, if grip up with somebody like,
*  so they were on about Teddy Rene, Teddy Rene comes out, takes the sleeve, big arm over the top,
*  and then, you know, he throws people, right? So they were saying, yeah, but stop,
*  you can't stop him doing it. This guy is six foot nine. And he is built like Garth, you know,
*  he's like, and he's, and not only that, he's skillful as well, you know, and, and he's got
*  that mentality of a winner. He has got that mentality of a winner there. He just wins
*  important matches. And he goes over the top of the group. Did they, where's that land now in terms
*  of rules over the top? Because those are some of the most epic, awesome types of grips.
*  Yeah. Just like over the top, just big grab. Yeah. Well, as long as they're throw from it,
*  so they can take any grip, as long as you move them and then catch them kind of action reaction,
*  really, you know, as long as you catch them on the move, then you can do it. So as long as you're
*  not using it to stall or that kind of stuff. Yeah. You can't block out. Yeah. So I mean, if I,
*  so like, for example, if I've got dominant grip on you and I just block out and I'm just,
*  I just stop you attacking me. So then what I get you three penalties, get you off and you haven't
*  done an attack. So we've got to stop that. You can't have that. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
*  You were the favorite to win the 1984 Olympics, but you got silver. I watched that match several
*  times. You probably haven't have a playing in your head. So there is a nice change of direction
*  by your opponent, German Frank Winnicki. Yeah. It was a fake right Uchimata and then to a left
*  drops Sayonagi. How did that loss feel? Devastating is not, you know, it's not enough,
*  really. Because, you know, the strange thing was, is coming into that Olympics, I was tired,
*  really tired. So my mental state wasn't the best, wasn't certainly the same as it was coming into
*  the previous. And I, I remember thinking I just need to get this over with, then I'm going to have
*  a break and just have a rest, you know, and, and that's totally the wrong attitude. It's just not,
*  not good for going into an Olympic Games. And so I was coming in there with a different mindset.
*  And I remember every match that I had, I was winning well, but I was winning with a struggle.
*  You know, it was, it was really not, I'd fought Novak and I was pretty of France, who was one of
*  the strongest physically, that was in the quarterfinals. I beat Brett Barron by an Ipon,
*  I armlocked him. I won my first match by Ipon as well. And then Michelle Novak, I was fighting
*  a France and I was lucky to, to, to win it. I was up, I would scored on him, but I was like
*  starting to defend and just everything that I talked to you about, you know, and they're
*  just about held on and, and then I won and, you know, so him and I were talking afterwards,
*  like some years afterwards. And he said, I was close, wasn't I? I was, yeah, but not close enough.
*  I didn't mean it, but I had to say it. Right. Of course. Of course. And no, he was right,
*  you know, and it was one of those. So it's through to the semi-final. I fought Lesak
*  in the semi-final of, and I'd fought him in the semi-final of the Worlds as well.
*  I'd never gone time with him, you know, I'd never, I'd always beaten him
*  fairly easily and with by Ipon and that went time. So I was, you know, I was just, just glad to get
*  it done. And I was in the final then against Frank Winnicker of Germany and I'd beaten Winnicker
*  before, but he was just a young German coming through. And when I started the final, I was,
*  I thought, right, I've just, and I started all my techniques just that little bit off.
*  Nothing was coordinated. Just, it was just, I can't really explain why it was just a little bit off.
*  And I see it so often now with a lot of the guys that are going for second, third Olympic games.
*  And I see their technique just not quite there and they're struggling and I know when they,
*  you know, I know what they're going through and I kind of empathize with them.
*  Well, you were, it felt like you were dominating that final.
*  I dominated it. Yeah, I was winning. Yeah, I was. And actually, if it had gone another minute and
*  a half, it would have been all over and I would have been Olympic champion and it would have been
*  done. He wouldn't have batted an eyelid, right? Because he would have fought me really, really
*  well. And he would have, you know, we talked about it afterwards and he said, he was just my
*  good day for me, you know, and he knows he was very respectful. This guy is very respectful.
*  He was surprised almost. I mean, not almost. He was very surprised and celebrating like a
*  surprise. Yeah, jumping up and down like, you know, he just, and you can look at that, can't you?
*  Go, well, it wasn't upon, but you know, would I have got it back? I don't know. But I just,
*  I think that actually taking the pressure off, because that was another thing as well,
*  pressure of being favorite, you know, and I see that with a lot of them and, you know,
*  the great champions, the ones that keep coming through, Capellic, there's a guy, you know,
*  he can look very ordinary and then comes the big tournament and he'll win it.
*  The tragedy of the Olympic Games. I mean, you were the favorite and
*  just like that, like split moment, you lost it.
*  Split moment, devastating and lived it probably not every day, but, you know, Nikki, my wife will tell
*  you that woken up in sweats and, you know, and I think they contributed as well because I had a
*  period of my life after where I was drinking too much and, you know, and I think kind of,
*  when I look back, kind of led into that kind of dark period of my life, you know, and I never,
*  ever, ever, you know, did it go through my mind, anything else, but it definitely affected me and
*  I was on a downward kind of spiral in a lot of different ways and would still, even, you know,
*  we have an amazing marriage and we have an amazing family and everything's great,
*  but I still wake up sometimes and I'll say, I've just dreamt, you know, that it's the same
*  reoccurring dream where I'm trying to get somewhere and I'm trying to put it right, you know, and I've
*  got this chance of putting this Olympic final right, you know, in this dream I've got a chance
*  of doing it, but I can't get there and the traffic's stopping me or something stops me and I,
*  you know, and then I wake up and I'm sweating and you think, well, after all this time, that's not
*  possible, but it is and it happens. Yeah. I mean, in the match itself, there's that feeling
*  for me just watching it, like you're going for throws, you're almost getting there with the
*  throws and it's almost like he's going for a kind of crappy Uchimura and then you're just like,
*  you're stopping, you're blocking it and all of a sudden, I mean, that's the beauty of the Olympics.
*  He finds it in himself to switch in that, like, against a favorite, against sort of
*  the great British judoka just finds the perfect drop Sinegagi.
*  Well, you know, his team doctor and coach, he came up to me afterwards and said,
*  I'm just really sorry and that's all they said is I'm just really sorry. They were sorry because,
*  you know, obviously the obvious sadness about that, you know, and of course everybody takes
*  their, you know, I went actually two and a, was it three weeks later, the German Open.
*  So he had to compete in the German Open three weeks later. So I went over to fight him
*  and beat him in the final of the German Open and it didn't do anything for me because it was a much
*  tighter match. He was a lot closer. He had a lot more confidence coming in. So he fought me a lot
*  differently and then it was me pulling it back and just managing to win in the final. And I thought,
*  well, that might appease, appease nothing. Didn't do anything.
*  When you give your whole life to judo just and your love of winning,
*  that's crazy how much the Olympic games mean.
*  It means so much and I think, you know, but I've got to, and I've got to say this and this is
*  honestly, you know, if it meant that if I'd have won that Olympic games and it had to change my
*  life into a different direction, which I probably would have not competed in the 88 Olympic games
*  then. All right. So if it had changed my life and then I didn't have, I didn't meet my wife and I,
*  you know, didn't have my family that I've got now, there's no, you know, I would,
*  I wouldn't swap that what I've got now for anything.
*  Well, part of the demons that you've gotten to know because of those losses is part of
*  probably the central reason that made you the man you are, a legend of the sport. You could have
*  been not that because an Olympic gold is just an Olympic gold.
*  Yeah. And it is, isn't it? You know, and I think that there's a lot of Olympic champions and world
*  champions that win and then are forgotten. And I said to Nikki, I said, my wife, I said,
*  I don't want to be forgotten and I want to be remembered. So I'm going to do anything, anything
*  I do, if I'm going to do commentary or whatever it is, or coaching, I want to do coaching to a
*  high level and I want to commentate at a high level. I remember the first commentary I ever
*  did, it was terrible. And I just thought I've got to do better than this. And I thought I just,
*  I need to do it well and I've got to do it professionally.
*  So in the book, A Game of Throws, you have a chapter titled Lessons in Losing. So what are
*  some of the lessons here? What are some of the deeper lessons you've pulled out of losing?
*  I think great champions are made up of the people that handle it in the right way.
*  And you could say, well, I don't like losing and you could throw your dummy out the pram and
*  you can be a bad loser in front of everybody. And actually people pick up on that very, very quickly.
*  You know what it's like in broadcasting, right? Somebody has a bad word to say about somebody.
*  Yeah. But actually the ones that endear themselves to you are the ones that
*  handle it in the right way, the correct way. It doesn't mean that you've got to like it.
*  I didn't like it. And I thought that I handled it certainly in later years in the right way.
*  And I like to see athletes do it in the right way. And I think that it's a make or break situation.
*  It's not all the contest they win. It's the one that they lose and then how they pick themselves
*  up and handle themselves after. So I think that is a big one for me. And also, I went through,
*  obviously, a later divorce and that was difficult on my son, really difficult on Ashley.
*  And then I think that some of that was the fact that I wasn't drinking all the time,
*  but I was drinking in excess at the wrong times. And I think that that's what a lot of people do.
*  Is that they use it for the wrong reasons. I used to hear it. I still hear it now all the time.
*  I need to knock the edge off and I need to just forget. And you need to be in a fuzzy place
*  for a while. And I had a lot of time in a fuzzy place and I needed to get rid of that. And I needed
*  to clear my head. Where was that place? Some of the lower points in your life that you've reached
*  mentally? I think definitely the fact that my first marriage didn't work. And that was,
*  you know, it's a mix of things between us. And then, you know, so that's not where I wanted to
*  be at the time. And the effects that it had on my son, it took a long time for him then to come
*  around and to trust me again and to have belief. He always had belief in me, but to trust me again.
*  And then I think that that was low. And I think that, you know, when I look back,
*  is that a lot of my bad decisions were when I was in that fuzzy kind of haze. And then it got
*  progressively worse. That got progressively worse to the degree where it was, you know,
*  trying to hide it and trying to hide how much. And I was kind of a functioning kind of drunk.
*  I think you could probably say that. And I was functioning, I was still able to,
*  I was still training most days, crazily enough. I was training to kind of mask it and cover it.
*  And that was probably my savior that I was still, you know, because I remember I said to my wife,
*  I said to Nikki, I'm probably the fittest, if I'm a drunk, then I'm a fittest drunk in the world.
*  She said, yeah, you probably are actually. You know, I was in great condition for a drunk.
*  So the fuzzy haze, where was your mind? Did you have periods of depression?
*  I had periods of depression. I can honestly say that my depression wasn't that bad. Although I did,
*  you know, when it's like anything that gives you an up, you know, it gives you an even bigger down,
*  doesn't it? You know, and so I hated that feeling and also hated myself for letting it happen.
*  Because I have got this really, it's a bizarre, I don't know whether you can call it a power,
*  but I have the ability to be able to say stop. And I can just, and that's what I did in the end.
*  In the end, there was an incident when I was working for Belgian Judo, and there was an
*  incident. It was Christmas. It was, I tell you exactly the day, it was 20th of December.
*  And me and a Belgian coach, we got absolutely hammered. But we were at the wrong place and he
*  got noticed. And so I remember they pulled me up in front of this board. And I looked down at these
*  guys and half of them were people I didn't want to be in that situation with. You know,
*  they're not people that I respected and they're not people that I trusted. So I said,
*  if you're going to sack me, sack me, but I promise you now that I will just,
*  this is it, I'll stop. I'm just going to stop. I've decided. On the way back in the car,
*  I rang Nikki up, my wife, and I said, whatever you hear now, whatever, I'm just going to stop.
*  So that was it. Stopped. You just saw the moment and said, stop. Stop. So that fuzzy place,
*  what advice could you give to people about how to overcome that dark place, the depression,
*  whether it has to do with drinking or not? I think if it's to do with drinking,
*  all I can say is that the two days or a week into not drinking, you'll feel different.
*  You know, it'll make a physical difference and you'll like that physical difference.
*  Mm hmm.
*  And then from a mental perspective as well, because I think that you have a massive downer,
*  and I think that that must be because of drugs as well, because I had a situation with my brother,
*  you know, he was like, you know, professional wrestling and the drugs was an element there.
*  So I'd never touched a drug or even seen one in my life, but I'd let the alcohol side go too far
*  and then decided never to do that. So then I guess I had people ringing me up saying, how can we stop?
*  When they say, can I have a word? Can I discuss something with you? And I know then what they
*  want to discuss with me, you know? And the thing is that I would say, you know, if you stop,
*  then feel the effects of it and it will make a difference to your everyday life and that
*  will make a massive difference. And I think about anybody who kind of, you know, is down all the
*  time is to find the cause of what's pushing you down, you know what I mean? And try and
*  attack that. I mean, because it's never, somebody once said to me, they said,
*  whatever you got, you know, we've got something special. I mean, we have a great life and
*  I've had a great competition record, you know, it could have been better, but it was great. But
*  I've had success with my business and we're still out there and we have a great life. We travel
*  all the world and, you know, there's people out there that would live in your house at the drop
*  of a hat, wherever you are, they drive your car, you know, no matter what car it is, some people
*  haven't got a car, you know, and whatever food you're having and you're moaning about food,
*  right? Somebody out there that would take that and gladly eat that. All right, so there's always
*  somebody worse off than you. And I think that we tend to sometimes, you know, look at the things
*  that we haven't got rather than the things we have got. Yeah, it's a skill probably to be grateful
*  for the things you have exactly as you said, in this sometimes the little things like food and
*  cars and all that kind of stuff, just to have gratitude for and family, all this kind of stuff.
*  So, but it's still, you know, having talked to a bunch of Olympic athletes,
*  there is a, you know, when you give so much of your life to winning and then you lose,
*  sometimes even when you win, but when you lose at the very top, it's a tough, tough,
*  like tough thing to go through. The most difficult thing, I think, for anybody is when they have to
*  decide when to stop. Yeah, yeah. You know, and all of a sudden, and I see the ones that are going
*  to second Olympic games and then third Olympic, and the ones that are there and they're holding
*  on and they're in their 30s now, different to when they were 19 years of age, you know, 30 something
*  is different to 19. And then what are you going to do afterwards, you know, and then how do you become
*  just a normal person? You're never going to be a normal person as such, but I think you've got to
*  do normal things, you know, and then you've got, I remember the first time that when I finished
*  competition, I had good sponsors. This was, you know, 40 years ago, but I had two really good
*  sponsorships, Vitamin Company and also a judogi company, and I had a car and, you know, I had
*  money. I just, and I was going all over the world. I was successful, and then I stopped,
*  and they took everything back. They took my car, and they did it within two weeks as well. They
*  stopped my funding, you know, and the Vitamin Company said, thank you very much. It's been a
*  great, you know, we've done well by you. Bye bye. This was after your last Olympics. 88 Olympics.
*  You know, when that finished and then that was it, you know, and then it's right. Okay. First time
*  I had to go in there and buy a tracksuit and a pair of training shoes. Wow. Yeah, those are
*  different with sitting there in the evening by yourself. So you go from seven days a week or six
*  days a week going into the gym and, you know, you're working out the dojo and then you don't
*  have to do it. You know, and that's why you get a lot of, when they finish competition, they finish
*  that 30 to 40. It's still, I mean, Ilias is still doing it now. He's still in there and he's still,
*  you know, and because he can, right? Okay. And it's natural. And I did exactly the same.
*  And then, like I say, you just get to an age and you just think, well, I'm just going to kind of
*  take a step back. Which is why, like, there's certain athletes like Ryo Kotani never stops.
*  It just dominates for 14 years. Probably one of the winningest athletes in Judo. Yeah. Seven time
*  world champ, two time Olympic champ, medaled at five Olympics. So it's always impressive. Never
*  stopped. Never stopped. So that's an option. If you're like the greatest ever. It'd be interesting,
*  wouldn't it? Just to see what they're doing now, you know, because at some stage you have to get
*  a normal job. You do have to stop. You do have to stop. You know, at some stage, you have to decide
*  what you're going to do. You know, and we, you know, it's either into coaching, the Judo is either
*  to coaching, or if you're not in coaching, then it's into something to do with the media. And,
*  you know, I was lucky that I, it was just by accident really with the commentary. Somebody said,
*  would you do a voiceover? So I did this voiceover and that was back in 1982. I did that.
*  So you've been commentating since 1982. I did some voiceovers. I wouldn't call it
*  commentating, but I did some voiceovers and then I did some, we did some different
*  European championships, world championship kind of events. And I did the voiceovers for it.
*  And the way that it was done, that it was more narration. And so it kind of turned into then
*  somebody asked me to do an event. And when you listen to the intonation of the voice and stuff
*  like that, it wasn't like it is now, but I guess that's just something that developed as a, you
*  know, because then it was coming from the heart and I, you know, started to get excited and just
*  do my thing. And it was just me really. It's just my style. Well, I've listened to your commentary
*  from a while back. I don't know if it's the eighties, but it's still there.
*  I think it's timing as well, isn't it? It's like, you know, you get your timing a bit better
*  and know when to go in, when to come out, when to say something, when not, you know, and I think
*  that in the early days, I tended to think, I tended to want to talk all the time and you don't have
*  to do that. Also knowing when to shut up. That's the key, isn't it? Yeah. Part of the dramas and
*  the silence building up to the setup and the throw and all that kind of stuff. But also,
*  you're very good at, while radiating passion, being very precise and specific about the details
*  of the throw and the setup and why something worked and didn't. Yeah, I think there's two
*  kinds of commentating. You can commentate what you see and then you commentate what
*  people can't see, you know? And so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding
*  of what's happening in the inner part of the game, so it might be a technical thing or it might be
*  the tactical part of the play here that's going on. And if you can introduce that as well,
*  then you've got an advantage. Quick pause. I need a breath and break. Okay. Good stuff.
*  So we just took a little break and went to judotv.com, which is, I guess, an IGF website. IGF is the
*  organization behind a lot of the big judo events in the world. And I just signed up. You should
*  sign up too. That's great. Absolutely. Sign up. Cheaper the price. Cheaper the price.
*  And you can watch basically any match from the Grand Slams and go back through history, I guess.
*  Yeah, I've got to say, Lex, I mean, everybody, still people saying to me, oh, you know,
*  we need more judo on television. They've got judo on television every other week that they can
*  access all of the top people in all the top events. And it costs $100 a year, you know,
*  to access everything. And they can play all the videos. I mean, we've just accessed this here,
*  the Paris tournament, and we're going to have a look at Teddy Renier. But, you know, it's so
*  cheap at the price. So we're now in Paris Grand Slam 2024. Teddy Renier final. By the way,
*  super cool. Like you click on the draw and you can just look at any of the matches.
*  You can go to the bottom of the finals. You can go. Yeah, to any one. Any one of them. That's so
*  cool. That's really well done. Really well done interface. Anyway, let me first ask the
*  ridiculous big question. Who do you think is the greatest of all time? Is Teddy Renier in the
*  writing? He's the greatest judo winner of all time. Of that, there's no doubt. You know, I mean,
*  he is. And I think if you asked him whether he was the greatest judo man in the world of all time,
*  he would say, no, I'm not. You know, and he's not the greatest judo man. There are people with,
*  you know, more beautiful judo in some ways, although he's got great technique.
*  But he is the ultimate winner. Ten time world champ, two time gold medalist in the Olympics.
*  I guess two time bronze medalist. He's probably going, he's going to Paris. Yeah. He's going
*  after it again. So he's right here. I mean, he's right there. You know, this was just a couple of
*  months ago. And then last week, this last week, he was out again and he won again. You think he
*  gets gold medal this time? There's people getting closer to him, right? Because he's obviously,
*  you know, is age wise and the amount of time that he's been there is obviously somebody that
*  is starting not quite at his best as he was when he was younger. But he, like I say, he still puts
*  it on the line. He lays it on the line every single time. And then not only does he lay it on
*  the line, but he beats them all, you know, and last week he just beat Saito, who was a young
*  up and coming Japanese fighter, and he beat him in the final. It was close and he did well.
*  There are certain people, the smaller ones actually, not the taller ones, because like,
*  you know, we're saying about the big arm over the top that he likes and the dominant grip that he
*  likes. There are people that can give him a hard time. Now, if at the Olympic games, he has two or
*  three of those on the trot, it might work against him, you know, and it's by no means an absolute
*  certainty that he's going to win the Olympic gold medal. But he's got to be one of the favorites,
*  top favorite. You know, no matter what happens now, Teddy Renair is the greatest winner that,
*  you know, and if you asked the great Yamashita, he would say the same, you know, there's nobody
*  that's, you know, and Yamashita was unbeaten in international competition. And I trained with
*  Yamashita a lot over a two year period and got to know him quite well. And he was one of the greatest
*  of all times, you know, for me was one of the greatest judo men. And I'm talking about from
*  a technical point of view, from a spectacular judo point of view, understanding the fundamental
*  principles of how techniques work, sometimes having, you know, different techniques that work
*  for you, you know, so if one doesn't work and one particular direction doesn't work, you can change
*  the direction completely. In case people don't know, Yamashita is this legendary judoka,
*  heavyweight, Teddy Renair, heavyweight, that's plus 100 kg. So he would have caused him all
*  sorts of problems. Oh yeah, that would have been, that's cool. Who do you think wins, Yamashita?
*  Yes, I think Yamashita. But you know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you think Yamashita
*  beats Teddy Renair? I think so. Strong words. You think so. You think so. Yamashita is on the
*  shorter side, right? Yeah, and he finds it more difficult with shorter people, you know, and so
*  it was, it would have been a very interesting confrontation. And I think if you asked Yamashita,
*  he would probably say, you know, that Teddy Renair, he's very gracious, he's really gracious.
*  It would be really good, it would have been an unbelievable matchup. And I've got to say this,
*  that, you know, Teddy Renair is the greatest winner of all time. Competition wise. So it's
*  interesting, both of them, maybe you can correct me, but have this osotogari, which is kind of
*  trip that I never understood. Yeah. It's a very tricky thing to do, right? It's very easy to
*  do maybe as a white belt, you roll in, you can understand. But like to do it at the high,
*  high level. You see any of the top guys now, especially if they're second time out, you know,
*  so like they might catch somebody by surprise, they come out and they go bang, oh, and you go,
*  that was amazing, right? But if they fought again, 10 minutes later, you go, you're not going to
*  catch me with that, right? You've got a different situation here. And so it's slightly different.
*  But the best fighters adapt like that. And they're able to see a situation, feel the situation,
*  and they attack once and then go again and attack second, third time. And in the third time,
*  they make it work. Yeah, both Yamashita and Teddy Renair with the osotogari, they'll just like hit
*  it over and over in the match. Yeah. Sometimes it'll hit first time and it won't go. And then
*  you make a readjustment of the way in. It's a little bit like, I mean, if you take a really
*  easy way of understanding it is if we're shooting at a target, and all of a sudden you start moving
*  that target, you know, it's different hitting a moving target. But it's also different hitting
*  a moving target that's trying to hit you as well. And that's our game, right? So we're not only
*  trying to throw a moving target, we're trying to throw a moving target that's trying to throw us.
*  So that makes it even more difficult. Yeah, there's a few folks who
*  you know what's coming. It's like over and over and over. It's the same attack. Anyway, with this
*  uchimata, it's like, it's different. There's not many people like that where it's like this
*  the same attack. I mean, there's other attacks also, but they'll just go after the same thing
*  over and over and over. When I watch great athletes, most of them can throw over both
*  flanks, not always going left and right, you know, although our sport always, I mean, the
*  cat is always demonstrated left and right. So like if you demonstrate, if you do something
*  on one side, you know, then can you demonstrate it on the other side, right? Okay, so can you
*  do it equally? No, but you do it differently, right, on the other side. So, you know, when I'm
*  teaching, I don't teach left and right. I teach, so if I was teaching you to do a technique,
*  first thing I'd do is say, I need you to take the sleeve and the lapel,
*  all right? So I'd let you decide what was left and right, okay? Because often what happens is,
*  we impart on people whether they're going to be left or right when we start teaching. You know,
*  you get a lot of teachers do that, all right? And they'll say immediately, what do you write
*  with, left or right hand? And it's no indicator actually as to how we do judo because I'm left
*  handed and I do more predominantly right handed because I lead off my strongest hand. And actually
*  most people do, you know, so actually left and right is a bit of a trap sometimes, you know,
*  when we're teaching, better to get, you know, because we can go, so my point was, is that a
*  lot of people can go both flanks, so they'll do something over this side and something over this
*  side. But anyway, was one sided? He was one sided, but he could switch it. So he had a
*  Sienagi as well on the other side. So he could switch it if he had to. Yeah. And by the way,
*  your opponent in 84, was he righty or lefty? He was a righty. So that drop left, say, oh,
*  where did that come from? Well, I mean, again, it was, you know, he could have probably in other
*  contests, he'd hit me with it several times and I just stopped it, you know, and just at the wrong
*  place at the right time for him, right place in the wrong time for me. That's life. Yeah. Yeah.
*  All right. Let's watch from there.
*  This is final of Paris Tournament. And this is against the Korean. The Korean had had a great day,
*  actually. Again, shorter, again, shorter. So he does find that difficult. Telly Rennais,
*  Telly Rennais is trying to catch the sleeve. He's after the sleeve and then the right arm over the
*  top. That's the key point for Telly Rennais. And of course, what he what he has done if he can't
*  always catch the big Oso de Gary over his right hand side, he's been doing something
*  to the opposite side. And the Korean just went for a drop sail.
*  And Telly Rennais blocked with the hips. He's like I say, it's difficult to always against somebody
*  smaller dropping with the sea and aggies. Has Telly Rennais ever been thrown for Ip-Hong?
*  Never been thrown for Ip-Hong, but he was thrown last week for a nice technique and he's being
*  caught more and more. So he's getting close. Yeah. And Tseyev in the final of the World
*  Championships, they had a strange situation there where Tseyev was a technique down and then
*  pulled off a counter and they didn't count it. But then they overruled it. Unfortunately,
*  I was commentating at the time and I went for a score for Tseyev. And anyway, they overruled it
*  and then they awarded a second gold medal to Tseyev. What can you say about Tamerlan Bashaev,
*  who also gave him trouble? Yeah, Bashaev and Tseyev are the two that could possibly go to the
*  Olympics. So that was a close one there from Rennais. That was closest that he'd actually
*  been there. Oh, wow. So didn't have the sleeve and he relies on the sleeve greatly. Big support there
*  in the French, in the crowd. And also maybe can you explain the penalties for stalling? Yeah. So
*  if they don't attack, if they've got a grip and they've got sleeve lapel or they got two hands on,
*  if they're too passive and they don't attack, if they've got dominant sleeve grip, they don't attack.
*  That was quite close as well from the Koreans. So the Korean here, you can see, is having a real go.
*  The penalties will come if they don't attack at the right time. Step outside the yellow area,
*  they'll get penalized as well. That's dedication for- Absolutely. I mean, it was really close,
*  wasn't it? They had nice little Ko Uchi-Gari there from the Korean. And if they touch below
*  the belt line with the arms, so if they're not allowed to grab the legs, they've stopped grabbing
*  the legs. Wow. The Koreans really go after- The Koreans having a real good go at it. I guess
*  every single person in that division is probably training for Teddy Rennais, right? You think
*  Teddy Rennais has been there a long time. He's got another guy here in the final of the Paris
*  tournament. He's got 18,000 people watching him. They're all on Teddy Rennais' side. They want him
*  to win. And the Korean's out there on his own with his coach. But also the pressure that on Teddy
*  Rennais. The amazing pressure. We interviewed him after this and he said, I've got pressure. People
*  go, well, is he going to do it at the Olympic games? Can I do it in Paris? He wanted to go to
*  Paris. I mean, really, the last Olympic games should have been it, shouldn't they? The last
*  should have been the final one. But he's gone, no, I've got to do another four years. Two penalties
*  are on the board already for the Korean. That Korean is really having a great go. He's got a
*  little bit of a lift on him. He's going after it. He's really going after it. It's an amazing
*  effort there from the Korean. And he's getting some last minute information. I don't know if
*  you've ever seen his coach stood next to him like that, but it's amazing. He's six foot six
*  and he's about four foot six. He's a real pitch. Full of passion. I love it. He's like screaming.
*  So golden score. How does golden score work? So the golden score. So if it goes without any
*  point on the board from a throw or a hold down or armlock strangle, then it goes into golden score.
*  So two Shidos on the board apiece, one more mistake now and it's going to be all over.
*  Teddy Renet just manages to turn it on the Korean. And that went really against
*  the run of play, didn't it? Because the Korean did better. But Teddy Renet is a winner.
*  And he says, right, okay, let's have more cheering. Finds a way to score.
*  And I have to say, you know, that even when he loses, you know, he's always graceful.
*  Yeah. He doesn't like it, but he's graceful. Yeah. There was so much love there. Celebration
*  is great. It's great to see. It's great that he's doing it again, going after it, chasing gold
*  medal again. Well, he's chasing the gold medal. It's going to be in Paris, which is going to be
*  even more fantastic. You know, he's already the greatest. You said, you know, what has he
*  got to do to be the greatest? Already the greatest competitor judo's ever known. And that was even,
*  you know, with the great Tani, you know. So Tani was amazing as well. Are you part of the
*  commentating team for Paris? I'm part of the commentating team, but it won't be for IJF
*  because it's independent broadcast. Have you ever had an athlete sort of come up to you and ask,
*  why'd you say that? Or like disagree with your commentary?
*  Do you know, I've got to say that 99%, 99.9% of everybody is so grateful that I've commentated
*  their fights all the way through. They know if they've messed up. So if I say something,
*  and I'm never disparaging, really disparaging, you know, but what I will say is, you know,
*  it was a great throw by the other guy or it was a great match. And if they made a mistake, so if
*  they walk out, they know that I will say something that will, you know, mean something. So then
*  nobody really moans about it. I try and talk the truth if I can. So who else would you consider
*  as some of the greats? So I personally just, because I love the standing Sianagi Koga. So
*  there's like, you know, the number of times you won the world championships and the Olympic games,
*  but there's also like how you won and how you wanted to fight and what you did. You know,
*  it's not necessarily about getting gold medals. It's about how you fought and how you represent
*  the sport. And there's certain athletes like anyway, and Eliadis that are going after the big
*  throws. Only after they didn't want to win by upon, you know, and I think that that is the
*  difference is they're the ones that come out there and it's a bit like, you know, when Tyson
*  stepped out there, you knew what you were going to get, you know, and if they went toe to toe,
*  if Tyson had somebody going toe to toe, somebody was going to get knocked out.
*  And you know, we got the same in judo when people go head to head and it's an open match. And I
*  often talk about an open match. I say, it's an open match. They're both trying to score.
*  Somebody is going to get scored on. Somebody's going to go, you know, and that's that makes it
*  exciting. And it's when they come out and they close up, you know, then that's not an exciting
*  match. Is there a case for, for Ono Shohei Ono three time world champ, two time gold medalist?
*  I think that, you know, judo wise, he's got to be one of the greatest because he had such versatility.
*  He had, he could go right and he could go left. He could pick up. He could go to the ground as
*  well. He won a lot of his earlier matches on the ground. I think his empathy, you know, and how he
*  presents himself sometimes he falls down. And I think that hopefully that should come with
*  tutoring and, you know, how to, how to be a great champion after, you know, it's not just about what
*  you do on the map, but what you do off the mat as well. So to you, a great champion is the whole
*  package of how you present yourself when you lose, how you represent yourself just every half the
*  time. Yeah. I think it's how you present yourself afterwards, how you are with people, how much you
*  can help people. I mean, people, kids, and, you know, they look up to these great champions because
*  they want to be like them. So the worst thing is when you get somebody that's a bit of an ass and
*  they're not presenting themselves in the right way. So I like to see somebody presenting themselves
*  in the right way. And I think that it's something that can be taught. It's something that normally
*  comes with a little bit of experience, a little bit of age, you know, and I like to think that I'm
*  a little bit different now than I was when I was 19. Not that I was bad, you know, I just think I
*  was just, you know, I see it often now, you know, just full of, full of beans. You're, you're a
*  beautiful work in progress. What about Nomura? That I hear in Nomura, that's three time gold medalist.
*  Never lost an Olympic fight. So there's, there's nobody, right? Yeah. No, nobody ever done that.
*  You know what I mean? So that's gotta be, it has to stand. He took two years off in between every
*  Olympic games and came back, did the right amount of events to qualify for. Not only did he,
*  having to qualify, he had to qualify through Japan. Now Japan, remember, have got the greatest depth.
*  So they got people coming through all the time, you know, and they, and then he had to win the
*  Japanese trials. I mean, we had a four time world champion from Japan. This is when world championships
*  was every other year. And this is Shouzo Fuji. And he was the greatest middleweight of all time.
*  And never got to, to participate in the Olympics because he lost the Japanese trials twice
*  in two Olympic, you know, possibilities. So, you know, he had to qualify for Japan and then
*  go to the Olympic games and then do it there, you know. So sometimes some of the best people
*  in Japan can't get outside of Japan. Look at the situation they had with Abe and then they had
*  Maruyama. Maruyama was, you know, and Abe were both the best by far in the under 66 kilos category.
*  This is for the last Olympic games. And they sent one to the world championships,
*  one to the Olympic games and they both won gold medals, you know.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's why the, the All Japan Championships is like legendary.
*  But there's these battles, yeah, with Dimash and all of them.
*  Well, Abe and Maruyama, they, they had a trials in the Kodakan. It was 26 minutes. I think it was
*  26 minutes it went. They were battling it out for 26 minutes. That's great. If we can just
*  go to, you've trained in Japan. What are those randoris like? What's that training like?
*  Like I touched on the danger, that danger of being thrown when you get hold of somebody
*  or somebody gets hold of you. And I often reflect, I often talk about it when I'm commentating,
*  you know, cause I can see immediately, you know, it's easy, isn't it? You know,
*  we're in the commentary chair or if you're in the coaches chair and you don't really understand
*  totally, absolutely what's going on when you're being, somebody's being outgripped
*  and when they're in danger of being thrown. I mean, you know, if you're in danger of being
*  thrown, the first thing you do is stick your backside out and defend, but you know, by not
*  being in the position they, they want you to be in. All right. And so that's danger. You know,
*  you feel the danger. And so in Japan, that was the place I used to go to train because I felt the
*  danger. And so my defenses would be heightened. And so somebody that was, I went two years,
*  one Olympic cycle, I went two years, two months without having a score on me in any competition.
*  And then I went to one competition in the European championships, which I won,
*  and I was struggling all the way through it and got scored on three times in my pool of,
*  you're like my first pool of fights and I was devastated. And actually nearly lost the whole
*  competition because I was more mortified about being scored on three times when I hadn't been
*  scored on for two and a half years. I had this thing in my head about two and a half years,
*  you know, and then all of a sudden, right, I'm not unbeatable. And then you just, you, and you go,
*  and I was almost lost it, completely lost it. Just so fortunate. A couple of things went my way and
*  just came out and I scraped and scratched my way to the final and won the final well. All right.
*  But that was my best match, but I almost lost it. Well, what do you do with the fact that if you go
*  to Japan and you're getting, you're saying danger, like you're probably getting thrown,
*  getting thrown. Yeah. What's that do to your ego? Well, again, it's my, you know, that was a winning
*  ego that had to adapt. I remember we went to the case, Joe, which police dojo one time and
*  they wanted to see the, they created this, the groundwork competition because they wanted to see
*  my, me do the juji, like how I went in and how I, yeah, how the, the armbar, right. They wanted
*  to see how I did it from underneath or over the top. And you just, so they created this event.
*  Yeah. They started it. So, and then winner stays on competition was happening at the case, Joe.
*  So I did about seven, I think it was seven in, and then my coach came in and said, no, it's finished.
*  That's it now. It's finished. You know, suddenly we realized what was going on.
*  And I was going, no, no, no, no, don't stop it like that. You know, and, and it was one of those
*  moments where, you know, the, the boot was on my foot, you could say, you know, rather than the
*  other side, the other way. Cause I had been to Japan in situation. I remember as a 16 year old,
*  I got such, I got such a drumming from one of the Japanese guys, older students,
*  and he had a gold tooth. And so he was gold tooth to me, you know, and he was my nightmare.
*  And I remember kept coming out to fight him because he kept throwing me and, and I was crying and I
*  was upset and I was like, and then that was another occasion where I got dragged away and I,
*  I said, no. And so I wanted to go back and fight him. And I went back to the same dojo every year
*  to fight him. He was on my mind morning, noon, night. He was on my mind. Gold tooth was on my mind,
*  you know, and, and two years later, I was two years to me from 16 to 18 was totally different.
*  18 years of age, I was pretty competitive with him. And it was like, you know, I was standing
*  up with him 19. He was in the groundwork competition. And that's when the switch
*  happened. Switch happened, you know, because I just, well, because I remember getting the arm lock and,
*  and he didn't put it on immediately. I needed it to last. It had to last. Sure. So I, I spread the
*  whole thing lasted as long as I could possibly get it. And it was a long memory. Yeah. As I was
*  looking down at him and now, and now he has nightmares about you. Now I wonder what nickname
*  he has for you. I'm hoping that he remembers me as, as, as, you know, he probably doesn't say it
*  doesn't back an eyelid, doesn't say a thing about it. Well, I mean, can you just speak to that
*  training with those folks? You know, you said crying and then just the frustration of being
*  thrown. Yeah. I mean, what, what, how do you, it's such a beautiful part of the process of becoming
*  great. Yeah. I think, I think it is just something that you're, you know, that doesn't happen at this
*  level. You know, we were talking about levels and then at this level, it never happened. And then I
*  went out in my first European cadet and all of a sudden I wasn't the, the, the top guy. I was in
*  the mix. And then I had to work myself to the top of that mix and then to the top of the next one,
*  you know, cause I went to the European senior championships and you know, again, you're not
*  the top and you know, you've worked your way to the top of that. And I think it is a frustration,
*  you know, but I think it's that kind of hatred of losing and, and also being out of control.
*  I think that the first time, first senior European championships I fought, I fought Nevzorov,
*  but he was only one of my contests. Then I had to fight a Frenchman for third place,
*  but he totally outgripped me. And, and I remember I was more upset. If though I won the contest,
*  I was more upset that he totally out, he did outgrip me and, and I was more upset. And then I
*  fought him a year later and outgripped him. All right. So it was, it was one of those, you know,
*  it was a learning process all the way through. Yeah. That like frustration is like, whatever
*  that does to your, your soul, the building up afterwards is what actually makes you better.
*  It's fascinating. And you think there's in Japan, just killers there. They're like,
*  just the world doesn't know about. They just, just.
*  Yeah. There's world champions in the dojo. You know, there's people that never make it out.
*  Yeah. You know, I remember we were training like so, and everybody that's, that goes to Japan,
*  all my friends, my, that have been world Olympic champions, right? They all know what I'm talking
*  about. They know exactly who I'm, what I'm saying is that when we go to the dojos there, we all get
*  thrown by people that never come out to be world champions. You know, they're, they're just in the
*  mix or they're going through three years of university. And then they go, we, we had a guy,
*  we had a guy that came in, he came, he was business guy, he came in his suitcase and his
*  briefcase like that. He's got a tie up like that. And he's kind of, so he decides he's going to come
*  in and he, he gets changed and he's, he's in his lunch hour. He's in his lunch hour, right? So
*  got to be quick. Yeah. So he comes in and he goes through, he's working his way through the whole
*  of the British team. We're all lined up, right? Yeah. He's just working his way through the whole
*  of the British team. And I knew it was my turn next. So I get hold of him and I throw him
*  immediately. And then it was what we were talking about when it happens in the first few minutes,
*  few seconds of the, the, the practice. So then I had four minutes of him coming at me and
*  I'm going up into the air and I'm twisting off and I'm like that. And then like everybody's
*  laughing at the side of the mat or the whole British team. He's gone through the whole
*  British team and then he, 10 minutes later, he's just tying his tie up like that, you know,
*  back to work. Like, you know, imagine him sitting behind his desk in his computer.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad he didn't get out.
*  Hopefully he listens to this.
*  Hopefully. Anybody else I didn't mention as part of the greats that just kind of jumped in?
*  Keshavazaki Sensei is, is the, the, my favorite of all favorites. He is what I would call a judo
*  genius. I don't know if you can get him up here. Can we get him up? Yeah. So go into 1981 World
*  Championships and, and I'll talk you through the great Keshavazaki. He was one year in Great
*  Britain and he was, he was a guy that was so much a genius. All right. So you want the final of the
*  under 60, 65 kilograms there, the one at the top. This is him. He is two weight categories below
*  my weight category that I won the World Championships same year I won it.
*  So this is, it's not, I'm not sure if this is going to show his final of,
*  watch this. This, this, this he did in the final of the world.
*  For people just listening, he did an incredible sacrifice throw.
*  Yep. And then he was on top for the, for the Newaze and renowned for his groundwork. And he,
*  he was on top of against a really strong Romanian guy. All right. So his transition was just
*  phenomenal. Yeah. Let me, let me go back and look at that. What just happened. So he's just showing
*  you. So he does this a coachy thing, just to create space. And it's his follow through into,
*  into groundwork that is best of all. And then the Romanian really strong, like I say, he'd gone all
*  the way through to the final of the world championships, winning most by upon, I think
*  the Romanian and he's defending really, really well here. And you can see that how persistent
*  he knows exactly what he wants. He's just got to get his leg out. Now watch, he tied the armor
*  and then he'll pull the top leg towards him and then he'll push the bottom one off
*  with both feet, always working, always working, uh, readjust the balance still one leg trapped
*  final of the world championships. Good referee because he's refereeing, uh, something here
*  that's happening, you know, that's going to decide as to whether, so he doesn't call it to stand it
*  up at all. Watch him pull the top one now and he will push the bottom one.
*  There's a calmness on his face. Calm, great to see calm pushes the bottom leg, leg out, job done,
*  all finished. This is him again. Watch this. This is another technique that he does. And then just
*  again, sacrifice directly in directly into the new waza. Transition is everything. Isn't it?
*  In judo. Yeah. You know, it's well, anything really, but judo is especially pays off.
*  Yeah. I mean, because we haven't got that long, I mean, we had more time here. They've just brought
*  more time back. So we've got more time to transition in and, uh, to get the situation that we want and,
*  and to get the attacking situation that we want. Because, you know, I remember I was, um, teaching,
*  uh, in America to, to, uh, some jujitsu guys and they were saying, oh, we'd never give you our back.
*  Mm hmm. And I said, with judo rules, certain situations,
*  it happens that, you know, when we try and do throws where we're facing away from our opponent,
*  you know, so like, for example, C and A, if they fail, then the back is there, you know,
*  and that's how we get the back. And, uh, it's a different situation, you know, than going on your
*  back in the guard situation, totally different. Well, there are Travis Stevens, I don't know how
*  familiar with his judo, but he's a really interesting example because he competed at
*  the highest level in jujitsu as well. And his idea, he's a big Sanagi guy and he basically
*  threw all that away. He in the jujitsu, in the jujitsu, like he took the sport from scratch
*  for what it is. So his, he almost never did a standing Sanagi, Sanagi's at all in jujitsu.
*  No, because it would leave his back all the time, you know, if it failed, you know what I mean?
*  But he wouldn't have the same kind of grip on the judogi or the karate, the jujitsu gi.
*  Yeah. A little bit different. And so you have to kind of consider the sport, the art of it,
*  and also the competitors, the styles and the culture of the sport. If you want to win,
*  if winning is the most important thing, then you're like, all right, well, let's, you know.
*  But you learn the game, don't you? And that's what he did. He learned the game, you know,
*  I think that is credit to him, you know, and that's why I'm saying about wrestling,
*  you know, the wrestlers, I mean, we, you, good to learn the judo and for what it is and the mechanics
*  and how it works and then learn the wrestling. I mean, I do the commentary as well for the freestyle
*  and I will be at the Olympics for the freestyle and the Greco-Roman. So, and I love the freestyle,
*  absolutely love it. But freestyle is freestyle, judo is judo. I like to see people doing judo.
*  Yeah. But there's a, there's a rhyme to the whole combat thing. They're all, I mean, the body
*  mechanics, it's all like fascinating echoes of each other in interesting ways. The details
*  are different, but there's still two humans clashing. Yeah. We've got some amazing crossovers
*  with people like the Mongolians have come in with Georgians. I mean, the Georgians do massive
*  pickups and different techniques. And, you know, if you ask the fighters, whether, you know,
*  grabbing the legs, you know, a lot of them would say some of the wrestling styles, you know, the
*  Georgians and the Mongolians might say, yeah, I'd like to be able to take the legs. But, you know,
*  a lot of them just adapted. You get Iliadis, for example, he just adapted. So he thought,
*  I'll take my arm over the top and I'll just rip them out the floor that way. You know what I mean?
*  They're still doing the big lifts. They're still doing the big ripping, but they just don't grab
*  below the legs. It's weird. They figured it out. And they figured it out like that. Yeah. You would
*  think it'd take a long time. No, it was like a month. Yeah. No, exactly. The highest level,
*  which is crazy. So you mentioned Jiu-Jitsu a little bit. What's, what's the interesting difference
*  between Jiu-Jitsu and Judo that you've observed? Because you're one of the greatest ever on the
*  ground in Judo. And so, you know, Jiu-Jitsu is primarily focused on similar type of stuff on
*  the ground. What do you use an interesting difference there? They're a different approach,
*  different time scale to them, and they have a different way in. So like where ours comes from
*  a standing position directly in, we've got a time scale on it. So we have to like the catch.
*  I always talk about the catch because in Judo terms, if you don't get the catch immediately,
*  then the referee won't see the transition in and also the continuation from plan A, B, C, D,
*  if something builds. So we have to build it. And we have to build it quickly. And I think in Jiu-Jitsu
*  terms, you have more time to build. Yeah, there's a kind of patience like, oh, if this doesn't work
*  out, I can try a different thing. With Judo, there's like an urgency. There's an urgency.
*  And there's a ref watching skeptically. So you better show that you're making progress.
*  You've got to show the progression. And that's why I always had a plan A, B, C. You see there
*  with that was 1981 there with the great Kashiwazaki had a progression. He knew exactly where he had
*  to be. It was feel. That wasn't by accident. It was trained. And I think that that transition there
*  and taking control of somebody's mistakes. So somebody might have made a mistake or not hit
*  properly or your defense has caused them to make a mistake and then you take advantage of it. And
*  that is the difference. So one of the side effects of that, I don't know what the chicken or the egg,
*  but Judo people on the ground are much more aggressive. So probably because of the urgency,
*  but just like there's an intention behind the progress you're making. I think Jiu-Jitsu
*  is more relaxed. There's more a culture of just finding places to relax and think of different
*  control and positions and take your time. And as a result, it's much, much less exhausting.
*  So you can go for much longer. It feels like Judo is exhausting. It's that 10 second blast,
*  isn't it? It's like doing sprints all the time. And that is really hard. And that's a special kind
*  of condition you need. And you need to be able to catch it and know when to go and when not to go.
*  And I think also, I was going to ask you, you think it make a difference? I mean, certain Jiu-Jitsu,
*  you can't just throw yourself on your back into the guard. You have to throw into the situation.
*  So you have got, I mean, I know Roger Gracie, he decided that he was going to learn Judo. He
*  saw the importance of being able to throw for the transition in. And so he came to the Budokai and
*  he was learning off Ray Stevens and they were doing really a lot. Yeah. Well, he's a fascinating
*  study because he does the most basic stuff. And he does it well. Like we did, another level of well,
*  it's like Yamashita. Everyone knows what's coming with Roger Gracie, but he just does it anyway.
*  I guess the best people in the world. It's crazy. He's like everybody in Jiu-Jitsu at White Belt
*  learns the techniques he's using and he just does it. But he has about a thousand ways in.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and the thousand ways are in the details. So it kind of might even look the
*  same to people, but there's, I mean, he finds a way to choke people. So he's on top of them mounted
*  in a sort of Judo pin position. And then, you know, everyone knows what's coming next against the best
*  people in the world. And you should be able to defend it, but nobody can. It's crazy.
*  I think there's the power element as well, you know, that you don't realize how, you know,
*  when somebody's directed in a particular way, then you have that kind of element of, of
*  absolute power. You can only feel like when Roger's doing a technique, I think that you would only
*  feel it if he did it on you, you know, then you can feel it. It's not something that happens,
*  you know, like so tricks is one thing, but actually being able to do something really well
*  from a PowerPoint of you, you know, it's like you say, he only does those few things, but he
*  does them really, really, really well. Yeah. I don't know what that is about.
*  Actually, Judo pins is a very interesting case study as well, because people are able to
*  feel so heavy. One of the things Judo are able to do is pin extremely well. Yeah.
*  And it makes you realize that it's not about the weight. It's about some kind of technique that
*  makes people feel like they weigh a thousand pounds. It's about, it's about weight distribution
*  and change of balance. You know, a lot of people don't realize that there's huge changes of balance
*  on the ground, massive, you know, you know what it's like. I mean, you know, you're a Jiu Jitsu man.
*  And, you know, the detail of the techniques is what really interests me. You know, I mean,
*  I'm always looking small ideas, you know, I'm always looking at the Jiu Jitsu and I just,
*  it fascinates me. You know, I would have done Jiu Jitsu for sure, but I wouldn't have forgotten
*  the Judo way in to the techniques. You know what I mean? I think you've got to differentiate the two,
*  but I would have loved the Jiu Jitsu. I would have absolutely loved it, you know,
*  but it wasn't as prominent then. You know, where the Nihwaza came from, it came from a mistake,
*  me getting beaten in a particular contest and I went, I'm not going to be beaten again on the
*  ground. That's how it happened. Yeah. Well, yeah. The story of your life is like a loss creates
*  the Phoenix Rises. Well, it was 1978 and it wasn't a mistake. It was a particular movement
*  and I was fighting weight up from my normal weight, but I stayed in the same position for one
*  second too long, got caught and- Choked?
*  Sengaku, yeah. Triangle, triangle, triangle. Wow.
*  And I said, I literally, just the same as I said to you when I said, I'm not going to drink anymore,
*  I came off and I said, I'm never going to get caught on the ground again.
*  Yeah, never going to lose on the ground ever again.
*  And I never lost in my whole competitive career again.
*  Wow. But yeah, I shouldn't mention that there's nothing like a pin from a Judo person. I don't
*  actually know if people in Jiu Jitsu have made sense of that, like loaded that in.
*  But it's not part of the game, is it? You know, the pin, it's submission.
*  Yeah, but you know, control is part of the game and nobody controls a human body the way Judo
*  people do on the ground. Like they have understood the science of control and I think that's,
*  control is extremely useful in Jiu Jitsu as well. It's just that people don't,
*  because there's so many other domains of exploration, but the-
*  It's interesting. I mean, it's just, and especially when you
*  applied Jiu Jitsu to the fighting setting, so mixed martial arts, that control, that side control,
*  that pin control is really, really, really important. So, but then you add punching to
*  the thing and it becomes- That puts a whole different thing on it, doesn't it?
*  I mean, there's an alternate history where you would have been part of the early UFCs
*  if time was a little different, you know, maybe a few years later. Because your style of Judo,
*  Jiu Jitsu and the transitions and the aggression and all of that would have worked really well in
*  the early UFCs. I'm sure I was being set up at one stage by one of the graces. And that was when
*  he was winning all the matches, but he came in with a couple of the cousins to one of my seminars.
*  And he was one of the first ones, wasn't he? That's how I love to see the
*  UFC because it was different martial arts, different skills. And, you know, I mean,
*  he'd get close and he'd just choke them out or armlock them or, you know, arm bar them. And that
*  was brilliant. You know, that was, for me, that was a revelation. That was how I saw it.
*  Yeah. It's a fascinating science experiment, which aspects of different martial arts work well and
*  not when they clash together. And it did turn out that Nwaza worked well.
*  Was the key. Yeah. It was the key, wasn't it? Yeah. It was a big missing link in our conception
*  of fighting. It's the neutralizer of size and a lot of other components. And it just blew people's
*  mind. Like, oh, okay. It's not just about size. It's not just about big guys swinging hands. It's
*  a lot of other components. And the groundwork is really, really important. And of course,
*  there's a few judoka that succeeded in the UFC since then, which is always interesting how they
*  adapt. You know, when you take off the gi, how can you still throw people? How can you still do
*  control? How can you still take advantage of the transition on the ground? Ronda Rousey is a good
*  example of somebody that took advantage of that. Yeah. I think one of the biggest things for the
*  judoka is we've never, you know, there's no strikes. And I think that's the biggest
*  shock, if you wish. You know, when you get punched in the face and you're not used to that,
*  you know, that's not what we're used to. Some people are able to get punched in the
*  face better than others. Yeah, for sure. Then again, there's Ronda Rousey who doesn't need to
*  get punched in the face. She just gets in close, throws a person armbar right there. Yeah. And
*  Kayla. You know, Kayla's a good one as well. Kayla Harrison, that's another incredible person.
*  She could have probably been just winning Olympic gold medal after Olympic gold medal, but chose to...
*  Whatever, you know, she decides. I mean, Ronda as well, you know, whatever they decided to do,
*  they're great athletes. They hate losing. I don't know anybody that hates losing more than those two.
*  They don't like it. And Kayla Harrison, like, I don't know anybody that works as hard as her.
*  That's a crazy, crazy, crazy work ethic. Well, let me ask you about training. Again, Jimmy Pedro
*  said he learned a lot from you. He learned how to do a Taiyotoshin, the armbar jiu-jitsu kataami,
*  but he also learned from you training methodology. So what's he talking about? He told me about this.
*  What's your approach to training throughout your career and as it developed?
*  I always wanted to train harder than anybody else. I still train now every day. If I don't train,
*  do something, I do an hour of my physical work and I still go on the mat a little bit. You know,
*  I'm 65 now. So I'm not doing really heavy stuff on the mat, but I still like to train. And when
*  I was 21, 20, up to 30, I was one of the best trainers. But, you know, Jimmy Pedro was one of
*  the best trainers as well. He was one of the, he's one of your dream athletes. You know,
*  when Jimmy Pedro stepped through your door, and he was just a kid, you know, he was like,
*  he was just young when he stepped through my door. And I had a lot of full-time trainers. So I had
*  up to 20 really good athletes that were training hard and I only wanted hard trainers, giving me
*  10 that trained hard rather than your one prima donna that, you know, you're skillful,
*  one that, you know, could do any. I just, I wanted 10, you know, or 20 really hard trainers
*  because you can do so much with them. You can make champions, you can make them world champions.
*  You know, if you've got somebody that was a special talent and they wanted to work hard,
*  then you had a special athlete.
*  When you say hard trainers, what do you mean? Are these people that just, like,
*  every single day are able to just grind it out, do randori, do the training, do the boring things,
*  just keep coming back?
*  Yeah, when they're going, it gets tough, you know, and I think that was him. He had a special
*  mentality. And, you know, and the thing is, you see, when you've got him in your dojo,
*  all right, even when you're tired, when somebody's tired and when, you know,
*  what an example to the others. So he'd pull the other ones in as well, you know, so I,
*  so I had somebody that when everybody was tired and everybody was sick of it and everybody
*  just wanted to, you know, and he'd still be there, you know, so they had to do it.
*  So that was for me a win-win, you know, so he, I had all the Americans actually, I had Bobby
*  Berland and I had Michael Swain and I had Ed Liddy and I had them all coming to visit me
*  at different times. Jimmy was there, you know, they wanted to be the best. In the end, we had
*  such a great club atmosphere, they wanted to come for the hard work. And they knew that if they came,
*  they were going to be dragged out and we were going to do physical training and it was physical
*  training like they hadn't done before. But it wasn't just physical training, it was the judo
*  and the skill side of it as well. And so I always had a great empathy with the US
*  team, Olympic team. So a lot of your Olympic medalists have been through with me, you know,
*  and so I'm proud of that because we had, you know, some great times and they're still great
*  mates now. And so in New York, in a couple of weeks time, I'm going to have everybody,
*  he's going to be there. They're all coming in. All old friends, all old friends, new friends.
*  So what's the tough week look like at your peak, physical training, Randori,
*  is there days off? Are you training like twice a day?
*  Twice a day. So we do the preparation training, we do the running, we do the weight training,
*  we do the skills in the morning as well. The skills is, for me, one of the biggest advantages
*  that any full-time trainers can have. Because what happens is that with most clubs, you're trying to
*  fit everything into that hour and a half or two hours. You know, you fit your skills, you fit your
*  physical training and your sparring and you know, everything's in there, all grouped in.
*  So the biggest advantages of having a full-time group is that you can split your skills and your
*  skills lay your foundation. So the biggest advantage is being able to work specifically on
*  things without having to worry about getting to do your, you know, your Randori or your sparring or
*  then you got to go out for, you just do the skills. Well, when you talk about skills, like what is,
*  say your specialty is a taiyotoshi, what, are we talking about Uchikomi doing a bunch of
*  things? Are you working with bands? Are you doing throws? Are you actually just having
*  conversations about like specific, like tiny details of throws? Like what, what does skills mean?
*  All those things about doing your repetition practice, making sure the repetition's correct,
*  you know, there's good repetition. So when we say good repetition, does it,
*  Uchikomi, when you're just fitting the throw versus doing the throw, where do you land on the value?
*  And getting it moving, you know, so one of the biggest, most important things is getting it
*  moving. If we do something static, again, it's that static target, you need to get it moving.
*  So you need to do a repetition and also you need to do a correct repetition because if you're doing
*  a hundred repetitions that are not correct and repetitions under pressure, too much pressure
*  without somebody overseeing those skills to make sure that you correct the skills.
*  Because if you're doing a skill, if you're doing it 99 times incorrectly, all right, then repetition
*  doesn't make perfect, repetition makes permanent. So you got to make it as perfect as you possibly
*  can. So actually that skills group there is the most important thing. And what I used to do is
*  oversee it. So I'd oversee it to make sure that it was done properly. So you're watching the footwork,
*  you're watching the gripping and just constantly adjusting.
*  I'll give you an example. Jimmy Pedro, Jimmy was one of the hardest when he was 19 years of age,
*  right? So he was always asking me to practice, always. So he's always on me all the time. So I
*  do groundwork with him and could I put him on his back? No. I was all on him and he'll tell you,
*  but he just wouldn't go. He was just going to be great without a doubt. All right.
*  So I wanted everybody on with him. Everybody. So everybody went on with him and so they only
*  improved their game and it improved him. And then with small technical things that have stayed with
*  him that we were doing with the Jujigatami that was passed on to Kayla and then gone on to Rhonda.
*  And it's all small things that I can see sometimes that, you know, it's passed on.
*  What about the Taitoshi? He said he learned a lot from you from that.
*  Yeah, and he does it differently.
*  And so I should mention that's one of the trickier, I mean, I still don't understand.
*  It is a tricky throw.
*  I don't understand. So for people who don't know it, boy, how would you even explain it? It doesn't
*  make any sense. It's when you just look solo, the movement you make is quite simple. But how you get
*  person to be off balance, how you actually get them to be thrown. And when you do throw it
*  successfully, it looks like a whipping motion that's effortless. It makes no sense.
*  It makes no sense. Other than it's every technique starts with the hands. So it's what we call
*  Kazushi and you're pulling somebody off balance, getting them moving, pulling them off balance.
*  Taitoshi means body drop. So it's basically two legs across your partner's body. I've got my back
*  to you. All right. And I've already pulled you off balance with my hands. And then I'm going to just
*  flex my legs up just as you're coming onto my back. And then you're going to go over. If I
*  coordinated all right, if it doesn't get coordinated right, then you're going to come
*  right on my back and try to rip my arm off. So yeah, I've got to get it right.
*  What was the, if you can convert it to words, some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it
*  off at the highest levels, the Taitoshi? The hands start every technique. So getting
*  the repetition right, first of all. So you need to get the repetition right, you need a good partner.
*  So actually training your partner to react in the right way is just as important as learning the
*  throw. So actually what happens is, you know, we could get a lesson of beginners. We teach
*  the throw and then go right off you go. And 90% of them will get it wrong because their partner's
*  not reacting in the right way. So half of it is to get the person to react as they should. So if I
*  was doing it with you, you and I, first thing I'd teach you to do is to react the way I want you to
*  react. And then I'd react the way that you want me to react. All right. So then we'd have success
*  with it rather than you leaning back in the wrong way or resisting or frightened you going over.
*  So, you know, so actually that's why nine times out of 10 people get the technique wrong.
*  It's actually fascinating to me because in the United States where I came up,
*  Judo, I mean, the level of Judo is not comparable to the level of Judo in the rest of the world.
*  Of course, the Pedro Center is an exception to that. Certain athletes, yeah. Certain athletes,
*  like when I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, it's like even like the 16 year old kids are just
*  all deadly. So it was terrifying. But, you know, I remember the Russian national team
*  came through Philadelphia. And one of the things that really impressed me is just how much easier
*  Judo was training Judo with them. They moved correctly. As like Uke said, as the people
*  getting thrown, every aspect of their body movement was correct in terms of it felt right to be
*  throwing them, to be training with them, everything about the gripping, about the position of their
*  hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun. It was easy. And like, and I always felt like I was
*  learning. So I think all of that is loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you're developing
*  through the throws, you're developing the right technique. Yeah. You have to develop between,
*  you know, I always had training partners that I trained with up to each Olympic Games. And
*  we worked together for the, we did the skills together. And then we, you know, we worked
*  together in order to make techniques work. And we got it moving as quickly as we could. And one of
*  the worst things that I see is, and I see a lot of YouTube stuff with coaches. Here we go.
*  Don't even start me on that. Don't even start me on that. But you know,
*  you're laughing because you know what I'm talking about.
*  I'm actually laughing because I'm enjoying you talking trash. But you're talking about technique.
*  Yeah. Just, well, you know, the coaches and their clipboard guys, you know, with the clipboards and
*  the stopwatches and, you know, they got these kids running up and down the mat and then doing
*  Uchikomi of something that's technically incorrect, you know, 10 times and then running up and doing
*  another 10 at the other side, you know, and actually mixing everything together. And it's
*  just a mess. Just technical mess. That said, some of it is conditioning type stuff that you were
*  doing. So what is like the hardest type of physical conditioning you're doing?
*  Probably ran too much, you know, when I was a kid, if I could go back now, I wouldn't run
*  as much. And I ran hard and I ran strong. And I remember doing the London Marathon one time. And
*  I said, I'm never going to do it again. I never, but I ran, you know, and I was trying to,
*  the problem was when I did the London Marathon is I was trying to beat three hours.
*  That desire to win again.
*  It's totally insane. You know, it was insane. And I went out through half marathon in what I thought
*  was a good time. Anyway, I got to 16, 17 miles and totally blue.
*  I see you went out too fast.
*  Yeah, I went out too fast.
*  And then you just...
*  I died. Absolutely. I died. I got in, I crossed the line. I remember seeing this bridge over there,
*  right? And the bridge was the finishing line over the bridge. And I had to get there. It was the
*  longest bridge I've ever, ever walked over. And like walk, run. So I got over the bridge and I took
*  one step over the line like that. And there was a guy over there and he was trying to rush everybody
*  through, you know, and he was going, come on, come on, come on. It was people behind you.
*  Get your hands off me. I said, you get your hands off me now. Like that, because we're going to fall
*  out, you know, and I couldn't move. I couldn't move. I was white.
*  And it was amazing that you made it to the finish line though.
*  I did. I got over there and, you know, yeah, Donald Duck passing me was a tell.
*  Oh, there's a person dressed as Donald Duck?
*  Donald Duck, yeah. But the thing was I still crossed over,
*  338. I crossed over 338, but I lost 38 minutes in the last four miles.
*  So that bridge, longest bridge ever.
*  The longest bridge.
*  So you regret the running?
*  So anyway, I would do the running a little bit differently, but we ran, we ran hard.
*  We did the weight training. We did good weight training. It was all conditioned.
*  So, I mean, it was never the same training all the time. So it was always,
*  we have certain phases building up. It was scientifically done. It wasn't just out there,
*  run, weight training, judo, same judo all the time. It was always pretty scientific.
*  Good variety.
*  It was a good variety and it had build up and it had a speed phase and it had a power phase and it
*  had, you know, like a base condition.
*  What about the randori? Was there a method to the madness there?
*  Yeah.
*  How much randori did you do?
*  A lot. So the most important thing for me, I mean, I see now that there's a lot of people out there
*  that are not getting enough randori. They're not randoring enough. And there's a lot of
*  sports science people and they're running and they're weight training and they're doing it all
*  to death and there's not enough judo. And the only ones, you know, like you have a look at some of
*  the Eastern block countries that are getting together. They're having these mass camps
*  and the Japanese, they have, you know, just massive people that they can do there. They're doing
*  probably 50, 60 randoris a week.
*  Wait, what?
*  50 or 60 a week.
*  Wow.
*  The average person is getting together. I mean, when I was doing randoris,
*  when I went to Japan, it was just purely for 60 randoris a week.
*  How much is each one? How long is it?
*  So they were five minutes then, they're four minutes now, but-
*  That's a lot, especially given the level of the competition there.
*  Well, you can do it in Japan because it's fairly light. If they throw you, they throw you,
*  you throw them.
*  There's like a level of like you're moving at like a close to 100%, but the actual power
*  and the force is not quite there.
*  Different in Korea. Korea was harder. It was more physical. So you couldn't do 50 randoris
*  in Korea. You'd die. Yeah. So you'd do 30.
*  But you need the randoris. And so I chased the randoris. So I chased them into training camps.
*  I traced them all over my country. So I was getting 40 to 50 a week in my club. And then
*  I would go to training camps and add more. And I honestly don't think that they do enough now.
*  A lot of countries.
*  Somebody who doesn't know randoris live training. So-
*  Yeah, sparring.
*  Was there a few people you remember that were just like really tough to go against?
*  You mentioned Gold Tooth.
*  Gold Tooth was pretty horrific.
*  Yeah. Oh, you got him in the end.
*  I got him in the end. And yeah.
*  I suppose I should say not just tough, but just good training partners that you like.
*  Great training partners. I remember Nishida. And Nishida was, I mentioned him earlier,
*  said he was one of the best. I mean, he was just such a great technician. So I would go there to
*  his dojo and he'd ask me to practice. And he'd always, he'd finish the practice and you know
*  that he would always say, another one, we'll do another one, right? So you'd go, oh yeah.
*  Because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered that you had to do another one.
*  So you do another one back to back. And then he goes sometimes, let's do another one. So he'd end
*  up doing 15 minutes with the same guy who could possibly throw you at any time. And that was hard.
*  So, but I remember those particular guys and there were plenty of those.
*  What do you do with the exhaustion that you're feeling in those? Like how deep did you go?
*  In terms of like- You have to dig deep. And I think that
*  was the great thing about having certain, like European training camps were more physical.
*  So I remember that we would have European training camps where you'd fight Germans and
*  then the Dutch and then the French and then the Russian or the, you'd have all sorts of different
*  styles and people there to fight. And that was something then you'd have to dig in at a different
*  place, come out of there. Where do you go mentally when you,
*  how many times have you gone there? Or like you're really in deep waters exhaustion wise
*  in competition actually. Competition it's happened. You know, so sometimes you go past
*  where your forearms are absolutely blown. I remember the final of Czech
*  tournament that we had and I fought a Frenchman in the final and my forearms were so blown,
*  I couldn't shake his hand. You know, and then I remember they were solid, absolutely solid
*  and they had lactic acid in them. And I remember I stood on the rostrum and they were giving me
*  things and I couldn't grip them properly. So I was saying, put it under my armpit or, you know,
*  chin like that. Trying to hold it, I couldn't hold anything, you know. And so there are times
*  when I really had to go really deep. I remember fighting two East Germans the same day, one of
*  the competitions and the number one and the number two East Germans. And that was another day where
*  I had to really dig deep. That's the fascinating thing about some of these tournaments is if you
*  get, if you go full distance and several matches in a row, the way you're seeing in the finals
*  are two people that have like fought a lot that day. Yeah. And we have golden score now,
*  you know, so we see a lot of guys, you know, that going into golden score and they've done
*  one contest for four minutes and then they go another four minutes and then, you know,
*  we've had some go into a third four minutes. That is all back to back. It might be in the first round,
*  it might be in the final, you know, and we've got some now that are coming out and you can see the
*  stats and the ones that winning golden score. So we got Japanese Hashimoto. He's the Japanese
*  representative now instead of Ono because Ono's finished. So Hashimoto's coming out. He was in a
*  tournament last week and he went to look up. Yeah. Just have a look at him. So Hashimoto's in white
*  here. All right. And, uh, great example there. Well, I'm glad we got onto that, you know, so I
*  mean, he has got great technique. Hashimoto. Effortless. There's the Taiyotoshi. All right.
*  So you can see exactly what we're talking about that great, um, timing. And again, you know,
*  sometimes he backs them up to the edge and then he'll wait for them to come back in
*  towards. They don't want to step out to get a penalty. I guess that's a cross grip Taiyotoshi.
*  Did I see that wrong? Yeah. Cross grip, different grips. Oh, great examples there. Just, just what
*  we were talking about. Making it look so easy. Wow. So he's going to be their representative, uh, at
*  73 kilograms. Look at him, back him up again. And again, just catching him as, as he pushes back.
*  Push, push, push. And then. Yep. Action reaction at his best there. And a slight change of direction.
*  He sometimes goes down onto his knee there, which is see a Toshi. It turns from Taiyotoshi,
*  which is springing up to see a Toshi that's going down. Oh, the, the title of the video is, uh,
*  his title is a work of art. Yeah. This is, uh, him at his best showing him, uh, doing what he does
*  best. But he had to go three times into golden score last week and dig deep and lost one of them,
*  I think. But you're still going at it. You're talking about all those training sessions. I, uh,
*  Nikki, your wonderful wife told me that you were looking, you were going all over, like from target
*  to target, looking for workout clothes because your luggage got lost because you had to get a workout.
*  And yeah, I just, I, you know what? I just, I, I realized that if I'm a miserable get right, then
*  she'll get me to get me into the gym, you know, say, and the thing is that I'm better if I get
*  in there for an hour and I just do something at least 30, 35 to 40 minutes cardio. And then I do
*  some weights and, uh, more high repetitions. It's not so much heavy weights now, but more functional.
*  I mean, you travel all over the world for, for, for, for the commentary of these competitions.
*  So you're, is it, is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how? Well, you know, we're during COVID,
*  then they closed all the gyms, but we were still going out. We were some, one of the first ones out.
*  They have the judo was some of the first out, the competitions were behind closed doors.
*  So we were in the hotel, the gym was closed, so we couldn't use the gyms. Uh, so we had to look
*  for other ways that we could work out. So, uh, most of the, uh, hotels that we were in were high rise
*  hotels. So we were in the steps. We were doing the steps or right the way up, you know, so I started
*  it and, uh, and so I started off with me going up and then one or two of the others and the referees
*  started to go up with me. And so in the end, we'd have this trail of people going up the steps and
*  down and every place we went to, we had the steps. So, um, yeah, that was an interesting
*  situation. So we were sick of steps in the end. Uh, what advice would you give to, um,
*  beginners, people starting out in judo, how to, um, how to develop their game,
*  how to find the beauty in, in the sport and the art of judo?
*  If you put 10 people in a room and said, right, get on with it. Yeah. You'd have mayhem, right?
*  Right. And I think that wherever, whatever sport you're doing, you need good instruction,
*  good teaching and a good club atmosphere, you know, some, somewhere that's not so intense
*  that, uh, winning is the, the, the only thing. And I think that if you look at 90% of the people
*  that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure. So they want to get pleasure. So you,
*  you need a club that's got a bit of a mixture. You know, they've got a, uh, a direction to go
*  into competition if they want. And, uh, and then the rest it's for fun and to enjoy it, but
*  with really good instruction, because with really good instruction and a good foundation and a good
*  base, you get more enjoyment because you're more, you know, you, you, you have more success.
*  And let's be honest, you know, the more success we have with something, the more we like it.
*  Yeah. And great technique is a way to really discover the beauty of the art.
*  And so great teaching is really important there. Great teaching is so important. What about,
*  what does it take to get from the early days when you started judo to, to world-class level?
*  I think that with most, I mean, you do hear, don't you? You know, if somebody's been doing judo for
*  eight years and then they're in, and I think it happened, um, one of the French,
*  Chameo, she went to the Olympic games in 2012 and she'd been doing judo for eight years,
*  but then she started to lose, you know, so she had a relative success early on.
*  The Olympics was one of them. She got a silver medal, but then she went off the boil and then
*  she came back and now she's been there for, she's still competing and she's been there for well over
*  13 years at the very top. So I think that, you know, any foundation, it's like anything. If,
*  if you lay a really solid foundation, generally it lasts longer.
*  Yeah. Well, that, that foundation again, is that technique or is there, um,
*  what does it take to build that foundation? I think technique, you get away with murder,
*  you know, you know, you, you, you, with technique, you can get away with, you know,
*  having bad condition, you know, but I mean, you get found out in the end, but, um, you can,
*  you know, you can go out and you can win certain things by doing really nice technique.
*  But I think if you've got the mixture, if you've got the whole package, then you can,
*  you know, go the whole way. So for people who somehow don't know, you've commentated
*  some of the greatest judo matches ever. You've done grand prize. You've done all these events,
*  Olympics, championship, everything. So what, what, uh, just looking at the history of judo,
*  what like stands out to you? What events stand out to you? What are some good memories that popped
*  your head? I think, you know, some of the Paris tournaments are amazing because the crowd, they're
*  there, you know, they're on the mat there. They're all judoka. They all, they're well educated to the
*  sport. Every time somebody twitches, you know, they're, they're very biased towards their own,
*  which is kind of you expect, but you know, sometimes I haven't been able to hear myself
*  speak and that's very unusual. You know, you've got the headphones on and you're blocked out,
*  you know, like sometimes Teddy Rene has been walking out there and the crowd are going crazy
*  and they're, and they're on the feet, you know, when somebody twitches and, you know, and,
*  and then you get this, they're the crowd silences. We had one of those last week,
*  you know, everybody's cheering their man and then bang, their man goes over, you know,
*  silence, silence, nothing like that. And of course we were, we were commentating. We would go,
*  that was a bit of a crowd silencer, you know, but yeah, that happens. Yeah. That is the surprising
*  thing that at least it was to me that Paris and France is really big on judo. Massive, you know,
*  and, and there's always surprises, you know, the, it's like Paris is great in Japan for the Olympic
*  Games. The biggest surprise was Ohno getting beaten in the team event. Now Ohno is the greatest
*  judo man, pound for pound, probably one of the best, and he won the Olympic title. And then they
*  went into the team event against France and Ohno lost to a, he's not run of the mill German, but
*  the German, you know, he wasn't certainly Olympic title-isc and beat Ohno. Yeah. Well, the team
*  stuff is fascinating. It changes the dynamics of the whole thing. And it's, I mean, it's funny you
*  say Paris, it really makes it really big deal that this Olympics is being held in Paris.
*  They'll be the team to beat, French team, because they have the best balance of the weight categories.
*  They have the best balance with their people that are world and Olympic champions
*  and qualified men and women. So three, three men, three women, they have the best balance out of
*  anybody. And an educated audience, educated audience, home grounds. It's going to be
*  awesome. It's going to be super fun. It will be super fun. You're nervous. Yeah. All right.
*  Do you get nervous? I get nervous. I get nervous. I get really nervous right now. But you know,
*  given, especially because it's the Olympics and you don't want to,
*  you want to celebrate people properly, right? And it's like, it's everything for them. Yeah.
*  And a lot of people, especially like the finals matches, you know, it'll be watched, you know,
*  millions of times, the highest of stakes, all of this. Played over and over. Yeah. And I find that,
*  you know, with mine, I'm now a little bit more careful, you know, with like, so I'll celebrate
*  a massive throw and then have empathy to the one that's been thrown, you know, because
*  it's not the best feeling in the world, especially in Olympic finals. Yeah. Can you imagine that?
*  Yeah. Must be terrible. Must be terrible. Yeah. Just reflecting. So, no, I have a bit of empathy
*  there and I just, I try and say the right things because they always do come up to me and say,
*  you commentated my fights. Yeah. You're the voice of the biggest triumphs and the biggest tragedies
*  for these athletes, for the world that watches and admires these athletes. No pressure. You're
*  the voice. Don't screw it up. Yeah. Don't screw it up. Your voice is in my head when I watch these,
*  you know, it's fascinating. It's fascinating, but you're a master of it. It's a huge honor
*  that you would talk with me. Thank you for everything you've done for the sport of judo,
*  for the Olympics, for just sports in general, just celebrating greatness in all of its forms.
*  Thank you for talking today. Keep going. I can't wait to listen to you in Paris. Thank you for
*  having me. And it's just been an honor to be here with you. Thanks for listening to this
*  conversation with Neil Adams. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the
