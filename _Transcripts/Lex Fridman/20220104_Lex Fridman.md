# Jay Bhattacharya: The Case Against Lockdowns | Lex Fridman Podcast #254
**Lex Fridman:** [January 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIOGUYOPAsA)
*  The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattacharya, professor of medicine,
*  health policy, and economics at Stanford University.
*  Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns and the blinding, destructive effects of arrogance
*  on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.
*  Jay Bhattacharya is the co-author of the now-famous Great Barrington Declaration,
*  a one-page document that in October 2020 made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.
*  Most of this podcast conversation is about the ideas related to this document.
*  And so, let me say a few things here about what troubles me.
*  Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy often ignore the quiet suffering of millions,
*  that it results in, which includes economic pain, loss of jobs, that give meaning and pride in the
*  face of uncertainty, the increase in suicide and suicidal ideation, and, in general, the fear and
*  anger that arises from the powerlessness forced onto the populace by the self-proclaimed elites
*  and experts. Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns talk down to the masses about
*  which path forward is right and which is wrong. What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy
*  among the policymakers for the common man and, in general, for people unlike themselves.
*  The landscape of suffering is vast and must be fully considered in calculating the response to
*  the pandemic with humility and with rigorous, open-minded scientific debate. Jay and I talk
*  about the email from Francis Collins to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two co-authors,
*  fringe epidemiologists, and also called for a devastating published take down of their ideas.
*  These words from Francis broke my heart. I understand them. I can even steel man them.
*  But, nevertheless, on balance, they show to me a failure of leadership. Leadership in a pandemic
*  is hard, which is why great leaders are remembered by history. They are rare. They stand out.
*  And they give me hope. Also, this whole mess inspires me on my small individual level to do
*  the right thing in the face of conformity despite the long odds. I talked to Francis Collins. I
*  talked to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO. I also talked and will continue to talk with people like Jay
*  and other dissenting voices that challenge the mainstream narratives and those in the seats of
*  power. I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses in their ideas with respect and empathy,
*  but also with guts and skill. The skill part I hope to improve on over time. And I do believe
*  that conversation and an open mind is the way out of this. And finally, as I've said in the past,
*  I value love and integrity far, far above money, fame and power. Those latter three
*  are all ephemeral. They slip through the fingers of anyone who tries to hold on
*  and leave behind an empty shell of a human being. I prefer to die a man who lived by principles that
*  nobody could shake and a man who added a bit of love to the world. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now here's my conversation
*  with Jay Barakaria. To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID? Do we have a good measure
*  for this very question? So the best evidence for COVID, the deadliness of COVID comes from a whole
*  series of seroprevalence studies. Seroprevalence studies are these studies of antibody prevalence
*  in the population at large. I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies, one in
*  Santa Clara County, one in LA County, and one with Major League Baseball around the US.
*  If I may just pause you for a second, if people don't know what serology is in seroprevalence,
*  it does sound like you say zero prevalence. It's not. It's sero and serology is antibodies. So it's
*  a survey that counts the number of antibodies. Specific to COVID.
*  People that have antibodies specific to COVID, which perhaps shows an indication that they
*  likely have had COVID and therefore this is a way to study how many people in the population have
*  been exposed to or have had COVID. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So the idea is that
*  we don't know exactly the number of people with COVID just by counting the people that present
*  themselves with symptoms of COVID. COVID has, it turns out, a very wide range of symptoms
*  possible ranging from no symptoms at all to this deadly viral pneumonia that's killed so many people.
*  The problem is if you just count the number of cases, the people who have very few symptoms
*  often don't show up for testing. They're outside of the ken of public health.
*  It's really hard to know the answer to your question without understanding how many people
*  are infected because you can probably tell the number of deaths even though there's some
*  controversy over that. The numerator is possible, but the denominator is much harder.
*  How much controversy is there about the death? We're going to go on a million tangents.
*  I have a million questions. One, I love data so much, but I'm almost tuned out paying attention
*  to COVID data because I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground. I don't know who to trust.
*  Maybe you can comment on different sources of data, different kinds of data. The death one,
*  that seems like a really important one. Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,
*  or is it just a giant messy thing that mixed up? Then there's this kind of stories about hospitals
*  being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.
*  There's some truth in some of that. Let me just talk about the incentive. In the United States,
*  we passed this CARES Act that was aimed at making sure hospital systems didn't go bankrupt
*  in the early days of the pandemic. A couple of things they did, one was they provided incentives
*  to treat COVID patients, tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient. The other thing
*  they did is they gave a 20% bump to Medicare payments for elderly patients who are treated
*  with COVID. The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them at the early days.
*  That did provide an incentive to have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital because your
*  financial success in the hospital or at least lack of financial ruin depended on having many
*  COVID patients. The other thing on the death certificates is that reporting of deaths is a
*  separate issue. I don't know that there's a financial incentive there, but there is this
*  complicated, when you fill out a death certificate for a patient with a lot of conditions,
*  let's say a patient has diabetes, a patient that, while that diabetes could lead to
*  heart failure, you have a heart attack, heart failure, your lungs fill up, then you get COVID
*  and you die. What do you write on the death certificate? Was it COVID that killed you?
*  Was it the lungs filling up? Was it the heart failure? Was it the diabetes? It's really
*  difficult to disentangle. I think a lot of times when we're talking about the death certificate,
*  I think a lot of times what's happened is people have erred on the side of signing it as COVID.
*  Now, what's the evidence of this? There's been a couple of audits of death certificates in places
*  like Santa Clara County where I live, in Alameda County, California, where they carefully went
*  through the death certificates and said, okay, is this reasonable to say this was actually COVID
*  or was COVID incidental? They found that about 20%, 25% of the deaths were more likely incidental
*  than directly due to COVID. I personally don't get too excited about this. I mean,
*  it's a philosophical question, right? Ultimately, what kills you? Which is an odd thing to say if
*  you're not in medicine, but really it's almost always multifactorial. It's not always just the
*  bus hits you. The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed. Was the brain bleed that killed you? Would
*  it have burst anyway? I mean, the bus hits you, killed you, right? The way you die is a philosophical
*  question, but it's also a sociological and psychological question because it seems like
*  every single person who has passed away over the past couple of years,
*  the first question that comes to mind was COVID. Not just because you're trying to be political,
*  but just in your mind. No, I think there's a psychological reason for this, right? So,
*  we spent the better part of at least a half century in the United States not worried too much
*  about infectious diseases. The notion was we'd essentially conquered them. It was something that
*  happens in faraway places to other people. And that's true for much of the developed world.
*  Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades. And for the first time in living memory,
*  we have a disease that can kill us. I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that,
*  like the panic centers of our brain, the lizard part of our brain takes over.
*  And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk. And so, it's not surprising that people,
*  when they're filling out death certificates or thinking about what led to the death,
*  this most salient thing that's in the front of everyone's brain would jump to the top.
*  And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing when we consider
*  what people say on the internet, what people say to each other, what people write in scientific
*  papers, what everything. It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,
*  everything changed in the way people feel about each other, just the way they communicate with
*  each other. I think the level of emotion evolved. I think in many people, it brought out the worst
*  in them. For sometimes short periods of time, and sometimes it was always therapeutic,
*  like you were waiting to get out the darkest parts of you, just to say,
*  if you're angry at something in this world, I'm going to say it now. And I think that's probably
*  talking to some deep primal thing that fear we have for formalities of all different kinds. And
*  when that fear is aroused and all the deepest emotions, it's like a Freudian
*  psychotherapy session, but across the world. It's something that psychologists are going to
*  have a field day with for a generation, trying to understand. I think what you say is right,
*  but piled on top of that is also this impetus to empathy, to empathize, compassion toward others,
*  essentially militarized. So I'm protecting you by some actions. And those actions,
*  if you don't do them, well, that must mean you hate me. It's created this social tension
*  that I've never seen before. We looked at each other as if we were just simply sources of germs,
*  rather than people to get to know, people to enjoy, people to get to learn from.
*  It colored basically almost every human interaction for every human on the planet.
*  Yeah, the basic common humanity. It's like you can wear a mask, you can stand far away,
*  but the love you have for each other when you look into each other's eyes,
*  that was dissipating by region too. I've experienced having traveled quite a bit
*  throughout this time. It was really sad, even people that are really close together,
*  just the way they stood, the way they looked at each other. And it made me feel for a moment
*  that the fabric that connects all of us is more fragile than I thought.
*  If you walk down the street or if you did this during COVID, I'm sure you had this experience
*  where you walk down the street, if you're not wearing a mask, or even if you are,
*  people will jump off the sidewalk that you walk past them as if you're poison.
*  Even though the data are that COVID spreads indifferently outdoors, if at all really outdoors,
*  but it's not simply a biological or infectious disease phenomenon or epidemiological phenomenon.
*  It is a change in the way humans treated each other. I hope temporary.
*  I do want to say on the flip side of that, so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts when the
*  pandemic broke out. I think that's where I was. Yeah. And then I came here to Austin, Texas to
*  visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan. And he was the first person without pause. This wasn't a
*  political statement. This was anything. Just walked toward me, gave me a big hug and say,
*  it's great to see you. And I can't tell you how great that felt because I, in that moment,
*  realized the absence of that connection back in Boston over just a couple of months.
*  We'll talk about it more, but it's tragic to think about that distancing, that dissolution of
*  common humanity at scale, what kind of impact it has on society. Just across the board, political
*  division, and just in the quiet of your own mind and the privacy of your own home, the depression,
*  the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide and forget suicide, just low key suffering.
*  I think that's the suffering, that isolation. We're not meant to live alone. We're not meant
*  to live apart from one another. That's of course the ideology of lockdown is to make people live
*  apart, alone, isolated so that we don't spread diseases to each other. But we're not actually
*  designed as a species to live that way. And that what you're describing, I think if everyone's
*  honest with themselves have felt, especially in places where lockdowns have been very
*  militantly enforced, has felt deep into their core. Well, if I could just return to the question of
*  deaths, you said that the data isn't perfect because we need these kind of seroprevalence
*  surveys to understand how many cases there were to determine the rate of deaths. And we need to have
*  a strong footing in the number of deaths. But if we assume that the number of deaths is approximately
*  correct, what's your sense? What kind of statements can we say about the deadliness of COVID
*  across different demographics? Maybe not in a political way or in the current way, but
*  when history looks back at this moment of time, 50 years from now, 100 years from now, the way we look
*  at the pandemic 100 years ago, what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?
*  I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID depends on not just the virus itself, but who it infects.
*  So probably the most important thing about the deadliness of COVID is this
*  steep age gradient in the mortality rate. So according to these seroprevalence studies
*  that have been done, now hundreds of them, mostly from before vaccination,
*  because vaccination also reduces the mortality risk of COVID, the seroprevalence studies
*  suggest that the risk of death, if you're say over the age of 70, is very high. If you have 5%,
*  if you get COVID, if you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05. But there's not a single
*  sharp cutoff. It's more like I have a rule of thumb that I use. So if you're 50, say,
*  the infection fatality rate from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data,
*  that means 99.8% survival if you're 50. And for every seven years of age above that, double it.
*  Every seven years of age below that, have it. So a 57-year-old would have a 0.4% mortality.
*  A 64-year-old would have a 0.8% and so on. And if you have a severe chronic disease like diabetes,
*  or if you're morbidly obese, it's like adding seven years to your life.
*  And this is for unvaccinated folks.
*  This is unvaccinated before Delta also.
*  Are there a lot of people that will be listening to this with PhDs at the end of their name
*  that would disagree with the 99.8%? Would you say?
*  So I think there's some disagreement over this. And the disagreement is about the quality of the
*  seroprevalence studies that were conducted. So as I said earlier, I was a senior investigator in three
*  different seroprevalence studies very early in the epidemic. I view them as very high quality
*  studies. In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit that we obtained from someone
*  who works in Major League Baseball, actually. He ordered these test kits very early in March 2020
*  that accurately measures antibodies in the bloodstream.
*  The test kits were eventually approved by the, had an EUA by the Emergency Use Authorization
*  by the FDA shortly after we did this. And it had a very low false positive rate. False positive means
*  if you don't have these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream, the kit shows up positive anyways.
*  That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time. And based on studies, a very large number of
*  studies looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit. And 0.5% of the time, 2018,
*  there shouldn't be antibodies there. So if it turns positive, it's a false positive, 0.5% of the time.
*  And then like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%, something like that. I don't remember the exact
*  number. But the false positive rate is the important thing there. So you have a population
*  in March 2020 or April 2020 with very low fraction of patients have been exposed to COVID. You don't
*  know how much, but low. Even a small false positive rate could end up biasing your study
*  quite a bit. But there's a formula to adjust for that. You can adjust for the false positive rate,
*  false negative rate. We did that adjustment. And those studies found in a community population,
*  so leaving aside people in nursing homes who have a higher death rate from COVID,
*  the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County and in LA County.
*  Across all age groups in the community, community meaning just like regular folks.
*  Yeah. So that's actually a real important question too. So the Santa Clara study,
*  we did this Facebook sampling scheme, which is, I mean, not the ideal thing, but it was very
*  difficult to get a random sample during lockdown, where we put out an ad on Facebook
*  soliciting people to volunteer for the study, a randomly selected set of people. We were hoping
*  to get a random selection of people from Santa Clara County, but it tended to, the people who
*  tend to volunteer were from the richer parts of the county. Like I had Stanford professors writing,
*  begging to be in the study because they wanted to know their antibody levels. So we did some
*  adjustment for that. In LA County, we hired a firm that had a pre-existing representative sample of
*  LA County. But it didn't include nursing homes, it didn't include people in jail,
*  things like that, didn't include the homeless populations. So it's representative of a community
*  dwelling population, both of those. And there we found that both in LA County and Santa Clara
*  County in April, 2020, something like 40 to 50 times more infections than cases in both places.
*  So for every case that had been reported to the public health authorities, we found 40 or 50 other
*  infections, people with antibodies in their blood that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.
*  So people were not reporting, they were severe, at least in those days, under reporting.
*  Yeah, I mean, there was testing, there weren't so many tests available. People didn't know,
*  a lot of them, we asked a set of questions about the symptoms they'd faced. And most of them said
*  they faced no symptoms, or the most, 30, 40% of them said they faced no symptoms.
*  I mean, even these days, how many people report that they get COVID when they get COVID? Okay,
*  have those numbers that point to percent, has that approximately held up over time?
*  That is. So if Professor Johnny Anides, who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,
*  is a world expert in meta-analysis, probably the most cited scientist on Earth, I think,
*  at least living, he did a meta-analysis of now 100 or more of these seroprevalence studies.
*  And what he found was that that 0.2% is roughly the worldwide number. In fact, I think he cites
*  this lower number, 0.15% as the median infection fatality rate worldwide. So we did these studies,
*  and it generated an enormous amount of blowback by people who thought that the infection fatality
*  rate is much higher. And there's some controversy over the quality of some of the other studies
*  that are done. And so there are some people who look at this same literature and say, well,
*  the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs, the higher quality studies.
*  IFR?
*  Oh, infection fatality, right? I apologize. I do this in lectures too.
*  And I'm going to rudely interrupt you and ask for the basics sometimes if it's okay.
*  No, of course. So these higher quality studies, they say, tend to produce higher,
*  but the problem is that if you want a global infection fatality rate, you need to get
*  seroprevalence studies from everywhere, even in places that don't necessarily have the
*  infrastructure set up to produce very, very high quality studies. And in poor places in the world,
*  places like Africa, the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.
*  And in some richer places, like New York City, the infection fatality rate is much higher.
*  There's a range of IFRs in a single number. This sometimes surprises people because they think,
*  well, it's a virus. It should have the same properties no matter where it goes.
*  But the virus kills or infects or hurts in interaction with the host.
*  And the properties of both the host and the virus combine to produce the outcome.
*  But you also mentioned the environment too?
*  Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person. If I'm going to think about it,
*  the most simplest way to think about it is age. Age is the single most important risk factor.
*  So older places are going to have a higher IFR than younger places. Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.
*  So in some sense, it's not surprising that they have a low infection fatality rate.
*  So that's one way you would explain the difference between Africa and New York City
*  in terms of the fatality rate is the age, the average age.
*  Yeah. And especially in the early days of the epidemic in New York City, the
*  older populations living in nursing homes were differentially infected
*  based on because of policies that were adopted to send
*  COVID-infected patients back to nursing homes to keep hospitals empty.
*  What do you mean by differentially infected?
*  The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.
*  Right. Okay.
*  The policy, it's the person that matters. It's not like the virus just doesn't care.
*  The policy determines the nature of the interaction. There is some contribution from
*  the environment, different regions have different proximity maybe of people
*  interacting or the dynamics of the way they interact.
*  Yeah. If you have situations where there's lots of intergenerational
*  interactions, then you have a very different risk profile than if you have societies where
*  generations are more separate from one another. Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this.
*  So in New York, you have a population that was infected in the early days that was very likely
*  going to die, but had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected. And so New York City had
*  a higher IFR, especially in the early days than Africa has had. The other thing is treatment.
*  The treatments that we adopted in the early days of the epidemic I think actually may have
*  exacerbated the risk of death. Which treatments?
*  Using ventilators, the over-reliance on ventilators is what I'm primarily thinking of,
*  but I can think of other things. But that also we've learned over time how better to manage
*  patients with the disease. So you have all those things combined. So that's where the controversy
*  over this number is. I mean, New York City also is a central hub for those who tweet
*  and those who write powerful stories and narratives in article form. And I remember there's quite
*  dramatic stories about doctors in the hospitals and these kinds of things. I mean, there's very
*  serious, very dramatic, very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals. Those stories,
*  loved ones losing each other on a deathbed, that's always tragic. And you can always write a hell of
*  a good story about that. And you should about the loss of loved ones. But they were doing it pretty
*  well, I would say, over this kind of dramatic deaths. And so in response to that, it's very
*  unpleasant to hear, even to consider the possibility that the death rate is not as high
*  as you might feel. Yeah. I was surprised by the reaction, both by regular people and also the
*  scientific community in response to those studies, those early studies in April of 2020. To me,
*  they were studies. I mean, they're the kinds of, not exactly the kinds of work I've worked on all
*  my life, but kind of like the kind of, you know, you write a paper and you get responses from
*  your fellow scientists and you change the paper to improve it. You hopefully learn something from it.
*  Well, but to push back is just a study. But there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting,
*  because I've received similar pushback on other topics. There's some studies that, if wrong,
*  might have a wide ranging detrimental effects on society. So that's the way they would perceive
*  the studies. If you say the death rate is lower and you end up, as you often do in science,
*  realizing that, nope, that was a flaw in the way the study was conducted, or we're just not
*  representative of a broader population, and then you realize the death rate is much higher,
*  that might be very damaging in people's view. So that's probably where the scientific community
*  steel man the kind of response is that's where they felt like, you know, there's some findings
*  where you better be damn sure before you kind of report them. Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure
*  we were right. And it turns out we were right. So like when we so we released the Santa Clara
*  study via this open open science process and this server called Med Archive. It's designed
*  for releasing studies have not yet been peer reviewed in order to garner comment from the
*  scientists before peer review. The LA County study, we went through the traditional peer review
*  process and got it published in the Journal of American Medical Association sometime in like
*  July, I think I forget the date of 2020. The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020.
*  In this sort of working paper archive. The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,
*  we had a result that was we thought was quite important. And we wanted to tell the scientific
*  community about it and also tell the world about it. And it wasn't we wanted to get feedback. I
*  mean, we are letting that's part of the purpose of sending it to these kinds of places. I think a
*  lot of the problem is that when people think about published science, they think of it as
*  automatically true. And if it goes through peer review, it's automatically true. If it hasn't
*  gone through peer review, it's not automatically true. And especially in medicine, when we're not
*  used to having this app, this access to pre peer reviewed work, I mean, in economics, actually,
*  that's quite normal. You take years to get something published. So there's a very active
*  debate over or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed in this in this sort of
*  working paper way, much less normal or much, much newer in medicine. And so I think part of that,
*  the perception about what those that that what process happens in open science, when you release
*  a study that that got people confused. And you're right, it was a very important result, because
*  we had just locked the world down in middle of March with, I think catastrophic results.
*  And if that if that study was right, if our study was right, that meant we'd made a mistake.
*  And not because the death rate was low. That's actually not the key thing there. The key thing
*  is that we had adopted these policies, these test and trace policies, these policies, these lockdown
*  policies aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero. That was essentially the idea.
*  If we can just get the virus to go away, we won't have to ever worry about it again.
*  The main problem with our result, as far as that strategy was concerned, wasn't the death rate,
*  it was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases, it was the two and a half percent or
*  3% or 4% prevalence rate that we identified of the antibodies in the population, if that number is
*  right, it's too late, the virus is not going to go to zero. And no matter how much we test and
*  trace and isolate, we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.
*  So we're going to have to let the virus go through the entire population in some way?
*  No, no, well, we can talk about that in a bit. That's the Great Barrington Declaration. You
*  don't have to let the virus go through the population. You can shield preferentially.
*  The policy we chose was to shield preferentially the laptop class, the set of people who could
*  work from home without losing their job. And we did a very good job at protecting them.
*  Yeah.
*  And we did a very good job at protecting them.
*  Well, let me take a small tangent. We're going to jump around in time,
*  which I think will be the best way to tell the story. So that was the beginning.
*  Yeah. Okay, actually, can I go back one more thing for that? Because that's really important.
*  And I should have started with this. What led me to do those studies was a paper that I'd
*  remembered seeing from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009. I've been much less active in writing
*  about that. I had written up a paper or two about that in 2009. There was actually this same debate
*  over the mortality rate, except it unfolded over the course of two or three years. The early studies
*  of the mortality rate in H1N1 counted the number of cases in the denominator,
*  the number of deaths in the numerator, cases meaning people identified as having H1N1 showing
*  up the doctor tested to have it. And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality were like 4%,
*  3%, really, really high. Over the course of a couple of more years, a whole bunch of
*  seroprevalence studies, seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out. And it turned out that there
*  were 100 or more times people infected per case. And so the mortality rate was actually something
*  like 0.02% for H1N1, not the three, like a hundredfold difference. So this made you think,
*  okay, it took us a couple of two or three years to discover the truth behind the actual infections
*  for H1N1. And then what's the truth here? And can we get there faster?
*  Yeah. And it spreads in a similar way as the H1N1 flu did. I mean, it spreads via
*  solidization, via person-to-person breathing, kind of contact up. And maybe some by fomites,
*  but it seems like that's less likely now. In any case, it seemed really important to me to speed
*  up the process of having those seroprevalence studies so that we can better understand who was
*  at risk and what the right strategy ought to be. This might be a good place to kind of
*  compare influenza, the flu and COVID in the context of the discussion we just had, which is
*  how deadly is COVID? So you mentioned COVID is a very particular kind of steepness,
*  where the X axis is age. So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza and COVID?
*  Because a lot of people outside the folks who suggest that the lizards who run the world
*  have completely fabricated and invented COVID. Outside of those folks, kind of the natural
*  process by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is say, what's just like the flu? The flu is a
*  very serious thing actually. So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?
*  Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing. It kills 50,000, 60,000 people a year,
*  something like that, depending on the particular strain that goes around. That's in the United
*  States. The primary difference to me, there's lots of differences, but one of the most salient
*  differences is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu. So the flu is more deadly for
*  two children than COVID is. There's no controversy about that. Children, thank God, have much
*  less severe reactions to COVID infection than they do to flu infections. And rate of fatalities.
*  Rate of fatality, all of that. I think you mentioned, I mean, it's interesting to maybe
*  also comment on, I think in another conversation you mentioned there's a U shape to the flu curve.
*  So meaning like, there's actually quite a large number of kids that die from flu.
*  I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu, the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.
*  And that is not the case with COVID. More than, I'm going to get the number wrong, but something
*  like 70, 80% of the deaths are people over the age of 60. We've talked about the fear the whole
*  time really. But my interaction with folks, now I want to have a family, I want to have kids,
*  but I don't have that real firsthand experience. But my interaction with folks is at the core fear
*  that folks had is for their children. Like that somehow, you know, I don't want to get infected
*  because of the kids, like, because God forbid something happens to the kids. And I think that,
*  obviously that makes a lot of sense. This kind of, the kids come first, no matter what,
*  that's their own priority. But for this particular virus, that reasoning was not grounded in data,
*  it seems like, or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.
*  It wasn't. But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu just overall,
*  and especially to older people.
*  Yes.
*  Right? So.
*  The numbers, when the story is all said and done, COVID would take many more lives.
*  Yeah. So I mean, point two is sounds like a small number, but it's not a small number worldwide.
*  What do you think that number will be by the, you know, that's not like me, but would we cross,
*  I think it's in the United States, it's the way the deaths are currently reports,
*  like 800,000, something like that. Do you think we'll cross a million?
*  Seems likely. Yeah.
*  Do you think it's something that might contain you with different variants?
*  Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID. The end state of COVID is it's here
*  forever. I think that there is good evidence of immunity after infection, such that you're
*  protected both against reinfection and also against severe disease upon reinfection.
*  So the second time you get it, it's not true for everyone, but for many people,
*  the second time you get it will be milder, much milder than the first time you get it.
*  With the long tail, like that lasts for a long time.
*  Yeah. So just there are studies that follow, of course, people who were infected for a year.
*  And the reinfection rate is something like somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.
*  And like a pretty fantastic study out of Italy has found that there's been one in Sweden,
*  I think there's a few studies have found this similar things. And the reinfections
*  tend to produce much milder disease, much less likely to end up in the hospital,
*  much less likely to die. So what the end state of COVID is, it's circulating the population
*  forever and you get it multiple times. Yeah. And then there's, I think, studies and discussions
*  like the best protection would be to get it and then also to get vaccinated. And then a lot of
*  people push back against that for the obvious reasons from both sides, because somehow this
*  discourse has become less scientific and more political.
*  Well, I think you want to, the first time you meet it is going to be the most deadly for you.
*  And so the first time you meet it, it's just wise to be vaccinated. The vaccine reduces
*  severe disease. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about the vaccine because I want to make sure I address it
*  carefully and properly in full context. But yes, sort of to add to the context, a lot of the
*  fascinating discussions we're having is in the early days of COVID and now for people who are
*  unvaccinated. That's where the interesting story is. The policy story, the sociological story and
*  so on. But let me go to something really fascinating just because of the people involved,
*  the human beings involved and because of how deeply I care about science and also kindness,
*  respect and love and human things. Francis Collins wrote a letter in October 2020
*  to Anthony Fauci, I think somebody else. I have the letter, oh, it's not a letter, email, I apologize.
*  Hi Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org. This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration
*  that you're a co-author on. This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists who met with
*  the secretary seemed to be getting a lot of attention and even a co-signature from Nobel
*  Prize winner Mike Levitt at Stanford. There needs to be a quick and devastating published take down
*  of its premises. I don't see anything like that online yet. Is it underway? Francis Collins,
*  director of the NIH, somebody I talked to on this podcast recently. Okay, a million questions I want
*  to ask, but first, how did that make you feel when you first saw this email come to light?
*  Which when did it come to light? This week actually, I think or last week. Okay, so this
*  is because of freedom of information. Yeah. Which by the way, sort of maybe because I do want to
*  add positive stuff on the side of Francis here. Boy, when I see stuff like that, I wonder if all
*  my emails leaked. How much embarrassing stuff. Like I think I'm a good person, but I haven't read my
*  old emails. Maybe, I'm pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole. Well, I mean, look, he's a
*  Christian and I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive, right? I mean, I think he was looking at
*  this Great Barrington Declaration as a political problem to be solved as opposed to a serious
*  alternative approach to the epidemic. So maybe we'll talk about it in more detail, but just
*  in case people are not familiar, Great Barrington Declaration was a document that you co-authored
*  that basically argues against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID and you propose
*  another solution that we'll talk about. But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document.
*  It is just a document that criticizes one policy solution that was proposed. But it was the policy
*  solution that had been put forward by Dr. Collins and by Tony Fauci and a few other scientists. I
*  mean, I think a relatively small number of scientists and epidemiologists in charge of
*  the advice given to governments worldwide. And it was a challenge to that policy that said that,
*  look, there is an alternate path that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown with an aim
*  to suppress the virus to zero effectively, I mean, that was unstated, cannot work and is causing
*  catastrophic harm to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide. We put this out in
*  October 4th, I think of 2020. And it went viral. I mean, I've never actually been involved with
*  anything like this, where I just put the document on the web and tens of thousands of doctors signed
*  on, hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on. It really struck a chord of people,
*  because I think even by October 2020, people had this sense that there was something really wrong
*  with the COVID policy that we've been following. And they were looking for reasonable people to
*  give an alternative. I mean, we're not arguing that COVID isn't a serious thing. I mean, it is a very
*  serious thing. This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it. But we were saying that
*  the policy we're following is not the right one. So how does a democratic government deal with that
*  challenge? So to me, that, you asked me how I felt. I was actually frankly, just I was,
*  I suspected there had been some email exchanges like that, not necessarily from Francis Collins,
*  around the government around this time. I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign,
*  almost immediately after we published it, where newspapers mischaracterized it in the same way
*  over and over and over again. And sought to characterize me as sort of a marginal fringe
*  figure or whatnot. And Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kuhl-Dorf, or the tens of thousands of other
*  people that signed it. I felt the brunt of that all year long. So to see this in black and white,
*  in the handwriting essentially, I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins
*  was actually frankly a disappointment because I've looked up to him for years.
*  Yeah, I've looked up to him as well. I mean, I look for the best in people and I still look up to him.
*  What troubles me several things. The reason I said about the asshole emails I send late at night is
*  I can understand this email. It's fear, it's panic, not being sure. The fringe,
*  three fringe epidemiologists.
*  Plus Mike Levitt who won a Nobel Prize.
*  But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts, I have said things like that about others,
*  like a little bit too unkind. Like you don't really mean it. Now add to that, he recently,
*  this week or whatever, doubled down on the fringe. This is really troubling to me.
*  I can excuse this email, but the arrogance there. Francis honestly, I mean,
*  broke my heart a little bit there. This was an opportunity to like, especially at this stage,
*  to say, just like I told him, to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.
*  I was wrong to not be open to ideas. I still believe that this is not like say,
*  like actually argue with the proposal, with the policy of the post solution. Also,
*  the devastating published take, devastating takedown, devastating takedown. As you say,
*  somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars that they're giving to scientists, some of whom
*  are often not their best human beings because they're fighting with each other over money.
*  Not being cognizant of the fact that you're challenging the integrity, you're not being
*  you're corrupting the integrity of scientists by allocating the money. You're now playing with that
*  by saying devastating takedown. Where do you think the published takedown will come from?
*  It will come from those scientists to whom you're giving money. What kind of example would they give
*  to the academic community that thrives on freedom? Like this, this is, I believe Francis Collins
*  is a great man. One of the things I was troubled by is the negative response to him from people
*  that don't understand the positive impact that NIH has had on society. How many people has helped.
*  But this is exactly the, so he's not just a scientist. He's not just a bureaucrat who
*  distributes money. He's also scientific leader that in the time, in difficult times we live in,
*  is supposed to inspire us with trust, with love, with the freedom of thought. He's supposed to,
*  you know those fringe epidemiologists, those are the heroes of science. When you look at the long
*  arc of history, we love those people. We love ideas even when they get proven wrong. That's what always
*  had attracted me to science. Like somebody, the lone voice saying, I know the moon of Jupiter does
*  move. But the funny thing is Galileo is saying something truly revolutionary. We were saying
*  that what we proposed in the Great Baratheon Declaration was actually just the old pandemic
*  plan. It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel. In fact, there were plans like this that
*  lockdown scientists had written in late February, early March of 2020.
*  So we were not saying anything radical. We were just calling for a debate
*  effectively over the existing lockdown policy. And this is a disappointment, a really truly a big
*  disappointment because by doing this, you were absolutely right Lex. He sent a signal to so many
*  other scientists to just stay silent, even if you had reservations. Yeah, devastating take down.
*  You know how many people wrote to me privately like Stanford, MIT, how amazing the conversation
*  with Francis Collins was? There's a kind of admiration because, okay, how do I put it?
*  A lot of people get into science because they want to help the world. They get excited by the ideas
*  and they really are working hard to help in whatever the discipline is. And then there is
*  sources of funding which help you do help at a larger scale. So you admire those, the people that
*  are distributing the money because they're often, at least on the surface,
*  are really also good people. Oftentimes they're great scientists. So like it's amazing. That's why
*  sort of like sometimes people from outside think academia is broken some kind of way. No,
*  it's a beautiful thing. It really is a beautiful thing. And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking
*  with this person is I don't think this is malevolence. I think he's just incompetent
*  at communication twice. I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too. So like,
*  all of us have arrogance. Yes, but there's a particular kind of arrogance. So here it's
*  the same kind of arrogance that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV and says that if you criticize
*  me, you're not simply criticizing a man, you're criticizing science itself. That is at the heart
*  also of this email. The certainty that the policies that they were recommending, Collins
*  and Fauci were recommending to the President of the United States were right. Not just right,
*  but right so far right that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous. And I think
*  that is really the heart of that email. It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.
*  Now to be as charitable as I can be to this, I believe they thought that. I believe some of them
*  still think that there was only one true policy possible in response to COVID. Every other policy
*  was immoral. And if you come from that position, then you write an email like that. You go on TV,
*  you say effectively, la science est moi. That is what happens when you have this sort of
*  unchallengeable arrogance that the policy you're following is correct. When we wrote the Great
*  Bank Declaration, what I was hoping for was a discussion about how to protect the vulnerable.
*  I mean, that was the key idea to me and the whole thing was better protection of the older
*  population who really at really serious risk if infected with COVID. And we had been doing a very
*  poor job, I thought, to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable. And what I wanted was
*  a discussion by local public health about better methods, better policies to protect the vulnerable.
*  So when we were met with instead a series of essentially propagandist lies about it. So
*  for instance, I kept hearing from reporters in those days, why do you want to let the virus rip?
*  Let it rip, let it rip. The words let it rip does not appear in the Great Barrington Declaration.
*  The goal isn't to let the virus rip. The goal is to protect the vulnerable, to let society go,
*  as you know, open schools and do other things that function as best it can in the midst of
*  a terrible pandemic. Yes, but not let the virus rip. Where the most vulnerable aren't protected,
*  the goal was to protect the vulnerable. So why let it rip? Because it was a propaganda term
*  to hit the fear centers of people's brains. Oh, these people are immoral. They just want to let
*  the virus go through society and hurt everybody. That was the idea. It was a way to preclude a
*  discussion and preclude a debate about the existing policy. So I have this app called Clubhouse.
*  I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian, unrelated for a few big Russian
*  conversations coming up. Anyway, it's a great way to talk to regular people in Russian.
*  But I also, there was a, I was nervous. I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation and
*  there was a vaccine room. And so I joined it. And it was a pro-science room. These are scientists
*  that were calling each other pro-science. The whole thing was theater to me. I haven't
*  thoroughly researched, but looking at the resume, there were pretty solid
*  researchers and doctors and they were mocking everybody who was at all. I mean, it doesn't
*  matter what they stood for, but they were just mocking people. And the arrogance was overwhelming.
*  I had to shut off because I couldn't handle that human beings can be like this to each other.
*  And then I went back to just to double check, is this really happening? How many people are here?
*  Is this theater? And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse to make a couple of comments.
*  And then as I opened my mouth, I said, thank you so much. This is a great room. Sort of the usual
*  civil politeness, all that kind of stuff. And I said, I'm worried that the kind of arrogance
*  with which things are being discussed here will further divide us, not unite us. And before
*  I said even the United further divide us, I was thrown off stage. Now this isn't where I mention
*  platform, but like I am like a Lex Friedman, MIT also, which is something those people seem
*  to sometimes care about the followers and stuff like that. Like, did you just do that? And then
*  they said enough of that nonsense, enough of that nonsense. They said to me enough of that nonsense.
*  Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins is the Pfizer CEO.
*  You're bringing up epidemiologists also. So just.
*  Yeah, exactly. But this broke my heart, the arrogance. And this is echoes of that arrogance
*  is something you see in this email. And I really would love to have a million things to talk about
*  to try to figure out how can we find a path forward? I think a lot of a lot of the problems
*  we've seen in the discussion over COVID, especially in the scientific community,
*  there's two ways to look at science, I think, that have been competing with each other for a while now.
*  One way, and this is the way that I view science and why I've always found it so attractive,
*  is an invitation to a structured discussion where the discussion is tempered by evidence,
*  by data, by reasoning and logic. So it's a dialectical process where if I believe A and
*  you believe B, well, we talk about it, we come up with an experiment that distinguishes between the
*  two. And while B turns out to be right, I'm all frustrated by I buy you dinner, and I say no, no,
*  no, no, no, C. And then we go on from there. That's what science is at its best, is this process of
*  using data in discussion. It's a human activity to have the truth unfold itself before us.
*  On the other hand, there's another way that people have used science or thought about science as
*  truth in and of itself. If it's science, therefore it's true automatically. What does the science
*  say to do? Well, the science never says to do anything. The science says, here's what's true,
*  and then we have to apply our human values to say, okay, well, if we do this, well, then this is
*  likely to happen. That's what the science says. If we do that, then that is likely to happen. Well,
*  we'd rather have this than that, right? But science doesn't tell us that we'd rather have this than
*  that. It's our human values that tell us that we'd rather have this than that. Science plays a role,
*  but it's not the only thing. It's not the only role. It helps us understand the constraints we
*  face, but it doesn't tell us what to do in face of those constraints. But underneath it,
*  at the individual level, at the institutional level, it seems like arrogance is really destructive.
*  So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility. So sort of always not being
*  sure that you're right. This is actually kind of, Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.
*  How do you make sure that AI, super intelligent AI doesn't destroy us? You built in
*  a sort of module within it that it always doubts its actions. Like it's not sure. Like I know
*  it says I'm supposed to destroy all humans, but maybe I'm wrong. And that maybe I'm wrong is
*  essential for progress, for actually doing in the long arc of history, but not the perfect thing,
*  but better and better and better and better. I mean, the question I have here for you is
*  this, this email so clearly captures some maybe echo, but maybe a core to the problem.
*  Do you put responsibility of this email, of the shortcomings and failures on individuals or
*  institutions? Is this Francis Collins, Anthony? No, this is an institutional failure, right? So
*  the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding. I've sat on NIH review panels. The purpose of
*  the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex, the purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.
*  To some extent, it's also to help scientists, to direct scientists to work on things that
*  are very important for public health or for the health of the public. So, and the way you do that,
*  is you say, okay, we're going to put $50 million on the research in Alzheimer's disease this year,
*  or $70 million on HIV or whatever it is. And that pot of money then scientists compete
*  with each other for the best ideas to use it to address that problem. So it's essentially
*  an endeavor to support the work of scientists. It is not in and of itself a policy organ.
*  It doesn't say what public health policy should be. For that, you have the CDC.
*  And what happened during the pandemic is that people in the NIH were called upon
*  to contribute to public health policymaking. And that created the conflict of interest you see in
*  that email. So now you have the head of the NIH in effect saying to all scientists, you must agree
*  with me in the policy that I've recommended or else you're a fringe. That is a deep conflict
*  of interest. It's deep because first he's conflicted. He has this dual role as
*  the head of the NIH, supporter of scientific funding, and then also inappropriately called
*  to set or help set pandemic policy. That should never have happened. There should be a bright line
*  between those two roles. Let me ask you about just Francis Collins. I don't know if you,
*  I had a chance to talk to him on a podcast. I don't know if you maybe by chance got a chance
*  to hear a few words. I heard some of it, yeah. Well, I have a kind of a question to that because
*  a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things about Francis Collins. And like I said,
*  I still believe he's a great man, a great scientist. One of the things when I talked to him
*  off mic about the vaccine, the excitement he had about when we were recollecting,
*  when they first got in an inkling that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine,
*  just he wasn't messaging, just in the private or of our own conversation. He was really excited.
*  And why was he excited? Because he gets to help a lot of people. This is a man that really wants
*  to help people. And there could be some institutional self-delusion, the arrogance,
*  all those kinds of things that lead to this kind of email. But ultimately the goal is this. I don't
*  think people quite realize this. The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,
*  the reason there needs to be a devastating published takedown, he, I believe really believes
*  that this could be very dangerous. And it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders because
*  like you said, in his role where he defines some of the public policy, like, you know,
*  depending on how he thinks about the world, millions of people could die because of one
*  decision he make. And that's a lot of burden to walk with. Yeah. No, I think that's right. I don't
*  think that he has bad intentions. I think that he was basically put, was put or maybe put himself
*  in a position where this kind of conflict of interest was going to create this kind of,
*  this, this kind of a reaction, right? The kind of humility that you're calling for is almost
*  impossible when you have that dual, dual role that that shouldn't, you shouldn't have it have as,
*  as funder of science and also setter of scientific policy. I agree with everything you just said,
*  except the last part, the, the humility is almost impossible. That, uh, humility is always difficult.
*  I think, I think there's a huge incentive to, for humility in that position. Now look, look at history.
*  Great leaders that have humility, um, are popular as hell. So if you like being popular,
*  if you like having impact legacy, uh, these descendants of ape seem to care about legacy,
*  especially as they get older in these high positions. Like I think the incentive for
*  humility is pretty high. The thing is, is like, there's a lot that he has to be proud of in his
*  career. Like the human genome project wouldn't have happened without him. Uh, and he is, he is,
*  he is a great man and a great scientist, but it's so tragic to me that his career has ended in this
*  particular way. Can I ask you a question about, um, my podcast conversation with him by way of advice
*  or maybe criticism? There's a lot of people that wrote to me kind words of support and a lot of
*  people that wrote to me, respectful, constructive criticism. How would you suggest to have
*  conversations with folks like that? And maybe, um, I mean, cause there's, I have other conversations
*  like this, including, I was debating whether to talk to, uh, Anthony Fauci. He wanted to talk.
*  And so what kind of conversation do you have? And sorry to take us on a tangent,
*  but almost from an interview perspective of how to inspire humility and inspire trust
*  in science or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing and we're going to figure this
*  out. I mean, I think, uh, you're, I've had been now interviewed by many people. Um, I think the,
*  the style you have really works well, Lex, you have to, cause you know, I don't think you're
*  going to be ever an attack dog trying to go after somebody and force them to, to like,
*  you know, submit that they were wrong or about, or whatever about, I mean, that's that I also
*  actually find that form of journalism and podcasting really off putting it's hard to watch.
*  Also, I, it's a whole lot of the tangent. Is that actually effective? I don't think so. Do you want
*  to ask, uh, Hitler and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler. I've been studying
*  a lot about the, the, the, the rise and fall of the third rite. I think about interviewing
*  Stalin. Like I put myself in that mindset, like how do you have conversations with people to
*  understand who they are so that not, so you can sit there and yell at them, but to understand who
*  they are so that you can inspire a very large number of people to be the best version of
*  themselves and to avoid the mistakes of the past. I believe that everyone that's involved in this
*  debate has good intentions. They have their, they're coming at it from their points of view.
*  They, they don't, they have, um, uh, they have their weaknesses. And if you can paint a picture
*  in your questioning by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses and their point of
*  view, you've done a service. Um, and that's really all you, I personally like, like to see in those
*  kinds of interviews. Um, I don't think a gotcha moment, uh, is really the key thing there. The,
*  the key thing is understanding where they're coming from, understanding their thinking,
*  understanding the constraints they faced and how did they manage them. That's going to provide a
*  much, I mean, for me, that's what I look for when I, when I listen to podcasts like yours, um, is,
*  is an understanding of that, of that, uh, of that person and the moment and how they dealt with it.
*  I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way, a flaw in a person's thinking
*  together. Like as opposed to discovering the positive thing together, you discover the thing
*  where I didn't really think about that. Yeah. I mean, that's what's, that's how science is,
*  right? That's why we find it. I think find it so attractive is this, I, I, I like it when a student
*  shows me I'm thinking incorrectly, right? I think I'm really grateful to that student because now I
*  have an opportunity to change my mind about it and then start thinking even more correctly. I mean,
*  and there are moments when, uh, I mean, like this is probably a good time to say like,
*  what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right? So like, for instance, you said Francis
*  Collins had a moment when he, uh, he learned that the, that there was quite possible to get a vaccine
*  going. Yeah. He must've learned that quite early in, I didn't learn that early. I mean, I, I didn't
*  know in March of 2020, in my experience with vaccine development, it would have taken,
*  I thought it would take a decade or more to get a vaccine. That was wrong, right? I didn't,
*  and I was so happy when I started to see the preliminary numbers in the, in the Pfizer trial
*  that strongly suggested it was going to work. Yeah. And I was, I mean, like very few times in
*  my life. And so happy to be wrong. And it changes kind of, um, I think I've heard you mention that
*  a lockdown is still a bad idea, uh, unless the vaccine comes out in like tomorrow. Uh, there's
*  still like suffering and economic pain. All kinds of pain can still happen in even just a, a scale
*  of weeks, um, uh, versus months. Yeah. Well, let's talk about the vaccine. What are your thoughts on
*  the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?
*  So for the vaccine safety data, uh, it's, it's actually challenging to convey to the public how
*  this is normally done. Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial. You'd have a
*  long trial with large numbers, relatively large numbers of people. You'd follow them over a long
*  time and the trial will give you some indication of the safety of the vaccine. And it did. Um, I
*  mean, but, uh, the, the, the trial, the way it was constructed when it was, came out that it was
*  protective against COVID, it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm. And so that placebo arm was
*  vaccinated, what large part of it. And so that meant that from the trial, you were not going to
*  be able to get data on the long-term safety profiles of the vaccine. Uh, and also the other
*  thing about trials, uh, there's tens of thousands of people enrolled. That's still not enough to get
*  when you, when you deploy a vaccine to the population scale, you're going to see things
*  that weren't in the trial guaranteed populations to people that weren't represented well in the
*  trial are going to, are going to be given the vaccine and then that they're going to have things
*  that happened to them that you didn't, didn't anticipate. So, um, I wasn't surprised when
*  people are a little bit skeptical when the trial was done about the safety profile, just the way,
*  the nature of the thing was going to make it so that it was going to be hard to get a complete
*  picture from the trials itself. And the trial showed they were pretty safe and quite effective
*  preventing, um, both you from getting COVID. I think the main endpoint of the trial itself was
*  a symptomatic COVID, right? So, um, uh, so that was like, that was, you know, I mean, it was really,
*  um, to me, like is about as amazing achievement as anything organizing a trial of that scale
*  and running it so quickly. And the final results being so surprisingly high. So good, right?
*  And, um, so the, but the problem then was normally it would take a long time. The FDA would
*  tell Pfizer to go back and try it in this subgroup. They'd work more on dosing. They do all,
*  all these kinds of things that kind of didn't, we really didn't have time for in the middle of the
*  pandemic. Right? So you have a, you have, um, a basis for approval that it's less full than
*  normally you would have for a population scale vaccine, but the results were good. The results
*  looked really good. And actually I should say for the most part that's been born out when we've
*  given the vaccine at scale in terms of protection against severe disease. Right? So people who have
*  got the vaccine, um, for a very long time after they've had the, for the full vaccination have
*  had great protection against going, being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.
*  Let's separate, cause this seems to be, um, there's critics of both categories, but different
*  kids and kids and old, not older people, like, uh, let's say five years old and above or something
*  like they're 13 years old and above. So, uh, for those, it seems like the reduction
*  of, uh, the rate of fatalities and, and serious illness seems to be something like 10 X.
*  I mean, for older people, it is a godsend. This vaccine, it, it transforms the problem of
*  focus protection from something that's quite challenging possible. I believe it quite
*  challenging to something that's much, much more manageable because the vaccine in and of itself,
*  when deployed in older populations is a form of focus protection.
*  Yes. Well, by the way, we'll talk about the focus protection in one segment,
*  cause it's such a brilliant idea for this pandemic of a future pandemics.
*  I thought the sociological psychological discussion about the letter from Francis Collins is, um,
*  because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me. So I'm glad we talked about that first.
*  But so the, there seems to be the vaccines work to reduce deaths.
*  And that has the, especially the most transformative effects for the older.
*  So can I, let me give you, I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic. Let me tell you
*  the second thing I got wrong for sure in the pandemic in January of, of this year, 2021,
*  I thought that the vaccines would stop infection. Yes. Right. It would,
*  would make it so that you were much less likely to be infected at all because the, the, the antibodies
*  that were produced by the vaccines looked like they are neutralizing antibodies that would,
*  would essentially block you from being infected at all. Um, that turned out to be wrong. Right. So
*  I think it, and it became clear as data came out from Israel, which vaccinated very early,
*  that they were seeing surges of infection, even in a very highly vaccinated population
*  that the vaccine does not stop infection. So you're a used car salesman and you were selling the
*  vaccine and the features you thought a vaccine would have, I mean, I have a similar kind of sense
*  when the vaccine came out, vaccine would reduce, uh, if you somehow were able to get it, it would
*  reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things, but it would also reduce the chance of you
*  getting it. And if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it to somebody else.
*  And it turns out that those latter two things are not as definitive or in fact,
*  or I mean, I don't know to what degree they're not. I mean, I think it's, it's a little
*  complicated because I think the first two or three months after you're fully vaccinated,
*  after the second dose, um, you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection. So, uh,
*  that, which is pretty good. I mean, right. But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%
*  some places, some studies like there's a study out of Sweden suggested might even drop to zero.
*  But, and then you're also infectious for some period of time. If you do get it,
*  even though you're vaccinated, although there seems to be lucid data that the period of time
*  your infectious is shorter, but the, the, the, the infectivity per day is about as high.
*  So you still, it's the point is that, that, uh, the vaccine might reduce some risk of
*  infecting others, but it's not a categorical difference. So, uh, uh, unvaccinated it's not
*  safe to be in the presence of just vaccinated people. You can still get infected. Right. So,
*  I mean, there's a million things I want to ask here, but is there in some sense, because the
*  vaccine, um, really helps on the worst part of this pandemic, which is killing people.
*  Yes. Uh, doesn't that mean, uh, where does the vaccine hesitancy come from in terms of,
*  it seems like obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution to let us open this thing up.
*  Yeah. So I wrote a wall street journal op-ed with Sinatra Gupta in December of last year.
*  A very night with a very naive title, which says we can end the lockdowns in a month.
*  And the idea was very simple. Vaccinate all vulnerable people and then open up, open up.
*  Right. Uh, and the idea was that, uh, the, the, the lockdown harms is related. This is directly
*  related to the great Barrington declaration. The great Barrington declaration said the lockdown
*  harms are devastating to the population at large. There's this considerable segment of people that
*  are vulnerable, protect them. Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool to protect the
*  vulnerable, which is, I still believe, I mean, it is true, right? You vaccinate the vulnerable,
*  the older population. And as you said, it's a 10 fold decrease in the mortality risk, um,
*  from getting infected, which is, I mean, amazing. So that was the strategy we got, we outlined.
*  What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed. So first there's, so you're asking
*  about vaccine hesitancy. I think there's, there's first, there's like, there's, there's the inherent
*  limitations of how to measure vaccine safety. Right. So we talked about a little bit about the
*  trial, but also after the trial, there's a, there's a, there's a mechanism and this is the work I've
*  been involved with before COVID on, on, on tracking and, and identifying and checking
*  whether the vaccines actually are safe. And the central challenge is one of causality.
*  So you no longer have the randomized trial, but, but, but you want to know is the vaccine,
*  when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events? Well, you can't just look at people
*  who are vaccinated and see what adverse events happen because you don't know what would have
*  happened if the person had not been vaccinated. So you have to have some control group. Now,
*  what happened is there's several systems to do to check this in that the CDC uses one at one very,
*  very commonly known one now is called VAERS, the vaccine adverse event reporting system.
*  There, anyone who has an adverse event that either, either a regular person or a doctor can just
*  go report, look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache or whatever it is.
*  The person died a day after that the vaccine, right. Now you're vaccinated,
*  the vaccine was rolled out to older people first and older people die sometimes with or without the
*  vaccine. So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated and a few days later they die.
*  Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it's really difficult to tell.
*  In order to tell you need a control group to, for that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have
*  like there's one called VSD, vaccine safety data link. There's another system called BEST.
*  I forget what the acronym is to essentially to track cohorts of people vaccinated versus
*  unvaccinated with as careful a matching as you can do. It's not randomized, but and then see
*  if you have safety signals that pop up in the vaccinated relative to the control group unvaccinated.
*  And so that's, for instance, how the, the, the, the, the myocarditis risk was picked up
*  in young, especially young men. It's also how the higher risk of blood clots in middle-aged and
*  older women in with the J&J vaccine was picked up. There, what you have is our, our situations where
*  the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low that if you see them in the, in the vaccinated arm
*  at all, that it's not hard to understand that the vaccine did this, right. Young men should not be
*  having myocarditis. Middle-aged women should not be having huge blood clots in the brain, right.
*  So when you see that, you can say it's linked. Now the rates are low. So young men, maybe one in
*  5,000, one in 10,000 of the vaccine, vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis, young women,
*  middle-aged women. I don't know. I don't, I'm not sure what the right number might be, but like,
*  I'd say it's like in the, you know, one in hundreds of thousands, something like that.
*  So these are rare outcomes, but they're, they're, they are vaccine linked outcomes. How do you deal
*  with that as a messaging thing? I think you just tell people, you tell people here are the risks,
*  you transparently tell them and just, you're not, you're not, they're, so they're not getting into
*  something that they don't know. Yeah. And don't treat people like they're children and need to be
*  told lies because they won't understand the full complexity of the truth. People I think are pretty
*  good at, or actually, you know, people with time are good at understanding data, but better than
*  anything, they're, they're better at, they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and
*  bullshit. And give them either one of those. I'll give you one that's where I think it's
*  greatly undermined vaccine has greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine is this weird denial
*  that if you are recovered from COVID, you have extremely good immunity, both against infection
*  and actually strange. And that denial leads to people distrusting the message given by like the
*  CDC director, for instance, favor of the vaccine, right? Why would you deny a thing that's such an
*  obvious fact? It's like, you can look at the data and it's just, I mean, it just, just pops out at
*  you that people that are COVID recovered are not getting affected again at very high rates, much
*  lower rates. After these kinds of conversations, I'm sure after this very conversation, I often get
*  a number of messages from Joe Rogan and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire, I think
*  are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings. They also have a platform. And I believe in at
*  least in my mind about this COVID set of topics, they represent a group of people.
*  Each group has smart, thoughtful, well-intentioned human beings. And I don't know who is right,
*  but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit, those groups. And I think that's
*  those groups. And so the question I want to ask is like, what do you think about these
*  two groups and this kind of tension over the vaccine that sometimes it just keeps finding
*  different topics on which to focus on, like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,
*  whether there should be vaccine mandates or not, which seem to be often very kind of specific
*  policy kinds of questions that missed the bigger picture.
*  I think it's a symptom of the distrust that people have in public health. I think this kind of schism
*  over the vaccine does not happen in places where the public health authorities have been much more
*  trustworthy. So you don't see this vaccine has in Sweden, for instance. What's happened in the
*  United States is the vaccine has become first because of politics, but then also because of
*  scientific arrogance, this sort of touchstone issue and people line up on both sides of it.
*  And the different language you're hearing is structured around that. So before the election,
*  for instance, I did a testimony in the House on measurement of vaccine safety.
*  And I was invited by the Republicans. There were, I think, four other experts invited by
*  the Democrats or three other experts invited by the Democrats, each of whom had a lot of experience
*  in measuring vaccine safety. I was really surprised to hear them each doubt whether the
*  FDA would do a reasonable job in assessing vaccine safety, including by people who have long records
*  of working with the FDA. I mean, these are professionals, great scientists whose main
*  goal in life is to make sure that unsafe vaccines don't get released into the world.
*  And if they are, they get pulled. And they're casting down on the vaccine the ability to
*  track vaccine safety before the election. And then after the election, the rhetoric
*  switched on a dime, right? All of a sudden it's Republicans that are cast as if they're vaccine
*  hesitant. That kind of political shift, the public notices. If all it takes is an election
*  to change how people talk about the safety of the vaccine, well, we're not talking science anymore,
*  many people think, right? I think that created its hesitancy. The other thing I think,
*  the hesitancy, some politicians viewed it as a political opportunity to demonize people who
*  are hesitant. And that itself fueled hesitancy, right? If you're telling me I'm a rube that just
*  doesn't want the vaccine because I want everyone to die, well, I'm going to react really negatively.
*  And if you're talking down to me about my legitimate concerns about whether this vaccine
*  is safe to take, I've heard from women who are thinking about getting pregnant,
*  should I take the vaccine? I don't know. I mean, there are all kinds of questions,
*  legitimate questions that I think should have good data to answer that we don't necessarily
*  have good data to answer. So what do you do in the face of that? Well, one reaction is to pretend
*  like we know for a fact that it's safe when we don't have the data to know for a fact in
*  that particular group with that particular set of clinical circumstances, you know,
*  and that I think breeds hesitancy. People can detect that bullshit.
*  Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know. Yeah, you're going to be with humility.
*  Yeah, you're going to you'll end up with a better result.
*  Let me ask you about a recent conversation with the Pfizer CEO.
*  So this is part therapy session, part advice, because again, I really want
*  us to get through this together. And it feels like the division is a thing that
*  prevents us from getting through this together. And once again, just like with Francis Collins,
*  a lot of people wrote to me, words of support. And a lot of people wrote to me, words of criticism.
*  I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism. So some of the criticism had to do
*  with against the vaccine and those kinds of things that I have a better understanding of.
*  But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer. So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,
*  I'm trying to understand, am I so naive that I just don't see it? Because yes, there's corrupt
*  people and they they're greedy, they're flawed in all walks of life. But companies do quite an
*  incredible job of taking a good idea to scale and making some money with that idea. But they are the
*  ones that achieve scale on a good idea. I don't know. It's not obvious to me. I don't see
*  where the manipulation is. So the fear that people have, and I talked to Joe about this quite a bit,
*  I think this is a legitimate fear and a fear you should often have that money has influence,
*  disproportional influence, especially in politics. So the fear is that the policy
*  of the vaccine was connected to the fact that lots of money could be made by manufacturing the
*  vaccine. And I understand that. And it's actually quite a heck of a difficult task to alleviate
*  that concern. Like you really have to be a great man or woman or leader to convince people that
*  you're not full of shit, that you're not just playing a game on them. I don't know. It's a
*  difficult task. But at the same time, I really don't like the natural distrust every billionaire
*  distrust everybody who's trying to make money because it feels like under a capitalistic system,
*  at least the way to do a lot of good, like to do good at scale in the world is by being at least
*  in part motivated by profit. I mean, I share your ambivalence, right? So on the one hand,
*  you have a fantastic achievement, the discovery of the vaccine and then the manufacturing at scale
*  so that billions of people can take the vaccine in a relatively short time. That is a remarkable
*  achievement that could not have happened without companies like Pfizer. On the other hand, there
*  is this sort of corrupting influence of that money. Just to give you one example, there's
*  an enormous controversy over whether relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs can be used to treat
*  the disease. No company like Pfizer has any interest whatsoever in evaluating it. Even Merck,
*  I think it was Merck that had the patent on ivermectin now expired, has no interest at all
*  in checking to see if it works. Not only do they not have interest, they have a way of talking
*  about people who might have a little bit of interest. That's again, full of arrogance.
*  And that is what troubles me. It's back to the play of science. They're not a bit of curiosity.
*  One, the natural curiosity of a human being that should always be there and an open mindness.
*  And second, in the case of ivermectin and other things like that, you have to acknowledge that
*  there's a very large number of people who care about this topic. And this is a way to inspire
*  them to also play in the space of science, to inspire them with science. You can't just
*  dismiss everybody. You can't just dismiss people, period. Yeah. Well, I think here,
*  take ivermectin. There's actually a study funded by the NIH, by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH,
*  called Active 6, that's a randomized trial of ivermectin. It's due to be completed in March
*  2023. So normally, when you have private actors like these big drug companies that have no
*  interest in conducting some kind of scientific experiment that would have some public benefit,
*  it's the job of the government, and in this case, the NIH, to fund that kind of work.
*  The NIH has been incredibly slow in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs.
*  And it's been left to lots of other private activities of uneven quality. And hence,
*  that's why you have these big fights. Because the data are not solid, you're going to have these
*  big fights. Yeah. But also, okay, forget the process of science here, the studies, not enough
*  effort being put into the studies, just the way it's being communicated about. Yeah, no, like
*  horse paste. I mean, come on. The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,
*  they're taking ivermectin because they've heard good things about it, and they're sick,
*  and they're desperate. And just call it horse paste was just, that was terrible.
*  That was deeply irresponsible. My hope is grounded in the fact that young people see the
*  bullshit of this. Young PhD students, graduate students, young students in college, they see
*  the less than stellar way that our scientific leaders and our political leaders are behaving,
*  and then the new generation will not repeat the mistakes of the past. That is my hope. Because
*  that's the cool thing I see about young people is they're good at detecting bullshit, and they
*  don't want to be part of that. That's my hope in the space of science. Let me return to this idea
*  of the Great Barrington Declaration, return to the beginning. So what are the basics? Can you
*  describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is? What are some of the ideas in it? You mentioned
*  focus protection. What are your concerns about lockdowns? Just paint the picture of this early
*  proposal. Sure. So the Great Barrington Declaration, first, why is it called Great Barrington
*  Declaration? It's such a great name. I mean, it's such an epic name, but the reason why it's
*  called that is way less than epic. It was because the conference, which is organized by Martin
*  Kuhldorf, who was a professor at Harvard University by a statistician, he actually designed
*  the safety system, the statistical system that the FDA uses for tracking vaccine safety.
*  He and I had met previously just the summer before that summer, and he invited me to come
*  to this small conference where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta, who was a professor of
*  theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University. I jumped at the chance because I knew that Martin
*  and Sunetra were both smarter than me, and it would be fun to talk about what the right strategy
*  would be. On the drive in, I didn't know what the name of the town was, and I asked, they said it
*  was Great Barrington. I had it in the back of my head. Martin and I arrived a little early,
*  and we were writing an op-ed about some of the ideas, hopefully we'll get to talk about very soon,
*  about focus protection and the right strategy. When Sunetra arrived, we realized we'd actually
*  come basically to the same place about the right way to deal with the epidemic. I thought, well,
*  why don't we write something like the Port Huron Statement? That was what I had in the back of my
*  head. I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again? It was Great Barrington.
*  It's not Barrington, it's Great Barrington. Which is fantastic, right?
*  It's so over the top that it's perfect. It's literally like the Big Bang. There's something
*  about these over the top fun titles that just really deliver the power.
*  That's my main contribution with the title, the name Great Barrington Decor.
*  But yeah, so it was kind of a... The idea is actually, while the title is great,
*  and I think that it was written in a very stylish way, it's less than a page. You can go
*  look online and read it. It's written not for scientists, but for the general public,
*  so that people can understand the ideas really simply. But it is not actually a radical set of
*  ideas. It actually represents the old pandemic plans that we've used for a century, dealing with
*  other similar pandemics. And it's twofold. First, let me talk about the science it rests on, and
*  then I'll talk about the plan. The science actually, some of it we already talked about,
*  there's this massive age gradient in the risk of COVID infection. Older people face much higher
*  risk than younger people. The second bit of science is all... That's not controversial,
*  even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2, no matter what, everyone agrees on this age gradient.
*  The second bit of science is also not controversial. The lockdown-focused policies that we followed
*  have absolutely devastating consequences on the health of the population.
*  Let me just give you some examples. This was known in October of 2020, we wrote it. So
*  the UN was sounding alarms that there would be tens of millions of people who would starve
*  as a consequence of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns. And that's come to pass.
*  Hundreds of thousands of children in places like South Asia dead from starvation
*  as a consequence of lockdowns. The priorities like the treatment of
*  patients with tuberculosis in poor countries stopped because of lockdowns. Childhood vaccinations
*  of measles, mumps, rubella, DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus, all those standard
*  vaccination campaigns stopped. Tens of millions of children skipping these doses for diseases that
*  are actually deadly for them. Is there, just on a small tangent, is it well understood to you,
*  what are the mechanisms that stop all those things because of lockdowns? Is it some aspect of supply
*  chain? Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed? Is it because there's a disincentive
*  to go outside by people even when they deeply need help? It's all of the above. But a lot of
*  those efforts, especially those vaccination efforts, are funded and run by Western efforts.
*  GAVI is a, I think it's a Gates funded thing actually, that provides vaccines for millions
*  of kids worldwide. And those efforts were scaled back. Malaria prevention efforts. So in the
*  developing world, it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns. There was also direct effects.
*  Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted, there was an order that 10 million
*  migrant workers who live in big cities and they live hand to mouth, they buy coconuts, they sell
*  the coconuts with the money, they buy food for themselves and coconuts for the next day to sell,
*  walk back to their villages or go back to their villages overnight. So 10 million people walking
*  back to their villages or taking a train back, a thousand died en route, overcrowded trains,
*  dying essentially on the side of the road. I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.
*  And the lockdowns there, it's kind of like what's happened in the West as well, but it was so severe.
*  There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.
*  What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai, there were 70% seroprevalence in July or August
*  of 2020, whereas in the rest of Mumbai was 20%. So it was incredibly unequal. The lockdowns
*  protected the relatively well off and spread the disease among the poor. So that's in the
*  developing world. In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns were also quite bad.
*  So we talked already about isolation and depression. There was a study done in July of 2020
*  that found that one in four young adults seriously considered suicide. Now, suicide rates haven't
*  spiked up so much, but the depths of despair that would lead somebody to seriously consider suicide
*  itself should be a source of great concern in public health. Yeah, this is one of the troubling
*  things about measuring well-being is we're okay at measuring death and suicide. We're not so good
*  at measuring suffering. It's like people talk about maybe even Holladamore under Stalin or the
*  concentration camps with Hitler. We talk about deaths, but we don't talk about the suffering
*  over periods of years by people living in fear, by people starving, psychological trauma that
*  lasts a lifetime, all of those things. I mean, and just to get back to that point, we closed schools,
*  especially in blue states, we closed schools. Now, richer parents could send their kids to
*  private schools, many of which stayed open even in the blue states. They could get pods,
*  they could get tutors, but that's not true for poor and middle-class parents.
*  And as a result, what we did is we took away life opportunities for kids. We tried to teach
*  five-year-olds to read via Zoom in kindergarten. And the consequence actually, you think,
*  okay, we can just make it up, but it's really difficult to make that up. There's a literature
*  in health economics that shows that even relatively small disruptions in schooling
*  can have lifelong consequences, negative consequences for kids. So they end up growing
*  up poorer, they lead shorter lives and less healthy lives as a consequence. And that's what
*  the literature now shows is likely to happen with the interruptions of schooling that we had in the
*  United States. Many European countries actually managed to avoid this. There were in the early
*  days of the epidemic great indications that children first were not severely at risk from
*  COVID itself, nor are they super spreaders. Schools were not the source of community spread.
*  Communities spread the disease to schools, not the other way around.
*  We can talk about the scientific base of that if you'd like, but that was pretty well known
*  even in October. We closed hospitals in order to keep them available to COVID patients, but as a
*  result, women skipped breast cancer screening. As a result, they are showing up with late stage
*  breast cancer that should have been picked up last year. Men and women skipped colon cancer
*  screening, again, with later stage disease that should have been picked up last year with earlier
*  stage. For patients with diabetes, it's very important to have regular screening for blood
*  sugar levels and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement, and we skipped that. People stayed
*  home with heart attacks and died at home with heart attacks. You had this wide range of medical
*  and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored as a result of the lockdowns.
*  Plus, there's the economic pain. Like you said, whatever is a good term for the non-laptop class,
*  people would lose their jobs. Yes, there might be in the Western world support for them.
*  Financially, but the big loss there that is perhaps correlated with depression and suicide is
*  loss of meaning, loss of hope for the future, loss of kind of a sense of stability, all the
*  pride you have in being able to make money that allows you to pave your own way in the world,
*  and yes, just having less money than you're used to so your family, your kids are suffering,
*  all those kinds of things. Again, there's economics literature on this. On deaths of despair,
*  it was called. 2009, there was the Great Recession. It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from
*  drugs, suicidality, depression as a result of the job losses that happened during the Great
*  Recession. Well, that's happening again, like an enormous increase in drug overdoses. That's not
*  that's not an accident. That's a lockdown harm. Same thing with the job losses. The job losses,
*  by the way, are like, it's so interesting because the states that stayed open have had much, much
*  lower unemployment than the states that stayed closed. The labor force participation rates
*  declined by 3%. It's women that separated because they stayed home with their kids.
*  We've reversed a generation of women, improving women's participation in the labor force.
*  Do you think it has to do with the institutions that we mentioned that there was so much priority
*  given or so much power given to maybe NIH versus other civilian leaders? Or do people just not care
*  about the economic pain, the leaders? I mean, because to me, it was obvious. I mean, probably
*  it's just studying history. Whenever I listen to people on Twitter or on mainstream news or just
*  anything, I realized that's the very kind of top. The people that have a voice represent a tiny
*  selection of people. And so whenever there's hard times, I always kind of think about the quiet,
*  the voiceless, the quiet suffering of the tens of millions of the hundreds of millions.
*  Do political leaders not just give a damn? I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing
*  at the beginning of the pandemic, where if you brought up economic harms at all,
*  you were seen as callous. I had a reporter call me up almost at the very beginning of the epidemic,
*  asking me about a very particular phenomenon. He was anticipating a rise in child abuse because
*  children were going to be staying at home, child abuse is generally picked up at school.
*  And that actually happened. The reported child abuse dropped, but actual child abuse increased.
*  Because normally you pick up the child abuse at school and you have the intervention, right? So
*  yeah, so I was talking about like, well, there's going to be some economic harms and they're going
*  to have health consequences, but the economic harms matter. But he counseled me and I think
*  he had my best interest at heart. If you were to put that in the story, I would essentially be
*  canceled. Because the narrative that arose in March of 2020 is if you care about money at all,
*  you're evil and crass. You must only care about lives. The problem with that narrative is that
*  money, what we're talking about is actually lives of poor people, right? When you throw a hundred
*  million people around the world into poverty, you're going to see enormous harm to their health,
*  enormous increases in their mortality. It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that
*  in the context of this pandemic response. Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot that
*  there are so many other public health priorities as well that need our attention desperately.
*  And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco when I visited. I was thinking of moving there
*  for a startup. This is the thing I'm really afraid of, especially if I have any effect on the world
*  through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way. You mentioned the laptop class,
*  living in this world where you're only concerned about this particular class of people.
*  Perhaps early on in the pandemic, amongst the laptop class, there was a legitimate concern
*  for health. You're not sure how deadly this virus is. You're not sure who to listen to,
*  so there's a real concern. And then at a certain point when the data starts coming in,
*  you start becoming more and more detached from the data. You don't start caring less and less,
*  and you start just swimming in the space of narratives, like existing in the space of
*  narratives. And you have this narrative in San Francisco, in the laptop class, that you just are
*  very proud that you know the truth. You're the sole possessors of the truth. You congratulate
*  yourself on it, and you don't care what actually gigantic detrimental effect that has on society,
*  because you're mostly fine. I'm so terrified of that. Well, I think the antidote to that is
*  just to remember. You remember. Yeah. I don't think you remember where you came from, and remember
*  who you're doing this for. At the back of your head should always be, what's the purpose? Why am I
*  here? What's the purpose of this? If the purpose is simply self-aggrandizement, then you should
*  rethink, because it'll just end up being a hollow life. All of us will be forgotten in the end.
*  Focus protection. The idea, the policy, what is focus protection? Right. So I was saying that
*  there's two scientific bases, right? So one is this steep age gradient, and the second is the
*  existence of locked arms. Again, I think there's very little disagreement, and the scientific
*  community have both of those facts. If you put those facts together, the obvious policy is to
*  protect the people who are at the most severe risk from the disease itself. And that's the idea of
*  focus protection. That's the general principle of it. The actual implementation of it depends on
*  the living circumstances of the people that are at risk, the resources that are available in the
*  community, the technology that's available to do this. And so it's almost always going to be,
*  in fact, it'll always be a local thing, because it'll depend on all of those things which are
*  all local in nature. Right? So one very, very obvious thing in a country like ours, where so
*  many older people live in institutionalized settings and nursing home settings, and that's
*  where older, really vulnerable, chronically ill patients often live. And you know this disease
*  affects that group most commonly. It is absolutely vital to protect that group. We should have known
*  that in February 2020 from just from the Chinese data. And we should have thought about that group
*  as the key constraint in our policymaking. Instead, we thought about in February, March 2020,
*  as hospital beds as the key constraint. Hospital beds and ventilator shortages. And so we ran around
*  trying to address that constraint, like a linear programming problem. You figure out which
*  constraint's binding, and you address that one thing, and then you go on to the next one. Right?
*  If that's that one constraint, we said, okay, the constraint is hospital beds.
*  That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states to send COVID-infected patients who were
*  on the verge of, or looked like they were about to recover, back to nursing homes,
*  who then spread the disease all through there, because they wanted to preserve the hospital beds.
*  Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization, I love the way you frame this.
*  But those are kind of connected, right? If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable,
*  you will also have the effect of not hitting the ceiling of the available hospital beds.
*  That's the irony. If we protected the vulnerable, the vulnerable are the most likely to be
*  hospitalized. And so by protecting the vulnerable, we would also have addressed the shortage of
*  hospital beds more effectively. So that little shift in priority would have had a big impact.
*  Okay, but specifically, the idea is to, and we could talk about different ideas of how to actually
*  do this, but you basically do a lockdown or something like that on a very small set of people.
*  You may have to do that if its community spread is very high, but generally, I think
*  it would depend on, again, the living circumstances. So for instance, if you are in a, if you have,
*  here's a very simple idea that doesn't require a lockdown forced on them. I don't actually,
*  generally not in favor of that kind of forced lockdown, because you just won't get cooperation.
*  But what you could do is provide resources to that group of people. So imagine you live next door to
*  somebody, an older couple, and there's high community spread. Well, they have to go grocery
*  shopping. We did like some of these, some communities did these like senior only grocery hour,
*  right? But they have to still have to go out and they might get exposed in when they're
*  shopping amongst other seniors. Well, why not organized home delivery of groceries to them?
*  We did that for the laptop class, right? Or we can even just as a volunteer effort, you know,
*  the older people living next door, just call them up and say, can I help you get that go out
*  and go shopping for you? And so you would have potentially federal support of that kind of thing.
*  So these kinds of efforts. Identify where the vulnerable people live. It's really challenging
*  in multi-generational homes in LA County, for instance, there's a lot of
*  older people living together with younger people in relatively crowded there, there,
*  it's really quite a challenge. But there again, you can use resources. So if grandma
*  is worried that grandson has come home, but is potentially being exposed, grandson calls grandma,
*  says, I mean, I might've been in a party where I might do that, where COVID was grandma calls
*  public health, public health and says, okay, you can have this hotel room for a couple of days
*  until you check to 10, 10 turn negative. In case it wasn't clear, the idea of focused
*  protection is the people that are vulnerable, protect them. And everybody else goes on with
*  their lives, open up the economy, just do as it was before.
*  And there was still fear abroad. So there still would be some restrictions people would pose on
*  themselves. They probably would go to parties less. The grandsons probably wouldn't go so many
*  parties, right? There would be less participation in big gatherings. You may even say like big
*  gatherings in order to restrict community spread again. I'm not against any of that.
*  But you shouldn't be closing businesses. You shouldn't be closing churches and synagogues.
*  You shouldn't be forcing people to not go to school. You should not be shuttering businesses.
*  You should just allow society to go on. Some disease will spread. But as we've seen,
*  the lockdown didn't stop the disease from spreading anyways.
*  Right. So what do you make of the criticism that this idea, like all good ideas,
*  cannot actually be implemented in a heterogeneous society where there's a lot of people intermixing.
*  And once you open it up, people like the younger people will just forget that this is even existing
*  and they'll stop caring about the older people and mess up the whole thing. And the government
*  will not want to fund any kind of the great efforts you're talking about about food delivery.
*  And then the food delivery services will be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway?
*  Because it's not making me much money. And so therefore, all good ideas, it will collapse.
*  That might be true. I think it's always a risk with policy. But I think back to the moment,
*  we actually felt like we were in this together to some extent.
*  I think that that empathy that we had that was used to tell people to stay in and happily,
*  not go in happily, but like stay in to like wear a mask or to do all these things that
*  we thought would help other people could have been redirected to actually helping the people
*  most needed to be especially. I do remember March. So this is even way before Barrington,
*  all that kind of stuff. March, April, May, there was a feeling like if we all just work together,
*  yeah, we'll solve this. Right. And that may be started to when did that start breaking down?
*  I mean, the the unfortunately, the election is mixed into this. Yeah, that became politicized.
*  But I think it lasted quite a long time. I think into the summer, I think there was some some of
*  that sense. I don't know, they've obviously varied among different people. But, but I think that it's
*  true, it would have been challenging. It's also true that it's heterogeneous, exactly the way you
*  said. But what that means is you need a local response, a response. So like, like my vision of
*  a public health officer is someone that understands their community, not necessarily the nation at
*  large, but their community and then works within their community to figure out how to deploy the
*  resources that are available to do the kind of protection policies we're talking about. That's
*  that's what should have happened. Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts closing, making
*  sure businesses stay closed. Businesses that I mean, they're, you know, like hardware stores
*  that closed. What good did it closing a hardware store do for the spread of COVID? If it had an
*  effect on spread COVID spread, I mean, it's gonna be more checking to make sure that plexiglass was
*  put up everywhere, which now in retrospect turns out to probably made the disease worse.
*  You know, masking enforcement, so shaming around mask, I mean, a huge amount of effort on things
*  that were only tangentially related to focus protection. What if we turned our energy,
*  that enormous energy put into that instead into focus protection of the vulnerable. That's
*  essentially the conversation I was calling for. And it wasn't, I mean, I didn't think of it as
*  we had every single idea. I mean, we gave some concrete proposals and we got, but the criticism
*  we got was that those those concrete proposals weren't enough. And the answer to that I have is
*  that's true. They weren't enough. I wasn't thinking of them as enough. I was thinking that they would,
*  I wanted to involve an enormous number of people in local public health to help think about how to
*  do focus protection in their communities. The question that's interesting here is about the
*  future too. So COVID has very specific characteristics, like you mentioned about
*  the curve of the death rate based on the, like it seems like with COVID, it's a little bit easier
*  to actually identify a group of people that you need to protect. So other viruses may not be this
*  way. So might lockdown be a good idea, like hardcore lockdown for a future virus that's 10
*  times deadlier, but spreads at the same rate as COVID? Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine
*  a virus that's 10 times deadlier. What's the right response? I mean, I think it's always going to be
*  focus protection, but the group that needs the focus protection may change depending on the
*  biology of the virus, right? So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the U.S., the great, the
*  people at most risk were children. We didn't know really at the beginning there was this fecal oral
*  spread. And so we did all kinds of crazy things, including like spraying DDT in communities,
*  which was somehow supposed to get rid of polio. But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak,
*  they would close the school down. And that was the right thing to do because that group that needed
*  protection was children and the disease was spread, we thought, in schools. I don't think
*  there's a single formula that works, but there's a single principle that works.
*  It's hard to imagine a disease that's uniformly deadly across every group and every single person.
*  There's always going to be some group that's differentially
*  harmed. There's always going to be some group that's differentially protected. And that may
*  change over time, right? So like in this epidemic, as people got infected and recovered,
*  we now had a class of people that were pretty well protected against the disease.
*  Instead of ostracizing them because they don't want a vaccine, we should be allowing them to
*  work. I mean, we're having staffing shortages in hospitals now because we forgot that principle.
*  It's quite a bit of this technology problem. How much of it is a sociological problem?
*  How much of it is a technology problem? Where do you put the blame on why this didn't go so great?
*  And how it can go great in the beginning? Think about lockdowns. If we didn't have Zoom,
*  we wouldn't have lockdowns. There's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock down. We didn't have the
*  technology to replace work with this remote technology. So we had good lockdown technology
*  in Zoom. We didn't have good focus protection technology. Yeah. I mean, focus protection is
*  always going to be complicated, especially for something like this that spreads so easily. It's
*  going to be complicated. And I'm the last person to say it would have been perfect.
*  There would have been people that would have gotten sick, but they got sick anyways. The hope
*  was that if we suppress community spread low enough, we can protect the vulnerable. That was
*  the hope by lockdown. The reality was that only a certain class of people were able to benefit from
*  lockdown. The rest of society, we call them essential workers, had to keep working and they got sick.
*  And the disease kept spreading. It didn't actually have a substantial effect on community spread in
*  non-laptop class populations. And also we should probably expand the class of people we call
*  vulnerable to those who would suffer, who have the capacity to suffer, given the policies that
*  you're weighing. It's very disingenuous to call the vulnerable just the people. Obviously we had
*  the very specific meaning, but broadly speaking, vulnerable should include anybody who can suffer
*  based on the policies you take in response to a virus. That principle you just said is completely
*  agree with is something I think has been lost and unfortunately lost. So the policies themselves,
*  if they have harm, those are real and we shouldn't pretend like they're not and essentially
*  demonize the people that suffer them. A lot of times the depression that we've been talking about,
*  that's thought of as like not so important, but it is important. And especially the harm to the
*  people in poor countries, it's like being out of sight, out of mind in much of the rich parts of
*  the world. Once again, I've hoped that we seeing this, learning the lessons of history with the
*  communication tools we have now will learn this. It's like going to another country and bombing
*  targeted terrorist locations and there's going to be some civilians who die pretending that
*  the child who watches their dad die is not going to grow up, first of all, traumatized,
*  but second of all, potentially bring more hate to the world than the hate that you were allegedly
*  fighting in the first place. That's another sort of considering only one kind of harm and not the
*  full range of harms that are being caused by your policies. To a good return to focus protection,
*  we still should be following the policy now for COVID and we're not. So the vaccines,
*  there's a great shortage in vaccines. You wouldn't know it in the United States and the rich parts
*  of the world, but there's a great shortage of vaccines. We're not going to be able to vaccinate
*  the entire set of elderly at least or larger groups until late 2022. Huge numbers of
*  older people around the world in poor countries that have not had COVID recovered yet, so they're
*  still quite vulnerable, have not had the vaccine. And yet we're talking about vaccinating five-year-olds
*  who benefit, if at all, from the vaccines of just a very little bit because they face such a low risk
*  of harm from COVID. Well, something that's a little bit near and dear to our specific, the two of our
*  hearts. So you're at Stanford. So Stanford recently announced that they're going back to virtual,
*  at least for some period of time in response to the escalated, maybe you can clarify, but I think
*  it's in response to the escalated, how would they phrase it? It's related to Omicron.
*  And a few other universities are kind of like considering back and forth. In my perspective,
*  as somebody who loves in-person lectures, who sees the value of that to students, to young minds,
*  also looking at the data seems the risk aversion in university policies around this,
*  given how healthy the student population is, seems not well calibrated, let's put it this way. Also,
*  pathological. Pathological is one way to put it, given that, I believe, depending on the university,
*  but I think many universities require that the student body is vaccinated at this point. So
*  I think it's a big mistake by Stanford to do this. And I'd like to say that because I just hope MIT
*  doesn't... But what are your thoughts about Stanford? I agree with you. I completely agree
*  with you. I think we have failed in our mission to educate our students by this decision. And I think,
*  frankly, just more broadly, I think we failed generally over the course of the last year and
*  a half in living up to our educational mission. In-person teaching is vital. Now, I can understand
*  you have older faculty, the principle of focus protection says provide some alternative teaching
*  arrangements for them. That makes sense to me. From the kid's point of view, they're more harmed
*  by not getting the education we promised them than by COVID. So applying this principle of this focus
*  protection, let young professors teach in-person. This is before the vaccine. After the vaccine,
*  let everyone teach in-person. Yeah, this is the part I don't understand the discussion we're even
*  having because... Okay, let's leave focus protection aside here because that's a brilliant policy for
*  perhaps for the future when there's no vaccine. Now with the vaccine, I'm misunderstanding something
*  here because we're now in a space that's psychological. It's no longer about biology
*  because with the booster shots, which I believe MIT is now requiring before January,
*  with the booster shots, the data shows no matter how old you are, the risks are very low for
*  ending up in a hospital relative to all the other risks you face when you're older.
*  I don't understand. Can you explain the policy around closing a university,
*  but also just a policy about just being so scared still in the university setting?
*  I think the great universities have done great harm by modeling this kind of behavior.
*  Yes. To me, sorry to keep interrupting, but to me, the university should be
*  the beacon of great behavior, not the beacon of scared conservative, let's not mess up,
*  pathologically. Let's not make it pathological. Let's not make anybody angry.
*  It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.
*  Yes. I think the central problem is actually related to the central problem of COVID policy
*  more generally. The goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading rather than to reduce the
*  harm from the disease. If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading, the sad fact is we have
*  no technology to accomplish that. At this point, because it's already
*  deeply integrated into the human civilization. It's here forever. There's a serosurvey of
*  white-tailed deer in the US. It turns out 80% of white-tailed deer in the US have COVID antibodies.
*  Dogs get it, cats get it. There's almost certainly human animal transmission of it.
*  I mean, presumably, I've heard bats get it apparently. You have a situation where
*  you have this disease, it's here to stay. The vaccines don't stop the spread of it. The
*  lockdowns don't stop the spread of it. We have no technology to stop the spread of it.
*  We're burning the earth trying to do something that's impossible rather than
*  working on what's possible. Letting regular college happen, that's a great good. Universities are a
*  wonderful invention and it's contributed so much to society to decide to shut it down.
*  The universities should be fighting tooth and nail to not be shut down, not the other way around.
*  Whatever the mechanisms that results in the universities doing that, that's probably,
*  this is me talking, it probably has to do with certain incentives for the administration,
*  probably has to do with lawyers and legal kinds of things to avoid legal trouble. Once again,
*  it's when the administration has too much power and too much definition of what the policy is for
*  the university, that's when you get to trouble. The beauty, the power of the university should be
*  about the faculty and the students. Administration just gets in the way, get out of the way.
*  They can help organize things. They play some important role, but they need to remember what
*  the mission is. The mission is not safety. The mission, actually, universities should be dangerous
*  places for ideas and whatnot. What is the role of fear in a pandemic? We've been dancing around it.
*  Is it useful? Is it destructive? Or is there a complicated story here? Because they've taken
*  us back into January 2020, there was so much uncertainty. This could have been a pandemic that
*  is a black death, the bubonic plague. It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.
*  We don't know that. We're very new to this. It's been a while. We're rusty. There is some value to
*  fear so that you don't do the stupid thing. You don't just go on living.
*  Where I come from, I think it's almost entirely counterproductive. I think fear should never be
*  used as a tactic to manipulate human behavior by public health. The fear on the individual level,
*  that feeling of fear, you should be very hesitant about that feeling because it could be easily
*  manipulated by the powerful. Exactly. I think that fear is natural.
*  It's not something that you have to stoke to get when the facts on the ground suggest it.
*  In fact, the tendency for humans in the face of threats from infectious disease is to
*  exaggerate the fear in their own minds of being contaminated by the environment and by others.
*  That's just natural to humans. The role of public health is not necessarily to eradicate the fear.
*  Obviously, technological advances can help eradicate the fear, but it's really to help
*  manage that fear and help people put the incentives that come out of that to useful
*  things as opposed to harmful things. What's happened in this pandemic is that there's been
*  a deliberate policy to stoke the fear to help make people think that the disease is worse than
*  it actually is. In survey after survey, you see this. That's been incredibly damaging.
*  Young people have readily given away their willingness to participate in regular life
*  because, A, they fear COVID more than they ought and, B, they fear that they're going to
*  harm the vulnerable in their lives. You put those two together and you get this powerful demand for
*  lockdowns. You see this all over the world. Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand
*  for irrational policies. I would like to mention the flip side of that. I've been saddened to see
*  how much money there is to be made by the martyrs, the people, the conspiracy theorists,
*  that tell you, you should be afraid of the government. You should be afraid of the man.
*  It feels like fear is the problem. I think there's some guy that once said something about we should
*  fear fear itself. He was a president or something. I vaguely remember that.
*  So I'm worried about both sides here. I think the general principle is that should not be a
*  tool of public policy. Public policy and public health policy in particular should
*  attempt to address that fear. It's not that you should tell people lies. Of course not.
*  Tell people accurately what the risk is. Give people tools that have evidence that they can
*  address their risk with and level with people when we don't know. I think that is the right adult way
*  to deal with this pandemic from a public health point of view. That is not the policy we have
*  followed. Instead, public health has intentionally stoked the fear in order to gain compliance with
*  its edicts. I think the consequence of that is people distrust public health. What you're talking
*  about, the distrust of government, I think is partly a consequence of that. That movement,
*  which is much smaller once upon a time, is much larger now because of essentially people look at
*  what public health has done and say, they've lied to me a whole bunch of times and a whole bunch of
*  things is the general sense and their consequences of that. We're going to have to work in public
*  health for a long time to try to regain the trust of the public. Throughout all of this,
*  you've been inspiring to me, to a lot of people. You've been fearless, bold in these kinds of
*  challenging the policies and not in a martyr kind of way because you're walking
*  the line gracefully and beautifully, I would say. Looking at that, I think you're an inspiration
*  to a lot of young people, so I have to ask, what advice would you give them if they're thinking of
*  going into science, if they're thinking of having an impact in the world? What advice would you give
*  them about their career and maybe about their life, thinking about somebody in high school,
*  maybe in undergraduate college? I'd say a few things. One is, this is a wonderful profession.
*  You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many and do it by having fun, the kind of play
*  we're talking about. It's an absolute privilege to be able to work in this kind of area.
*  And to young people looking at the same, that have some gifts or desire for this area, I say,
*  please, go for it. So this area of science broadly.
*  Yeah. I mean, it could be, I don't have any gifts in AI, but like, it could be, or in health or in
*  medicine or whatever, whatever your gifts lie, develop them, work hard and develop them because
*  it's worth it. It's worth it, not just because you get some status, but because the journey is fun
*  and the result is improvements in the lives of so many. So I think that that is the encouragement
*  I give. I'd also say, if you're looking at this ugliness of this debate that's happened over the
*  pandemic, I'd say to young people, we need you to come in and help transform it. Many of the people
*  we've seen in this debate that behave poorly, I ask that you forgive them. I've done my best to try
*  because many of them are acting out of their own sense that they need to do good, but the mistake
*  they've made is in this arrogance and this power. But when you come in, remember that example as a
*  negative example. And so when you join the debate, you'll join it in a spirit of humility, in a
*  spirit of trying to learn while keeping that love that led you to enter the field in the first place.
*  And yeah, choose forgiveness versus derision. The people that you know have messed up,
*  give them a pass because that's how it feels like that's how improvement starts.
*  Honey, I've been thinking this is like, I told you I'm Christian, right? So God has given me
*  many opportunities to forgive people, learn to practice how to do that.
*  Gave you a gift.
*  It's a very humbling thing, I guess.
*  Is there a memory from when you were young that was very formative to you?
*  So you just gave advice to some young people. Is there something that stands out to you that
*  a decision you made, an event that happened that made you the man you are today?
*  I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment. I was born in India and moved when I was four.
*  My dad had eight brothers and sisters and my mom had four brothers and sisters. She grew up in the
*  slum in Calcutta. His dad died when he was young and he supported his family, his brothers and
*  sisters with university scholarship money. Came to the US and my dad worked in a McDonald's,
*  even though he was an electrical engineer, couldn't find a job in 1971. So he worked in
*  McDonald's. We lived in basically the housing port development in Cambridge, this middle building on
*  the 17th floor, this housing development. I think that was transformative for me. I didn't realize
*  so much at the time how that experience of being essentially poor, lower middle class,
*  what effect it had on my outlook.
*  You mentioned to me offline that you listened to a conversation that I had with my dad.
*  What impact did your dad have on your life? What memories do you have about him?
*  He was a rocket scientist, actually. He helped design rocket guidance systems. He died when I
*  was 20 and I still miss him to this day. I think that experience of seeing him sacrifice
*  himself for his family, a brilliant man, but in many ways frustrated with his opportunities in
*  the world, partly what led him to come to the US in the first place, that's had a transformative
*  effect on me. I wish I could tell him that looking back.
*  Do you think about your own mortality? Do you think about your death? Your dad is no longer with us.
*  You're the old wise sage that represents-
*  I've only worried about death once in this pandemic. Although I had two of my cousins
*  who's 73 and my uncle who's 74 die in India during the pandemic and I grieve them both from COVID.
*  The fear of COVID really hit me only really once during this. It wasn't for me.
*  I recognize it as irrational. On the eve of the Santa Clara County Ciro Prevalence Study,
*  it was a really interesting thing because so many people volunteered to help.
*  My daughter, who's 20, I guess she was 19 at the time, and my wife also volunteered to help with
*  various aspects of the study. So, the eve of the study, they were going to go out in public
*  and I didn't know what the death rate was because we hadn't done the study.
*  I suspected it was lower than people were saying, but I didn't know.
*  I knew about the age gradient because I'd seen the Chinese data and my daughter is young,
*  but my wife is my age and I didn't know the death rate. I couldn't sleep the night before.
*  What if I'm putting my daughter and my wife at risk because of some activity that I'm doing?
*  So, you're worried about the well-being of others when you look in the mirror?
*  If I die, I die. I'm Christian, so death is not the end for me, I believe. I don't particularly
*  worry about my own death, but I think we can't help but worry about the well-being of our loved
*  ones. So, from the perspective of God, then let me ask you, what do you think is the meaning of
*  this whole journey we're on? What do you think is the meaning of life? It's very simple. Love one
*  another. Treat your neighbor as yourself. It's love. As simple as that. Well, I'd love to see
*  a little bit more of that in this pandemic. It's an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.
*  I've seen some of the worst, but I think some of that is just good therapy. I'm hoping in the end,
*  what we have here is love. At the very least, make your dad proud with some incredible rockets
*  that we're launching. I think you'd get along well with my dad, Lex.
*  I definitely would. Thank you so much. This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay. You've been
*  an inspiration to so many people and keep fighting the good fight. Thank you so much for spending
*  your valuable time with me today. Thank you for having me here. Appreciate it.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jay Barakaria. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from Alice
*  Walker. The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
