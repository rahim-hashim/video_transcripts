# Robert F. Kennedy Jr: CIA, Power, Corruption, War, Freedom, and Meaning | Lex Fridman Podcast #388
**Lex Fridman:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPtBkw5uD-0)
*  It's not our business to change the Russian government. Anybody who thinks it's a good idea to
*  do regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible.
*  Vladimir Putin himself has said, we will not live in a world without Russia. It was clear when he
*  said that that he was talking about himself. He has his hand on a button.
*  That could bring Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job
*  to change that regime. And we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating
*  them as an enemy. Now we've pushed them into the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our
*  country. And by the way, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.
*  The following is a conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., candidate for the president of the
*  United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer, and author who has challenged
*  some of the world's most powerful corporations, seeking to hold them accountable for the harm
*  they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me, the most beautiful
*  and powerful in the history of human civilization. Science is our journey, our fight for uncovering
*  the laws of nature and leveraging them to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of
*  suffering in the world. Some of the greatest human beings I've ever met, including most of my good
*  friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science. But science cannot flourish without
*  epistemic humility, without debate, both in the pages of academic journals and in the public
*  square, in good faith, long-form conversations. Agree or disagree, I believe Robert's voice should
*  be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he
*  says without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process. At the same time,
*  dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial topics like the pandemic is equally,
*  if not more, dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen to Robert F. Kennedy
*  Jr., his arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation,
*  that people read and listen to Vincent Racanello from This Week in Virology, Dan Wilson, and
*  the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken in their disagreement
*  with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth
*  and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you. But we must
*  have the humility to hear it and to learn from it. This is the Lex Freeman Podcast. To support it,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Robert F. Kennedy
*  Jr. It's the 4th of July, Independence Day, so simple question, simple big question. What do you
*  love about this country, the United States of America? I would say, well, the United States of
*  America, I would say there are so many things that I love about the country, on the landscapes
*  and the waterways and the people, et cetera, but on the kind of the higher level. People argue about
*  whether we're an exemplary nation. And that term has been given a bad name, particularly by the
*  neocons, the actions of the neocons in recent decades who have turned that phrase into kind
*  of a justification for forcing people to adopt American systems or values at the barrel of a gun.
*  But my father and uncle used it in a very different way, and they were very proud of it.
*  I grew up very proud of this country because we were the exemplary nation in the United States of
*  America. I grew up very proud of this country because we were the exemplary nation in the
*  sense that we were an example of democracy all over the world. When we first launched our democracy
*  in 1780, we were the only democracy on earth. And by the Civil War, by 1865, there were six democracies.
*  Today, there's probably 190. And all of them in one way or another are modeled on the American
*  experience. And it's kind of extraordinary because our first contact with, our first serious and
*  contact with the European culture and continent was in 1608 when John Winthrop came over with his
*  Puritans in the Sloop Arpela. And Winthrop gave this famous speech where he said, this is going
*  to be a city on a hill. This is going to be an example for all the other nations in the world.
*  And he warned his fellow Puritans. They were sitting at this great expanse of land. He said,
*  we can't be seduced by the lure of real estate or by the carnal opportunities of this land. We have
*  to take this country as a gift from God and then turn it into an example for the rest of the world
*  of God's love, of God's will and wisdom. And then 200 years later, 250 years later,
*  they, a different generation, they were mainly deists. They were people who had a belief in God,
*  but not so much a love of particularly religious cosmologies. You know, the framers,
*  the constitution believed that we were creating something that would be replicated around the
*  world and that it was an example. In democracy, there would be this kind of wisdom from the
*  collective, you know, that, and the word wisdom means a knowledge of God's will. And that somehow
*  God would speak through the collective in a way that he or she could not speak through
*  through totalitarian regimes. And, you know, I think that that's something that even though
*  Winthrop was a white man and a Protestant, that every immigrant group who came after them,
*  I kind of adopted that belief. And I know my family, when, you know, my family came over,
*  all of my grandparents came over in 1848 during the potato famine. And they saw this country as
*  unique in history as something that, you know, that was part of kind of a broader spiritual
*  mission. And so I'd say that from a 30,000 foot level, that, you know, that's, I grew up
*  so proud of this country and believing that it was the greatest country in the world. And for those
*  reasons. Well, I immigrated to this country. And one of the things that really embodies America to
*  me is the ideal of freedom. Hunter Thompson said, freedom is something that dies unless it's used.
*  What does freedom mean to you? To me, freedom does not mean, you know, chaos. And it does not
*  mean anarchy. It means that it has to be accompanied by restraint if it's going to
*  live up to its promise and self-restraint. What it means is the capacity for
*  human beings to exercise and to fulfill their creative energies
*  unrestrained as much as possible by government. So this point that Hunter Thompson made is dies
*  unless it's used. Do you agree with that? Yeah, I do agree with that. And I think, you know,
*  he was not unique in saying that, you know, Thomas Jefferson said that the tree of liberty has to be
*  had be watered with the blood of each generation. And what he meant by that is that it's you can't
*  live off, we can't live off the laurels of the American Revolution. That, you know, we had a
*  group, we had a generation where between 25,000 and 70,000 Americans died. They gave their lives,
*  they gave their livelihoods, they gave their status, they gave their property, and they put
*  it all on the line to give us our Bill of Rights. And that, but those Bill of Rights, the moment that
*  we signed them, there were forces within our society that began trying to chip away at them.
*  And that, you know, happens in every generation and it is the obligation of every generation
*  to safeguard and protect those freedoms. The blood of each generation. You mentioned your
*  interests, your admiration of Albert Camus, of Stoicism, perhaps your interest in existentialism.
*  Camus said, I believe in myth of Sisyphus, the only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so
*  absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. What do you think he means by that?
*  I suppose the way that Camus viewed the world and the way that the Stoics did and a lot of the
*  existentialists was that it was so absurd and that the problems and the tasks that were given
*  just to live a life are so insurmountable that the only way that we can kind of get back to the gods
*  for giving us this, you know, this impossible task of living life was to embrace it and to enjoy it
*  and to do our best at it. I mean, to me, I, you know, I read Camus and particularly in the myth
*  of Sisyphus as a kind of a parable that and it's the same lesson that I think he writes about in
*  the plague where we're all given these insurmountable tasks in our lives, but that by doing our duty,
*  by being of service to others, we can bring meaning to a meaningless chaos and we can bring
*  order to the universe. And, you know, Sisyphus was kind of the iconic hero of the Stoics
*  and he was a man because he did something good, he delivered a gift to humanity.
*  He angered the gods and they condemned him to push a rock up the hill every day and then it would
*  down, when he got to the top, it would roll down and he'd spend the night going back down the hill
*  to collect it and then rolling it back up the hill again. And the task was absurd, it was
*  insurmountable, he could never win. But the last line of that book is one of the great lines, which
*  is something to the extent that, you know, I can picture Sisyphus smiling because Camus' belief was
*  that even though his task was insurmountable, that he was a happy man. And he was a happy man
*  because he put his shoulder to the stone. He took his duty, he embraced the task and the absurdity
*  of life and he pushed the stone up the hill. And that if we do that and if we find ways of being
*  service to others, that is the ultimate, that's the key to the lock, that's the solution to the
*  puzzle. Each individual person in that way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning to
*  this whole messy thing. And we can bring meaning not only to our own lives, but we can bring meaning
*  to the universe as well, we can bring some kind of order to life. And, you know, that those,
*  the embrace of those tasks and the commitment to service resonates out from us to the rest of
*  humanity in some way. So you mentioned The Plague by Camus. There's a lot of different ways to read
*  that book, but one of them, especially given how it was written, is that The Plague symbolizes Nazi
*  Germany and the Hitler regime. What do you learn about human nature
*  from a figure like Adolf Hitler, that he's able to captivate the minds of millions,
*  rise to power and take on pulling the whole world into a global war?
*  I was born nine years after the end of World War II and I grew up in a generation that was,
*  with my parents who were fixated on that, on what happened. And my father, at that time,
*  the resolution in the minds of most Americans and I think people around the world is that there had
*  been something wrong with the German people, that the Germans had been particularly susceptible to
*  this kind of demagoguery and to following a powerful leader and to industrializing cruelty
*  and murder. And my father always differed with that. My father said, this is not a German problem.
*  This could happen to all of us. We're all just inches away from barbarity and the thing that
*  keeps us safe in this country are the institutions of our democracy, our constitution.
*  It's not our nature. Our nature has to be restrained and that comes through self-restraint,
*  but also the beauty of our country is that we devise these institutions that are designed to
*  allow us to flourish, but at the same time, not to give us enough freedom to flourish, but also
*  create enough order to keep us from collapsing into barbarity.
*  One of the other things that my father talked about from when I was little, he would ask us
*  this question. If you were the family and Anne Frank came to your door and asked you to hide her,
*  would you be one of the people who hid her, at risk your own life, or would you be one of the people
*  who turned her in? And of course, we would all say, well, of course we would hide Anne Frank and take
*  the risk. But that's been something, kind of a lesson and a challenge that has always been near
*  the forefront of my mind that if a totalitarian system ever occurs in the United States, which
*  my father thought was quite possible, he was conscious about how fragile democracy actually is,
*  that would I be one of the ones who would resist the totalitarianism, or would I be one of the
*  people who went along with it? Would I be one of the people who was at the train station in Krakow
*  or even Berlin and saw people being shipped off to camps and just put my head down and pretend I
*  didn't see it because talking about it would be destructive to my career and maybe my freedom and
*  even my life. So, you know, that has been a challenge that my father gave to me and all of
*  my brothers and sisters. And it's something that I've never forgotten. A lot of us would like to
*  believe we would resist in that situation, but the reality is most of us wouldn't. And that's a good
*  thing to think about, that human nature is such that we're selfish even when there's an atrocity
*  going on all around us. And we also, you know, we have the capacity to deceive ourselves
*  and all of us tend to kind of judge ourselves by our intentions and our actions.
*  What have you learned about life from your father, Robert F. Kennedy? First of all,
*  I'll say this about my uncle because, you know, I'm going to apply that question to my uncle and
*  my father. My uncle was asked when he first met Jackie Bouvier, who later became Jackie Kennedy.
*  She was a reporter for a newspaper and she had a kind of column where she'd do these kind of
*  pithy interviews with both famous people and kind of men in the street interviews.
*  And she was interviewing him and she asked him what he believed his best quality was,
*  his strongest virtue. And she thought that he would say courage because
*  he had been a war hero. He was the only president who, and this one he was senator by the way,
*  who received the Purple Heart. And, you know, he had a very kind of famous story of him as a hero
*  in World War II. And then he had come home and he had written a book on moral courage among
*  American politicians and won the Pulitzer Prize. That book profiles in courage, which was a series
*  of incidents where American political leaders made decisions to embrace principle, even though
*  their careers were at stake and in most cases were destroyed by their choice.
*  She thought he was going to say courage, but he didn't. He said curiosity. And I think,
*  you know, looking back at his life, that the best, that that was true. And that was the quality that
*  allowed him to put himself in the shoes of his adversaries. And he always said that if you,
*  the only way that we're going to have peace is if we're able to put ourselves in the shoes of our
*  adversaries, understand their behavior and their context, that context. And that's why he was able
*  to, you know, during the, he was able to resist the intelligence apparatus and the military
*  during the Bay of Pigs when they said, you've got to send in the Essex, the aircraft carrier.
*  And he said, no, even though he'd only been in two months in office, he was able to stand up to them
*  because he was able to put himself in the shoes of both Castro and Khrushchev and understand
*  there's got to be another solution to this. And then during the Cuban missile crisis,
*  he was able to do it. The narrative was, okay, Khrushchev acted in a way as an aggressor to put
*  missiles in our hemisphere. How dare he do that? And Jack and my father were able to say, well,
*  wait a minute, he's doing that because we put missiles in Turkey and Italy that were right on,
*  you know, the Turkish ones right on the Russian border. And they then made a secret deal with
*  Delbran and with Ambassador Delbran and, you know, with Khrushchev to remove the missiles in Turkey.
*  If he moved the Jupiter missiles from Turkey, so long as Khrushchev removed them from
*  Cuba, there were 13 men on the executive, on the end, what they call the Ankon Committee,
*  which was the group of people who were deciding, you know, what the action was,
*  what they were going to do to end the Cuban missile crisis. And virtually,
*  and of those men, 11 of them wanted to invade and wanted to bomb and invade.
*  And it was Jack and then later on my father and Bob McNamara, who were the only people who were
*  with him. But because he was able to see the world from Khrushchev's point of view, he believed that
*  there was another solution. And then he also had the moral courage. So my father, you know, to get
*  back to your question, famously said that moral courage is the most important quality and it's
*  more rare than courage on the football field or courage in battle than physical courage.
*  It's much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important quality in a human being.
*  And you think that kind of empathy that you referred to, that requires moral courage?
*  It certainly requires moral courage to act on it, you know, and particularly, you know, in,
*  you know, anytime that a nation is at war, there's kind of a momentum or an inertia that says,
*  okay, let's not look at this from the other person's point of view.
*  And that's the time we really need to do that.
*  Well, if we can apply that style of empathy, style of curiosity to the current war in Ukraine,
*  what is your understanding of why Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022?
*  Vladimir Putin could have avoided the war in the Ukraine. His invasion was illegal. It was
*  unnecessary and it was brutal. But I think it's important for us to move beyond these kind of
*  comic book depictions of this insane, avaricious Russian leader who wants to restore the Soviet
*  Empire and that that's why, and it was, and who made it an un-privoked invasion of the Ukraine.
*  He was provoked and we were provoking him and we were provoking him for, since 1997.
*  And it's not just me that's saying that. I mean, when, and before Putin ever came in,
*  we were provoking Russians in this way unnecessarily. And to go back that time in 1992,
*  when the Russians moved out of, when the Soviet Union was collapsing,
*  the Russians moved out of East Germany and they did that, which was a huge concession to them.
*  They had 400,000 troops in East Germany at that time and they were facing NATO troops on the
*  other side of the wall. Gorbachev made this huge concession where he said to George Bush,
*  I'm going to move all of our troops out and you can then reunify Germany under NATO, which was a
*  hostile army to the, to the Soviet, it was created to, you know, with hostile intent toward the Soviet
*  Union. And he said, you can take Germany, but I want your promise that you will not move NATO to
*  the East. And James Baker, who was the secretary of state famously said, I will not move NATO,
*  we will not move NATO one inch to the East. So then five years later in 1997,
*  Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was kind of the father of the neocons, who was a Democrat at that time,
*  served in the Carter administration. He said, he published a paper, a blueprint for moving NATO right
*  up to the Russian border, a thousand miles to the East and taking over 14 nations.
*  And at that time, George Kennan, who was the kind of the deity of American diplomats, he was
*  probably arguably the most important diplomat in American history. He was the architect of the
*  containment policy during World War II. And he said, this is insane and it's unnecessary.
*  And if you do this, it's going to provoke the Russians to a violent response. And we should be
*  making friends with the Russians. They lost the Cold War. We should be treating them the way that
*  we treated our adversaries after World War II, like with a Marshall Plan to try to help them
*  incorporate into Europe and to be part of the brotherhood of, you know, of man and of Western
*  nations. We shouldn't continue to be treating them as an enemy and particularly surrounding them at
*  their borders. William Perry, who was then the secretary of defense under Bill Clinton threatened
*  to resign. He was so upset by this plan to move NATO to the East. And William Burns, who was then
*  the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, who's now at this moment, the head of the CIA said at that
*  time, the same thing. If you do this, it is going to provoke the Russians toward a military response.
*  And we moved all around Russia. We moved to 14 nations, a thousand miles to the East,
*  and we put Aegis missile systems in two nations, Romania and Poland. So we did what, you know,
*  what the Russians had done to us in 1962 that would have provoked an invasion of Cuba.
*  We put those missile systems back there and then we walk away unilaterally,
*  walk away from the two nuclear missile treaties, the intermediate nuclear missile
*  treaties that we had with Russia. Neither of us would put those missile systems on the borders.
*  We walk away from that and we put Aegis missile systems, which are nuclear capable. They can
*  carry the Tomahawk missiles, which have nuclear warheads. So the last country that they didn't
*  take was the Ukraine. And the Russians said, and in fact, Bill Perry said this,
*  or William Byrne said it, so now the head of the CIA, it is a red line. If we go into,
*  if we bring NATO into Ukraine, that is a red line for the Russians. They cannot live with it. They
*  cannot live with it. Russia has been invaded three times through the Ukraine. The last time it was
*  invaded, we killed, or the Germans killed one out of every seven Russians. They destroyed, my uncle
*  described what happened to Russia in his famous American university speech in 1963, 60 years ago,
*  this month, or last month, 60 years ago in June, June 10th, 1963. He told that speech was telling
*  American people, put yourself in the shoes of the Russians. We need to do that if we're going to
*  make peace. And he said, all of us have been taught that we won the war, but we didn't win the war.
*  The Russians, if anybody won the war against Hitler, it was the Russians. Their country was
*  destroyed. All of their cities, and he said, imagine if all of the cities on the East Coast
*  of Chicago were reduced to rubble and all of the fields burned, all of the forests burned. That's
*  what happened to Russia. That's what they gave so that we could get rid of Adolf Hitler.
*  And he had them put themselves in their position. And today there's none of that happening. We have
*  refused repeatedly to talk to the Russians. We've broken up two treaties, the Minsk agreements,
*  which the Russians were willing to sign. And they said, we will stay. The Russians didn't want the
*  Ukraine. They showed that when the Donbas region voted 90 to 10 to leave and go to Russia, Putin
*  said, no, we want Ukraine to stay intact, but we want you to sign a Minsk Accords. The Russians
*  were very worried because of the US involvement in the coup in Ukraine in 2014. And then the
*  oppression and the killing of 14,000 ethnic Russians. And Russia hasn't had the same way
*  that if Mexico would ageist missile systems from China or Russia on our border and then killed 14,000
*  expats American, we would go in there. Oh, he does have a national security
*  interest in the Ukraine. He has an interest in protecting the Russian speaking people of the
*  Ukraine. Yeah, I think Russians and the Minsk Accords did that. It left Ukraine as part of Russia.
*  It left them as a semi-autonomous region that could continue to use their own language,
*  which is essentially banned by the coup, by the government we put in in 2014.
*  And we sabotaged that agreement. And we now know in April of 2022, Zelensky and Putin had
*  inked a deal already to another peace agreement. And that the United States sent Boris Johnson,
*  the neocons in the White House sent Boris Johnson over to the Ukraine to sabotage that agreement. So
*  what do I think? I think this is a proxy war. I think this is a war that the neocons in the
*  White House wanted. They've said for two decades they wanted this war and that they wanted to use
*  Ukraine as a pawn in a proxy war between United States and Russia, the same as we used Afghanistan.
*  And in fact, they say it, this is the model. Let's use the Afghanistan model. That was said
*  again and again, and to get the Russians to overextend their troops and then fight them
*  using local fighters and US weapons. And when President Biden was asked why are we in the
*  Ukraine, he was honest. He says to depose Vladimir Putin, regime change for Vladimir Putin. And when
*  his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, in April, 2022 was asked, you know, why are we there? He said
*  to degrade the Russian's capacity to fight anywhere, to exhaust the Russian army and degrade
*  its capacity to fight elsewhere in the world. That's not a humanitarian mission. That's not
*  what we were told. We were told this was an unprovoked invasion, but, and that we're there
*  to bring a humanitarian relief to the Ukrainians. But that is the opposite. That is a war of
*  attrition that is designed to chew up, to turn this little nation into an abattoir of death
*  for the flower of Ukrainian youth in order to advance a geopolitical ambition of certain
*  people within the White House. And, you know, I think that's wrong. We should be talking to
*  the Russians the way that, you know, Nixon talked to Brezhnev, the way that Bush talked to Gorbachev,
*  the way that my uncle talked to Khrushchev. We need to be talking with the Russians. We should
*  end negotiating. And we need to be looking about how do we end this and preserve peace in Europe?
*  LW – Would you, as president, sit down and have a conversation with Vladimir Putin
*  and Vladimir Zelensky separately and together to negotiate peace?
*  KH – Absolutely.
*  LW – What about Vladimir Putin? He's been in power since 2000. So as the old adage goes,
*  power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Do you think he has been corrupted
*  by being in power for so long? If you think of the man, if you look at his mind…
*  KH – Listen, I don't know exactly. I can't say because I just, I don't know enough about
*  him or about, you know, the evidence that I've seen is that he is homicidal. He kills his enemies
*  or poisons them. And, you know, the reaction I've seen to that, to hit those accusations from him
*  have not been to deny that, but to kind of laugh it off. I think he's a dangerous man and that,
*  of course, you know, there's probably corruption in his regime. But having said that,
*  it's not our business to change the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a good
*  idea to do regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do,
*  is, I think, irresponsible. And, you know, Vladimir Putin himself has said,
*  you know, we will not live in a world without Russia. And it was clear when he said that,
*  that he was talking about himself. And he has his hand on a button that could bring, you know,
*  Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change
*  that regime. And we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating them as
*  an enemy. Now we've pushed them into the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country.
*  And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.
*  Now, you know, if you believe that the polls that are coming out of Russia, they show him,
*  you know, the most recent polls that I've seen show him with an 89% popularity that people
*  in Russia support the war in Ukraine. And they support him as an individual.
*  And I understand there's problems with polling and, you know, you don't know what to believe.
*  But the polls consistently show that. And, you know, it's not America's business to be the
*  policeman of the world and to be changing regimes in the world. That's illegal. We shouldn't be
*  breaking international laws. You know, we should actually be looking for ways to improve relationships
*  with Russia, not to, you know, not to destroy Russia, not to destroy and not to choose its
*  leadership for them. That's up to the Russian people, not us.
*  So step one is to sit down and empathize with the leaders of both nations to understand
*  their history, their concerns, their hopes, just to open the door for conversation so they're not
*  back to the corner. And I think the U.S. can play a really important role. And a U.S. president can
*  play a really important role by reassuring the Russians that we're not going to consider them
*  an enemy anymore, that we want to be friends. And it doesn't mean that you have to let down
*  your guard completely. The way that you do it, which was the way President Kennedy did it,
*  is you do it one step at a time. You take baby steps. We do a unilateral move
*  to reduce our, you know, our hostility and aggression and see if the Russians reciprocate.
*  And that's the way that we should be doing it. And, you know, we should be easing our way
*  into a positive relationship with Russia. We have a lot in common with Russia,
*  and we should be friends with Russia and with the Russian people. And, you know,
*  apparently there's been 350,000 Ukrainians who have died, at least in this war. And there's
*  probably been 60 or 80,000 Russians, and that should not give us any joy. It should not give
*  us any, you know, I saw Lindsey Graham on TV saying, you know, anything we can,
*  something to the extent that anything we can do to kill Russians is a good use of our money.
*  That it is not, you know, those are somebody's children. They're, you know, we should have
*  compassion for them. This war is an unnecessary war. We should settle it through negotiation,
*  through diplomacy, through statecraft, and not through weapons.
*  Do you think this war can come to an end purely through military operations?
*  No, I mean, I don't think there's any way in the world that the Ukrainians can be the Russians.
*  I don't think there's any appetite in Europe. I think Europe is now, you know,
*  in having severe problems in Germany, Italy, France. You're seeing these riots. There's
*  internal problems in those countries. There is no appetite in Europe for sending men to die
*  in Ukraine. And the Ukrainians do not have anybody left. The Ukrainians are using press gangs to,
*  you know, to fill the ranks of their armies. Men, military age men, are trying as hard as
*  they can to get out of the Ukraine right now, to avoid going to the front. The front, you know,
*  the Russians apparently have been killing Ukrainians at a 7 to 1 ratio. My son fought
*  over there and he told me, you know, he had firefights with the Russians, mainly at night,
*  but he said most of the battles were artillery wars during the day. And the Russians now outgun
*  outgun the NATO forces 10 to 1 in artillery. Oh, they're killing at a horrendous rate. Now,
*  you know, my interpretation of what's happened so far is that Putin actually went in early on
*  with a small force because he expected to meet somebody on the other end of a negotiating table
*  that once he went in. And when that didn't happen, they did not have a large enough force
*  to be able to mount an offensive. And so they've been building up that force up to now,
*  and they now have that force. And even against this small original force, the Ukrainians have been
*  helpless. All of their offenses have died. They've now killed, you know, the head of the
*  Ukrainian Special Forces, which was probably arguably by many accounts, the best elite
*  military unit in all of Europe. The commandant, the commander of that special forces group
*  gave a speech about four months ago saying that 86% of his men are dead or wounded and will cannot
*  return to the front. He cannot rebuild that force. And, you know, the troops that are now headed,
*  that are now filling the gaps of all those 350,000 men who have been lost
*  are scantily trained and they're arriving green at the front. Many of them do not want to be there.
*  Many of them are giving up and going over the Russian side. We've seen this again and again,
*  including platoon size groups that are defecting to the Russians.
*  And I don't think it's possible to win. And anybody, you know, I saw, of course, I've studied
*  World War II history exhaustively, but I saw a, there's a new, I think it's a Netflix series of
*  documentaries that I highly recommend to people. They're colorized versions of the black and white
*  films from the battles of World War II, but it's all the battles of World War II. So I watched
*  Stalingrad the other night and, you know, the willingness of the Russians to fight on against
*  any kind of allies and to make huge sacrifices of Russians, the Russians themselves who were making
*  the sacrifice with their lives, the willingness of them to do that for their motherland is almost
*  inexhaustible. It is incomprehensible to think that Ukraine can beat Russia in a war. It would be like
*  Mexico beating the United States. It's just, it's impossible to think that it can happen. And, you
*  know, Russia has deployed a tiny, tiny fraction of its military so far. And, you know, now it has China
*  with its mass production capacity supporting its war effort. It's just, it's a hopeless situation
*  and we've been lied to. You know, we're the press in our country and our government are just,
*  are just, you know, promoting this lie that the Ukrainians are about to win and that everything's
*  going great and that Putin's on the run and there's all this wishful thinking because of the
*  the Wagner group, you know, the, the pregogian and the Wagner group that this was an internal coup
*  and it showed dissent and weakness of Putin and none of that is true. That was a, that
*  insurgency, which wasn't even an insurgency, only got 4,000 of his men to follow, an amount of 20,000
*  and they were quickly stopped and nobody in the Russian military, the oligarchy, the political
*  system, nobody supported it, you know, and by we're being told, oh yeah, it's the beginning
*  at the end for Putin. He's weakened, he's wounded, he's on his way out and all of these things are
*  just lies that we are being fed. So to push back on a small aspect of this, you kind of implied,
*  so I've traveled to Ukraine and one thing that I should say, similar to the Battle of Stalingrad,
*  it is just not, it is not only the Russians that fight to the end. I think Ukraine is a very,
*  to fight to the end and the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody, this was a year ago
*  in August with Khursan, everybody was proud to fight and die for their country and there's some
*  aspect where this war unified the people to get, gave them a reason and an understanding that this
*  is what it means to be Ukrainian and I will fight to the death to defend this land.
*  Yeah, I, you know, I would agree with that and I should have said that myself at the beginning,
*  that's one of the reasons my son went over there to fight because he was inspired by the valor of
*  the Ukrainian people and this extraordinary willingness of them and I think Putin thought
*  it would be much easier to sweep into Ukraine and he found a stone wall of Ukrainians where they're
*  ready to put their lives and their bodies on the line. But that to me makes the whole episode even
*  more tragic is that, you know, I don't believe, I think that the US role in this
*  has been, you know, that there were many opportunities to settle this war and the
*  Ukrainians wanted to settle it. Vladimir Zelenskyy when he ran in 2019, here's a guy who's a comedian,
*  he's a, he's an actor. He had no political experience and yet he won this election with
*  70% of the vote. Why? He won on a peace platform. And he won promising to sign the Minsk Accords
*  and yet something happened when he got in there that made him suddenly pivot and, you know, I think
*  it's a good guess what happened. I think he was, you know, he came under threat by
*  ultra-nationalist nationalists within his own administration
*  and the insistence of neocons like Victoria Nuland in the White House that, you know,
*  we don't want peace with Putin, we want a war. Do you worry about nuclear war? Yeah, I worry about
*  it. It seems like a silly question but it's not. It's a serious question. Well, the reason it's not,
*  you know, the reason it might, it's not, it's just because people seem to be in this kind of
*  dream state about that it'll never happen. And yet, you know, we're, it can happen very easily and
*  it can happen at any time. And, you know, if we push the Russians too far, you know, I don't doubt
*  that Putin, if he felt like his regime was or his nation was in danger, that the United States was
*  going to be able to place, you know, a quizzling on, you know, into the Kremlin that he would use
*  nuclear, you know, torpedoes. And, you know, these strategic weapons that they have and that could be
*  once you do that, nobody controls the trajectory. By the way, you know, I have very strong memories
*  of the Cuban Missile Crisis and those 13 days when we came closer to nuclear war, you know,
*  and particularly I think it was when the U-2 got shut down over Cuba, you know, and nobody in this
*  country, there's a lot of people in Washington, D.C. who at that point thought that they very
*  well may wake up dead, that the world may end at night. 30 million Americans killed, 130 million
*  Russians. This is what our military brass want. If they saw a war with Russia, a nuclear exchange
*  with Russia as not only inevitable, but also desirable because they wanted to do it now,
*  oh, we still had a superiority.
*  Can you actually go through the feelings you've had about the Cuban Missile Crisis? Like what,
*  what are your memories of it? What are some interests?
*  You know, in the middle, I was going to school in Washington, D.C. to Sidwell, or to
*  Our Lady of Victory, which is in Washington, D.C. So we were, I lived in Virginia across the
*  Potomac and we would cross the bridge every day into D.C. And during the crisis, U.S. Marshals
*  came to my house to take us, I think around day eight. My father was spending the night at the
*  White House. He wasn't coming home. He was staying with the EXCOMM committee and sleeping there. And
*  they were up, you know, 24 hours a day. They were debating and trying to figure out what was happening.
*  And, but we had U.S. Marshals come to our house to take us down. They were going to take us down to
*  White Sulphur Springs in southern Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountains where there was a,
*  there was an underground city, essentially a bunker that was like a city. And apparently it had
*  McDonald's in it and a lot of other, you know, it had, it was a full city for the U.S. government
*  and their families. U.S. Marshals came to our house to take us down there. And I was very excited
*  about doing that. And this was at a time, you know, when we were doing the drills, we were doing the
*  duck and cover drills once a week at our school, where they would tell you if they, you know, when
*  the alarms go off, then you put your head onto the table. You take the, remove the sharps from your
*  desk, put them inside your desk. You put your head onto the table and you wait. And the initial blast
*  will take the windows out of the school. And then we all stand up and file in an orderly fashion
*  into the basement where we're going to be for the next six or eight months or whatever.
*  But in the basement where, you know, we went occasionally in those corridors,
*  we're lined with freeze-dried food canisters up to the ceiling from floor to ceiling. So people were,
*  you know, we were all preparing for this. And it was, you know, Bob McNamara, who was my,
*  was a friend of mine and, you know, was my father, one of my father's closest friends,
*  the secretary of defense. He later called it mass psychosis. And my father deeply
*  regretted participating in the bomb shelter program because he said it was part of a,
*  you know, a psychological, a psyop trick to treat them, to teach Americans that nuclear war was
*  acceptable, that it was survivable. My father, anyway, when the marshals came to our house,
*  take me and my brother Joe away. And we were the ones who were home at that time. My father
*  called and he talked to us on the phone and he said, I don't want you going down there because
*  if you disappear from school, people are going to panic. And I need you to be a good soldier
*  and go to school. And he said something to me during that period, which was that if the
*  nuclear war happened, it would be better to be among the dead than the living, which I did not
*  believe. Okay. I mean, I had already prepared myself for the, you know, for the dystopian future
*  and I knew I could, I spent every day in the woods. I knew that I could survive by catching
*  crawfish and, you know, cooking mud puppies and do whatever I had to do. But I felt like, okay,
*  I can handle this. And I really wanted to see the set up down in, you know, this underground city.
*  But anyway, that was, you know, part of it for me. My father was away and, you know, the last days
*  of it, my father got this idea because Khrushchev had sent two letters. He sent one letter that was
*  conciliatory. And then he sent a letter that after his joint chiefs and the warmongers around him
*  to solve that letter and they disapproved of it. They sent another letter that was extremely
*  belligerent. And my father had the idea, let's just pretend we didn't get the second letter and
*  reply to the first one. And then he went down to Dobrynin and who was, he met Dobrynin in the
*  justice department and Dobrynin was the Soviet ambassador. And they, you know, they proposed
*  this settlement, which was a secret settlement. Khrushchev would withdraw the missiles from Cuba.
*  Khrushchev had put the missiles in Cuba because we had put missiles, you know, nuclear missiles in
*  Turkey and Italy. And my uncle's secret deal was that if he, if Khrushchev removed the missiles from
*  Cuba within six months, he would get rid of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey. But if Khrushchev told
*  anybody about the deal, it was off. So if news got out about that secret deal, it was off.
*  That was the actual deal. And Khrushchev complied with it and then my uncle complied with it.
*  How much of that part of human history turned on the decisions of one person?
*  I think that's one of the, you know, because that of course, the perennial question, right?
*  But it is history kind of on an automatic pilot and, you know, human decisions, the decisions of leaders
*  really only have, you know, a marginal or incremental bearing on what is going to happen anyway.
*  But I think that is the, and historians argue about that all the time. I think that that is a
*  really good example of a place in human history that literally the world could have ended if
*  we had a different leader in the White House. And the reason for that is that there were,
*  there were, as I recall, 64 gun emplacements, you know, missile emplacements. Each one of those
*  missile emplacements had a crew of about a hundred men and they were Soviets. So they were, and
*  they, we didn't know whether, we had a couple of questions that my uncle asked,
*  Alan, or asked the CIA and he asked, Douglas was already gone, but he asked the CIA and he asked
*  his military brass because they all wanted to go in. Everybody wanted to go in. And my uncle said,
*  my uncle asked to see the aerial photos and he examined those personally. And that's why it's
*  important to have a leader in the White House who can push back on their bureaucracies.
*  He, and then he asked them, you know, are those, who's manning those missile sites?
*  And are they Russians? And if they're Russians and we bomb them,
*  are they, isn't it going to force Khrushchev to then go into Berlin?
*  And that would be the beginning of a cascade of facts that would, you know, highly likely to end
*  a nuclear confrontation. And the, the, the military brass said to my uncle, oh, we don't think
*  he'll have the, you know, we don't think he'll have the guts to do that. So he was, my uncle was like,
*  that's what you're betting on. And, you know, they all wanted him to go in. They wanted him
*  to bomb the sites and then invade Cuba. And he said, if we bomb those sites, we're going to be
*  killing Russians and it's going to force, it's going to provoke Russia into some response.
*  And the obvious response is for them to go into Berlin. Oh, but the thing that we didn't know then
*  that we didn't find out until I think, you know, there was a, it was like a 30 year anniversary of
*  the Cuban missile crisis in Havana. And what we learned then was that from the Russians who came
*  to that event, it was like a symposium where everybody on both sides talked about it. And
*  we learned a lot of stuff that I never, nobody knew before. One of the insane things, the most
*  insane thing that we learned was that the, the weapons were already, the nuclear warheads were
*  already in place. They were ready to fire and that the authorization to fire was made, was delegated
*  to each of the gun group, gun crew commanders. So there were 60 people who had all had authorization
*  to fire if they felt themselves under attack. So you have to believe them. At least one of them
*  would have launched and that would have been the beginning of the end. And you know, if they, if
*  anybody had launched, you know, we knew what would happen. My uncle knew what would happen
*  because he asked again and again, what's going to happen. And they said,
*  30 million Americans will be killed, but we will kill 130 million Russians. So we will win.
*  And that was a victory for them. And my uncle said, later said, he told Arthur Slesinger and
*  Kenny O'Donnell, he said, those guys, he called them the salad brass, the guys with all of this
*  stuff on their chest. And he said, he said, those guys, they don't care because they know that if
*  it happens, that they're going to be in the charge of everything. They're the ones who are going to
*  be running the world after that. So for them, you know, it was, there was an incentive to kill 130
*  million Russians and 30 million Americans, but my uncle, he had this correspondence with Khrushchev.
*  They were secretly corresponding with each other. And that is what saved the world is that they had
*  both of them had been men of war. Eisenhower famously said, it will not be a man of war.
*  It will not be a soldier who starts World War III because a guy who's actually seen it knows how
*  bad it is. And my uncle, you know, had been in the heat of the South Pacific. His boat had been cut
*  in two by a Japanese destroyer. His, many of his, three of his crewmen had been killed. One of them
*  badly burned. He pulled that guy with a lanyard in his teeth six miles to the island in the middle
*  of the night. And then they hid out there for 10 days, you know, and, and, you know, he came back.
*  Like I said, he was the only president of the United States that are in the Purple Heart.
*  Meanwhile, Khrushchev had been at Stalingrad, which was the worst place to be on the planet,
*  you know, probably in the 20th century, other than, you know, in Auschwitz or one of the death camps.
*  It was, you know, it was, it was the most ferocious, horrific war with people starving,
*  people, you know, committing cannibalism, you know, eating the dogs, the cats, eating their shoe
*  leather, freezing to death by the thousands, et cetera. Khrushchev did not want, the last thing
*  he wanted was a war. And the last thing my uncle wanted was a war. And they, but the CIA did not
*  know anything about Khrushchev. And the reason for that is the, there was a mole at Langley,
*  so that every time the CIA got a spy in the Kremlin, he would immediately be killed.
*  So they had no eyes in the Kremlin. You know, there were literally hundreds of Russian spies
*  who had, who had defected the United States and were in the Kremlin who were killed during that
*  period. They had no idea anything about Khrushchev, about how he saw the world. And they saw the
*  Kremlin itself as a monolith, you know, that this, this kind of, you know, the same way that we look
*  at Putin today, that, you know, it's all, they have this ambition of world conquest and that's,
*  it's driving them and there's nothing else they think about. They're absolutely single-minded
*  about it. But actually there was a big division between Khrushchev and his joint chiefs and his
*  intelligence apparatus. And they both at one point discovered they were both in the same situation.
*  They were surrounded by spies and military personnel who were intent on going to war and
*  they were the two guys resisting it. So when my uncle, my uncle had this idea of, you know,
*  being the peace president from the beginning, he told Ben Bradley, his, one of his best friends,
*  who, you know, was running the publisher of the Washington Post, or the editor-in-chief at that
*  time, he said, Ben Bradley asked him, what is, what do you want in your gravestone? And my uncle said,
*  he kept the peace. He said, the principal job of the president of the United States is to keep the
*  country out of war. And so when he first became president, he anxiously agreed to meet Khrushchev
*  in Geneva to do his summit. And by the way, Eisenhower had wanted to do the same thing.
*  Eisenhower wanted peace, but his, and he was going to meet in Vienna, but that peace summit
*  was blown up. He was going to try to do, you know, he was going to try to end the cold war.
*  Eisenhower was in the last year of his, of his, in May of 1960, but that was torpedoed by the CIA
*  during the U-2 crash. You know, they sent a U-2 over the, over the Soviet Union and it got
*  shot down. And then they told, and then Alan Douglas told Eisenhower to deny that we had a
*  program. They didn't know that the Russians had captured Gary Francis Powers. And so when,
*  and that blew up the peace talks between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. And so, you know,
*  there was a lot of tension. My uncle wanted to break that tension. He agreed to meet with,
*  with Khrushchev in Vienna early on in his term. He went over there and Khrushchev snubbed him.
*  Khrushchev lectured him imperiously about the, you know, the terror of American imperialism and,
*  and rebuffed any, you know, they did agree not to go into Laos. They made an agreement that kept
*  the United States, kept my uncle from sending troops to Laos, but it had been a disaster in Vienna.
*  So then we had a spy that used to come to our house all the time. I cut Georgie Bolshakoy.
*  He was this Russian spy. My, my parents had met at the embassy. They had gone to a party or a
*  reception, the Russian embassy, and he had approached them and they knew he was, he was a GRU agent
*  and KGB. He was both, oh, he used to come to our house. They really liked him. He was very
*  attractive. He was always laughing and joking. He would do rope climbing contests with my father.
*  He would do pushup contests with my father. He was, he could do the Russian dancing, the Cossack
*  dancing, and he would do that for us and teach us that. And he was, and we knew he was a spy too.
*  And this was at the time of, you know, the James Bond films were first coming out. So it was really
*  exciting for us to have an actual Russian spy in our house. The State Department was horrified by
*  it. But, but anyway, when Khrushchev, after Vienna and after, you know, the Bay of Pigs,
*  Khrushchev had second thoughts and he sent this long letter to my uncle.
*  And he didn't want to go through his, his State Department or his embassy. He wanted to end run
*  them. And he was friends with Bolsheviks. So he gave Georgie the letter and Georgie brought it
*  and handed it to Pierre Salinger, folded in the New York Times. And he gave it to my uncle. And
*  it was this beautiful letter, which he said, you know, my uncle had talked to him about the children
*  who were played, you know, we played 29 grandchildren who were playing in his yard. And he's saying,
*  what is our moral basis for making a decision that could kill these children so they'll never
*  write a poem, they'll never participate in election, they'll never run for office? How can
*  we make, how can we, can we morally make a decision that is going to eliminate life for
*  these beautiful kids? And he had said that to Khrushchev and Khrushchev wrote in this letter
*  back saying that he was now sitting as this dacha on the Black Sea. And that he was thinking
*  about what my uncle jacket said to him at Vienna. And he regretted very deeply not having taken the
*  olive leaf that jacket offered him. And then he said, you know, it occurs to me now that we're
*  all on an arc and that there is not another one. And that the entire fate of the planet
*  and all of its creatures and all of the children are dependent on the decisions we make. And you
*  and I have a moral obligation to go forward with each other as friends. And immediately after that,
*  this was, you know, he said that right after the Berlin crisis in 1962, General Curtis LeMay
*  tried to, had tried to provoke a war with an incident at Checkpoint Charlie, which was
*  the entrance, the entrance and exit through the Berlin Wall in Berlin. And the Russian tanks had
*  come to the wall, the US tanks had come to the wall and there was a standoff. And my uncle had
*  had sent a message to Khrushchev then through Dobrynin saying, my back is at the wall. I
*  cannot, I have no place to back, to please back off. And then we will back off. And Khrushchev
*  took his word, backed his tanks off first. And then my uncle ordered LeMay to back, like, he had,
*  LeMay had mounted bulldozer plows on the front of the tanks to plow down the Berlin Wall.
*  And that, and the Russians had come. So it was just, you know, it was the, it was his generals
*  trying to provoke a war. And, but they started talking to each other. And then when he, after
*  he wrote that letter, they agreed that they would install a hotline so they could talk to each other
*  and they wouldn't have to go through intermediaries. And so at Jack's house on the Cape, there was a
*  red phone that we knew if we picked it up, Khrushchev would answer. And there was another
*  one in the White House. And that, but they knew it was important to talk to each other,
*  you know, and you just wish that we had that kind of leadership today.
*  I can, I, you know, they just understands our job. Look, I know you know a lot about AI, right?
*  And you know how dangerous it is potentially to humanity and what opportunities it also,
*  you know, offers, but it could kill us all. I mean, Elon said first it's going to steal our job,
*  then it's going to kill us. Right? And it's probably not hyperbole. It actually, you know,
*  if it follows the laws of biological evolution, which are just the laws of mathematics, that's
*  probably a good endpoint for it. You know, a potential endpoint. So we, we need, it's going
*  to happen, but we need to make sure it's regulated and it's regulated properly for safety
*  in every country. And, and that includes Russia and China and Iran. Right now we,
*  we should be putting all the weapons of war aside and sitting down with those guys and say,
*  how are we doing? How are we going to do this? There's much more important things to do.
*  We're going to, this stuff is going to kill us if we don't figure out how to regulate it.
*  And, and leadership needs to look down the road at what, what is the real risk here? And the real
*  risk is that, you know, AI will, will, you know, enslave us for one thing and, you know, and,
*  and then destroy us and do all this other stuff. And how about biological weapons?
*  We're now all working on these biological weapons and we're doing biological weapons from
*  from Ebola and, and, you know, dengue fever and, you know, all of these other bad things. And we're
*  making ethnic bio weapons, bio weapons that can only kill Russians. Bio weapons that the Chinese
*  are making that, you know, can kill people who don't, who don't have Chinese genes. So all of
*  this is now within reach. We're actively doing it and we need to stop it. And we can easily,
*  biological weapons treaty is the easiest thing in the world to do. We can verify it, we can enforce
*  it and everybody wants to agree to it. It only insane people do not want to want to continue this
*  kind of research. There's no reason to do it. So there are these existential threats to all of
*  humanity now out there like AI and biological, biological weapons. We need to start, stop fighting
*  each other, start competing on economic game fields, playing fields instead of military
*  playing fields, which will be good for all of humanity. And that we need to sit down with each
*  other and negotiate reasonable treaties on how we regulate AI and biological weapons. And nobody's
*  talking about this in this political race right now. Nobody's talking about it in a government.
*  They get fixated on these little wars and, you know, and these comic book depictions of good
*  versus evil. And, you know, and we all go, you know, and go off to and give them the weapons and enrich,
*  you know, the military and gosh, I should have a complex, but we're,
*  we're on the road to perdition if we don't end this. And some of this requires that this kind of
*  phone that connects Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy that cuts through all the bureaucracy
*  to have this communication between heads of state. And in the case of AI, perhaps heads of tech
*  companies where you can just pick up the phone and have a conversation because a lot of it,
*  a lot of the existential threats of artificial intelligence, perhaps even bioweapons is
*  unintentional. It's not even a strategic intentional effects. So you have to be
*  transparent and honest about, especially with AI, that people might not know what's the worst
*  that's going to happen once you release it out into the wild. And you have to have an honest
*  communication about how to do it so that companies are not terrified of regulation,
*  overreach of regulation. And then government is not terrified of tech companies, of manipulating
*  them in some direct or indirect ways. So like there's a trust that builds versus a distrust
*  that seems to basically that old phone or Khrushchev can call John F. Kennedy is needed.
*  Yeah. And you know, I don't think there's a, listen, I don't understand AI. Okay. I do know,
*  I can see from all this technology how it's this kind of turnkey totalitarianism that once you put
*  these systems in place, you know, they can be misused to enslave people. And I think that's
*  the problem. They can be misused in wars and, you know, to subjugate, to kill, to do all of these
*  bad things. And I don't think there's anybody on Capitol Hill who understands this. You know,
*  we need to bring in the tech community and say, tell us what these regulations need to look like,
*  you know, so that there can be freedom to innovate so that we can milk AI for all of the good things,
*  but not, you know, fall into these traps that are going to, you know, that are these existential
*  threats to that pose existential threats to humanity. It seems like John F. Kennedy is a
*  singular figure in that he was able to have the humility to reach out to Khrushchev and also the
*  strength and integrity to resist the, what did you call them, the salad brass and institutions like
*  the CIA. So that makes it particularly tragic that he was killed. To what degree was CIA involved
*  or the various bureaucracy involved in his death? The evidence that the CIA was involved in my
*  uncle's murder and that they were subsequently involved in the coverup and
*  continue to be involved in the coverup. I mean, there's still 5,000 documents that they won't
*  release 60 years later is I think so insurmountable and so, you know, mountainous
*  and overwhelming that it's beyond any reasonable doubt, including, you know, dozens of confessions
*  of people who were involved in the assassination, but, you know, every kind of document and,
*  um, and, you know, I mean, it came as a surprise recently to most Americans, I think,
*  the release of these documents in which the press, the American media finally acknowledged that,
*  yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset and he was recruited, you know, in 1957. He was a Marine
*  up, uh, working at the Addis Ababa Air Force Base and which was the CIA Air Force Base in,
*  you know, with the U-2 flights, which was a CIA program and that, uh, he was recruited by James
*  Jesus Angleton, who was the director of counterintelligence and then sent on a fake
*  defection to Russia and then brought back, you know, um, to Dallas and people didn't know that
*  that, even though it's been known for decades, it never percolated into the mainstream media
*  because they have such a, um, you know, they have such an allergy to anything that challenges the
*  Warren report. You know, when Congress investigated my uncle's murder in the, um, in the, uh, in the
*  1970s, the church committee did, and they did, you know, two and a half year investigation and
*  they had many, many more documents and much more testimony available to them, uh, than the Warren
*  commission had. And this was, this was a decade after the Warren commission. They came to the
*  conclusion that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy. And there was a division where essentially one guy
*  on that committee believed it was primarily the mafia. But Richard Schweitzer was the
*  center head of the committee, um, said, you know, straight out the CIA was involved in the murder
*  of the president of the United States. Oh, and, and the, if I've talked to most of the staff on
*  that committee and they said, yeah, um, and the CIA was stonewalling us the whole way through.
*  And the actual people that the CIA appointed, George John, who had, who the CIA appointed
*  as liaison to the committee, they brought him out of retirement. He had been one of the masterminds
*  of the assassination. Oh, uh, there's no, I mean, it's impossible to even talk about a tiny,
*  the fraction of the evidence here. And what I suggest to people, there are hundreds of books
*  written about this, that, you know, assemble this evidence and mobilize the evidence. The best book
*  to me for people to read is James Douglas's book, which is called the unspeakable. And he,
*  Douglas does this extraordinary, he's an extraordinary scholar and he does this,
*  it's an amazing job of digesting and summarizing and mobilizing all of them, you know, the,
*  probably a million documents and, you know, the evidence from all these confessions that have
*  come out into a coherent story. And it's riveting to read. And, you know, I recommend people who
*  do not take my word for it, you know, um, and don't take, uh, don't take anybody else's word
*  for, go ahead and do the research yourself. And one way to do that is probably the most efficient
*  way is to read Douglas's books. He has all the references there. So if it's true that CIA had
*  a hand in this assassination, how is it possible for them to amass so much power? How is it possible
*  for them to become corrupt? And is it individuals or is it the entire institution? No, it's not
*  the entire institution. My daughter-in-law who's helping to run my campaign was a CIA, uh, you
*  know, in the clandestine, uh, uh, services for all of her career. She was a spy and weapons of mass
*  destruction program in the Mideast and in China. And there's 22,000 people who work for the CIA.
*  Probably 20,000 of those are, you know, are patriotic Americans and really good public
*  servants and they're doing important work for our country. Um, but the institution is corrupt
*  and because the higher ranks of the institution. And in fact, Mike Pompeo said something like this
*  to me the other day. He was the director of the CIA. He said, when I was there, I did not
*  do a good job of cleaning up that agency. And he said the entire upper bureaucracy
*  of that agency are people who do not believe in the institutions of, uh, of democracy.
*  This is what he said to me. So I don't know if that's true, but I know that, you know,
*  that's significant. He's a smart person and he ran the agency and he was the secretary of state.
*  Um, but it's no mystery how that happened. We know the history. The CIA was originally,
*  first of all, there was great reluctance in 1947 that we had it for the first time. We had a secret
*  spy agency in this country during World War II called the OSS. That was disbanded after the war
*  because Congress said having a secret spy agency is incompatible with a democracy. The secret spy
*  agencies are things that like the KGB, Stasi in East Germany, Savak in Iran, and, uh,
*  Peep in Chile, whatever, you know, all over the world. They're all have to do with totalitarian
*  governments. They're not something that you can have that, um, it's, it's antithetical democracy
*  to have that. Uh, but, um, in 1947 we created, Truman signed it in, but it was initially,
*  and has to be an agency, which means information gathering, which is important. It's to get,
*  to gather and consolidate information from many, many different sources from all over the world
*  and then put those in reports of the White House. So the president, um, can make good decisions based
*  upon valid information, evidence-based, you know, decision-making. Uh, but Alan Dulles, who was the,
*  essentially the first head of the agency, made a series of, of, uh, legislative machinations
*  and political machinations that gave additional powers to the agency and opened up the, uh,
*  what they called then the plans division, which is the plans division is the dirty tricks. It's the
*  black ops fixing elections, um, murdering what they call executive action, which means killing
*  foreign leaders, um, and, you know, making small wars and, uh, and bribing and blackmailing
*  people, stealing elections and that kind of thing. And the reason at that time, you know,
*  we were in the middle of the Cold War and Truman and Eisenhower did not want to go to war. They
*  didn't want to commit troops. And it seemed to them that, you know, this was a way of kind of
*  fighting the Cold War secretly without and doing it at minimal cost by, um, uh, by, uh, changing
*  events sort of invisibly. And so it was seductive to them, but everybody, you know, Congress,
*  when they first voted it in place, Congress, both political parties said,
*  if we create this thing, it could turn into a monster and it could undermine our,
*  you know, our values. And today it's so, it's so powerful and then nobody knows what its budget is.
*  Plus it has its own investment fund in QDEL, which has invested, you know, made, I think,
*  2000 investments in Silicon Valley. Oh, it has ownership of a lot of these tech companies
*  and, you know, and the, a lot of the CEOs, those tech companies have signed state secrecy agreements
*  with the CIA, which if they even reveal that they have signed that they can go to jail for 20 years
*  and have their assets removed, et cetera. Oh, the influence that the agency has, the capacity to
*  influence events at every level in our country, uh, are, is really, uh, frightening. And then
*  for most of its, um, for most of its life, the CIA was banned from propagandizing Americans,
*  but we learned that they were doing it anyway. So in 1973, during the church committee hearings,
*  we learned that the CIA had a program called Operation Mockingbird, where they had at least
*  400 members, leading members of the United States press corps, the New York Times, the Washington
*  Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, et cetera, who were secretly working for the agency and, um, and steering news
*  coverage, uh, to support CIA priorities. And they agreed at that time to disband Operation Mockingbird
*  in 73. Um, but there's, uh, there's indications they didn't do that. And they still, the CIA today
*  is the biggest funder of journalism around the world. Oh, the biggest funder is through USAID.
*  The biggest funder is through USAID. Um, the USA, the United States funds journalism in almost
*  every country in the world. You know, it owns newspapers, it has journalists on it, thousands
*  and thousands of journalists on its payroll. They're not supposed to be doing that in the
*  United States, but, um, you know, in 2016, President Obama changed the law to make it legal now for the
*  CIA to propagandize Americans. And I think, you know, we can't look at the Ukraine war and how
*  that was, you know, has been, how the narrative has been formed in the, in the minds of Americans
*  and say that the CIA had nothing to do with that. What is the mechanism by which the CIA
*  influences the narrative? Do you think it's indirectly? Through the press.
*  Indirectly through the press or directly by funding the press?
*  Directly through, I mean, there's certain press organs that have been linked, you know,
*  to the agency that the people who run those organs, things like the Daily Beast, now Rolling Stone,
*  you know, editor of Rolling Stone, Noah Schlackman, has deep relationships with the
*  intelligence community, Salon, Daily Coast. But I wonder why they would do it. So from my perspective,
*  it just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity where your opinion cannot be
*  influenced or bought. I agree with you, but I actually think that the entire field of journalism
*  has, uh, has, uh, you know, really ashamed itself in recent years because it's become, you know,
*  the principle newspapers in this country and the television station, the legacy media
*  have abandoned their, um, their traditional, their tradition of, of, you know, which was
*  when I was a kid, listen, my house was filled with the greatest journalists alive at that time.
*  People like Ben Bradley, like Anthony Lewis, Mary McGrory, Pete Hamill, Jerry, Jack Newfield,
*  Jimmy Breslin, uh, and many, many others. And after my father, after my father died, they started the
*  RFK journalism awards to recognize integrity and courage, you know, journalistic integrity and
*  color, courage. And for that generation of journalism, they, they thought they believed
*  that the, that, um, the function of a journalist was to maintain this posture of fear, skepticism
*  toward any aggregation of power and including government authority. That you always, that people
*  in authority lie and that they always have to be questioned and, uh, and that their job was to speak
*  truth to power and to be guardians of the first amendment right to, to, uh, free expression.
*  But if you look what happened during the pandemic, it was the inverse of that kind of journalism
*  where the, uh, the major press organs in this country, um, were instead of speaking truth to
*  power, they were doing the opposite. They were broadcasting
*  propaganda. They became propaganda organs for the government agencies and they were actually
*  censoring, um, the speech of anybody who dissents of the powerless. Oh, and in fact, it was, it was
*  an organized conspiracy, you know, and it was the name of, it was the Trusted News Initiative and,
*  you know, some of the major press organs in our country signed onto it and they agreed
*  not to print stories or facts that, um, that departed from government orthodoxy. So the
*  Washington Post was the signature, the UPI, the AP, and then, um, the four media or the four social
*  media, um, groups, Microsoft, Twitter, uh, Facebook and Google all signed onto the Trusted News
*  Initiative. It was started by the BBC, organized by them, and the purpose of it was to, you know,
*  to make sure nobody could print anything about government that departed from government orthodoxy.
*  The way it worked is the UPI and the AP and the, which are the news services that provide most of
*  the news, you know, news around the country and the Washington Post would decide what news was
*  permissible to print. And a lot of it was about COVID, but also Hunter Biden's laptops where you,
*  it was impermissible to suggest that those were real or that, you know, they had stuff on there
*  that was compromising. And, um, and we, you know, and by the way, I, this, what I'm telling you,
*  you know, is all well documented and I'm litigating on it right now. So I'm part of a lawsuit against
*  the DNI. And so I know a lot about what happened and I have all this documented and people can go
*  to our website. There's a letter on my sub stack now to, um, to Michael Scherer of the Washington
*  Post that outlines all this and gives all my sources. Um, because Michael Scherer accused me
*  of being a conspiracy theorist when he was actually part of a conspiracy, a true conspiracy
*  to suppress anybody who was departing from government orthodoxies by either censoring
*  them completely or labeling them conspiracy theorists. I mean, you can understand the intention
*  and the action, the difference between this. We talked about, you can understand the intention of
*  such a thing being good at a time of a catastrophe, at a time of a pandemic. Uh, there's a lot of risk
*  to saying untrue things, but that's a slippery slope that leads into a place where the journalistic
*  integrity that we talked about is completely sacrificed. And then you can deviate from truth.
*  Deviate from truth. If you read their internal memorandum, including the statements of the,
*  the, the leader of the trusted news initiative, I think her name's Jessica, uh, Jennifer DeCisil.
*  Um, and I, you know, you can go on our website and see her statement. And she says, she says,
*  the purpose of this is that we're now, she says, when people look at us, they think we're competitors,
*  but we're not. The real competitors are coming from all these alternative news sources now all
*  over the network. Uh, and they're hurting public trust in us and they're hurting our economic model.
*  And we have to, they have to be choked off and crushed. And, uh, and the way that we're going to
*  do that is to make an agreement with the social media sites that if we say, if we label their
*  information, misinformation, the social media sites will, um, will deplatform it or they will
*  throttle it or they will, uh, shadow ban it, which destroys the economic model of those
*  alternative competitive sources of information. So that, that's true. But, and, but the point you
*  make is an important point, um, that the journalists themselves who probably didn't know about the TNI
*  agreement, certainly I'm sure they didn't, um, they believe that they're doing the right thing
*  by suppressing information that may challenge, you know, government proclamations on COVID.
*  But I mean, there's a danger to that. And the danger is that,
*  you know, once you appoint yourself an arbiter of what's true and what's not true, uh, then there's
*  really no end to the power that you have now assumed for yourself because now your, your job
*  is no longer to inform the public. Your job now is to manipulate the public.
*  And if you end up manipulating the public in collusion with powerful entities, then you become
*  the instrument of authoritarian rule rather than the, you know, the, the opponent of it.
*  And it becomes the inverse of journalism and a democracy.
*  You're running for president as a Democrat. Uh, what to you are the strongest values that represent
*  the left-wing politics, uh, of this country?
*  I would say protection of the environment and the commons, you know, the air, the water,
*  wildlife, fisheries, public lands, um, you know, the, those assets, they cannot be reduced to
*  private property ownership. You know, the, you know, the landscapes are purple mountain majesty.
*  The protection of the most vulnerable people in our society, people, um, who, um,
*  which would include children and minorities, uh, the restoration of the middle class,
*  you know, and, uh, and, uh, protection of labor, dignity, uh, and, you know, decent pay for labor,
*  um, uh, uh, bodily autonomy, a woman's right to choose or an individual's right to endure
*  unwanted medical procedures, um, peace, you know, the Democrats have always been anti-war.
*  The refusal to use fear as a governing tool. You know, if FDR said the, the only thing we have to
*  fear is fear itself because he recognized that tyrants and dictators could use fear to disable
*  critical thinking and, uh, and, uh, and overwhelm the desire for personal liberty. Um, the, uh,
*  the freedom of government from untoward influence by the government, uh,
*  the freedom of government from untoward influence by corrupt corporate power.
*  That's the end of this corrupt merger of the state and corporate power that is now,
*  I think, dominating our democracy. That's what Eisenhower warned about when he warned against
*  the emergence of the military industrial complex. And then I prefer to talk about kind of the
*  positive vision of what we should be doing in our country and globally, which is,
*  you know, I, I, I see that the corporations are commoditizing us, are poisoning our children, are,
*  um, strip mining the wealth from our middle class and, um, and treating America as if it were a
*  business and liquidation, converting assets to cash as quickly as possible. And, you know, and,
*  and creating or exacerbating this, uh, this huge disparity in wealth in our country,
*  which is eliminating the middle class and creating, you know, kind of a Latin American
*  style feudal model. There's a, these huge aggregations of wealth above and widespread
*  poverty below. And that's a configuration that is too unstable to support democracy
*  sustainably, you know, and we're supposed to be modeling democracy, but we're losing it.
*  Um, and I, you know, I think we ought to have a foreign policy that restores our moral authority
*  around the world, restores America as the embodiment of moral authority, which it was when my uncle was
*  president and as a purveyor of peace rather than, you know, a war-like nation. My uncle said he
*  didn't want people in Africa and Latin America and Asia to think of, when they think of America,
*  to picture a man with a gun and a bayonet. He wanted them to think of a Peace Corps volunteer
*  and he refused to send combat veterans, combat soldiers abroad. He never sent a single soldier
*  to his death abroad. Um, and, uh, and, you know, into combat, um, he sent 16,000. He resisted in,
*  in Berlin and 62, he resisted in Laos, uh, in 61, he resisted, um, in, in Vietnam, you know,
*  Vietnam, they wanted him to put 250,000 troops. He only put 16,000 advisors, which was fewer,
*  fewer troops. And he sent to get James Meredith into the, uh, into the universe, to Ole Miss
*  in Oxford, Mississippi. One black man, he sent 16,000 and a month before he died, he ordered them
*  all home. He actually, I think it was October 2nd of 1963, he heard that a Green Beret had died
*  and he asked his aid for a combat, um, for a list of combat fatalities. And the aid came back
*  and there was 75 men had died in Vietnam at that point. And he said, that's too many. We're going
*  to have no more any order. And he signed a national security order, 263 and ordered all of those men,
*  all Americans home from Vietnam by 1965 with the first thousand coming home by December 63.
*  And then, uh, in November, he, of course, just before that evacuation began, he was killed.
*  And a week later, President Johnson remanded that order. And then a year after that, the Tonkin Gulf
*  resolution, we sent 250,000, which is what they wanted my uncle to do, which he refused.
*  And then, and it became an American war. And then Nixon, you know, topped it off at 560,000,
*  560,000, 56,000 Americans never came home, including my cousin, George Schakel, who died
*  at the Tet Offensive. Um, and we killed a million Vietnamese and we got nothing for it.
*  So America should be the symbol of peace. And you know, today my uncle, you know, really focused on
*  putting America on the side of the poor instead of our tradition of, you know, of, of,
*  of fortifying oligarchies that were anti-communism. That was our, you know, our major
*  criteria. If you said you were against communists, and of course the people were, were the rich people.
*  Our aid was going to the rich people in those countries and they were going to the military,
*  hunt us, our weapons were going to the hunt us to fight against the poor. And my uncle said, no,
*  you know, America should be on the side of the poor. And so he launched the Alliance for Progress
*  and USAID, which were intended to bring aid to the poorest people in those and build middle classes
*  and, and take ourselves away. In fact, his most, his favorite trip, his two favorite trips while
*  he was president, his most favorite trip was to Ireland. This is incredible, um, emotional
*  homecoming for all of the people of Ireland. But his second favorite trip was when he went to
*  Columbia. He went to Latin America, but Columbia was his favorite country. And there were, I think
*  there were 2 million people came into Bogota to see him, this vast crowd, and they were just
*  delirious cheering for him. And the president of Columbia, Jerez Carmargo, um, said to him,
*  do you know why they love you? And my uncle said, why? And he said, because they think you've put
*  America on the side of the poor against the oligarchs. And you know, when my uncle, after
*  he died today, there are more avenues and boulevards and hospitals and schools named after,
*  and statues named after and commemorating in parks, commemorating John Kennedy in Africa
*  and Latin America than any other president in the United States, and probably more than all
*  the other presidents combined. And it's because, you know, he put America on the side of the poor,
*  and that's what we ought to be doing. We ought to be projecting economic power abroad.
*  The Chinese have essentially stolen his playbook. And, you know, we've spent $8 trillion on the
*  Iraq war and its aftermath, the wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya, you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan.
*  And what do we get for that? We had nothing for that money, $8 trillion.
*  We got, we killed more Iraqis than Saddam Hussein. Iraq today is a, is a much worse,
*  much worse off than it was when Saddam was there. It's a, it's an incoherent violent war between
*  Shia and Sunni death squads. We pushed Iraq into the embrace of Iran, which has now become
*  essentially a proxy for Iran, which is exactly the outcome that we were trying to prevent for
*  the past, you know, 20 or 30 years. We created ISIS. We sent 2 million refugees into Europe,
*  destabilizing all of the nations in Europe for generations. We're now seeing these riots
*  in, in France, and that's a direct result from the Syrian war that we created and,
*  and our creation of ISIS. Brexit is another, you know, result of that. So we, for $8 trillion,
*  we wrecked the world. And during that same period that we spent $8.1 trillion,
*  bombing bridges, ports, schools, hospitals, the Chinese spent $8.1 trillion building schools,
*  hospitals, bridges, and universities. And now, you know, the Chinese are outcompeting us everywhere
*  in the world. Everybody wants to deal with the Chinese because they, you know, they come in,
*  they build nice things for you and they, and there's no strengths attached and they're
*  pleasant to deal with. And, and, you know, as a result of that, Brazil is switching the Chinese
*  currency. Argentina is switching. Saudi Arabia, our greatest partner, that, you know, we put
*  trillions of dollars into protecting our oil pipelines there. And now they're saying,
*  you know, we don't, we don't care what the United States think. That's what my mom and Ben Salam said.
*  He said, we don't, he, you know, they, he dropped oil production in Saudi Arabia
*  in the middle of a U.S. inflation spiral. They've never done that to us before,
*  to aggravate the inflation spiral. And two weeks later, and then they signed a deal,
*  a unilateral peace deal with Iran, which has been the enemy that we've been telling them to,
*  you know, to be a bulwark against for 20 years. And two weeks after that, he said,
*  we don't care what the United States thinks anymore. So that's what we got for spending all
*  those trillions of dollars there. We got short-term friends. And the United States,
*  you know, policy abroad, and we have not made ourselves safer. We've made Americans,
*  we've put Americans in more jeopardy all over the world. You know, you have to wait in lines to get
*  through the airport. You have to, you know, the security state is now costing us $1.3 trillion.
*  $1.3 trillion. And America is unsafer and poorer than it's ever been. So, you know, we're not
*  getting, we should be doing what President Kennedy said we ought to do and what, what China, the
*  policy that China has now adopted. So that's a really eloquent and clear and powerful description
*  of the way you see U.S. should be doing geopolitics and the way you see U.S. should be taking care of
*  the poor in this country. Let me ask you a question from Jordan Peterson that he asked
*  when I told him that I'm speaking with you. Given everything you've said, when does the left go too
*  far? I suppose he's referring to cultural issues, identity politics.
*  Well, you know, Jordan trying to get me to badmouth the left the whole time, I was in,
*  I really enjoyed my talk with him. But he seemed to have that agenda where he wanted me to,
*  you know, say bad things about the left. And I just, you know, that's not what my campaign is
*  about. I want to do the opposite. I'm not going to badmouth the left. They try, you know, I was on
*  shows this week with David Remnick from The New Yorker and he tried to get me to badmouth Donald
*  Trump and, you know, and Alex Jones and a lot of other people just and aiding me to do it.
*  And of course, there's a lot of bad things I could say about all those people, but it doesn't,
*  you know, I'm trying to find, I'm trying to find values that hold us together that we can share in
*  common rather than to focus constantly on these disputes and these issues that drive us apart.
*  So me sitting here badmouthing the left or badmouthing the right is not going to advance
*  the ball. I really want to figure out ways that, you know, what do these groups hold in common that
*  we can all, you know, have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like.
*  Well, that's music to my ears. But in that spirit, let me ask you a difficult question then.
*  You wrote a book harshly criticizing Anthony Fauci. Let me ask you to steel man the case
*  for the people who support him. What is the biggest positive thing you think Anthony Fauci
*  did for the world? What is good that he has done for the world, especially during this pandemic?
*  You know, I don't want to sit here and speak uncharitably by saying the guy
*  didn't do anything, but I don't, I can't think of anything. I mean, if you,
*  um, if you tell me something that you think he did, you know, maybe there was a drug that got
*  licensed while he was in NIH that, you know, benefited people. That's certainly possible.
*  He was there for 50 years. And I, in terms of his, um, of his principal programs of the
*  AIDS programs and his COVID programs. And I think that the harm that he did vastly outweighed,
*  outweighed the benefits. Do you think he believes he's doing good for the world?
*  I don't know what he believes. In fact, in that book, which is, I think 250,000 words,
*  I never tried to look inside of his head. I deal with facts. I deal with science. Oh, and I,
*  every factual assertion in that book is cited in source to government databases or peer reviewed
*  publications. And I don't, I try not to speculate about things that I don't know about,
*  or I can't prove. And I do not, I cannot tell you what his motivations were. I mean, all of us,
*  he's done a thing, a lot of things that I think are really very, very bad things for humanity and
*  very deceptive. We all have this, um, this capacity for self-deception. As I said at the
*  beginning of this podcast, we, we judge ourselves on our intentions rather than our actions. And we
*  all have an almost infinite capacity to convince ourselves that what we're doing is, is right.
*  And, um, you know, not everybody kind of lives and examine life and is examining their motivations
*  in the way that the world might experience, um, their professions of goodness.
*  Let me ask about the difficulty of the job he had. Do you think it's possible to do that kind of job
*  well, or is it also a fundamental flaw of the job of being the central centralized figure that's
*  supposed to know scientific policy? No, I think he was a genuinely bad human being
*  and that there were many, many good people in that department over the years. Um, Bernice
*  Eddy is a really good example of John Anthony Morris, many people whose careers he destroyed
*  because they were trying to tell the truth. One after the other, the greatest scientists
*  in the history of NIH were run out of that organization, out of that agency.
*  But, you know, people listening to this, you know, probably, you know, will, in hearing me say that,
*  will think that I'm bitter or that I, I'm doctrinaire about him, but you know, you should
*  really go and read my book. And I, it's hard to summarize a, you know, I tried to be really
*  methodical to not call names, to just say what happened. Uh, you are the bigger picture of this
*  is you're an outspoken critic of, uh, pharmaceutical companies, big pharma.
*  What is the biggest problem with big pharma and how can it be fixed?
*  Well, the problem could be fixed through regulation, you know, on the problems, but
*  the pharmaceutical industry is, um, is, uh, I mean, I don't want to say because this is going
*  to seem extreme that a criminal enterprise, but if you look at the history, that is an applicable,
*  um, describe our characterization. For example, the four biggest vaccine makers,
*  Sanofi, Merck, Pfizer, and Glaxo, four companies that make all of the 72 vaccines that are now
*  mandated for America, effectively mandated for American children. Collectively, those
*  companies have paid $35 billion in criminal penalties and damages in the last decade.
*  And I think since 2000, about 79 billion. So these are the most corrupt companies in the world.
*  And the problem is that they're serial felons. They, you know, they do this again and again and
*  again. So they did via, you know, Merck did Vioxx, which Vioxx, they, you know, they killed people by
*  falsifying science and they did it. They lied to the public. They said this is a headache medicine
*  and arthritis painkiller, but they didn't tell people that it also gave you heart attacks.
*  And they knew, you know, we've found when we sued them, um, the, you know, the memos from their
*  bean counters saying we're going to kill this many people, but we're still going to make money.
*  So they make those calculations and those calculations are made very, very regularly.
*  And then, you know, when they, um, when they get caught, they, they pay a penalty. And I think they
*  paid about $7 billion for Vioxx, but then they went right back that same year that they paid that
*  penalty. They went back into the same thing again with Gardasil and with a whole lot of other drugs.
*  So the way that the system is set up, the way that it's sold to doctors, the way that, um,
*  nobody ever goes to jail. So there's really no penalty that, uh, it all becomes part of the
*  cost of doing business. And, you know, you can see other businesses that if they're not, if they don't,
*  if there's no penalty, if there's no real, I mean, these look, these are the companies that gave us
*  the opioid epidemic, right? So they knew what was going to happen. And we, you know, you go and see,
*  there's a documentary, I forget what the name of it is, but it shows exactly what happened. And,
*  you know, they corrupted FDA. They knew that this, that Oxycodone was addictive. They got FDA to
*  tell doctors that it wasn't addictive. They pressured FDA to lie and they got their way.
*  And they've so far, they led this year, you know, those, they got a whole generation addicted to
*  Oxycodone. And now, you know, when they got caught and they made it, we made it harder to get
*  Oxycodone. And now all those addicted kids are going to fend no one dying. And this year it killed
*  106, 106,000. That's twice as many people who were killed during the Vietnam, during the 20 year
*  Vietnam war, but in one year, twice as many American kids. And they knew it was going to happen.
*  And they did it to make money. So I don't know what you call that other than saying that's,
*  you know, a criminal enterprise.
*  Was it possible to have within the capitalist system to produce medication, to produce drugs at
*  scale in a way that is not corrupt?
*  Of course it is.
*  How?
*  Through a, you know, through a solid regulatory regimen, you know, where drugs are actually tested.
*  You know, I mean, the problem is not the capitalist system. The capitalist system, I,
*  you know, I have great admiration for them. I love the capitalist system. It's the greatest
*  economic engine ever devised, but it has to be harnessed to a social purpose. Otherwise it's
*  going to, it leads us, you know, down the trail of oligarchy, environmental destruction, and,
*  you know, and commoditizing, poisoning, and killing human beings. That's what it will do in the end.
*  You need a regulatory structure that is, that is not corrupted by entanglements, financial
*  entanglements with the industry. And we've set this up the way that this is, that the system is
*  set up today has created this system of regulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget
*  comes from pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, you know, their money is coming,
*  their salaries are coming from pharma, half their salaries. So they're, you know, they know who their
*  bosses are. And that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved as
*  quickly as possible. It's called fast track approval and they pay 50% of FDA's budget.
*  It goes about 45% actually goes to fast track approval. Do you think money can buy integrity?
*  Oh yeah, of course it can. And yeah, I mean, there's, that's not something that is,
*  that is controversial. Of course it will. So, and then- Slightly controversial to me. I would like to
*  think that scientists- It may not be able to buy your integrity. I'm talking about population wide.
*  I'm not talking about the individual. But I'd like to believe that scientists, I mean,
*  in general, a career of a scientist is not a very high paying job. I'd like to believe that people
*  that go into science that work at FDA, that work at NIH are doing it for a reason that's not even
*  correlated with money really. Yeah. And I think probably that's why they go in there, but scientists
*  are corruptible. And you know, the way that I can tell you that is that I've brought over 500 losses
*  and almost all of them involve scientific controversies. And there are scientists on both
*  sides in everyone. When we sued Monsanto, there was on the Monsanto side, there was a Yale
*  scientist, a Stanford scientist and a Harvard scientist. And on our side, there was a Yale,
*  Stanford and Harvard scientist. And they were saying exactly the opposite things.
*  In fact, there's a word for those kind of scientists who take money for their opinion.
*  And the word is buyostitutes. And they are very, very common. And I've been dealing with them my
*  whole career. I think it was Upton Sinclair who said that it's very difficult to persuade a man
*  of a fact if the existence of that fact will diminish his salary. And I think that's true
*  for all of us. If we find a way of reconciling ourselves to things that are, to truths that
*  actually end worldviews, that actually benefit our salaries. Now, NIH, NIH has probably the worst
*  system, which is that scientists who work for NIH, NIH itself, which used to be the premier
*  gold standard scientific agency in the world. Everybody looked at NIH that today it's just an
*  incubator for pharmaceutical drugs. And that is that gravity of economic self-interest.
*  Because if NIH itself collects royalties, they have margin rights for the patents on all the
*  drugs that they work on. So with the Moderna vaccine, which they promoted incessantly and
*  aggressively, NIH on 50% of that vaccine is making billions and billions of dollars on it.
*  And there are four, at least four scientists that we know of and probably at least six
*  at NIH who themselves have margin rights for those patents. So if you are a scientist who
*  work at NIH, you work on a new drug, you then get margin rights and you're entitled to royalties of
*  $150,000 a year forever from that, forever. Your children, your children's children, as long as that
*  products on the market, you can collect royalties. So you have, you know, the Moderna vaccine is
*  paying for the top people at NIH. You know, some of the top regulators is paying for their boats,
*  it's paying for their mortgages, it's paying for their children's education. And, you know,
*  you have to expect that in those kinds of situations, the regulatory function would be
*  subsumed beneath the mercantile ambitions of the agency itself and the individuals who stand to
*  profit enormously from getting a drug to market. Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer, to find
*  problems with those drugs before they get to market. But if you know that drug is going to pay for your
*  mortgage, you may overlook a little problem. And that worry even a very big one. And that's the
*  problem. You've talked about that the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer.
*  And you've said that you're not anti-vaccine, you're pro-safe vaccine.
*  Difficult question. Can you name any vaccines that you think are good?
*  I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably
*  a
*  verting more problems than they're causing.
*  There's no vaccine that is safe and effective.
*  Those are big words. What about the polio? Can we talk about the polio?
*  Here's the problem. The polio vaccine contained a virus called Simeon virus 40,
*  SV 40. It's one of the most carcinogenic materials that is not demand. In fact,
*  it's used now by scientists around the world to induce tumors in rats and guinea pigs in labs.
*  But it was in that vaccine, 98 million people who got that vaccine in my generation got it.
*  And now you've had this explosion of soft tissue cancers in our generation that kill many, many,
*  many more people than polio ever did. So if you say to me, the polio vaccine was effective
*  against polio, I'm going to say yes. If you say to me, did it kill more people, did it cause more
*  deaths than it did? I would say, I don't know, because we don't have the data on that.
*  But let's talk, well, we kind of have to narrow in on, is it effective against the thing it's
*  supposed to fight? Well, a lot of them are. Let me give you an example. The most popular vaccine in
*  the world is the DTP vaccine, diphtheria tetanus and pertussis. It was introduced in this country
*  around 1980. That vaccine caused so many injuries that Elias, which was the manufacturer, was said
*  to the Reagan administration, we are now paying $20 in downstream liabilities for every dollar that
*  we're making in profits, and we are getting out of the business unless you give us permanent
*  immunity from liability. So the vaccine companies then were given, and by the way,
*  Reagan said at that time, why don't you just make the vaccine safe?
*  And why is that? Because vaccines are inherently unsafe. They said unavoidably unsafe. You cannot
*  make them safe. And so when Reagan wrote the bill and passed it, the bill says in its preamble,
*  vaccines are unavoidably unsafe. And the Bruceowitz case, which was a Supreme Court case that
*  upheld that bill, uses that same language. Vaccines cannot be made safe. They're
*  unavoidably unsafe. So this is what the law says. Now, I just want to finish this story because this
*  illustrates very well your question. The DTP vaccine was discontinued in this country,
*  and it was discontinued in Europe because so many kids were being injured by it. However,
*  the WHO and Bill Gates gives it to 161 million African children every year.
*  And Bill Gates went to the Danish government and asked them to support this program, saying,
*  we've saved 30 million kids from dying from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
*  The Danish government said, can you show us the data? And he couldn't. So the Danish government
*  paid for a big study with Novo Nordisk, which is a Scandinavian vaccine company in West Africa.
*  And they went to West Africa and they looked at the DTP vaccine for 30 years of data.
*  And they hired, they retained the best vaccine scientists in the world, these kind of deities
*  of African vaccine program, Peter AAB, Sigrid Morgensen, and a bunch of others.
*  And they looked at 30 years of data for the DTP vaccine and they came back and they were shocked
*  by what they found. They found that the vaccine was preventing kids from getting diphtheria,
*  tetanus, and pertussis. But the girls who got that vaccine were 10 times more likely to die over the
*  next six months than children who didn't. Why is that? And they weren't dying from anything
*  anybody ever associated with the vaccine. They were dying of anemia, heart disease, malaria,
*  sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease, pneumonia.
*  And it turns out this is what the research has found, who are all pro-vaccine by the way.
*  They said that this vaccine is killing more children than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis
*  prior to the introduction of the vaccine. And for 30 years, nobody ever noticed it.
*  The vaccine was providing protection against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the
*  children's immune systems and they could not defend themselves against random infections that
*  were harmless to most children. But isn't it nearly impossible to prove that link?
*  You can't prove the link. All you can do is for any particular interest, you can't
*  illness or death, you can't prove the link. But you can show statistically that if you get that
*  vaccine, you're more likely to die over the next six months than if you don't. And those studies,
*  unfortunately, are not done for any other vaccines. So for every other medicine,
*  in order to get approval from the FDA, you have to do a placebo control trial prior to licensure,
*  where you look at health outcomes among an exposed group, a group that gets it,
*  and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets a placebo. The only medical intervention
*  that does not receive, that does not undergo placebo control trials prior to licensure are
*  vaccines. Not one of the 72 vaccines that are now mandated for our children have ever undergone
*  a placebo control trial prior to licensure. So I should say that there's a bunch on that point.
*  I've heard from a bunch of folks that disagree with you, including polio. I mean, in the test,
*  testing is a really important point before licensure, placebo control, randomized trials.
*  Polio received just that against the saline placebo control.
*  So it seems unclear to me. I'm confused why you say that they don't go through that process.
*  It seems like a lot of them do. Here's the thing. I was saying that for many years,
*  because we couldn't find any. And then in 2016, in March, I met President Trump, ordered Dr. Fauci
*  to meet with me, and Dr. Fauci and Francis Collins. And I said to them during that meeting,
*  you have been saying that I'm not telling the truth when I said not one of these has undergone a
*  prior pre-licensure placebo control. And the polio may have had one post-licensing. Most of them
*  haven't. The polio may have, I don't know. But our question was prior to licensure,
*  do you ever test these for safety? And by the way, I think the polio vaccine did undergo a saline
*  placebo trial prior to licensure, but not for safety, only for efficacy. So I'm talking about
*  safety trials. Now, Fauci told me that the polio vaccine was not safe for the patient.
*  Fauci told me that he said, I can't find one now. He had a whole tray of files there. He said,
*  I can't find one now, but I'll send you one. I said, just for any vaccines. And we won.
*  For any of the 72 vaccines. He never did. So we sued the HHS. And after a year of stonewalling us,
*  HHS came back and they gave us a letter saying we have no pre-licensing safe trial for any of the
*  72 vaccines. And that letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit against them, because we
*  had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is posted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it.
*  So if CHD, if HHS had any study, I assume they would have given it to us and they can't find one.
*  Well, let me zoom out because a lot of the details matter here. Pre-licensure, what does
*  placebo controlled mean? I just, this is, this probably requires a rigorous analysis. Actually,
*  at this point, it would be nice for me just to give a shout out to other people, much smarter than me,
*  that people should follow along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Use their mind, learn and think.
*  So one really awesome creator, I really recommend him as Dr. Dan Wilson. He hosts the Debunk the
*  Funk podcast. Vincent Recagnolo, who hosts this week in Virology. Brilliant guy. I've had him on
*  the podcast. Somebody you've been battling with is Paul Offit. Interesting Twitter, interesting
*  books people should read and understand and read your books as well. And Eric Topol has a good
*  Twitter and good books and even Peter Hotez. I'll ask you about him. And people should, because
*  Paul Offit published a, a substack recently debunking, I think my, my discussion with,
*  with Joe Rogan. And, and we have published a debunk of his debunking. And, you know,
*  so if you read his stuff, you should read both. Yes, you should read. And I would love to debate
*  any of these guys. So Joe Rogan proposed just such a debate, which is quite fascinating to see how
*  much attention and how much funding it garnered. The debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do
*  you think Peter rejected the offer? I think it's, I, you know, again, I'm not going to look into his
*  head, but what I will say is if you're a scientist and you're making public recommendations based
*  upon what you say is evidence-based science, you ought to be able to defend that. You ought to be
*  able to defend it in a public forum and you ought to be able to defend it against all, you know,
*  all commerce. And, you know, so I, you know, if you're a scientist, science is based on,
*  is rooted in logic and reason. And if you can't use logic and reason to defend your position.
*  And by the way, I know almost all of the studies. I've been, you know, I've written books on them and
*  we've made a big effort to assemble all the studies on both sides. And so I'm prepared to
*  talk about those studies and I'm prepared to submit them in advance, you know, and for each
*  of the points. And by the way, I've done that with Peter Hotez, you know, I've, I've actually,
*  because I had this, this kind of informal debate with him several years ago with a, with a referee
*  at that time. And we were debating not only by phone, but by email. And on those emails,
*  every point that he would make, I would cite science and he could never come back with science.
*  He could never come back with publications. He would give publications that had nothing to do
*  with, for example, thimerosal vaccines, mercury-based vaccines. He sent me one time 16
*  studies to, to, to rebut something I'd said about thimerosal and not one of those studies. They were
*  all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real debate where
*  you're, you know, you're, you're using reason and isolating points and having a, you know,
*  a rational discourse. I don't think that he, I don't blame him for not debating me because I
*  don't think he has the science. Are there aspects of all the work you've done on vaccines, all the
*  advocacy you've done that you found out that you were not correct on, that you were wrong on, that
*  you've changed your mind on? Yeah, there are many times over time that I, you know, I found that
*  I've made mistakes and we correct those mistakes. You know, I run a big organization and I do a lot
*  of tweets. You know, I'm very careful. For example, my Instagram, I was taken down for,
*  for misinformation, but there was no misinformation on my Instagram. Everything that I cited on
*  Instagram was cited or a source to a government database or to peer reviewed science. But for
*  example, the defender, which was our, our organization's newsletter, we summarize scientific
*  reports all the time. That's one of the things, the services that we provide. We watched the,
*  you know, PubMed and we watched the peer reviewed publications and we summarize them when they come
*  out. We have made mistakes. When we make mistakes, we are rigorous about acknowledging it,
*  apologizing for it and changing it. That's what we do. I think we have one of the most robust
*  fact checking operations anywhere in journalism today. We actually do real science and you know,
*  there, listen, I've put up on my Twitter account and I, there's, there are numerous times that I've
*  made mistakes on Twitter and I apologize for it. And people say to me, you know, oh, that's weird.
*  I've never seen anybody apologize on Twitter. And I think it's really important at the only, of course,
*  human beings make mistakes. My book is, you know, 230, 40, 50,000 words. There's going to be a
*  mistake in there. But you know, what I say at the beginning of the book, if you see a mistake in
*  here, please notify me. I give away that people can notify me. And if somebody points out a mistake,
*  I'm going to change it. I'm not going to dig my feet in and say, you know, I'm not going to
*  acknowledge this. So some of the things we've been talking about, you've, you've been an outspoken
*  contrarian on some very controversial topics. This has garnered some fame and recognition
*  in part for being attacked and standing strong against those attacks.
*  If I may say for being a martyr, do you worry about the, this drug of martyrdom that might cloud
*  your judgment? First of all, yeah, I don't consider myself a martyr and I've never considered myself a
*  victim. I make choices about my life and I, you know, and I'm, I'm content with those choices and
*  peaceful with them. I'm not trying to be a martyr or a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think
*  is right because I want to be peaceful inside of myself. But I, the only guard I have is just,
*  is, you know, fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong,
*  for example, if you come back and say, look, Bobby, here's a polio, here's a safety study on polio
*  that was done pre-licenser and used a real salient solution. I'm going to put that on my Twitter and
*  I'm going to say I was wrong. There is one out there. So, you know, but that's all I can do.
*  All right. I have to ask you are in great shape. Can you go through your diet and exercise routine?
*  I do intermittent fasting. So I eat between noon. I start at my first meal at around noon
*  and then I try to stop eating at six or seven. And then I hike every day.
*  Morning, evening.
*  In the morning, I go to a meeting first thing in the morning, 12, 7 meeting, and then I go hike
*  and I hike uphill for a mile and a half up and a mile and a half down with my dogs. I do my
*  meditations. And then I go to the gym and I go to the gym for 35 minutes. I do a short time. I've
*  been exercising for 50 years. And what I found is it's sustainable if I do just a short periods.
*  And I do four different routines at the gym and I never relax at the gym. I go in there and I have
*  a very intense exercise. I lived, you know, I mean, I could tell you what my routine is, but I do
*  I do backs one day, back just one day, legs, and then a miscellaneous. And I do 12. My first set
*  of everything is I try to reach failure at 12 reps. And then my fourth set of everything is a strip set.
*  I do, I take a lot of vitamins. I can't even list them to you here because I, you know,
*  I couldn't even remember them all, but I take a ton of vitamins and nutrients.
*  I'm on an anti-aging protocol from my doctor that includes testosterone replacement.
*  But I don't take any steroids. I don't take any anabolic steroids or anything like that. And the
*  DRT I use is bio identical to what my body produced.
*  LW What are your thoughts on hormone therapy in general?
*  Dr. Michael S. Lange I've talked to a lot of doctors about that stuff,
*  you know, because I'm interested in health. And, you know, I've heard really good things about it,
*  but I don't know. I'm definitely not an expert on it.
*  LW About God, you wrote, God talks to human beings through many vectors,
*  wise people, organized religion, the great books of religions, through art, music, and poetry.
*  But nowhere was such detail and grace and joy as through creation. When we destroy nature,
*  we diminish our capacity to sense the divine. What is your relationship? And what is your
*  understanding of God? Who is God? Dr. Michael S. Lange
*  Well, I mean, God is incomprehensible. You know, I mean, I guess most philosophers would say we're,
*  you know, we're inside the mind of God. And so it would be impossible for us,
*  Sanders, and you know, what actually would, you know, what God's form is there. But I mean,
*  for me, I have a, let's say this, I had when I was, I was raised in a very, very deeply religious
*  setting. So we went to church in the summer, oftentimes twice a day,
*  the morning mass. And we went to, we definitely went every Sunday. And we, and I went,
*  we prayed in the morning, we prayed before and after every meal. We prayed at night, we sent a
*  rosary, sometimes three rosaries a night. And my father read us the Bible. Whenever he was home,
*  he would read us, you know, we'd all get in the bed and he'd read us the Bible stories.
*  And I went to Catholic schools, I went to Jesuit schools, I went to the nuns,
*  and I went to a Quaker school at one point. When I, I became a drug addict when I was about 15
*  years old, about a year after my dad died, I was addicted to drugs for 14 years. During that time,
*  when you're an addict, you're living against conscience. And when you're living, I never,
*  you know, I was always trying to get off of drugs, never able to, but I never felt good about what I
*  was doing. And when you're living against conscience, you kind of push God to the peripheries of your
*  life. Oh, I'll call me he, it recedes and gets smaller. And then when I got sober,
*  I knew that I had a couple of experiences. One is that I had a friend of my brother's,
*  one of my brothers who died of this disease of addiction, had a good friend who had used to take
*  drugs with us. And he became a Mooney. So he became a follower of Reverend Stun Young Moon.
*  And he's at that point, his compulsion, he had the same kind of compulsion that I had,
*  and yet it was completely removed from him. And so, and he used to come and hang out with us,
*  but he would not want to take drugs, even if I was taking them right in front of him. He was,
*  he was immune to it. He'd become impervious to that impulse. And I, when I was in the,
*  when I first got sober, I was, I knew that I did not want to be the kind of person who was,
*  you know, waking up every day and white-knuckling sobriety and just, you know, trying to resist,
*  resist through willpower. And by the way, I had, I had iron willpower as a kid, I gave up candy for
*  Len when I was 12, and I didn't eat it again until I was in college. I gave up, I gave up desserts
*  the next year for Len, and I didn't ever eat another dessert until I was in college. And I
*  was trying to bulk up for rugby and for sports. So I felt like I could do anything with my willpower,
*  but somehow this particular thing, you know, the addiction was completely impervious to it.
*  And it was cunning, baffling, incomprehensible. I could not understand why I couldn't just say no
*  and then never do it again like I did with everything else. And so I was living against
*  conscience. And I thought about this guy, and I, you know, reflecting my own prejudices at that
*  time in my life, I said to myself, I didn't want to be, I didn't want to be like a drug addict who
*  was wanting a drug all the time and just not being able to do it. I wanted to completely realign my
*  myself so that I was somebody who got up every day and just didn't want to take drugs, never thought
*  of them. You know, I kissed the wife and children and went to work and was never thought about drugs
*  the whole day. And I knew that people throughout history had done that. You know, I'd read The
*  Lives of the Saints. I knew St. Augustine had a very, very dissolute youth and, you know,
*  had this spiritual realignment transformation. I knew the same thing had happened to St. Paul,
*  you know, Damascus, the same thing had happened to St. Francis. St. Francis also had a
*  dissolute and fun-loving youth and had, you know, had this deep spiritual realignment.
*  And I knew that that had happened to people throughout history. And I thought that's what
*  I needed, you know, something like that. I had the example of this friend of mine,
*  and I used to think about him and I would think this again reflects the bias and, you know,
*  probably the meanness of myself at that time. But I said I'd rather be dead than be a Mooney.
*  But I wish I somehow could distill that power that he got without becoming a religious nuisance.
*  And at that time, I picked up a book by Carl Jung called Synchronicity. And Jung, he was a
*  psychiatrist, he was a contemporary of Freud's. Freud was his mentor and Freud wanted him to be
*  his replacement, but Freud was an avowed atheist. And Jung was a deeply spiritual man. He had these
*  very intense and genuine spiritual experiences from when he was a little boy from his three years
*  old that he remembers. His biography is fascinating about him because he remembers him with such a
*  detail. And he was interesting to me because he was a very faithful scientist. And I considered
*  myself a science-based person from when I was little. And yet he had this spiritual dimension
*  to him, which infused all of his thinking and really I think made him, you know,
*  branded his form of recovery or of treatment. And he thought that he had this experience that he
*  describes in this book where he's sitting up on the third, he ran one of the biggest sanitariums
*  in Europe in Zurich. And he was sitting up on the third floor of this building. And he's talking
*  to a patient who was describing her dream to him. And the fulcrum of that dream was a scarab beetle,
*  which was an insect that is very, very uncommon, if at all, in Northern Europe. But it's a
*  common figure in the iconography of Egypt and the hieroglyphics on the walls of the pyramids,
*  etc. And while he was talking to her, he heard this bing, bing, bing on the window behind him.
*  And he didn't want to turn around to take his attention off her, but finally he does it.
*  In a exasperation, he turns around, he throws up the window and a scarab beetle flies in and
*  lands in his hand. And he shows it to the woman and he says, is this what you were thinking of?
*  Is this what you were dreaming about? And he was struck by that experience, which was similar to
*  other experiences he had like that. And that's what synchronicity means. It's an incident,
*  a coincidence. And if you're talking with somebody about somebody that you haven't thought about in
*  20 years and that person calls on the phone, that's synchronicity. And he believed it was a
*  way that God intervened in our lives that broke all the rules of nature that he had set up,
*  the rules of physics, the rules of mathematics, to reach in and sort of tap us on the shoulder
*  and say, I'm here. And so he tried to reproduce that in a clinical setting. And he would put one
*  guy in one room and another guy in another room and have them flip cards and guess what the other
*  guy had flipped. And he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance, laws of mathematics,
*  that he would approve the existence of an unnatural law, a supernatural law. And that was the first
*  step to proving the existence of a God. He never succeeds in doing it, but he says in the book,
*  even though I can't prove using empirical and scientific tools the existence of a God,
*  I can show through anecdotal evidence, having seen thousands of patients come through this
*  institution that people who believe in God get better faster and that the recovery is more
*  enduring than people who don't. And for me, hearing that was more impactful than if he had claimed
*  that he had proved the existence of a God because I wouldn't have believed that. But I was already
*  at a mindset where I would have done anything I could to improve my chances of never having
*  to take drugs again by even 1%. And if believing in God was going to help me, whether there's a
*  God up there or not, believing in one itself had the power to help me. I was going to do that.
*  So then the question is, how do you start believing in something that you can't see or smell or hear
*  or touch or taste or acquire with your senses? And Jung provides the formula for that. And he says,
*  act as if, you fake it till you make it. And so that's what I started doing. I just started
*  pretending there was a God watching me all the time and kind of life was a series of tests.
*  And there was a bunch of moral decisions that I had to make every day. And each one,
*  you know, these were all just little things that I did. But each one now for me at a moral dimension,
*  like when I, you know, when the alarm goes off, do I lay in bed for an extra 10 minutes with my
*  indolent thoughts or do I jump right out of bed? Do I make my bad most important decision of the
*  day? Do I hang up the towels? You know, do I, when I go into the closet and pull out my blue jeans
*  and a bunch of those wire hangers fall on the ground, do I shut the door and say, I'm too much,
*  I'm too important to do that, that somebody else's job or not? And so, do I put the water in the ice
*  tray before I put in the freezer? Do I put the shopping cart back in the, you know, place that
*  it's supposed to go in the parking lot of the Safeway? And if I make a whole bunch of those choices
*  right, that I maintain myself in a posture of surrender, which keeps me open to the power of,
*  to my higher power, like to my God. And when I do those things right, when I, you know,
*  so much about addiction is about abuse of power, abuse of, all of us have some power, whether it's,
*  you know, good looks or whether it's, you know, connections or education or family or whatever.
*  And there's always a temptation to use those to fulfill self-will. And the challenge is how do you
*  use those always to serve instead God's will and, you know, the good of our community. And that,
*  to me, is kind of the struggle. And when I do that, I feel God's power coming through me
*  and that I can do things. I'm much more effective as a human being. That gnawing, you know, anxiety
*  that I lived with for so many years and my God, that it's gone. And that I can kind of like
*  put down the oars and hoist the sail and, you know, and the wind takes me and I can,
*  I can see the evidence of it in my life. And, you know, the big thing, you know, the temptation for
*  me is that when all these good things start happening in my life and the cash and prizes
*  start flowing in, you know, how do I maintain that posture of surrender? How do I stay surrendered
*  then when my inclination is to say to God, thanks God, I got it from here and drive the car off the
*  cliff again? And so, you know, I had a spiritual awakening and my desire for drugs and alcohol was
*  lifted miraculously. And to me, it was as much a miracle as if I had, if I'd been able to walk on
*  water because I had tried everything earnestly, sincerely and honestly for a decade to try to
*  stop and I could not do it under my own power. And then all of a sudden it was lifted effortlessly.
*  And, you know, so I saw that evidence, early evidence of God in my life and of the power.
*  And, and I see it now, you know, every day of my life.
*  RG So adding that moral dimension to all of your actions is how you're able to
*  win that Camus battle against the absurd.
*  CICIFUS Exactly. It's all the same thing. It's the battle to just, to do the right thing.
*  RG And now Cicifus was able to find somehow happiness.
*  CICIFUS Yeah.
*  RG Well, Bobby, thank you for the stroll through some of the most important moments in,
*  in recent human history and for running for president. And thank you for talking today.
*  CICIFUS Thank you, Lex.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from John
*  F. Kennedy. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.
*  Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Instead, let us accept our own responsibility
*  for the future. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
