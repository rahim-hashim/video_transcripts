# ThePrimeagen: Programming, AI, ADHD, Productivity, Addiction, and God | Lex Fridman Podcast #461
**Lex Fridman:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8)
*  The following is a conversation with Michael Paulson, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=0.0s)]
*  better known online as ThePrimogen. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2.84s)]
*  He is a programmer who has entertained [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6.3s)]
*  and inspired millions of people [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8.96s)]
*  to have fun building stuff with software, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10.8s)]
*  whether you're a newbie or a seasoned developer [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13.52s)]
*  who has been battling it out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17.52s)]
*  in the software engineering trenches for decades. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19.86s)]
*  In short, ThePrimogen is a legendary programmer [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=22.6s)]
*  and a great human being [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=26.979999999999997s)]
*  with an inspiring roller coaster of a life story. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=28.18s)]
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=31.88s)]
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=33.9s)]
*  in the description. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  And now, dear friends, here's ThePrimogen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=37.3s)]
*  What do you love most about programming? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=42.5s)]
*  What brings you joy when you program? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=44.76s)]
*  I can tell you the first time that I ever felt love [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=46.86s)]
*  in programming or felt that joy or that excitement, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=49.36s)]
*  which was in college. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=52.26s)]
*  It was the second class data structures. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=54.06s)]
*  And the teacher that was teaching, Ray Babcock, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=57.5s)]
*  he was talking about linked lists. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=59.86s)]
*  Now, you have to learn Java [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=61.86s)]
*  at Montana State University when I went. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=64.18s)]
*  And so he's off there kind of explaining [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  this whole linked list thing and all that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=68.3s)]
*  And then he shows code. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=70.06s)]
*  And in the code, it's like abstract class node [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  or whatever it was. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=74.12s)]
*  I can't remember what it was. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  And then it had a private member [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  and that private member was of type node. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  And I've never seen that before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  It is a class that is called node [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=81.2s)]
*  with a member that is of itself. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=82.96s)]
*  And for the first time ever, I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=85.16s)]
*  Like there's no end, there's no way to iterate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=88.94s)]
*  This is not like a set of 10 items. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  This is a set of infinite items. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=93.78s)]
*  And so like my mind kind of like exploded in that moment. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  Like there's actually, like what you can express is huge. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=99.46s)]
*  I can see what memory looks like. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  Like I can see this kind of hopping through space. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  And I just remember being just so blown away [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  because up until that point, everything was just, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=108.88s)]
*  all right, I have a list of 10 items. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  I have a list of 20 items, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=112.32s)]
*  It was very rigid and small. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=114.38s)]
*  And the things I built were really small and trivial. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=116.66s)]
*  And all of a sudden I felt like I could build [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=119.22s)]
*  like anything in that one moment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  And it was so amazing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=123.1s)]
*  I just remember sitting in class for what, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=124.33999999999999s)]
*  I don't even remember how long those classes were anything [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=127.05999999999999s)]
*  but I just remember being just completely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  like profoundly impacted by this notion. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=131.45999999999998s)]
*  And so I just sat there and I watched it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=134.42s)]
*  I had the exact same experience in heavens forbid [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=136.14s)]
*  by a software engineering class. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  When we talked about the decorator pattern [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=140.22s)]
*  where you can keep on constructing these objects [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=141.74s)]
*  in this recursive way. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=143.62s)]
*  Not that I think that's actually a good idea to do [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=144.46s)]
*  but just watching that and realizing like there's so many [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=146.66s)]
*  weird and unique ways you can solve problems. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=149.02s)]
*  And like you can just, anything your mind can think of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=151.78s)]
*  you can just create that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=154.32s)]
*  And I just remember getting just so excited [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=155.86s)]
*  about the possibility that anything is possible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=158.7s)]
*  Yeah, let's wax philosophical about a linked list. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=161.78s)]
*  It is pretty profound for people who don't know a node [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=165.38s)]
*  in a linked list doesn't know anything [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=168.66s)]
*  about the world it's in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=170.62s)]
*  It only knows about the thing it's linked to its neighbor. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=171.88s)]
*  Maybe that's symbolic. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a metaphor for all of us humans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=178.08s)]
*  There's billions of us on this planet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=180.56s)]
*  We only know about our local little network. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=182.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=184.72s)]
*  And it's kind of beautiful. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=185.56s)]
*  And you realize like in that little simple data structure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=186.38s)]
*  you can construct arbitrarily large systems [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=190.52s)]
*  and they're like roots that go through memory. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=193.72s)]
*  And then of course that's where you get [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=197.26s)]
*  all the programming languages that allow you to dump junk [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=198.94s)]
*  into memory and have memory leaks [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=203.14s)]
*  and therefore create infinite pain [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  as you try to figure out where that unfreed memory is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=208.77999999999997s)]
*  For me, yeah, probably so beautiful the way you put that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  Linked lists are indeed beautiful. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=220.06s)]
*  Recursion also for me. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=221.88s)]
*  When I finally wrap my brain around what it means to write [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  a recursive function. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  What was the thing? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=229.4s)]
*  What was the one that taught you? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=230.56s)]
*  Cause I think we all probably, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=233.08s)]
*  you probably did factorial where you like, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  just do like a quick factorial of it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=236.68s)]
*  It just doesn't hit home. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  What was the thing that kind of made it hit home? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=239.24s)]
*  I don't remember the first. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=241.44s)]
*  I remember my first. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  How do you not remember your first? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=246.94s)]
*  It was magic. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=248.16s)]
*  I've had so many that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=249.0s)]
*  I mean, you are a lisp guy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=251.16s)]
*  You're probably pretty used to the recursion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=252.24s)]
*  Yeah, all I remember is just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  surrounded by C of parentheses. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=256.44s)]
*  I mean, that's really probably when I, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=259.7s)]
*  in high school, I think it was either Java or C++. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=262.42s)]
*  Wow, how do I not remember that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=265.9s)]
*  It must've been C++. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=267.26s)]
*  And then college, it was the generic bullshit [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=268.74s)]
*  software engineering classes were Java. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=273.14s)]
*  But then the renegades, the cool kids were all using lisp. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=277.9s)]
*  That's when you're doing the AI, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=283.32s)]
*  the quote unquote AI at that time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=285.58s)]
*  That was lisp. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=287.82s)]
*  If you want to write a chess engine, you would use lisp. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  And so for me, probably the moment I really fell in love [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=293.08s)]
*  with programming was lisp and writing like Othello programs [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  and chess engines, all kinds of engines that play a game. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=302.7s)]
*  And then I could play against that thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=306.36s)]
*  And that thing would beat me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=308.74s)]
*  The joy of being destroyed by the thing you've created. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=310.36s)]
*  And oh, Game of Life too, Cellular Automata. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=314.02s)]
*  That's when I built that, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  all kinds of programming languages. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  That's less about programming languages [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  and more about the system you create. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=324.02s)]
*  And that just filled me with infinite joy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=325.96s)]
*  Having, now similar to the link list situation, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  creating a system where each individual cell [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=332.82s)]
*  only knows about its neighbors [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=335.88s)]
*  and operates in a very simple rules. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=338.58s)]
*  But when you take that system as a whole [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=342.04s)]
*  and allow it to evolve over time, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=344.4s)]
*  it can create infinite complexity. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=346.12s)]
*  So I just, man, those are many pothead moments [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=348.14s)]
*  where I'm just like looking at the beautiful complexity [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=352.96s)]
*  that can be created with Cellular Automata. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=356.36s)]
*  That filled me with just infinite joy for sure. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=357.92s)]
*  But yeah, all I remember is parentheses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=362.06s)]
*  So my first, memories of my first are drowned [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=364.32s)]
*  in a sea of parentheses. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=369.32s)]
*  Oh man, mine is, I have, well, first off, mine was in Java. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=371.9s)]
*  So my first was a little bit more rigid, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=375.58s)]
*  kind of a corporate, a corporate experience, but. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=377.34s)]
*  Cold, meaningless. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=381.38s)]
*  Yeah, I was in a lab. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=382.78s)]
*  Everyone was using CentOS at that or CentOS or however you say. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=384.82s)]
*  I always call that CentOS, the fresh maker. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  And so it's just like, I'm in this very cold. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=390.02s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=392.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=393.08s)]
*  I'm in like this cold, rigid environment [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=394.02s)]
*  with my Microsoft keyboard programming away in Java. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=396.74s)]
*  And I still, I have just such this memory of despair [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=399.86s)]
*  because I love programming. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=403.06s)]
*  This was after the linked list [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=405.66s)]
*  and I cannot figure out recursion. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=407.1s)]
*  And so I go to the university store and I buy a book [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=410.5s)]
*  and it's die tell and die tell, learn Java. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=414.5s)]
*  And it has a section recursion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=416.5s)]
*  So I opened it up and I start reading it [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=417.7s)]
*  and it just doesn't hit home. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=419.22s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm spiraling into this like, kind of, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=420.68s)]
*  maybe I'm not a programmer. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=423.92s)]
*  Maybe I'm not worthy enough to enter into this circle [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=425.02000000000004s)]
*  of people who can figure out what the heck recursion means. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=427.94s)]
*  And so die tell and die tells like, I still remember this. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=430.46s)]
*  Their phrase, their exact phrase was every young [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=433.3s)]
*  budding developer solves this recursion program. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=435.82s)]
*  And it was the tower of Hanoi. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=439.38s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=441.38s)]
*  I don't know if I can solve the tower of Hanoi to this day. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=442.22s)]
*  It's like a very hard recursive problem. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=445.1s)]
*  And I just sat there and thought, oh my gosh, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna make it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=451.82s)]
*  And I sat there in the lab for eight hours, 10 hours [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=453.22s)]
*  doing these things, so worried. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=456.9s)]
*  It's the week of recursion. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  We have to do a lab assignment. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to do it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=462.34s)]
*  And I just remember being like genuinely worried about that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  And then, because I always, my big problem was, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  is like, okay, two factorial. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=468.73999999999995s)]
*  Why not just use a for loop? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=470.26s)]
*  Okay, what about Fibonacci sequence? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=472.09999999999997s)]
*  Why not use a for loop? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  Or like, I don't understand. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  What's the purpose of recursion? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=476.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand it yet. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=477.58s)]
*  It's so powerful. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=478.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=479.73999999999995s)]
*  It looks like a really complicated for loop. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=480.56s)]
*  And so I just could not understand it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=482.17999999999995s)]
*  And then the lab came that day [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=484.17999999999995s)]
*  and it was, I'm gonna give you a 2D array [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=486.34s)]
*  you have to read from a file. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=489.5s)]
*  This is what a starting position looks like. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=491.9s)]
*  This is what an ending position looks like. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=493.85999999999996s)]
*  This is what a wall looks like. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=495.34s)]
*  I want you to find to me a path through the maze. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  And so I just sat there, I'm like, okay, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=499.5s)]
*  well, I guess I can just go up [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=501.26s)]
*  and I can create like a visited grid [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=502.41999999999996s)]
*  so I know not to visit these places anymore. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  And then all of a sudden just started clicking. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=507.14s)]
*  I'm like, well, wait a second. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know the maze, but if I just go up, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  right, down and left and hop back [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=511.62s)]
*  every time I bend to that square, don't visit it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=514.24s)]
*  It will just go forever. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=517.02s)]
*  And I realized in that moment, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=518.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I actually understand recursion. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=519.7399999999999s)]
*  I've understood recursion this whole time. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=521.26s)]
*  I just never had a problem [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=523.38s)]
*  in which it actually made sense to use. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=524.54s)]
*  And that was like my big downfall [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  is that I was measuring my understanding [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=528.66s)]
*  with the problems that I had available, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=531.4599999999999s)]
*  which were just list traversal, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=533.02s)]
*  which is not a good use of recursion. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  And so I just remember that freeing, oh man, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=537.54s)]
*  recursion, it was a great moment in my life. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=540.14s)]
*  I mean, it does require, to be fair, a leap of faith, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  because people will tell you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=545.74s)]
*  those conformist dogmatic Java instructors [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=547.62s)]
*  will tell you that this is important to understand recursion, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=554.38s)]
*  but it takes a leap of faith that this is something, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=559.88s)]
*  this is a different way of looking at the world, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=564.78s)]
*  and it's a powerful way of looking at the world. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=567.06s)]
*  Actually remembered when I think I first, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=568.98s)]
*  I think I remember my first now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=574.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=577.18s)]
*  I think it was a first search for one of the games, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=580.4599999999999s)]
*  maybe a fellow, something like that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=585.38s)]
*  And for that implementing recursion, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=587.66s)]
*  understand that you can search trajectories [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  through the space of states and do that recursively. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  That was mind blowing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=596.78s)]
*  Just imagining like the possibilities. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like numbers flying. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=602.3399999999999s)]
*  It was like the beautiful mind. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  And then that's when I also discovered conspiracy theories. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=605.6999999999999s)]
*  That was, and I just saw, I saw the truth. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay, yeah, so what were we talking about? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=613.54s)]
*  Oh, what was the most painful aspect of programming for you? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=615.66s)]
*  Like what memories do you have of deep, profound suffering [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=619.14s)]
*  in terms of programming in the early days? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  I would say the biggest one that I can really hold onto [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=627.42s)]
*  had to be one of two experiences. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=632.4599999999999s)]
*  The first experience was when I was at a place [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=635.78s)]
*  called Schedulicity. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  And am I not allowed to say the place? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=639.06s)]
*  No, you're allowed. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure if they're even operating still at this point, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=644.5s)]
*  but they're in both. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=646.42s)]
*  There's just something funny about the name, I'm sorry. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=647.26s)]
*  Oh, Schedulicity, yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  They actually, the name was so bad [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  that when you looked at their like paid for Google ad terms [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=652.5s)]
*  that they would make sure that they're at the top of the list. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=655.78s)]
*  The spellings were just insane [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=657.9399999999999s)]
*  because no one knew how to spell the word Schedulicity. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=659.54s)]
*  It was just like the Google optimizing for that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=663.02s)]
*  is just hilarious. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=665.38s)]
*  But okay, go back to the thing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=667.18s)]
*  And the thing that kills me the most about programming, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=669.02s)]
*  what I actually considered the worst aspect of programming [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  is when you know everything. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  And so when I was at this job, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=676.8199999999999s)]
*  it's just every single day I'd come in, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=678.7399999999999s)]
*  there were no surprises, there was no questions. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=681.18s)]
*  I didn't understand the code base, sure, that's fair. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=684.3s)]
*  I didn't understand all the things about the code base, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=686.26s)]
*  but I knew I was gonna go in. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=688.02s)]
*  I was gonna generate some sort of object from the database. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  I was gonna take that object from the database [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=691.98s)]
*  and I was just gonna map it over [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=693.62s)]
*  and just display it on the webpage. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=694.86s)]
*  There's no creativity, there's nothing to it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=696.38s)]
*  It's very like almost factory line kind of work. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=698.62s)]
*  And that was a very kind of difficult moment for me, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=701.74s)]
*  which is I didn't enjoy programming [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=705.02s)]
*  because like I knew everything about it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=707.74s)]
*  I already knew exactly what I was gonna do that day. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=709.46s)]
*  I knew all the hurdles I was gonna have to go over. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=711.78s)]
*  There was no unknown unknowns, if you will. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=714.22s)]
*  It was just knowns at all times. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=717.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's just, for me, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=720.4599999999999s)]
*  that is the worst part about programming [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=722.06s)]
*  is when you already know the solution [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  and it's just a matter of how fast you can type [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=725.42s)]
*  and get it out from your head to your hands. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=727.5799999999999s)]
*  So the absence of uncertainty, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=730.06s)]
*  the absence of challenge was the pain. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=731.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  That's pretty profound, Prime. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=735.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm more than just good looks, I want you to know that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=738.06s)]
*  It's a low bar. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=741.9s)]
*  What do you identify as? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=743.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm enjoying asking the general question. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  38 male. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=747.38s)]
*  Male. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=748.9799999999999s)]
*  And my husband, a beautiful wife. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=750.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  You stream about all kinds of programming, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=753.0200000000001s)]
*  but what kind of programmer are you? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=755.38s)]
*  Are you full-stack developer, web programming, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=758.58s)]
*  and maybe can you lay out all the different kinds [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=761.98s)]
*  of programming and then place yourself in that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=764.7800000000001s)]
*  in terms of your identity, sexual identity as well? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=768.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can get it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=770.34s)]
*  We can put it all in there. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=772.0200000000001s)]
*  Plus, I mean, obviously those two are very, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=772.86s)]
*  very tightly coupled. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=775.3000000000001s)]
*  I have seen you on the border of sexually aroused [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=776.4200000000001s)]
*  and you got real excited about OCaml or... [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=780.5400000000001s)]
*  OCaml, let's go. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Dylan Mulroy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=786.82s)]
*  Okay, wow. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=787.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=789.22s)]
*  I did not expect that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=790.0600000000001s)]
*  That escalated quickly. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=791.1400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, what do you identify as? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=792.22s)]
*  Okay, so first let's do the previous [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=793.74s)]
*  or the in-between question first, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  which is the different kind of archetypes. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=798.62s)]
*  I think that's a really interesting kind of question [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=800.58s)]
*  because if you go on Twitter or you're new, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=802.5s)]
*  your thoughts are probably that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=804.94s)]
*  there is just web programming [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=806.9000000000001s)]
*  and maybe there's some other stuff, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=808.86s)]
*  yeah, like game programming, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=809.86s)]
*  but you'd like game programming in JavaScript and on the web. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=810.86s)]
*  You know, like there's this very kind of very myopic view [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=813.78s)]
*  of the programming world. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=817.1800000000001s)]
*  And I bet if you ask a lot of people these days, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=818.34s)]
*  like what is the most popular form of programming? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=820.74s)]
*  They'd probably say web. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  If you said what contains the most amount of repos, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=824.34s)]
*  how many percentage of repos on GitHub are web-based? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=826.82s)]
*  They'd probably say 90% or some huge number. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=829.46s)]
*  But the reality is that there's [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=832.22s)]
*  an entire embedded robotics world. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=833.86s)]
*  You're familiar with the ML side of things. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=836.66s)]
*  There's networking, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=839.3399999999999s)]
*  there's gonna be just like [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=840.54s)]
*  performance operating systems, compilers. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=841.38s)]
*  There's just huge amounts of variation [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=843.8599999999999s)]
*  of all these different type of programming verticals [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=845.8199999999999s)]
*  that you can be. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=847.9399999999999s)]
*  And so we often talk about programming [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=848.78s)]
*  in perspective of web or something that's pretty narrow. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's just a social construct of Twitter [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=853.5799999999999s)]
*  more than anything else that it's actually, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=855.8599999999999s)]
*  I don't believe it's that representative [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=858.06s)]
*  of the entire kind of programming world out there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=859.9799999999999s)]
*  And I think a lot of programming is really, really fun. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  There's some really great stuff. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=865.06s)]
*  Building your own language [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=866.1s)]
*  is just a very fun experience to do. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=867.34s)]
*  Every programmer should just do that once [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=869.74s)]
*  just to have a completely different perspective [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=871.34s)]
*  on how things work in life. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=874.98s)]
*  But as far as what do I do, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=876.5400000000001s)]
*  I've always looked at myself as a tools engineer. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=877.9s)]
*  So at my time at my jobs, typically, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=880.22s)]
*  I would start off on the UI and then they'd be like, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=883.5400000000001s)]
*  okay, well, hey, we need a library for this thing. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=886.46s)]
*  So then I'd be the one writing like the library. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=888.4200000000001s)]
*  So in 2012, 2013, I was writing a UI library [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=890.1800000000001s)]
*  for the web that can behave just like an iPad. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=894.54s)]
*  So you can pinch and zoom on it, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  but it's still a webpage [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=898.6999999999999s)]
*  because we didn't have any of that stuff back then. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=899.62s)]
*  It was a canvas, had to do all the like matrices operations [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=901.0999999999999s)]
*  and all that stuff to kind of, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=904.2199999999999s)]
*  it felt like you're on an iPad, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=905.86s)]
*  but it actually wasn't on an iPad. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  And this was iPad 2, by the way. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=909.54s)]
*  So this is a long time ago. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=911.18s)]
*  And so every single time I got into a job, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=913.5799999999999s)]
*  it's like, okay, hey, we need to do a library. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=915.54s)]
*  Hey, can you work on a build system? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=917.42s)]
*  So back then there was no grunt, there was no gulp, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=919.3399999999999s)]
*  there was no any of those things. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=921.98s)]
*  So I had to hand roll my own JavaScript build system. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=923.14s)]
*  And so I always fell into these positions [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=926.66s)]
*  of building tools for developers to be successful. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=928.38s)]
*  And I've always really enjoyed that region. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=931.46s)]
*  So as I went on to say Netflix, spent 10 years there, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=933.42s)]
*  I'd say the majority of my 10 years [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=937.74s)]
*  were building things for developers to use [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=939.3s)]
*  that they could be successful at their job. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=943.04s)]
*  And so I've always really enjoyed that aspect [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=945.74s)]
*  because your shareholders [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  and the people that use your program understand programming [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=949.74s)]
*  and they're gonna say like, hey, I need this. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=952.42s)]
*  And typically the thing that they need, they actually want. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=954.62s)]
*  Whereas with people, people want stuff, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=958.2199999999999s)]
*  but what they actually need versus what they actually want [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=960.74s)]
*  often are kind of like this weird separation. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=962.9399999999999s)]
*  People, that's like the old Henry Ford quote, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=965.86s)]
*  I just want a faster horse. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=968.14s)]
*  And he's like, no, what you actually want is a car. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=969.2199999999999s)]
*  And so it's like this, you have to play this game [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=970.9799999999999s)]
*  of trying to really figure it out. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=973.06s)]
*  Whereas developers, it's like, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=975.0s)]
*  you know what I'm doing, I know what you want, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=976.54s)]
*  let's figure it out together. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=978.5799999999999s)]
*  That's actually, that gives you a really nice big picture [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=980.2199999999999s)]
*  view of programming in general. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=982.66s)]
*  So I love the idea of just kind of starting [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=984.06s)]
*  at the interface, like you need to pinch [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=987.18s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=989.7399999999999s)]
*  And then figure out the entire thing that requires [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=990.5799999999999s)]
*  to make that happen, including maybe the side quest tooling, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=993.26s)]
*  how to make it more productive and efficient [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=997.8599999999999s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=999.62s)]
*  So the entirety, the entirety of the thing, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1000.4599999999999s)]
*  that's really cool. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1002.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that would be full stack [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1003.2199999999999s)]
*  by the general definition of full stack, meaning like, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1006.6999999999999s)]
*  versus like systems, like starting at the bottom [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1010.3399999999999s)]
*  and trying to optimize a certain kind of specific thing [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1014.2199999999999s)]
*  without seeing the big picture of like [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  what the resulting interface would look like. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1019.14s)]
*  And a lot of people, in web programming, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1021.78s)]
*  they never go beyond the front end of how the thing looks. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1025.06s)]
*  They kind of always assume there'll be somebody, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1027.94s)]
*  some grunt in the shadows in the darkness of the basement [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1030.3s)]
*  that will implement the back end. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1035.3s)]
*  Some gilfoyle out there will be doing the back end. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1036.94s)]
*  Yeah, like I like to call myself a generalist [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1039.42s)]
*  just to kind of give some ideas is, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1042.06s)]
*  at one point at Netflix, I built the WebSocket connection. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1045.02s)]
*  So for TVs, how WebSocket works is code I just wrote. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  And so I built the framing thing. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1051.54s)]
*  And before that, I was doing stuff with memory. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  And before that, I built the UI for a tool. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1054.78s)]
*  It's just like, I can just do the thing. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1057.06s)]
*  You just tell me the thing to do [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1058.78s)]
*  and I'll just go do the thing. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1059.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't worry too, I don't try to get super good [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1060.9s)]
*  at one specific activity. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1064.46s)]
*  Like I don't want to be a Kubernetes engineer [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1066.3s)]
*  who's the world's greatest deployer. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1068.34s)]
*  But if I had to go learn Kubernetes, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1070.1s)]
*  I'd go learn it and learn how to deploy some things [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1071.74s)]
*  and then hopefully move on to like the next thing, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1074.46s)]
*  if that makes sense. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1076.82s)]
*  I posted about the fact that I'm talking to you on Reddit [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1078.34s)]
*  and there's a lot of wonderful questions. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1080.78s)]
*  Somebody mentioned that I should ask you about DevOps. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1083.22s)]
*  Can you explain what DevOps is? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1085.78s)]
*  Is it a kind of special ops of programmers? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1087.4199999999998s)]
*  Is it CoTM6 of developers? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1089.6599999999999s)]
*  What's DevOps? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1091.34s)]
*  Can you define what, are you a DevOps engineer? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1092.18s)]
*  Well, people keep telling me DevOps isn't real. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1094.5s)]
*  There's actually, you want platform engineers, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1096.78s)]
*  cloud engineers, infra engineers. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1098.62s)]
*  I just often think, I think the easiest way, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1101.66s)]
*  if we're doing like just kind of like some [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1103.86s)]
*  basic nomenclature, it's just DevOps are the people [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1105.78s)]
*  that make sure that when you launch a service and all that, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1108.26s)]
*  it doesn't just disappear, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1111.58s)]
*  It's all the kind of backbone of being able to operate [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1113.14s)]
*  something at scale. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1115.74s)]
*  Like you really don't, if you think about it, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1117.26s)]
*  if you're just writing a mom and pa like website, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1118.7s)]
*  people that do PHP that are doing WordPress and all that, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1121.18s)]
*  they're gonna build something, they're gonna hand it off [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1123.94s)]
*  to, I don't know, Leno, DigitalOcean, some company. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1125.7s)]
*  They don't really need a really complicated build, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1128.78s)]
*  deployment, all this. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  It's just someone with a simple website [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1133.1000000000001s)]
*  so they can sell their goods. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1135.18s)]
*  And so they don't really need that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1136.46s)]
*  And so that's kind of how I think of a DevOps [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  is when things need to scale, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1139.6200000000001s)]
*  that's kind of the person you hire. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1142.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, those people are actually amazing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1144.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1146.5s)]
*  Of the time I spent at Google, it's like, oh yeah, yeah, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1147.3400000000001s)]
*  there's all these fancy machine learning people, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1150.46s)]
*  but the folks that are running the compute, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1152.06s)]
*  the infrastructure, basically that make sure [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1155.46s)]
*  the shit doesn't go down, they're like wizards. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1159.22s)]
*  And they're essential. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1162.82s)]
*  Very incredible, like vertical of job. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1163.6599999999999s)]
*  And obviously I'm using a very broad term to describe, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1165.86s)]
*  I'm sure like a bunch, you know, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1167.98s)]
*  because making stuff doesn't go down. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1168.98s)]
*  You could also say that's like an SRE, right? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1171.3799999999999s)]
*  Site Reliability Engineer, whatever, you know, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1173.3799999999999s)]
*  the ones that wear the bomber jackets at Google. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1175.54s)]
*  And so when we say DevOps, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1178.34s)]
*  I think people get very particular about terms [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1180.02s)]
*  specifically in this category. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1182.1399999999999s)]
*  They're like, well, actually you're mentioning [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1183.34s)]
*  Infrastructure Engineer versus Site Reliability Engineer. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1184.34s)]
*  It's just like, okay, yes, I hear you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1187.5s)]
*  But generally when someone thinks DevOps, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1188.86s)]
*  they think somebody that manages the servers [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1190.9s)]
*  and their life cycles and the reliability. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1193.1s)]
*  There's DevOps, is it real? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1196.7s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1198.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1198.9s)]
*  Did Vercell kill DevOps? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1199.74s)]
*  Question mark? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1202.34s)]
*  Question mark. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1203.18s)]
*  Wow, that's, you're almost a journalist. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1204.26s)]
*  That's a headline. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's go back to the beginning. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1207.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1210.8200000000002s)]
*  Baby Prime. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1211.66s)]
*  So you mentioned Netflix. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1212.5s)]
*  You've- [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1214.3400000000001s)]
*  I worked at Netflix by the way. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1215.18s)]
*  For people who don't know who the Primogen is, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1217.5400000000002s)]
*  he mentions the fact that he has been very successful [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1222.2600000000002s)]
*  and has worked at Netflix and basically every other sentence. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1226.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1229.74s)]
*  Almost as much as I mentioned NeoVim. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1231.5s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1233.2600000000002s)]
*  Tell me more about NeoVim. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1234.42s)]
*  No, please don't. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1235.94s)]
*  So Baby Prime, at the very beginning, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1237.54s)]
*  you've had one hell of a life [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1241.46s)]
*  and I think it's inspiring to a lot of people. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1243.5s)]
*  You've gone through a lot of painful low points, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1245.3s)]
*  including meth addiction, loss. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1248.42s)]
*  And like you mentioned, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1251.26s)]
*  you've come out of that to become a successful programmer [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1253.14s)]
*  and a person that inspires a huge number of people [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1257.66s)]
*  to get into programming and just to find success in life. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1261.8200000000002s)]
*  So maybe I would love it if you laid out [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1264.5s)]
*  just your whole life journey from the beginning. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1267.66s)]
*  So I guess if we're gonna start with this whole journey, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1271.02s)]
*  I think it's probably best to start [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1272.98s)]
*  when I was about four or five years old. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1274.3s)]
*  That was the first time I was ever exposed to pornography [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1276.34s)]
*  and it's kind of just earwormed me [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1280.18s)]
*  for a large portion of my life. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1282.98s)]
*  And so I don't think there was a day that didn't go by [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1285.34s)]
*  from when I was a very young lad [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1287.9s)]
*  all the way up until I was 20 some years old, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1289.78s)]
*  where I didn't think about porn on the daily basis. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1292.54s)]
*  And so it was just like every single day, even at that young. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1295.3s)]
*  And so it was just a very mind-consuming, time-consuming, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1298.58s)]
*  thought-consuming thing that kind of plagued me [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1302.86s)]
*  from starting at a very young age. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1304.94s)]
*  When I was seven years old, my dad died. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1307.3799999999999s)]
*  That was kind of a really tough period of life. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1309.3799999999999s)]
*  I still think about this time that I went over to China [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1313.54s)]
*  and there's kind of some rules that we were given [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1318.3799999999999s)]
*  and one of the rules was just like, hey, don't talk about God. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1323.22s)]
*  And if you do use the word dad instead. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1326.46s)]
*  And I was just like, okay, dad. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1329.2600000000002s)]
*  It was like the first time I said that word [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1331.5400000000002s)]
*  in like 17 years or some long time. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1333.1000000000001s)]
*  It was like so weird to say that phrase. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1335.5400000000002s)]
*  And I was just like, oh, that was just the strangest thing [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1337.46s)]
*  I've ever said in my entire lifetime. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1340.66s)]
*  It just felt so weird. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1342.74s)]
*  So kind of rewind as I got older, obviously, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1344.38s)]
*  was very good at computers, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1347.8200000000002s)]
*  good at accessing porn, of course, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1349.42s)]
*  played video games on the internet. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1351.5s)]
*  Fun, fun kind of like side quest story. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1355.02s)]
*  I think the guy's name is Lord Talk on Twitch. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1356.98s)]
*  I can't quite remember his name, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1359.94s)]
*  but he built this game called Grail, G-R-A-A-L [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1361.46s)]
*  and Grail Online. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1365.02s)]
*  And when I was a young lad, that it was just like Zelda, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1366.14s)]
*  except for it also had a level editor [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1370.06s)]
*  and it had like a C-like language. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1371.62s)]
*  And that's how I discovered how to program [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1373.22s)]
*  is I looked at these symbols and figured out what they meant. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1374.98s)]
*  And then I was able to make things happen in the game. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1378.34s)]
*  And that was like a, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1380.3s)]
*  that's my introduction into programming. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1381.3s)]
*  So thank you, that guy, whatever your Twitch name was. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1383.1s)]
*  But all right, so keep on going. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1386.1s)]
*  As I got older, I was super bad socially. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1388.62s)]
*  I was not a very great social person. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1392.8999999999999s)]
*  High school was brutal, got made fun of a lot. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1395.3s)]
*  I wouldn't say I had a great time during high school. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1399.82s)]
*  Definitely felt very out of place or offset [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1403.3s)]
*  or maybe misplaced, if you will. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1405.98s)]
*  I'm not sure what the right word is. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1407.86s)]
*  And so of course, at that point, I just always wanted to, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1409.3400000000001s)]
*  I wanted to be accepted to fit in and all that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1413.1000000000001s)]
*  I did forget to say one side story after my dad died. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1415.78s)]
*  My brother, older brother, he got, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1418.78s)]
*  and I started getting into drugs. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1420.46s)]
*  And along with that, he exposed me to pot. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1421.74s)]
*  So at eight years old, I was smoking some marijuana [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1424.42s)]
*  for a while there until like maybe 11 or 12 and took a break. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1427.94s)]
*  And then again, did a lot of that [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1431.42s)]
*  as I got a little bit older. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  But so I kind of got a lot of these exposures fairly young. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1435.14s)]
*  16, 15 through 18, a lot of drinking and all that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1439.7s)]
*  When I graduated or as I was graduating high school, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1443.7s)]
*  it's just like, I had such sadness, if you will. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1446.3s)]
*  I was very sad about how everything went. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1450.26s)]
*  Tried to commit suicide. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1452.54s)]
*  Obviously it was a very poor attempt [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1455.02s)]
*  and I'm still here today. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1456.78s)]
*  I'm very happy about that aspect. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1458.18s)]
*  I'm glad that I didn't follow through with anything. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1459.8600000000001s)]
*  Had to go to the hospital and all that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1462.26s)]
*  And when I was done, I just still remember kind of [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1463.8600000000001s)]
*  coming out of the hospital and I was like, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1466.78s)]
*  coming out of the hospital and at like that moment, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1468.34s)]
*  it's kind of like something broken you. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1470.06s)]
*  Have you ever read the book, Wheel of Time? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1472.02s)]
*  It's 14,000 pages or something like that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1474.06s)]
*  But right around page 12,000, Rand has to intentionally [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1476.22s)]
*  kill a girl, the main character. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1479.5s)]
*  And that's like the moment he breaks [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1481.34s)]
*  and he gets into like hard Rand, Quindler ran, if you will. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1482.6999999999998s)]
*  For those that know Wheel of Time will appreciate all that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1487.02s)]
*  For those that don't, very confusing and I understand. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1490.82s)]
*  Not the Amazon movie show, not that Wheel of Time. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1492.9399999999998s)]
*  So now that we kind of go back onto it, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1497.26s)]
*  at that point, it's just like something kind of broken me. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1499.06s)]
*  And it's just like, I just didn't care anymore. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1501.62s)]
*  So all the kind of social awkwardness, if you will, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1503.54s)]
*  all that kind of just died away with me, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1505.82s)]
*  but also, so did everything else. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1508.42s)]
*  And so I started using a bunch of drugs, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1511.02s)]
*  well, LSD, mushrooms, math, did a bunch of math, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1515.5s)]
*  did a bunch of that stuff and then went off to college [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1519.66s)]
*  and continued to do a bunch of stuff. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1522.9s)]
*  I took too much acid to where for like quite a few years, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1524.54s)]
*  I had like little squigglies on the side of my eyes [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1526.86s)]
*  whenever I'd walk by high contrast objects. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1529.3s)]
*  And so it's just like that whole period of life [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1532.1799999999998s)]
*  was just kind of marked by just poor decisions. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1534.3799999999999s)]
*  And then sometime when I was about 19 years old, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1539.86s)]
*  somewhere in that range, I just had this one evening [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1543.26s)]
*  where it's just, I felt the very dramatic [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1546.9799999999998s)]
*  and real presence of God. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1548.82s)]
*  And it's just like, I kind of had this choice, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  like Frodo on a razor where it's like, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1551.9399999999998s)]
*  if I go either way, I'm gonna fall off [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1555.58s)]
*  and I need to change my life. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1557.86s)]
*  You just, you get to make the choice now. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1560.1799999999998s)]
*  Do you want to do that or not? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1562.02s)]
*  And so I remember going, okay, I do want to change my life. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1563.6599999999999s)]
*  Like, I don't like this experience. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1566.1s)]
*  I don't like what I'm living. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1568.02s)]
*  I am still very sad. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1569.26s)]
*  I still feel very desperate. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1570.3799999999999s)]
*  I still feel all those things. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1571.54s)]
*  I'm just like pretending to be this other person. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1572.5s)]
*  And then I just went to sleep that night. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1575.82s)]
*  Nothing changed in my life. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1580.9399999999998s)]
*  Everything was still the way it was. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1582.46s)]
*  I woke up the next day, the same person. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1583.74s)]
*  And I was just like, oh, that's just like such a strange, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1586.06s)]
*  weird kind of experience. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1587.86s)]
*  And I just went about my day. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1589.94s)]
*  And then I remember, I think that evening, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1591.34s)]
*  I looked at porn and all of a sudden I just had a conscious. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1593.98s)]
*  I just like this deep, profound like shame. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1599.1s)]
*  And I was like, I've never felt shame in my life. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1601.34s)]
*  Right, like I have no idea what's happening now. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1604.46s)]
*  And then all of a sudden when I smoked pot, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1607.18s)]
*  I just felt deep shame. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1608.3s)]
*  And when I hurt somebody or did something wrong, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1609.22s)]
*  it's just like I got a conscious from that evening. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1611.42s)]
*  That's what kind of my gift was, if you will. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1613.74s)]
*  And it's just like at that point, I didn't even have a choice. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1616.22s)]
*  I had to change my life. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1619.38s)]
*  Cause for whatever reason, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1621.8600000000001s)]
*  I've kind of been changed in a moment. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1622.8200000000002s)]
*  And so from there, I started actually trying in school. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1625.0200000000002s)]
*  I always kind of joke around that I got 2.14 in high school. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1627.6200000000001s)]
*  I had a teacher hand write me a note saying, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1630.5s)]
*  I was the worst student she's ever had. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1632.14s)]
*  All that kind of stuff. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1633.98s)]
*  I was not a really great student. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1634.8200000000002s)]
*  And then in that moment, it's just like, okay, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1639.1000000000001s)]
*  now life's changed and I start trying to learn. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1640.7s)]
*  And I try to become a good student. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1643.46s)]
*  And it turns out it's really hard. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1645.46s)]
*  Like I was really bad. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1646.9s)]
*  I still got Cs. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1648.5s)]
*  I went and took pre-calculus and failed pre-calculus. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1650.02s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my gosh, I used to be the smart math guy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1652.82s)]
*  And now I'm kind of the idiot failing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1655.5800000000002s)]
*  And so it's like, I'm just questioning myself and all that. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1657.3400000000001s)]
*  And I spent hours upon hours [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1660.1000000000001s)]
*  in like a studying math learning center. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1662.66s)]
*  And then just at some point, years into this journey, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1667.22s)]
*  I'm like a year and a half into this journey at this point, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1669.94s)]
*  it's just like something clicks. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1672.22s)]
*  And I go from being the worst person [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1673.66s)]
*  to just immediately becoming the best. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1676.74s)]
*  Everything after that, it's just, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1678.54s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1680.18s)]
*  All of a sudden I was the best person at math. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1681.6200000000001s)]
*  I started going into my computer science classes. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1684.38s)]
*  I just really got everything. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1686.18s)]
*  It's just like everything at just years after trying, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1687.8600000000001s)]
*  just all of a sudden became easier. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1690.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure if it happened over the course of weeks [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1692.5800000000002s)]
*  or when the easier started, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1695.38s)]
*  but it was just first predicated [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1697.14s)]
*  by just a huge amount of difficulty. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1698.58s)]
*  And then this is kind of where I started really desiring [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1700.5s)]
*  and loving the process of learning [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1703.1s)]
*  was when things started getting easier after all those years. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1704.78s)]
*  Cause I just was motivated by this desire to do something, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1706.98s)]
*  not thinking it was gonna get any easier. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1710.8999999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it just started getting easier. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1715.1799999999998s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1717.02s)]
*  And that's kind of really where, I guess, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1717.86s)]
*  I started having the biggest parts of my life change. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1719.6599999999999s)]
*  At that point, I started really, really, really wanting [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1722.54s)]
*  to never look at porn again. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1726.22s)]
*  Cause every single time just such shame [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1727.78s)]
*  and I really wanted to stop. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1729.34s)]
*  And that was by far the hardest addiction to quit. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1730.42s)]
*  Like smoking cigarettes was also [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1732.7s)]
*  really hard addiction to quit. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1734.02s)]
*  Shockingly hard addiction to quit. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1735.54s)]
*  But porn by far was just the worst of them all. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1737.58s)]
*  And then I think about 22, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1740.42s)]
*  I was finally done with all kind of addictions, if you will. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1743.5s)]
*  And then for a year, I just worked in all that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1747.3s)]
*  And I think right around maybe it was 21 and three quarters, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1749.66s)]
*  somewhere in that range. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1753.26s)]
*  I'm not really sure where I stopped all the addictions part, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1754.38s)]
*  or at least the outwardly addictions. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1757.78s)]
*  And then at some point, six months later, a year later, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1760.6200000000001s)]
*  met my beautiful wife. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1763.18s)]
*  Things just started falling more and more into place. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1765.02s)]
*  I loved more and more work. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1767.5s)]
*  I loved programming. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1769.02s)]
*  I started programming like 12 hours a day. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1770.06s)]
*  I watched the social network movie. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1772.22s)]
*  And after that, I was just like, I'm doing a startup. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1774.1000000000001s)]
*  And it's like that night I started my first startup. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1776.42s)]
*  And I was just like, so, it was in PHP, by the way. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1778.66s)]
*  PHP, yeah, 5.2 or something like that. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1781.7s)]
*  It was great, great times. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1784.14s)]
*  And I was just so motivated to do that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1785.8600000000001s)]
*  And I would just program for, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1788.06s)]
*  sometimes I'd program for 24, 36 hours straight. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1789.7s)]
*  And I just like nonstop, just that's all I wanted to do [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1792.26s)]
*  at all points. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1795.7s)]
*  I think my wife got a little sick of me. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1796.7s)]
*  I wouldn't, she was be like, can you drop me off at school? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1798.46s)]
*  And I'd be like, no, I'm programming. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1800.6200000000001s)]
*  I was not a very nice, you know, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1801.66s)]
*  I didn't think through things that well. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1803.1000000000001s)]
*  And I was just so into it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1804.82s)]
*  And I just did it nonstop. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1806.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of like how I became me is that story, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1808.5s)]
*  if that makes sense. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1812.26s)]
*  Let's try to reverse engineer some of the pain [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1813.14s)]
*  and some of the triumph. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1815.5400000000002s)]
*  You made it sound easy at times. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1816.66s)]
*  Let's try to understand it better. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1819.74s)]
*  Maybe when you were seven years old, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1821.98s)]
*  what do you think about the pain you've experienced there, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1825.26s)]
*  losing your dad? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1827.38s)]
*  What do you think, what kind of impact did it have on you? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1828.98s)]
*  What kind of memories do you have at that time? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  The best way I can kind of put it is that [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1833.7800000000002s)]
*  I just never knew what a dad was. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1835.5800000000002s)]
*  I was young enough that I could kind of maybe repress [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1837.66s)]
*  or just even have the capability [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  of remembering things long-term. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1841.66s)]
*  Cause I know most people don't remember a lot [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1843.42s)]
*  from when they're young. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1845.18s)]
*  And so I'm not exactly sure. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1846.42s)]
*  I probably as at one of the best possible ages, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1847.42s)]
*  if I'm gonna lose a dad to lose a dad, you know, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1850.3400000000001s)]
*  if you're gonna lose one, if you're 11 or 12, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1853.42s)]
*  it's like a terrible age. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1855.22s)]
*  That's what my brother was and he fell into drug addiction [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1857.46s)]
*  and never got back out. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1859.8600000000001s)]
*  And so I just kind of have more of like a fuzziness [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1861.3000000000002s)]
*  and just kind of a longing that I just wish I had a dad. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1865.5400000000002s)]
*  What impact did that have on your evolution, on your life? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1869.98s)]
*  Sort of having that longing. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1874.34s)]
*  I think that's why I was so bad socially [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1876.38s)]
*  in the sense that I was looking for approval, right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1881.22s)]
*  Like something I needed approval. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1883.78s)]
*  I think that a lot of people kind of desire that approval [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1884.98s)]
*  or that loving figure and I just didn't have that. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1887.34s)]
*  And so I think I just looked for it in everything else. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1890.34s)]
*  Right? Like if I had to psychoanalyze my actions [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1892.26s)]
*  during the time, it's not like I was actively thinking that. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1895.58s)]
*  But yeah, I just always wanted something to fill in, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1899.66s)]
*  whatever that was I felt. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1903.3s)]
*  I think a lot of people listening to this will resonate [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1904.7s)]
*  with your experience in high school. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1907.14s)]
*  Like being the outsider, being picked on, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1909.06s)]
*  struggling through a lot of different complexities at home. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1911.54s)]
*  What advice would you give to them? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1915.1s)]
*  The worst part about high school is that you're surrounded [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1918.3s)]
*  by a bunch of people your age and it feels eternal. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1920.98s)]
*  You don't think, like the people that are around you, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1925.42s)]
*  you feel like are the people that will be there [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1929.6599999999999s)]
*  for the rest of your life. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1930.78s)]
*  At least that's what I kind of like I thought. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1931.78s)]
*  And I didn't really even realize this [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1933.46s)]
*  until many years later that they are gonna be some [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1935.62s)]
*  of the least consequential people in your life, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1939.06s)]
*  which is very shocking to kind of think about, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1941.9399999999998s)]
*  especially if you're in it right now, right? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1945.02s)]
*  Like right now they are the, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1947.3s)]
*  everything that you're experiencing is your whole reality. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1948.86s)]
*  And then one day it all stops [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1951.4199999999998s)]
*  and then real life starts to begin. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1954.54s)]
*  That's such a shocking thing. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1957.42s)]
*  And if I could just tell myself that, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1958.98s)]
*  maybe I would have been a bunch of different person. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1960.66s)]
*  That's so beautifully put. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1962.66s)]
*  I mean, it's like a trial run. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1964.3s)]
*  You know, like at the beginning of video games, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1966.98s)]
*  there's a little tutorial, that's what that is. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1968.8200000000002s)]
*  And actually that should be a chance to try shit out, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1971.42s)]
*  to take risks because real life will begin [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1977.8600000000001s)]
*  where there is more consequences after that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1981.74s)]
*  Here you can, you know, if you like a girl, ask her out, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1983.9s)]
*  try, try shit. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1987.9s)]
*  If you get picked on, hit that guy back, try shit out. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1988.74s)]
*  I'm not gonna condone punching another person. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  I will beat the shit out of them and take some Jiu-Jitsu [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  and learn how to take them down. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1997.5s)]
*  And then that girl that rejected you will be like, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1998.66s)]
*  hmm, maybe I'll give that guy a second chance. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2001.8200000000002s)]
*  Be a bad motherfucker. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2004.46s)]
*  It's a chance to try stuff out. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2005.66s)]
*  This is a very motivational speech, kicking ass. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2008.22s)]
*  It is true there. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2011.42s)]
*  I mean, there is something very true about that, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2012.26s)]
*  that I think especially, I mean, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2013.7800000000002s)]
*  I have no idea what the girls experience [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2015.18s)]
*  of high school would be like, but as a guy, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2017.02s)]
*  there's definitely a lot of like physical requirements [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2018.94s)]
*  in high school. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2022.14s)]
*  There's a lot of physical measurement, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2022.98s)]
*  at least where I grew up. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2024.8200000000002s)]
*  I think that might not be true in all high schools, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2025.8600000000001s)]
*  but if they're filled with boys, it's probably true. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2027.8400000000001s)]
*  And so it's just like, yeah, it probably does help [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2031.1000000000001s)]
*  to do those things, to go to BJJ, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2034.38s)]
*  to do any of these activities, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2036.14s)]
*  because even if you don't ever kick someone's ass, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2037.94s)]
*  just having some level of confidence in yourself [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2039.76s)]
*  is probably a very valuable thing. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2041.98s)]
*  But just remembering that this is such a short, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2044.18s)]
*  tiny moment in your life, it's just like a huge help. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2048.02s)]
*  I mean, the way you phrased it is exactly right. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2052.7400000000002s)]
*  That's what it feels like, that these are the people [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2055.7000000000003s)]
*  that will be with you for the rest of your life, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2058.5s)]
*  and this is the whole world. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2061.2200000000003s)]
*  And so that means that there'll be just tremendous [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2062.9s)]
*  amount of impact if somebody picks on you, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2065.78s)]
*  or if you fall somewhere low in the hierarchy, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2067.46s)]
*  in the status hierarchy of this high school, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2072.3s)]
*  that means you'll be low in the status hierarchy [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2074.86s)]
*  of the world and you're fucked for the rest of your life. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2077.26s)]
*  And that carries a tremendous amount of weight. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2079.46s)]
*  It's just why psychologically it's extremely difficult. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2082.46s)]
*  I think it's understated often by parents, by society, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2085.6600000000003s)]
*  how difficult it is to be a high schooler, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2090.3s)]
*  how difficult psychologically it is, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2092.6400000000003s)]
*  how it actually makes sense that some people [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2094.38s)]
*  would suffer from depression and be on the verge of suicide. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2096.98s)]
*  It's very, very difficult. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2099.86s)]
*  People always say back in my day, blah, blah, blah. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's genuinely harder today than it's ever been [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2105.6800000000003s)]
*  in the sense that when I was a kid, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2108.52s)]
*  there was a qualification to people, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  meaning this is a cool guy, this is not a cool guy. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2112.8s)]
*  Today, there's a quantification of people. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  You have 32,514 people following you, you have 12. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2117.46s)]
*  People can visually, they can inspect your exact social value [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2122.44s)]
*  on whatever platform you're on, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2126.96s)]
*  and that has to be just so much harder. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2128.52s)]
*  And I can imagine that there's a lot of just so much weight [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2132.52s)]
*  to put on that, that it feels probably way worse [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  and way more damning to be uncool [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2139.24s)]
*  because you have an exact number of how uncool you are. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the challenge there. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2145.02s)]
*  And the task, the quest is to remember [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2148.2s)]
*  that just because your social circle on social media [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2152.3399999999997s)]
*  and in high school thinks you're uncool, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2156.44s)]
*  it actually might mean you are cool. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2161.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2163.5800000000004s)]
*  And you need to find that cool and grow it [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2164.42s)]
*  and let it flourish so that when real life begins, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2167.6600000000003s)]
*  you can fucking come out of the gate, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2171.0600000000004s)]
*  firing on all cylinders. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2173.7400000000002s)]
*  That's a great way to put it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2175.5800000000004s)]
*  I think if anything, high school is really bad [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2176.7400000000002s)]
*  at picking out the cool people. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2181.5s)]
*  That like, whatever the system, the hierarchy that forms, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2183.3s)]
*  it is such a basic bitch hierarchy. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2187.0600000000004s)]
*  You're good at very generic shit. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2190.54s)]
*  That's how you rise. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2192.54s)]
*  Your parents bought you an expensive car. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2193.62s)]
*  Expensive car, right. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2195.06s)]
*  Materialistic shit, yeah, exactly. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2196.38s)]
*  It's a greedy search. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2198.18s)]
*  See, they didn't have a proper search, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2199.1s)]
*  so they're just hitting that local optima. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2200.4s)]
*  But the heuristic, I mean, even the objective function [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2202.12s)]
*  for that greedy search is just a really shitty one [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2205.2599999999998s)]
*  where those people that win the game of high school [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2208.8199999999997s)]
*  are very often not gonna be the people [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2212.56s)]
*  that win the much more exciting, beautiful game of life. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2214.54s)]
*  So do epic shit and try stuff out. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2217.8199999999997s)]
*  The weirdos are the ones that are gonna succeed. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2221.8599999999997s)]
*  The weirdos in high school, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2223.9799999999996s)]
*  probably because they also get bullied [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2226.7799999999997s)]
*  and they get to be tormented more psychologically [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2228.3399999999997s)]
*  and get to explore their own mind [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2231.18s)]
*  and think through what it means to be a human being more. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2233.22s)]
*  Because if you're winning in high school, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2236.8599999999997s)]
*  you're not being challenged. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2239.2599999999998s)]
*  You're not self-reflecting. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2241.1s)]
*  You're not trying shit out. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2243.02s)]
*  So there is some degree to being tormented [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2244.98s)]
*  as long as it doesn't break you. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2248.22s)]
*  The porn addiction, that's another powerful one [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2250.5s)]
*  that I think will probably resonate with a lot of people. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2254.38s)]
*  And it's interesting that you say [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2257.58s)]
*  that's one of the hardest addictions to overcome. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2258.94s)]
*  Let me say it this way. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2263.6s)]
*  Some addictions have a much bigger societal look. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2264.78s)]
*  And porn is just not one of them, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2268.06s)]
*  which makes it super hard. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2269.3s)]
*  None of your friends are gonna cheer you on. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2270.98s)]
*  If you go on Twitter and say, I quit porn, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2272.7400000000002s)]
*  they're gonna be like, well, that's good for you, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2274.9s)]
*  but not everybody. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2275.74s)]
*  No one makes that argument with meth. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2277.22s)]
*  No one's gonna be like, well, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2279.18s)]
*  not everyone has to quit meth, okay. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2280.02s)]
*  It's actually a fine industry. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2281.78s)]
*  And people who are the ones producing it, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2282.98s)]
*  they're good also. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2285.14s)]
*  No one's gonna make that kind of argument. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2286.5s)]
*  Whereas with porn, you're gonna have a whole thing [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2288.7s)]
*  and friends are gonna think you're dumb for doing it [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2291.58s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2293.82s)]
*  It's a much more difficult one in just like that. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2295.06s)]
*  So it feels accepted. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2299.62s)]
*  And I think it's also an addiction you can practice [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2301.18s)]
*  and participate in privately and hide it from the world. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2305.2200000000003s)]
*  There are certain addictions that are harder to hide [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2307.34s)]
*  from the world for prolonged periods of time. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2309.06s)]
*  And porn addiction is probably one you can just have [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2311.06s)]
*  for many years and then it can deepen. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2313.34s)]
*  That's probably like a serious issue. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2315.9s)]
*  Boy, am I glad I grew up before the internet [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2318.1s)]
*  because porn is so accessible, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2321.38s)]
*  so easy to go deep into that addiction. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2323.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what can you speak about what impact it had [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2329.6600000000003s)]
*  on your life? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2331.78s)]
*  Maybe some of the low points, but also how to overcome it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2333.14s)]
*  I'd say as far as impact goes is that you will have [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2336.3799999999997s)]
*  such a long and broken look at women. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2340.74s)]
*  Again, I'm only speaking from a male's perspective [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2345.02s)]
*  that porn and it's just like most basic thing [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2348.2999999999997s)]
*  is that you use another person for your own desire [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2351.74s)]
*  or your own want. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2357.22s)]
*  It's not something that is deeply needed. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2358.48s)]
*  There's no need for porn. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2361.46s)]
*  It's purely a want-based activity or a lust, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2363.26s)]
*  however you want, whatever word you can fill in there. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2366.1000000000004s)]
*  And it is purely an objectifying activity. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2368.38s)]
*  Someone else is on display for your own enjoyment. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2371.94s)]
*  And so I think you carry this around. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2375.26s)]
*  I do think that the women that I dated during high school [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2377.5400000000004s)]
*  or the women after high school and college, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2380.0400000000004s)]
*  I looked at them as a means to an end. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2383.0s)]
*  I think porn greatly shifted that perspective in my head [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2385.2200000000003s)]
*  that I did not give the value [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2388.58s)]
*  that was desired to another person. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2390.34s)]
*  It really devalues humanity just in general [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  is my perspective of it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2395.9s)]
*  And then it makes people into commodities. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2397.42s)]
*  And I don't think people are commodities. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2398.98s)]
*  I think everyone has value. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2400.5s)]
*  And so during that, for me, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2402.14s)]
*  that's kind of like the great effect of porn [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2403.94s)]
*  is that it's just consumerism gone wild [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2406.98s)]
*  or materialism maybe you could ask, argue gone wild. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2410.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's extremely hard to quit just like you said, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2413.2599999999998s)]
*  because I can look at porn and then I can go out to lunch. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2416.78s)]
*  No one's gonna know, no one's gonna have any ideas. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2421.1400000000003s)]
*  It's a very private, it can be very short session. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2423.02s)]
*  It doesn't have to be something that takes, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2426.3s)]
*  you can't take acid and go out to lunch. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2428.5800000000004s)]
*  Your whole day is gonna be a very different day. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2430.7000000000003s)]
*  And so it's very quick, easy, accessible. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2434.26s)]
*  And then obviously there's all the science and statistics [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2438.02s)]
*  like men make worse decisions for some period of time [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2441.02s)]
*  after looking or being exposed to sexualized images. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2443.52s)]
*  There's the whole dopamine effect. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2446.22s)]
*  That's just like you're constantly need more [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2448.02s)]
*  and more dopamine. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2449.62s)]
*  That's why people typically don't just watch [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2450.74s)]
*  five minutes of porn and call it a day. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2453.02s)]
*  There's like the hundred tab joke [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2454.2999999999997s)]
*  that's always made on the internet. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2456.22s)]
*  It's because it's just this constant dopamine cycle [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2457.74s)]
*  you're constantly doing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2460.74s)]
*  And all that stuff is great to say. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2461.58s)]
*  And I'm sure statistics and science and all that stuff [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2464.3799999999997s)]
*  is really great arguments for some amount of people. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2467.3399999999997s)]
*  But for me, it just comes down to like, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2469.5s)]
*  is it really a good thing to do? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2472.18s)]
*  Like, is it really actually something we want? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2474.02s)]
*  I believe that men need who they are. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2476.86s)]
*  They need people who they care about, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2478.38s)]
*  who they value. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2481.3399999999997s)]
*  They don't care about it when it doesn't matter if it's [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2482.98s)]
*  good or bad for women. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2487.06s)]
*  They don't care about it if your man has a bad image [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2488.18s)]
*  of you as someone who may have sad sex. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2491.0s)]
*  They don't care about that if he's an actor [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2494.06s)]
*  or a celebrity. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2497.54s)]
*  They don't care about that when she's pregnant [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2499.74s)]
*  because of some reason he still loves her. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2502.86s)]
*  I think sleeping with a bunch of women is great, wonderful. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2505.8999999999996s)]
*  But the problem is making that the primary objective [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2511.46s)]
*  of your life, similar with porn, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2514.54s)]
*  is you devalue one of the most awesome things, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2517.48s)]
*  which is intimacy. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2521.18s)]
*  That's true for deep friendship, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2522.7s)]
*  that's true for relationships. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2524.16s)]
*  And I think porn does that in its purest, darkest form, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2526.46s)]
*  which is like the thing that matters is the sex, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2531.5s)]
*  not the deep connection with another human being. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2533.86s)]
*  I think, again, going back to high school [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2537.2200000000003s)]
*  and the manosphere, the objective function, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2539.94s)]
*  if it's to get laid, which helps with status [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  and confidence and all that is wonderful, I think. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2547.1400000000003s)]
*  Again, can be an addiction, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2550.98s)]
*  but the thing that's even more awesome for a lot of people [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2552.5s)]
*  is a deep friendship or deep intimacy [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2556.28s)]
*  with a romantic partner. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2558.6600000000003s)]
*  That's also fucking awesome. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2561.1800000000003s)]
*  And both of those are great. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2563.06s)]
*  It's objectively better to have. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2565.22s)]
*  I would say that there's no universe that exists [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2567.5s)]
*  or there should be no argument possible that exists [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2569.74s)]
*  that a guy who has meaningless sex has a better [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2571.82s)]
*  or a more meaningful life than say me and my wife [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2575.18s)]
*  who've been together for 15 years. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2577.42s)]
*  We have a very, like I can depend on her [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2578.7799999999997s)]
*  in all circumstances. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2581.38s)]
*  Whereas if you live that other life, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2582.94s)]
*  it sure, it could feel great, but there's no meaning to it. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2584.98s)]
*  There's no actual real value to it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2588.14s)]
*  That's absolutely correct. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2590.7799999999997s)]
*  I do think that getting laid [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2591.94s)]
*  can have a tremendous positive impact [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2595.62s)]
*  on the confidence of a young man. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2597.3s)]
*  I think just there's a certain number of sexual partners [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2598.78s)]
*  from which you can collect a lot of data [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2602.9s)]
*  and it can free you about, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2604.54s)]
*  like not to be so nervous about the opposite sex, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2608.6s)]
*  not to be so nervous about human interaction. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2611.76s)]
*  And that will allow you to see the world more clearly [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2614.6s)]
*  and to actually find that one partner [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2618.1s)]
*  with whom you can be deeply intimate with. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2620.26s)]
*  Sometimes the nervousness around this societally [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2622.26s)]
*  constructed value in getting laid can cloud your judgment. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2628.96s)]
*  And if you just release that by getting laid [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2634.14s)]
*  a bunch of times, then you could see the world clearly [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2637.14s)]
*  that getting laid is not nearly as important, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2640.48s)]
*  as you said, as finding the right human. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2642.46s)]
*  Including, I should put in that pile, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2645.98s)]
*  not just like a romantic partner, but like friendships, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2648.42s)]
*  like deep lasting friendships. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2651.86s)]
*  I mean, I think you're right that our society [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2654.02s)]
*  puts a lot of emphasis on getting laid. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2655.42s)]
*  And I'm sure that's true among any group of males [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2657.6600000000003s)]
*  throughout any point in history. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2661.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm sure that's a very common joke [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2662.58s)]
*  that's never actually like never stopped at any point. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2664.2200000000003s)]
*  So I'm sure that exists. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2666.94s)]
*  But, and there's probably some truth to the sense that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2669.06s)]
*  after you've, who was it? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2672.26s)]
*  Jim Carrey, I hope that everyone can get rich [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2674.26s)]
*  so they realize that money solves none of your problems. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2676.02s)]
*  Like the realization that this thing that society told you [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2678.58s)]
*  is hyper important is actually not the important part. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2681.1s)]
*  Like it is a very important, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2683.98s)]
*  it's a great sign that your relationship is healthy. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2685.18s)]
*  Like if me and my wife were to have no sex at all [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2688.14s)]
*  for months on end, like something's gone wrong. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2690.34s)]
*  Which means what, you know, we are no longer [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2693.24s)]
*  like on the same plane, you know, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2696.62s)]
*  but it's not also a good identifier. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2698.18s)]
*  Just because you're having a lot of sex [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2700.14s)]
*  doesn't mean you're having a good relationship. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2701.5s)]
*  And so it's kind of like a unique kind of, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2703.98s)]
*  I forget the right term here, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2707.1000000000004s)]
*  but it's a unique way at looking at the problems [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2708.86s)]
*  and our society puts so much emphasis. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2712.1800000000003s)]
*  And maybe that's why porn was so hard to quit, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2714.38s)]
*  but my guess is just all the dopamine effect that it is. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2716.2200000000003s)]
*  But for me, like the most important part [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2721.7400000000002s)]
*  and the thing that actually has real reward [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2723.86s)]
*  is having that, having just my wife. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2725.5800000000004s)]
*  I do not look at, I try, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2729.6200000000003s)]
*  I desperately try not to look at any other woman. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2730.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm hopefully not gonna get caught Mark Zuckerberg [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2732.98s)]
*  at the White House like that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2734.98s)]
*  You know, like I don't look at porn. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2737.1s)]
*  My wife has complete confidence in me [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2738.9s)]
*  that there is not gonna be a situation [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2740.34s)]
*  in which she has to question me in any kind of sense. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2742.1s)]
*  And that builds a much more deeply, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2744.66s)]
*  I would argue it a very deep relationship [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2747.9s)]
*  because the trust is that much bigger. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2750.94s)]
*  I think the deepness of the relationship [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2752.58s)]
*  is probably proportional to the trust you have in each other. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2754.2599999999998s)]
*  It's very hard to have a deep relationship with no trust. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2757.14s)]
*  Yeah, and a probably a prerequisite, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2759.7s)]
*  maybe a component of trust is vulnerability [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2764.7s)]
*  to where you like take the leap of being vulnerable [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2767.62s)]
*  with another human being. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2770.7799999999997s)]
*  And that vulnerability when reciprocated [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2772.8999999999996s)]
*  builds this really strong trust [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2777.62s)]
*  and it's a beautiful thing, yeah. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2779.2599999999998s)]
*  I personally just given my position [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2780.8599999999997s)]
*  that's even more challenging, you know, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2785.06s)]
*  being vulnerable with the world [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2787.22s)]
*  and there's a bunch of people out there [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2788.66s)]
*  that wanna hurt you for it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2789.9399999999996s)]
*  And I think it's worthwhile anyway to be vulnerable. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2791.3s)]
*  It's always worth it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2796.86s)]
*  The risk is always worth it in some sense. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2797.7000000000003s)]
*  Obviously everyone has a different kind of life [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2800.46s)]
*  they have to filter through their actions with, right? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2802.94s)]
*  Because the person that has no, say, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2805.26s)]
*  social following or anything, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2806.86s)]
*  their risk reward profile could just be local impact, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2808.46s)]
*  which could be just as damning or harming to them. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2811.2200000000003s)]
*  And so it's always worth the risk though, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2814.02s)]
*  in my personal opinion, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2816.7000000000003s)]
*  because like finding my wife has been obviously [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2817.54s)]
*  the most impactful or changing thing in my life. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2821.34s)]
*  Or second most, I'd argue that one night with God [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2824.02s)]
*  would probably be the most impactful thing [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2826.42s)]
*  that led to everything else, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2828.86s)]
*  but then the wife would be the next most impactful. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2829.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm like cleaning up after myself and stuff now. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2831.66s)]
*  Changed man, I'm a changed man. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2834.34s)]
*  Can we try to reverse engineer [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2837.38s)]
*  that moment of you finding God? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2839.7s)]
*  What is it at 19? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2841.34s)]
*  Because it feels like that was a big leap for you [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2842.94s)]
*  to escape the pain, to escape the addiction [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2848.7400000000002s)]
*  or the beginning of that journey. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2852.0s)]
*  What do you think happened there? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2853.78s)]
*  I think it just felt like I just, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2857.1s)]
*  there was no line that I wasn't willing to cross. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2859.1s)]
*  Like everything was fine. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2861.78s)]
*  And just like, it just all of a sudden, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2863.26s)]
*  it's just in that moment, it's just like I had a, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2865.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess some sort of deep fear and understanding [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2866.94s)]
*  like I am going down a path. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2870.9s)]
*  Is this really the path you want to go down? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2874.6600000000003s)]
*  And I don't know what the result of that path would be [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2877.98s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2879.9s)]
*  I don't tend to speculate on things I don't understand. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2881.1s)]
*  I just know that in that moment, I had the option [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2884.9s)]
*  and I just chose, I didn't want it anymore, right? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2889.76s)]
*  It's kind of mixed in this whole thing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2893.1s)]
*  where it's just like, I had no value. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2894.3s)]
*  I wrapped up all my meaning or value [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2896.06s)]
*  in having sex or getting laid. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2897.82s)]
*  All that stuff, all the things we just talked about, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2900.46s)]
*  like that was where all my worth was. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2902.5s)]
*  And that is just such a terrible place to have your worth. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2904.58s)]
*  And it's just, I kind of all came to a point [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2908.02s)]
*  and I can't tell you the day of the week. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2911.1s)]
*  I can't tell you anything other than it was nighttime. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2912.9s)]
*  And I was in South Hedges in Montana State University, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2915.22s)]
*  go Bobcats. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2918.7799999999997s)]
*  Rarow. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2919.62s)]
*  That's about, yeah, that's the sign [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2921.14s)]
*  that we do at football games. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2922.5s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2923.48s)]
*  But like, that's all I can really tell you [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2924.46s)]
*  because that night was no more or less special [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2927.66s)]
*  than some other night. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2930.66s)]
*  It's just the specialness was, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2931.5s)]
*  I got at least a chance to make a choice. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2933.8199999999997s)]
*  Because you find in that advice that you can give to others [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2938.64s)]
*  who are probably, there's probably just an endless amount [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2942.14s)]
*  of people that are struggling with porn addiction, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2946.58s)]
*  not young people. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2948.14s)]
*  What advice could you give to them? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2949.54s)]
*  How to overcome it? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2951.3799999999997s)]
*  For me to overcome it, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2955.3799999999997s)]
*  I had to realize that I was taking something away [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2957.7s)]
*  from my future wife. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2959.2999999999997s)]
*  Some people will be like, oh, well, you just, you know, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2960.7799999999997s)]
*  once you get a girlfriend, then you can stop. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2962.54s)]
*  And it's just like, no, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2964.06s)]
*  because you never stopped the problem. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2965.22s)]
*  You don't stop a problem by replacing it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2967.18s)]
*  And so I didn't have a girlfriend, didn't have all that. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2970.4199999999996s)]
*  I just realized that I was truly taking away [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2972.2999999999997s)]
*  from something from my future wife. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2974.54s)]
*  And I didn't even know my current wife at that time. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2977.06s)]
*  She was not in the picture. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2979.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not even sure if she was at Montana State University [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2980.62s)]
*  at that point. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2982.3799999999997s)]
*  And so it's just, that's... [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2983.22s)]
*  Once I made that realization, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2986.3s)]
*  I think it went from my head to my heart, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2988.2200000000003s)]
*  which they say is the greatest distance in the universe. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2989.82s)]
*  I finally like got it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2992.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's really where things change. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2994.7000000000003s)]
*  So if the ability to say like, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2996.1800000000003s)]
*  what's gonna help you change and all that, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3000.26s)]
*  I don't know if there's, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3001.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't think there's silver bullets, right? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3002.7400000000002s)]
*  If someone could offer you a drug, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3004.86s)]
*  I forget who says this phrase, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3006.58s)]
*  but there's this really interesting phrase [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3007.7000000000003s)]
*  that goes something like, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3009.5s)]
*  he was a very depressed man [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3011.2200000000003s)]
*  and he was struggling with suicide. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3013.94s)]
*  And he kind of writes about this in this memoir. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3016.6600000000003s)]
*  And he goes to these doctors [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3018.58s)]
*  and the doctors effectively say, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3020.38s)]
*  well, here's antidepressants, it's gonna help you. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3021.46s)]
*  And he says that, well, the problem was, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3023.5s)]
*  is that scientists told me that I could just touch my brain [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3025.86s)]
*  and make myself happy. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3028.1400000000003s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3029.78s)]
*  Like they could reach in, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3030.62s)]
*  they could configure some stuff and I'll be happy. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3031.44s)]
*  He's like, for me, it was a lot like going out into a field [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3033.3s)]
*  and being able to take a drug to see the rain. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3036.86s)]
*  I could look out, see the rain, it would fall down, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3038.9s)]
*  it'd be silvery, it'd be beautiful. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3041.1s)]
*  But all the crop would still die [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3043.1s)]
*  because there's not actually any rain. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3044.38s)]
*  I had to discover how to be happy myself. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3045.8199999999997s)]
*  And so for me, it's like, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3048.38s)]
*  the reason why I looked at porn is because I was unhappy. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3049.7799999999997s)]
*  I was trying to find meaning, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3052.5s)]
*  I was trying to find value in something, right? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3053.5s)]
*  Something that was supposed to finally give me [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3056.16s)]
*  this ultimate satisfaction. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3057.58s)]
*  And it just does not. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3059.02s)]
*  No matter how hard and no matter how much you think it will, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3060.9s)]
*  there is no escapade, there is no pornography [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3064.3399999999997s)]
*  that will ever give you that satisfaction you're looking for. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3068.1s)]
*  That's the reason why it's addicting. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3070.46s)]
*  That's kind of like my call to why you shouldn't do it, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3073.2999999999997s)]
*  but how to get out of it, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3075.66s)]
*  I only got out of it by realizing. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3077.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that's really brilliantly described. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  You knew that this thing you're doing [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3086.42s)]
*  is preventing you from finding your future wife. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3088.2999999999997s)]
*  And future wife could mean more, even broadly, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3092.1s)]
*  this path to a flourishing, to a beautiful life. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3097.02s)]
*  I think there's a lot of choices we make [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3102.94s)]
*  that are just preventing us from opening the door [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3104.5s)]
*  to whatever future they would take. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3108.06s)]
*  I think what's really nice to do is to imagine, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3110.54s)]
*  just like we said with high school, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3114.46s)]
*  that there are a bunch of trajectories in life [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3116.74s)]
*  where you'll be truly happy. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3120.68s)]
*  And you need to construct your life in a way [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3122.78s)]
*  where you have the chance to travel down those paths. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3125.1s)]
*  And there's a bunch of addictions, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3127.9s)]
*  there's a bunch of choices that prevent us [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3129.06s)]
*  from traveling down those paths. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3130.76s)]
*  So just believe that you're gonna have an awesome life [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3132.6400000000003s)]
*  and remove from your life the things [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3136.7200000000003s)]
*  that are preventing you from walking down that path, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3138.6000000000004s)]
*  which is essentially what you did. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3143.0400000000004s)]
*  It's a leap of faith that if you let go of porn, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3144.4s)]
*  that a better life is waiting for you on the other end. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3149.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3152.28s)]
*  I definitely can't say how long it will take a better life, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3153.6800000000003s)]
*  but for me, there's no way in the universe [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3156.94s)]
*  I could have had the relationship that I have [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3159.4s)]
*  without first making those steps, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3161.64s)]
*  because I couldn't value my wife [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3163.0s)]
*  in the way that was proper for who she was. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3167.92s)]
*  I would have valued her through the index or the lens [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3172.08s)]
*  that I currently was looking through. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3174.6s)]
*  Gotta ask. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3178.4s)]
*  So I've never done math. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3179.6s)]
*  I've never done math. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3182.64s)]
*  That was a great segue, by the way. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3183.8s)]
*  Oh man, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, honestly, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3186.08s)]
*  with this interviewing thing. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3190.04s)]
*  But yeah, math and LSD. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3191.48s)]
*  I did Ayahuasca, I did shrooms a bunch of times. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3194.88s)]
*  Oh, and this topic, I should say that there's a lot of, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3198.08s)]
*  on Twitter and in the tech community in general, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3201.86s)]
*  people speaking negatively about Ayahuasca, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3205.16s)]
*  and some positively. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3207.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's such a roll of the dice. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3210.48s)]
*  Like, I had incredible experiences, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3212.76s)]
*  but I don't think I wanna recommend it to anyone. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3215.5200000000004s)]
*  It's a risk, it's a serious risk. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3218.36s)]
*  It really is a roll of the dice. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3220.92s)]
*  You could meet your demons and they could destroy you, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3222.6000000000004s)]
*  or you can meet your demons and let go of them, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3225.5200000000004s)]
*  or you could have experiences like I did, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3228.0800000000004s)]
*  which is like never, apparently I don't have demons. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3230.32s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they're somewhere in the basement, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3232.76s)]
*  but I've never met them on drugs. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3235.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm always really happy. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3238.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm a happy drunk, I'm a super happy Ayahuasca, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3240.72s)]
*  just full of love. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3244.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't understand, I don't understand where the demons are, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3245.66s)]
*  but that's my biochemistry, whatever that is. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3248.2s)]
*  And for some others, one trip could be amazing, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3250.64s)]
*  and the next one could just completely destroy you [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3254.24s)]
*  and wreck your life. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3256.44s)]
*  So I don't know what the recommendation from that is. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3257.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe avoid it, but then all of us die, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3260.48s)]
*  and life, I tend to lean into adventure. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3263.52s)]
*  But drugs is a, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3267.92s)]
*  if you fuck with the biochemistry of your brain, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3271.44s)]
*  you can really destroy yourself [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3274.56s)]
*  in a way that it's gonna torment you. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3276.72s)]
*  So I would generally recommend that people avoid drugs, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3278.2799999999997s)]
*  altogether, probably, unless you're a crazy motherfucker. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3284.56s)]
*  Hunter S. Thompson. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3290.16s)]
*  What an intro to this topic. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3293.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, what's meth like? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3295.08s)]
*  That's a great intro. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3297.76s)]
*  I like, you are very correct in the sense that there is, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3298.6000000000004s)]
*  at least when it comes to hallucinogens, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3302.2400000000002s)]
*  there is a wild variance to what you're going to experience, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3304.0s)]
*  and there is no guarantee. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3307.6400000000003s)]
*  There's no, just because you buy the product [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3309.1200000000003s)]
*  doesn't mean you're gonna have a good time. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3311.56s)]
*  There's a lot of, personally, I find that stuff to be very, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3313.44s)]
*  I believe in the spiritual realm. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3319.48s)]
*  I believe demons and angels exist, I believe God exists, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3321.32s)]
*  and that kind of whole realm is like, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3324.34s)]
*  I don't know what it opens you up to, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3327.44s)]
*  but it's much, much different experience. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3328.56s)]
*  Now, some people will be like, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3329.96s)]
*  oh, it's just a bunch of chemicals in your brain. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3330.7999999999997s)]
*  They all get mixed up. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3332.04s)]
*  LSD just takes all of your pathways, and they all go, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3332.8599999999997s)]
*  you know, they all get kind of scrambled up in your brain. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3335.56s)]
*  And it's just like, yeah, the experiences are profound. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3337.44s)]
*  I had some really bizarre, very cool, very awful. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3340.04s)]
*  I've had all the experiences in them all. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3345.04s)]
*  I can just tell you that I, like, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3347.3599999999997s)]
*  I personally always say the same thing. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3348.52s)]
*  It's like, choices that I made, I can never take back. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3350.4s)]
*  I would never take that away from myself [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3352.6s)]
*  because I don't know if I would be who I am today [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3354.52s)]
*  without all those experiences going up to it. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3356.6s)]
*  But if you have not had that experience, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3358.92s)]
*  I'm on your team, or at least partially on your team, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3360.52s)]
*  maybe more severely. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3362.48s)]
*  I don't think you need those experiences. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3363.68s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3365.36s)]
*  you don't have to put yourself through that [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3366.58s)]
*  to make good decisions or to realize [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3369.3199999999997s)]
*  that people have value, right? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3371.24s)]
*  You can, you don't have to do that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3374.6s)]
*  So as far as like, what is meth like? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3376.2s)]
*  Meth is like, if you've ever done cocaine, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3377.36s)]
*  cocaine starts off with like a 15 minute dance party. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3379.4s)]
*  Just, it's just so intense. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3382.1s)]
*  It's like so great. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3384.42s)]
*  And then it just followed up with like, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3385.24s)]
*  like a five hour, like just feeling wiggly, right? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3387.08s)]
*  I don't know how else to describe it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3389.52s)]
*  A meth is like that, except for, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3391.12s)]
*  I didn't get as much dance party or any dance party, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3392.9199999999996s)]
*  but instead I just got that part for like 12 hours. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3395.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3400.04s)]
*  So did a lot of skateboarding. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3401.24s)]
*  Did a lot of, you know, running around. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3404.72s)]
*  Would you say it's a pleasant feeling [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3406.64s)]
*  or is it more like an escape from the loneliness of life? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3409.1s)]
*  Is it pleasant or negative in the actual moment? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3414.86s)]
*  Not the consequences, but in the moment. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3419.58s)]
*  So, I mean, this is just like a very interesting [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3421.42s)]
*  kind of area, which is that not, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3424.38s)]
*  universally you can't say that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3428.2599999999998s)]
*  Often you'll find that there's kind of these two groups [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3430.56s)]
*  of drug addicts. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3434.22s)]
*  There's those that like the opioids [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3435.16s)]
*  and those that like the uppers. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3437.3199999999997s)]
*  They typically don't like, there's very few people [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  in the drug world that do both. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3441.62s)]
*  They're really just kind of like find their side [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3443.3s)]
*  and they go for it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3444.94s)]
*  So will, is meth a thing that everybody's gonna enjoy? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3445.78s)]
*  Well, categorically, as you can see, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3448.98s)]
*  and just like how people experience drug addiction, no. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3450.38s)]
*  But for me, it's just like, I had a really, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3454.0400000000004s)]
*  it kind of like feeds into like the ADHD nature [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3456.38s)]
*  of like this, like, because you know, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3459.1000000000004s)]
*  you're kind of high energy. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3460.42s)]
*  You're kind of like always in the moment. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3461.42s)]
*  So it's just like, you're in the moment, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3462.78s)]
*  but it's just like, oh, I'm in the moment. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3464.42s)]
*  You know, like it's like, everything's just so intense. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3465.86s)]
*  You know, like you just want to like really be in the moment. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3468.2200000000003s)]
*  And so it's just experiencing that constantly. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3471.46s)]
*  And so was that great? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3474.86s)]
*  Well, some people, you know, my wife always tells me this, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3476.38s)]
*  like being like nervous or I forget the anxiety [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3479.62s)]
*  of a situation can also be the same thing as like thrill. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3484.7400000000002s)]
*  I forget the exact way. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3487.2200000000003s)]
*  She's probably super disappointed that I messed this up, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3488.18s)]
*  but it's like, you could perceive those two experiences [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3490.26s)]
*  in very different lights. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3492.82s)]
*  Some people, you know, get in front of a crowd [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3493.78s)]
*  and it's like thrilling. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3496.3s)]
*  Some people get in front of it [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3497.66s)]
*  and it's just like the worst experience of their lifetime. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3498.58s)]
*  They would actually literally rather die, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3500.58s)]
*  which is a crazy thing to think about [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3502.42s)]
*  than stand up and speak. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3504.34s)]
*  And so for me, meth was that kind of thrilling side, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3505.58s)]
*  but at the same time is it didn't, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3510.2599999999998s)]
*  it still didn't like quite give me that thing I wanted. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3513.34s)]
*  Whatever I was looking for, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3515.9s)]
*  I'd use it to help try to get that thing I want, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3517.58s)]
*  but it was never giving me that thing I wanted. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3520.1s)]
*  Yeah, for me, I've had all really wonderful experiences. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3523.02s)]
*  Do not recommend them, but like with Shroom. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3527.14s)]
*  Like a YouTube policy, by the way, that you have to say, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3530.02s)]
*  by the way, do whatever you do, do not do illegal activity. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3532.1s)]
*  But I had great experiences, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3534.6200000000003s)]
*  but don't have whatever you do, don't do it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3536.02s)]
*  Mr. The Primogen, I have no master. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3537.54s)]
*  I don't have YouTube or whatever. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3540.78s)]
*  I'll say whatever the fuck I want. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3542.86s)]
*  I'm just. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3545.2200000000003s)]
*  But seriously, YouTube. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3546.9s)]
*  No, I don't give a shit about YouTube or anybody, honestly. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3548.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm just kind of careful about the words I say [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3552.54s)]
*  because just because I had positive experiences, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3555.26s)]
*  I don't want young people listening to this [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3559.22s)]
*  think they should try the experience. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3562.22s)]
*  I think the much more powerful message [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3563.8599999999997s)]
*  is that life is awesome even without that. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3566.14s)]
*  That's something I definitely experiment with [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3568.8199999999997s)]
*  on the alcohol side. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3573.7s)]
*  So for me, I'm an introvert, I'm afraid of the world. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3574.8999999999996s)]
*  Social interaction fills me with anxiety. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3578.46s)]
*  Alcohol is definitely a thing that helps with that sometimes. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3580.98s)]
*  But I think honestly, like it's not even the alcohol. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3584.06s)]
*  It's like having to do something [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3587.7799999999997s)]
*  while a person is talking to me. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3589.4599999999996s)]
*  I could just like drink a liquid. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3591.14s)]
*  There's like a social thing with a beer. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3594.58s)]
*  It's like, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, we're having fun. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3596.62s)]
*  And I think for me, it works the same as, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3600.58s)]
*  if the liquid actually looks like alcohol, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3604.1s)]
*  it does the same purpose often because alcohol, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3608.22s)]
*  like if you have a whiskey or a beer looking thing, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3612.8599999999997s)]
*  it kinda sends a signal that we should be having fun. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3617.3s)]
*  So we're socializing, right? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3620.98s)]
*  We're fucking getting crazy. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3622.26s)]
*  And then that means you don't actually need the alcohol. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3623.7000000000003s)]
*  You can get fucking crazy without the alcohol substance. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3626.1400000000003s)]
*  But there is some kind of like social signaling [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3630.6600000000003s)]
*  that happens when you have a drink in your hand. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3636.5s)]
*  So I've been to get togethers where I'm not drinking, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3639.1000000000004s)]
*  but just doing like a fake drink situation [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3642.34s)]
*  and I can also have fun. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3645.0200000000004s)]
*  But that said, traveling across the world, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3646.58s)]
*  there are times when you need to be able [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3650.38s)]
*  to down a bottle of vodka. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3651.82s)]
*  That's very essential for my line of work. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3653.06s)]
*  But that's almost like a cultural experience [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3655.38s)]
*  versus like a necessary component [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3659.66s)]
*  of a successful social interaction [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3662.06s)]
*  and one that brings you happiness. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3664.34s)]
*  So not drinking, I think you can have fun and not drink too. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3665.38s)]
*  So all of this, man, I'm so careful saying drugs [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3669.58s)]
*  have had a good effect on my life [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3673.62s)]
*  because I think for most people, no, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3677.94s)]
*  for majority of people, they will in the long term [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3680.2999999999997s)]
*  have a negative effect. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3685.22s)]
*  So I think if you were to choose one or the other, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3687.3399999999997s)]
*  just no drugs and no drinking means one day [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3690.1s)]
*  you can be the president of the United States, kids. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3695.98s)]
*  And I should say, oh man, that is Diet Coke. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3699.98s)]
*  Diet Coke is great. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3704.2200000000003s)]
*  That's his funniest line, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3705.7400000000002s)]
*  which is you would hate me if I drink, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3706.7000000000003s)]
*  which to me that tickles me to no end, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3708.1800000000003s)]
*  just like, oh my gosh, that is such a funny line. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3710.7000000000003s)]
*  Self-awareness and humor is wonderful there. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3712.82s)]
*  I am on your team. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3715.34s)]
*  All of the reasons why I used drugs and all that [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3716.5s)]
*  was some level of escapism. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3719.26s)]
*  I'm sure that's like would be the archetype [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3721.94s)]
*  or the box I'd put that into [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3723.62s)]
*  or the pursuit of trying to feel something [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3725.42s)]
*  that cannot come from them. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3727.58s)]
*  It's like trying to find a meaning in your job. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3729.7000000000003s)]
*  You can find satisfaction in what you do. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3732.02s)]
*  That is a very good thing. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3733.94s)]
*  You can find satisfaction [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3734.98s)]
*  and be happy with what you've created. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3736.14s)]
*  You can be thrilled by the experience, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3738.18s)]
*  but you cannot find, I doubt you can find purpose. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3740.46s)]
*  Maybe some people in specific jobs, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3744.14s)]
*  this obviously have very broad strokes I'm painting with. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3746.22s)]
*  If you're an EMT and you save someone's life, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3748.7s)]
*  maybe there can be purpose in that whole experience. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3750.58s)]
*  So I'm not saying all things, but as programming goes, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
*  most programmers, you cannot just simply find your purpose. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3756.18s)]
*  And same with drugs, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3759.38s)]
*  you cannot find that thing you're looking for, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3760.7s)]
*  but they are a very great distraction. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3763.14s)]
*  And then at some point, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3766.18s)]
*  that distraction comes with a heavy cost. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3767.58s)]
*  I think Dr. Faust would probably know the best [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3769.7799999999997s)]
*  about the heavy costs, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3771.54s)]
*  but it's just you're making one trade for another. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3772.3799999999997s)]
*  And at some point the bill comes due [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3774.8199999999997s)]
*  and that bill can be very, very large. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3777.02s)]
*  The other moment you mentioned [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3780.18s)]
*  that I think is really inspiring [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3781.8599999999997s)]
*  is that you failed pre-calculus. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3784.1s)]
*  You really struggle in school. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3786.18s)]
*  Like you realize that school is really hard. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3787.7s)]
*  And then eventually you're able to sort of persevere [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3789.98s)]
*  and I don't know, break through that wall of struggle. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3794.7400000000002s)]
*  Can you, by way of advice, figure out what happened [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3799.42s)]
*  and what kind of advice you can give [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3802.54s)]
*  to people who are struggling? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3804.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'll paint it in kind of more clear picture, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3805.78s)]
*  a very fast speed run of it, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3808.62s)]
*  is that I took pre-calculus, failed. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3810.26s)]
*  I took pre-calculus again, failed. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3812.3s)]
*  Took pre-calculus again and got a C. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3813.98s)]
*  So I took it three times. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3816.62s)]
*  Then I took calc over the summer. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3818.86s)]
*  So calc one. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3820.9s)]
*  In that one, at the end, the final, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3822.26s)]
*  the final was a two hour final. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3825.7000000000003s)]
*  I finished it in 30 minutes [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3826.86s)]
*  and that is the highest score in all of the school. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3827.9s)]
*  And I proceeded to be the highest score [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3830.82s)]
*  in all calculus and Diffie-Q. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3832.3s)]
*  I was the only person out of 400 people [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3834.1800000000003s)]
*  to finish the Diffie-Q final and I got the highest grade. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3835.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I was like, I got really good. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3839.3s)]
*  So I somehow went from really bad to really good. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3840.98s)]
*  And so my only, the thing that I did is that I had to win. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3843.26s)]
*  It was not a option. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3848.46s)]
*  It was not like, oh, this would be really great. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3849.94s)]
*  It's like, I will not graduate. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3851.7400000000002s)]
*  I will not finish my stuff if I cannot do this. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3853.2200000000003s)]
*  And so every single day I got up, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3856.6600000000003s)]
*  I went to my, however many hour class it was, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3859.3s)]
*  right after that, I went straight [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3862.5s)]
*  to the math learning center, did those problems. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3863.6200000000003s)]
*  When I got home, I just got the book [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3865.5800000000004s)]
*  and it had the odd answers in the back [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3867.6200000000003s)]
*  and I would try to walk through the problems over [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3869.26s)]
*  and over and over and over again until I absolutely got it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3871.7s)]
*  And it just became this thing where I just, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3874.8199999999997s)]
*  I just simple rote memory took over [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3876.62s)]
*  and the ability to just effectively have the times table [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3880.14s)]
*  but for calculus all stuck in my head, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3882.9399999999996s)]
*  inverse trig substitution, trig substitution, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3885.1s)]
*  doing Taylor-McClaren series, like all those things [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3887.02s)]
*  kind of just over and over and over and over again. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3888.8599999999997s)]
*  Eventually they became easy. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3891.8199999999997s)]
*  They became very easy. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3894.46s)]
*  It's just that I had to cram it in there. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3895.3799999999997s)]
*  And some people, you hear these stories [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3897.7s)]
*  where they barely show up to class [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3899.9399999999996s)]
*  and they get A's, I've never been that person. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3902.34s)]
*  I've always been the person that has to sit down, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3903.54s)]
*  read through everything and I'm bad at abstract concepts. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3905.42s)]
*  I like the concrete into the abstract, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3909.42s)]
*  not the abstract into the concrete, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3911.38s)]
*  very bad at talking about things theoretically [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3913.26s)]
*  then trying to apply them. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3915.02s)]
*  But if I can do it once, literally, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3916.14s)]
*  then it's really easy for me to go into the abstract. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3918.22s)]
*  And so it's just like for me, it just, I had, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3920.78s)]
*  there's no substitute for the hours. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3923.46s)]
*  So if you, if I were to give advice, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3926.42s)]
*  it's just that you have to have time in the saddle. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3928.86s)]
*  Hour after hour will make you slowly better. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3932.1800000000003s)]
*  And at first it's crushing, it's defeating [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3934.54s)]
*  and it's not fun because you were bad at it. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3937.1400000000003s)]
*  But then at some point, you're just not bad at it [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3940.06s)]
*  if you can just do it long enough [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3942.78s)]
*  and you'll start getting okay at it. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3944.6600000000003s)]
*  And then at some point you might even get good at it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3945.82s)]
*  And when you get good at something, it feels amazing. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3947.86s)]
*  There's like an exploratory thing. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3950.86s)]
*  Like if you've ever played a musical instrument, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3952.2200000000003s)]
*  you stop having to think about all the little teeny things [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3954.7000000000003s)]
*  you have to do to be able to play something correctly. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3958.82s)]
*  And you start thinking about how you can explore that space. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3961.46s)]
*  It's like a completely different problem. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3964.38s)]
*  And same with programming. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3966.6600000000003s)]
*  Programming has an identical kind of feel to it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3967.5s)]
*  It's just like, you'll cross that barrier [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3970.26s)]
*  and it becomes magical as opposed to a chore. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3972.3s)]
*  Yeah, once you cross that barrier, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3975.1800000000003s)]
*  somehow other things become easier. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3976.46s)]
*  But then if you wanna have a truly successful life, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3979.78s)]
*  then you find the next barrier. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3981.78s)]
*  Yeah. The next barrier. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3983.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've always been the same. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3984.1000000000004s)]
*  Everything has come really hard. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3985.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've had no free lunches. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3987.58s)]
*  Everything's just been a lot of pain and struggle. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3990.58s)]
*  I think somebody said that on this topic [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3995.42s)]
*  that you think work smarter, not harder [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3999.5s)]
*  is a phrase that you dislike. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4003.46s)]
*  Yeah. Somebody on Reddit told me that. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4006.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't just dislike it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4007.78s)]
*  I hate that phrase. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4008.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4009.82s)]
*  Tell me about your hatred. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4012.3s)]
*  How do you feel? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4013.62s)]
*  The reason why I dislike that [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4014.82s)]
*  is that there is a kind of a hidden suggestion there, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4017.38s)]
*  which is that you already know what smarter is. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4020.34s)]
*  So just do that. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4023.46s)]
*  That actually things should be easy. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4024.6600000000003s)]
*  You should just not have to like try that hard. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4026.94s)]
*  You should just do the quick, easy, obvious path [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4028.7000000000003s)]
*  and boom, it's done. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4031.06s)]
*  It's like, I've never experienced that [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4032.5s)]
*  in anything I've done. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4034.34s)]
*  Everything is actually really hard. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4036.1000000000004s)]
*  And most of the time, I don't even know what I'm doing. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4037.54s)]
*  So therefore I don't even know what smart looks like. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4040.6600000000003s)]
*  And so for me, the only way I can learn how to work smart [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4043.22s)]
*  is by working very, very hard [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4046.66s)]
*  and knowing that there's no shortcuts. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4048.98s)]
*  And then when I finally figure out what smart is, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4050.7s)]
*  when I work smart and work hard, it is that much better. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4054.66s)]
*  I think there's a deep, profound truth to that. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4059.46s)]
*  There's a lot of these phrases [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4062.58s)]
*  that just drive me nuts in our society. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4063.5s)]
*  But that one is, sorry, that one is really accepted. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4065.5s)]
*  If you can just linger on it [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4068.2999999999997s)]
*  because it really bothers me as well. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4069.58s)]
*  So one, which is a really nice thing you said, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4071.54s)]
*  the presumption there is things should be easy [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4074.54s)]
*  and you're a failure if you don't see the easy path. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4077.58s)]
*  That's kind of the implied thing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4081.34s)]
*  Just work smart, dog. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4082.18s)]
*  Why are you putting in all those hours? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4083.02s)]
*  And so it makes a lot of people that struggle [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4085.06s)]
*  feel like they're a failure [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4087.34s)]
*  because I don't see it. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4088.94s)]
*  And then the choice to have, well, I'll just go with the, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4091.06s)]
*  I'll just be lazy and then maybe the profound truth [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4095.2599999999998s)]
*  will come to me somehow. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4098.18s)]
*  And yeah, I think I don't think I've ever, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4099.66s)]
*  and I don't think I've met great engineers [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4102.78s)]
*  that find the smart way without the extremely hard work. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4106.94s)]
*  The annoying thing about those great engineers [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4111.7s)]
*  is then looking back, they forget the hard work [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4114.66s)]
*  because they remember all the joy [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4117.42s)]
*  they now are experiencing [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4119.099999999999s)]
*  from all the efficient smart work [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4120.98s)]
*  they've figured out how to do. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4123.18s)]
*  They forget, so when they give advice, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4124.86s)]
*  they give the stupid fucking advice [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4126.62s)]
*  of, well, just do it the easy way. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4128.86s)]
*  Here's the easy way, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4133.339999999999s)]
*  You have to put in the hours. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4135.98s)]
*  Musical instrument is a beautiful example. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4139.78s)]
*  Guitar and piano, I've put in, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4142.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how many thousands of hours. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4143.54s)]
*  And now when I'm explaining stuff, jujitsu as well, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4146.0599999999995s)]
*  I sound like one of those people, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4153.179999999999s)]
*  just relax in jujitsu. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4154.5s)]
*  By the way, just relax is a really wonderful thing [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4157.98s)]
*  for physical endeavors like piano and so on. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4160.379999999999s)]
*  But to learn how to relax your hand, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4162.94s)]
*  how to relax your mind, your body, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4165.66s)]
*  and use the whatever, the biomechanics of your body [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4168.459999999999s)]
*  to apply the correct kind of leverage [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4174.299999999999s)]
*  and the timing and all that, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4176.099999999999s)]
*  that takes thousands of hours of learning. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4177.459999999999s)]
*  Just to learn how to relax takes a lot of really hard work. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4180.379999999999s)]
*  In jujitsu, that takes many months [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4183.54s)]
*  of getting your ass beat over and over [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4187.14s)]
*  until you ride the bus home crying, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4190.98s)]
*  your ego completely shattered and destroyed. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4195.86s)]
*  And then a little element is figured out [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4199.5s)]
*  late that night or next morning. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4204.62s)]
*  And from the depression, there's this little plant [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4207.9s)]
*  that grows this flower of insight. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4211.34s)]
*  And you use that insight to then get your ass kicked again [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4214.66s)]
*  all next fucking month and year. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4217.34s)]
*  And then you grow and grow and grow. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4221.3s)]
*  And from that, you discover how beautifully simple [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4222.78s)]
*  jujitsu is or judo is, just speaking for myself, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4225.46s)]
*  or piano or guitar. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4229.06s)]
*  And then, yes, the profound truth [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4230.42s)]
*  or the mastery of a skill feels simple [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4235.34s)]
*  when you finally arrive to it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4239.26s)]
*  But the path for most people is going to be a hard one. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4242.02s)]
*  Can I, I think I should make an addendum to the phrase. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4246.02s)]
*  I think the phrase should be work hard, get smart. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4248.22s)]
*  Nice, that's a T-shirt. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4251.14s)]
*  That's what it should be. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4253.1s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4254.26s)]
*  Okay, that was a tangent of a tangent. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4255.46s)]
*  Can I say one more phrase, cultural phrase [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4257.46s)]
*  that I absolutely hate? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4259.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4259.900000000001s)]
*  The journey is better than the destination. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4261.38s)]
*  Right, everyone's heard this, right? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4264.820000000001s)]
*  Just take one second to apply what that means. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4266.860000000001s)]
*  That means forever, starting from now, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4269.78s)]
*  you are only going towards a place that's worse. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4272.54s)]
*  Right, like that literally is what it means. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4276.54s)]
*  Enjoy the journey, celebrate the destination. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4279.94s)]
*  That's like, that should be what it would be. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4282.98s)]
*  But no, people say these phrases are everywhere. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4284.62s)]
*  There's these very shallow phrases [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4286.86s)]
*  that have no logical bounds to them. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4288.66s)]
*  You're just like, what does that, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4290.86s)]
*  why would the journey ever be better than the destination? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4292.099999999999s)]
*  Cause you're always, I think this might even be [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4294.139999999999s)]
*  a C.S. Lewis quote is that C.S. Lewis was like, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4296.139999999999s)]
*  nope, this is terrible. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4299.38s)]
*  The journey is not in fact better than the destination. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4300.58s)]
*  I love the demotivational posters. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4303.740000000001s)]
*  Progress, moving forward is better than moving backwards, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4307.900000000001s)]
*  even if you're still going nowhere. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4311.22s)]
*  I feel that one so much being in California [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4314.3s)]
*  for a few years, that is painful. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4317.14s)]
*  Positivity, if it doesn't break you today, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4320.14s)]
*  don't worry, it will try again tomorrow. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4322.42s)]
*  It's just a lot of really great posters. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4326.06s)]
*  I didn't even know this was a thing. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4327.86s)]
*  This is a thing. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4329.34s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I want that. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4330.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4331.7s)]
*  Hey, hi, this is the Primogen. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4332.94s)]
*  One thing that I forgot to mention in this podcast, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4335.139999999999s)]
*  which feels just so foolish to me for forgetting, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4338.219999999999s)]
*  is just what a big role my mom played in my life. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4341.0199999999995s)]
*  She had to work 18 hours a day after my dad died. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4343.98s)]
*  She really made her house be able to survive. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4346.66s)]
*  I always looked up to her and I always thought her amazing. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4349.54s)]
*  And she really was the reason why when I decided [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4351.9s)]
*  to get my butt kicked back in gear, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4354.0599999999995s)]
*  she's just someone who I looked to as like an internal [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4356.38s)]
*  kind of inspiration for me to continue to keep on going. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4359.14s)]
*  Because I really wanted to make her proud. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4362.1s)]
*  And all those years of just high energy effort, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4363.7s)]
*  I really wanted to make sure that she knew [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4366.22s)]
*  that I was just so dang appreciative for it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4368.86s)]
*  So, hey, I just wanted to say thank you, love you, mom. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4371.18s)]
*  For people who don't know, you worked in Netflix. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4375.74s)]
*  By the way. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4379.78s)]
*  By the way. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4380.7s)]
*  No, how did you go from there, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4382.1s)]
*  from the hardship that we mentioned, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4384.26s)]
*  from the struggle, from the addictions and so on, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4386.62s)]
*  to a place where you were working at [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4389.860000000001s)]
*  this incredible engineering company [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4393.22s)]
*  and building cool shit there? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4396.02s)]
*  So tell the Netflix story. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4398.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so I kind of alluded to it earlier [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4401.02s)]
*  that I wanted to do my own startup. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4404.1s)]
*  So for, I forget how long it was, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4405.34s)]
*  one or two years or two and a half years, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4407.62s)]
*  built a startup, PHP, jQuery, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4410.22s)]
*  everyone's favorite languages all put together. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4412.74s)]
*  You can solve math stuff with jQuery. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4415.46s)]
*  So I just was like totally into just nonstop doing that. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4417.219999999999s)]
*  This was like the height of Stack Overflow. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4420.46s)]
*  I was asking really dumb questions on Stack Overflow, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4422.9s)]
*  like what is more Pythonic? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4425.34s)]
*  And then you get a bunch of upvotes [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4426.82s)]
*  and try to steal a bunch of karma away. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4428.3s)]
*  Like all the fun stuff to do. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4430.0199999999995s)]
*  Good times, and I was just like so into it, breathing. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4432.38s)]
*  And I just breathe it in, breathe it out. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4435.62s)]
*  And that's what I do all day, every day. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4438.139999999999s)]
*  And so it's just like nonstop building of a startup. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4439.58s)]
*  Ultimately that startup failed. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4442.74s)]
*  And so I had to go get a real job. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4444.22s)]
*  Can you say what the startup was? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4446.7s)]
*  It is so wild thinking about it in the past. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4448.26s)]
*  Before I tell you what it is, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4451.38s)]
*  I wanna tell one quick thing about my dad. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4452.38s)]
*  My dad in the early 90s, like 91, 92, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4454.5s)]
*  was building kind of like a phone card company [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4458.26s)]
*  where you'd be able to pre-purchase long distance minutes. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4461.5s)]
*  Now, if you remember the 90s and about like what? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4464.66s)]
*  97, 98, 99, 10, 10, 220, all those different things [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4466.9s)]
*  down down the center, right? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4471.0199999999995s)]
*  Like all of those companies [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4472.139999999999s)]
*  where you can pre-purchase long distance minutes [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4473.74s)]
*  kind of came out and were very, very big. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4476.66s)]
*  And so my dad was like six years early to that notion. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4478.7s)]
*  And ultimately his startup failed, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4482.0599999999995s)]
*  but he was just really early to something [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4484.66s)]
*  that would catch on really, really big, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4487.099999999999s)]
*  specifically in the telecommunication space. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4489.0199999999995s)]
*  Me, as I grew up and did my own startup, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4491.9s)]
*  I did a startup where it was text message marketing. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4494.099999999999s)]
*  This was in 2010 where you could receive, say, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4495.9s)]
*  texts about various deals, all that kind of stuff. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4498.299999999999s)]
*  And of course, 10 years later, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4501.179999999999s)]
*  now you don't stop receiving texts [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4503.94s)]
*  and text message marketing's all the rage. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4505.74s)]
*  And so I also, much like my father, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4508.78s)]
*  had a startup in the telemarketing space [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4510.94s)]
*  in which was just like a half decade too early. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4512.9s)]
*  So is it fair to say you're almost always ahead of your time [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4515.82s)]
*  at your visionary of sorts? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4518.78s)]
*  No, in fact, I am not ahead of my time. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4520.0599999999995s)]
*  I just got, some would say I got unlucky [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4522.0199999999995s)]
*  on that situation, but I did see, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4524.78s)]
*  it seemed so obvious to me at that time when I was doing it, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4526.94s)]
*  80% of phones were dumb phones. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4530.34s)]
*  Most people had flip phones. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4532.74s)]
*  When I went and sold via text is what the name was [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4534.3s)]
*  of that specific product. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4537.82s)]
*  It was, and we had the short code via text too. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4539.219999999999s)]
*  So it was pretty, pretty clever, right? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4541.58s)]
*  Six digits. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4543.38s)]
*  When I went out and sold it, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4545.62s)]
*  I only had a flip phone during that time. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4546.54s)]
*  I didn't even have a smartphone, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4548.42s)]
*  Cause they were kind of untenable for a lot of people. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4550.46s)]
*  So it's kind of just wild times to think about. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4553.74s)]
*  But then after that, obviously had to get a real job. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4556.78s)]
*  We were living in an apartment in right next to campus, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4559.38s)]
*  Bozeman, Montana, and the guy below us must've been on [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4563.58s)]
*  some amount of drugs. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4567.3s)]
*  He threatened to kill us several times with just like scream [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4568.78s)]
*  and just loses marbles all the time. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4570.94s)]
*  Very unhinged man, angry downstairs man [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4573.66s)]
*  is what we called him. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4575.98s)]
*  One time my wife had dropped a battery, AA. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4576.82s)]
*  Okay, so not like a big, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4579.58s)]
*  we're not talking about like a B battery or D battery. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4580.66s)]
*  We're just talking about AA, drop it. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4582.74s)]
*  Land on the ground. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4585.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna kill you. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4585.98s)]
*  Like crazy, right? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4587.38s)]
*  Absolutely unhinged behavior down there. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4588.38s)]
*  So I had to go get a real job. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4590.62s)]
*  We need to move out of there. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4592.34s)]
*  We're gonna start our life. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4593.7s)]
*  And so I worked at a small place, Schedulisty, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4594.62s)]
*  which I kind of talked about the boredom there. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4597.5s)]
*  Got to go to a place called Web Filings [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4599.34s)]
*  where I'm working just tons and tons of hours [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4601.099999999999s)]
*  during all that time. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm still trying to figure out startups. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4603.86s)]
*  Did one where you could pre-wish your friend's birthday [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4605.46s)]
*  messages, and then it would automatically send it [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4608.3s)]
*  via Facebook beforehand. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4611.26s)]
*  We call it great feed. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4613.42s)]
*  It was pretty, it was pretty clever. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4614.26s)]
*  Nonetheless, that story, say all that story, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4615.9800000000005s)]
*  because everything that I was doing was exploring, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4619.42s)]
*  building, finishing things, working, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4621.5s)]
*  learning about corporate life, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4624.46s)]
*  learning how to communicate in corporate life, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4625.7s)]
*  being able to be successful at a job, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4628.02s)]
*  learning about a bunch of kind of technologies [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4630.3s)]
*  that we're about. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4632.42s)]
*  And one of the big technologies during that day, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4633.26s)]
*  specifically 2013 was RXJS. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4635.06s)]
*  If you remember that one, RXJS. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4637.820000000001s)]
*  That's a link from C Sharp, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4639.42s)]
*  kind of ported over to JavaScript. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4642.38s)]
*  And for people who don't know, I guess C Sharp, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4645.26s)]
*  what is its closest neighbor, Java? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4647.54s)]
*  Is Java like? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4649.34s)]
*  They obviously just took Java and ripped it off [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4650.18s)]
*  at one point. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4651.7s)]
*  But now it's such a dynamic, interesting language [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4652.54s)]
*  that it seems like it could be a really cool, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4656.22s)]
*  like bounds of practical versus non-practical. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4658.26s)]
*  It's just, I'm not really into wearing pleated pants [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4660.58s)]
*  and programming at a Microsoft house, so. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4662.78s)]
*  Is pleated pants a requirement? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4665.38s)]
*  I think so. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4666.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4667.74s)]
*  Let's get back to this. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4668.58s)]
*  Can we just get back? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4669.42s)]
*  Come on. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4670.26s)]
*  All right. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4671.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4671.92s)]
*  Web filings. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4672.74s)]
*  Okay, so anyways, web filings was that's where I had to do [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4673.58s)]
*  like all the matrices stuff and build systems [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4675.74s)]
*  and just kind of all that. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4678.98s)]
*  And it really pushed me [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4679.94s)]
*  because they also wanted me to do like 60 hours a week. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4680.9s)]
*  It was not very healthy work-life balance. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4684.18s)]
*  It was very hard work and kind of like that really hard work [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4687.38s)]
*  going to cutting edge stuff, really understanding the world, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4689.94s)]
*  really made it so that I was able to just be able to talk [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4692.9s)]
*  about stuff very commandingly, because you know, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4696.66s)]
*  we had to build really complex state machines for the UI [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4698.14s)]
*  for what we're building. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4701.18s)]
*  And so when I went and started getting a LinkedIn [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4702.0s)]
*  and all that, inevitably just due to the fact [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4705.26s)]
*  that I've touched all these technologies [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4708.5s)]
*  and I had some sort of paper trail saying [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4709.92s)]
*  I've touched these technologies, Microsoft or Microsoft. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4712.18s)]
*  Dang it, Lex. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4714.700000000001s)]
*  Pleated pants. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4716.1s)]
*  Pleated pants reached out. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4716.9400000000005s)]
*  No, Netflix reached out and said, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4717.780000000001s)]
*  hey, like I see you've done RXJS. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4719.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, we do a lot of it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4723.64s)]
*  You want to come and interview with us. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4724.9400000000005s)]
*  And you know, I was always told that you should never reject [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4726.98s)]
*  a kind of like a handwritten personal invitation [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4730.94s)]
*  to interview. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4733.54s)]
*  This was way before bots and even the bots were pretty [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4734.379999999999s)]
*  obvious to tell that we're bots. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4737.0199999999995s)]
*  This was a manager at Netflix, Jeff Wagner, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4738.66s)]
*  first manager ever. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4741.54s)]
*  And he just wrote a really nice note and just like, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4742.7s)]
*  hey, I see you're doing a lot of these things. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4744.5199999999995s)]
*  We really need help with JavaScript. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4746.179999999999s)]
*  I would love for you to come interview. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4748.759999999999s)]
*  We even using a lot of RXJS if you're interested in that. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4750.0599999999995s)]
*  And so I was like, all right, you know, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4752.66s)]
*  I can come and I'll interview. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4753.98s)]
*  And lo and behold, interview went on. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4755.22s)]
*  And I called my wife, I think halfway through the interview [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4758.860000000001s)]
*  and I was just like, defeated, absolutely crushed. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4762.9400000000005s)]
*  Because I said, she might remember this, but I said, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4766.9400000000005s)]
*  we now have to make a decision. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4771.02s)]
*  Are we actually going to move to California or not? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4772.58s)]
*  Cause I already knew I had the job at that point. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4774.26s)]
*  I got just was just knocking them out of the park. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4776.1s)]
*  I was doing a great job on that. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4779.16s)]
*  And so I just knew for a fact, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4780.7s)]
*  I'm getting a job at Netflix. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4782.740000000001s)]
*  I, you know, all the things, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4783.94s)]
*  there's this thing that people always get so freaked out [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4785.66s)]
*  about when it comes to interviews and all that. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4787.379999999999s)]
*  And I luckily somehow avoided this. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4789.179999999999s)]
*  I don't get test anxiety. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4791.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't get any of that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4792.62s)]
*  Because when I go into these situations, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4793.78s)]
*  my only goal is to show the things I already know. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4796.0599999999995s)]
*  And so it's like, I walked into the situation. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4799.259999999999s)]
*  I had been preparing for this 80 hours a week [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4801.66s)]
*  for the last like five years. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4803.94s)]
*  So just walk in and just, I'm just showing the things I know. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4805.9s)]
*  And it was perfectly fitting for Netflix [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4808.36s)]
*  at that time period in the 2013 early JavaScript days [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4809.919999999999s)]
*  on television. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4813.46s)]
*  And so it was just awesome. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4814.38s)]
*  Just worked out perfectly. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4816.62s)]
*  Got hired there. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4818.38s)]
*  So where in California was Netflix? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4819.9s)]
*  This is San Francisco. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4821.46s)]
*  Los Gatos. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4822.3s)]
*  So if you're familiar, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4823.54s)]
*  so classic symbol people do, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4825.82s)]
*  which is this is San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4828.42s)]
*  Los Gatos is just like a little bit, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4832.54s)]
*  kind of little bit below, a little bit south of San Jose. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4834.86s)]
*  Same mega contiguous city. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4837.54s)]
*  Yellowstone is in Montana. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4839.26s)]
*  Yellowstone is the show. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4840.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4841.8s)]
*  So is it basically like that? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4842.96s)]
*  Kevin Costner riding on a horse? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4845.84s)]
*  Were you riding on a horse to campus or? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4846.68s)]
*  No, no. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4848.88s)]
*  But I mean, I love those stereotypes. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4849.72s)]
*  Actually, I mean, to be completely fair, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4851.160000000001s)]
*  when I was 15 years old, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4853.160000000001s)]
*  I was driving around on what is now [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4854.780000000001s)]
*  a very busy populated street, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4857.56s)]
*  shooting gophers out the window of our car with a 22. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4860.0s)]
*  So it's like, Montana was a different place [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4863.200000000001s)]
*  at one point than it is today. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4865.6s)]
*  And there's plenty of parts of Montana [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4867.0s)]
*  that's still very rural, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4868.64s)]
*  still kind of more of that old world. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4869.76s)]
*  So yeah, a little bit, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4871.98s)]
*  you can kind of get whatever you want from Montana. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4874.099999999999s)]
*  As far as like culturally goes, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4875.94s)]
*  I'm not really sure the best way to put [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4877.379999999999s)]
*  the difference between California and Montana. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4879.719999999999s)]
*  It's just different expectations. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4882.94s)]
*  Like one thing I can really appreciate about California, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4884.86s)]
*  or at least when I say California, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean the Silicon Valley, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4889.339999999999s)]
*  because obviously LA and the Silicon Valley, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4890.879999999999s)]
*  very different attitudes, very different mindsets. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4894.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't really compare one to the other. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4896.259999999999s)]
*  One thing I can say that's really positive about the Valley [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4898.259999999999s)]
*  is that everybody is operating on this idea [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4900.66s)]
*  of like trying to build or create something. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4904.26s)]
*  And there's an energy to it that's like very exciting. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4906.34s)]
*  Like you meet somebody and they have a startup [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4909.42s)]
*  and they're working on the startup. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4911.0s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4912.54s)]
*  And there's a lot of negative aspects to that. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4913.5s)]
*  And we can all agree that our entire life [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4916.54s)]
*  being commercialized has probably not been that great, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4918.94s)]
*  but the kind of the experience of being there [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4921.7s)]
*  and everyone's excited to build something, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4923.66s)]
*  it's a really cool experience. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4925.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4926.62s)]
*  It's really great. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4927.5s)]
*  The excitement, the energy. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4928.34s)]
*  Montana doesn't have that. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4929.74s)]
*  I have an admiration, a romantic admiration [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4931.219999999999s)]
*  for the shows like Yellowstone, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4933.42s)]
*  being out in nature, it's beautiful. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4935.5s)]
*  I like riding horses. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4937.179999999999s)]
*  Somebody also said, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4938.5s)]
*  Reddit is full of wisdom about you. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4939.82s)]
*  Some of it could be fake news, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4942.139999999999s)]
*  but something about horses and this kind of thing. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4943.42s)]
*  Like you like horses, you like riding horses. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4945.88s)]
*  We have horses on our up. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4947.9s)]
*  Our neighbor had much more hilly land. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4949.26s)]
*  And one of the horses broke its legs, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4952.76s)]
*  so they had to put it down. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4955.139999999999s)]
*  And so we just said, hey, we're on much flatter land. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4956.599999999999s)]
*  You can just have your horses in our property. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4958.86s)]
*  And so we just have horses that run around on our. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4961.179999999999s)]
*  What about milking cows? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4964.259999999999s)]
*  Somebody asked about cattle and cow and. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4965.98s)]
*  So I've only had open cows. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4970.0599999999995s)]
*  So if you don't know cow means girl, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4972.5s)]
*  open means that, hey, they've tried to get the cow pregnant. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4974.42s)]
*  The cow did not get pregnant first try. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4977.5s)]
*  And so they're calling that gene. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4979.339999999999s)]
*  They're getting rid of that gene. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4980.66s)]
*  The cow's gonna now, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4981.54s)]
*  or the open cow is gonna now go out to pasture, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4982.38s)]
*  pasture for the year, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4984.86s)]
*  then get turned into delicious T-bone steaks [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4986.0599999999995s)]
*  of various things. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4988.48s)]
*  And so we would house open cows on our property. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4989.32s)]
*  So no, there's no milking of open cows. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4993.5s)]
*  They'd be very upset if you tried to milk an open cow [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4996.099999999999s)]
*  because they're not milking cows. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5000.08s)]
*  You have to get like that cow pregnant. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5001.76s)]
*  And then once you get a pregnant, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5003.2s)]
*  you have to kind of put it into this permanent state [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5004.04s)]
*  of milking and all that. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5005.4s)]
*  And it's a little bit more complicated than say what we did, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5006.98s)]
*  which was just cows on eating grass [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5010.96s)]
*  and I didn't have to touch them. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5013.34s)]
*  Okay, well, that's wonderful. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5015.24s)]
*  Reddit is not a great place for wisdom about me. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5016.8s)]
*  They're gonna give you the craziest answers. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5019.360000000001s)]
*  We will return to Reddit time and time again, my friend. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5021.72s)]
*  So yeah, you took the leap into Netflix. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5026.24s)]
*  So what was that like? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5028.360000000001s)]
*  It was, you know, this is one of those things [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5030.2s)]
*  where when you talk about it, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5033.56s)]
*  people love to trivialize this [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5034.54s)]
*  cause it's like, oh, you're taking a leap of faith [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5037.360000000001s)]
*  by going into a fang company in like 2013. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5039.04s)]
*  Sounds super risky. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5041.88s)]
*  My wife was 36 weeks pregnant. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5043.820000000001s)]
*  We had to travel to a place where we knew not a soul. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5045.7s)]
*  We were about to have our first kid. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5049.74s)]
*  We didn't even have a doctor. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5050.9s)]
*  If you don't know, having a baby does like kind of, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5052.099999999999s)]
*  you kind of want a relationship with a doctor. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5054.22s)]
*  There's like a whole thing that goes on there. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5056.78s)]
*  So it was kind of, it was a really hard and great experience. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5058.76s)]
*  So I went to a job in which their culture deck. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5063.5599999999995s)]
*  So during this time, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5065.58s)]
*  this is where Netflix still had like [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5066.42s)]
*  kind of that old generation X feel to it. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5068.66s)]
*  Their culture deck was higher fast, fire fast. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5072.26s)]
*  It was very in your face about like, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5075.219999999999s)]
*  hey, this is how we operate. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5076.86s)]
*  You don't meet the standards, we kick you out. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5077.86s)]
*  So it's like, I'm going, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5079.219999999999s)]
*  I'm leaving a place where it's more secure to go to a place. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5080.34s)]
*  I don't know anybody to a job that's bold [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5083.46s)]
*  in its claims about firing everybody [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5086.48s)]
*  with a wife that's just about to have a baby. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5088.54s)]
*  And so it's like, and I'm from Montana [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5090.5s)]
*  and every Montanans born with a natural dislike [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5092.54s)]
*  of California. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5096.42s)]
*  So there's like all these things kind of flowing into it [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5097.259999999999s)]
*  where it's just gonna be like, wow, this is gonna be, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5099.74s)]
*  this is a very intense experience. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  And it was hard for sure. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5105.1s)]
*  Like it wasn't just some easy, simple experience [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5106.94s)]
*  that we were just like, oh, I work now at Fang. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5109.54s)]
*  We had to kind of work through that. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5112.46s)]
*  Having a kid was very difficult. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5113.64s)]
*  Our first kid was very difficult. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5114.94s)]
*  Not having any family around to ever help you. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5117.14s)]
*  Like took a much larger toll on my wife than me for sure. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5119.06s)]
*  What was the technical learning curve for you? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5123.88s)]
*  You showed up in your plaid pants, like dressed up. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5125.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5128.9800000000005s)]
*  And what was it? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5129.82s)]
*  What did you have to learn about the stack? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5130.64s)]
*  Because Netflix, I imagine is this incredible infrastructure [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5131.9s)]
*  has to deliver just a huge amount of data. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5136.66s)]
*  I'm just blown away by Netflix, but also like YouTube. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5139.7s)]
*  These companies that have to deliver, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5145.139999999999s)]
*  like serve a huge amount of like bits. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5148.62s)]
*  Netflix has the easiest out of all the companies Netflix buy. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5155.0199999999995s)]
*  Even though we have, you could say maybe we have, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5157.94s)]
*  maybe we beat YouTube in view hours. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5160.42s)]
*  I'm not sure if we do, but let's just pretend Netflix [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5162.14s)]
*  has 5X more view hours than YouTube. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5164.34s)]
*  Whatever it is, Netflix has a fundamentally easier problem [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5168.3s)]
*  than all other companies. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5171.3s)]
*  And let's get back to that. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5172.34s)]
*  I'm gonna first tell you about the stack, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5173.26s)]
*  but I'll tell you why it has a fundamentally easier problem. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5174.42s)]
*  So when I first got there, they gave me my PlayStation 3. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5176.78s)]
*  My boss said, go learn some code. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5181.16s)]
*  Come back to me in a couple of days [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5183.66s)]
*  and tell me what you've learned. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5184.86s)]
*  And then I'm gonna start giving you bugs to fix. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5185.7s)]
*  Wait, PlayStation 3, what are you talking about? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5187.46s)]
*  Well, I was on the TV team. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5189.62s)]
*  I had to go plug in a PlayStation [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5190.78s)]
*  and start launching programs onto the PlayStation 3 [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5192.76s)]
*  and figure out how to work Netflix on a television device. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5195.46s)]
*  Oh, so like you have different kinds of devices. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5198.82s)]
*  Why PlayStation 3s? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5200.94s)]
*  Other different. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5201.9s)]
*  It's just 2013, that's what you had. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5202.74s)]
*  Any devices that plug into the TV, okay, cool. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5204.58s)]
*  Yeah, not as many TVs had Netflix, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5206.46s)]
*  let alone what they called their Darwin app, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5208.9s)]
*  which is their new application. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5210.94s)]
*  So if you bought a Vizio earlier that year, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5212.74s)]
*  you'd get their older one there. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5214.46s)]
*  It's called Plus UI. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5215.54s)]
*  You get their older version. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5216.9s)]
*  And so not many had the newer version. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5218.52s)]
*  We no longer supported Plus, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5220.280000000001s)]
*  or we never actively developed on Plus. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5221.6s)]
*  We only did stuff on Darwin. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5223.400000000001s)]
*  And so I had to learn that whole stack. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5224.6s)]
*  The backend or the middle end, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5227.64s)]
*  the middle layer between the actual backend [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5229.68s)]
*  and the front end was written in Groovy. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5231.6s)]
*  And as I went around, Groovy is, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5234.040000000001s)]
*  if you're not familiar with Jenkins, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5236.160000000001s)]
*  then you've probably never interacted with Groovy. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5237.84s)]
*  But Groovy is a JVM language. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5240.040000000001s)]
*  It's a very interesting language. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5243.0s)]
*  But here's how it got started at Netflix. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5247.6s)]
*  Oh, it's Apache. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5250.52s)]
*  Apache Groovy is a powerful object-oriented [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5251.360000000001s)]
*  programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5252.92s)]
*  released in 2007. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5255.84s)]
*  It has evolved to become a versatile language [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5257.68s)]
*  that combines both static and dynamic typing capabilities. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5259.88s)]
*  All right, so the AI is kind of lying to you. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5263.04s)]
*  Groovy is not a powerful, great language. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5265.280000000001s)]
*  That statement makes it seem way cooler than it actually is. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5268.08s)]
*  You will meet one out of a hundred people [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5270.780000000001s)]
*  that have touched Groovy that said, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5273.0s)]
*  oh yeah, Groovy's great. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5274.0s)]
*  The other 99 will be like, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5276.08s)]
*  heavens forbid you ever have to touch that language. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5277.5199999999995s)]
*  So when I got there, nobody, not a single soul at Netflix, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5280.2s)]
*  there's 40 some engineers, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5285.12s)]
*  had any idea how Groovy pretty much worked. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5286.8s)]
*  Somehow people just hacked together these scripts [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5289.64s)]
*  and put them all on there and it worked. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5292.5199999999995s)]
*  And it was all, this was before there was a Groovy RX port. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5294.64s)]
*  We wrote our own version called WX. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5299.16s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5301.48s)]
*  Observables, all these things. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5302.96s)]
*  I remember one time they told me that, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5304.28s)]
*  oh yeah, with RX it's really easy. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5306.28s)]
*  You just say what you need to do. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5308.28s)]
*  It maps out and boom, boom, boom, boom. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5309.32s)]
*  Everything will run multi-thread and all that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5310.92s)]
*  And I was like, oh wow, really? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5312.4s)]
*  So all I did was go like observable.sleep1 [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5313.82s)]
*  because I just wanted to see it sleep [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5318.759999999999s)]
*  and then do the next thing. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5319.92s)]
*  And it turns out when a thread sleeps itself, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5321.219999999999s)]
*  no thread can wake it up. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5323.679999999999s)]
*  And I just turned off all of staging [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5325.16s)]
*  because I ran it like 10 times, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5326.96s)]
*  like, oh, it's not responding. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5327.92s)]
*  Oh, it's not responding. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5328.92s)]
*  Oh, now it's not even coming back. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5329.759999999999s)]
*  Broke all of staging for everybody. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5331.44s)]
*  So no developer could work for the rest of the afternoon [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5333.36s)]
*  because I locked up all the instances [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5335.5599999999995s)]
*  because it turns out, no, it was in fact not multi-threaded. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5337.08s)]
*  Every assumption we've been told is a lie. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5340.16s)]
*  No one had any idea what they were doing. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5342.12s)]
*  It was a wild time. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5343.92s)]
*  And so I just simply naturally gravitated towards that [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5346.44s)]
*  because I'm good at printf debugging. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5349.219999999999s)]
*  I'm good at doing those things. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5351.04s)]
*  So I was like, here, I'll just figure this out here. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5352.04s)]
*  I will do this. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5353.7s)]
*  So I had to rewrite how we do the data structure [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5354.7s)]
*  on the front end for the TV [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5357.08s)]
*  from what is called a LoloMo, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5359.28s)]
*  list of list of movies into LoloRomo, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5361.04s)]
*  which is a list of list of recommendation objects for movie. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5363.56s)]
*  Why would we need to do that? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5367.08s)]
*  Think about this. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5368.28s)]
*  You have two lists. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5369.12s)]
*  One has Live Free Die Hard, Bruce Willis, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5370.1s)]
*  because you love Bruce Willis. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5372.08s)]
*  The other one has Live Free Die Hard [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5373.2s)]
*  because you want tough men doing tough jobs. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5374.92s)]
*  Well, during those days, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5377.32s)]
*  we'd only have one way we could show evidence [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5378.64s)]
*  why you wanted it. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5380.6s)]
*  So we couldn't say, oh, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5381.44s)]
*  because you liked this other movie. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5382.28s)]
*  You'd go to that one and say the same thing. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5383.76s)]
*  So we had to kind of add one level of indirection [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5385.68s)]
*  where we could decorate the video [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5387.76s)]
*  with the recommendation information. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5390.24s)]
*  Okay, so you can abstract away into the space [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5392.04s)]
*  of recommendation versus the space of movies directly. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5394.4s)]
*  Yeah, so you can't hang it off the video [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5396.8s)]
*  because obviously then it would be the same [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5398.639999999999s)]
*  for everything that shows that same video. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5400.0s)]
*  So I had to do all this and I wrote it in Groovy [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5401.639999999999s)]
*  and I just did it. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5404.639999999999s)]
*  And people were like, how did you write this in Groovy? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5406.04s)]
*  And it was just like, well, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5409.5599999999995s)]
*  I read the language reference for a day [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5410.92s)]
*  and then programmed it well. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5413.74s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5415.16s)]
*  It was a very radical language, shall we say. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5416.24s)]
*  And so I just simply became the person that knew these things [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5419.34s)]
*  so they just give me more and more jobs with that. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5422.1s)]
*  And so that's kind of how I excelled, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5423.900000000001s)]
*  being the person that was willing to do the thing [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5425.42s)]
*  that no one else was. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5426.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, can you actually speak to the print of debugging? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5428.3s)]
*  You walk into a system, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5430.780000000001s)]
*  and there's a lot of systems in the world like this. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5433.1s)]
*  Twitter was like this when Elon acquired Twitter [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5435.38s)]
*  and then rolls in and there's this old janky code base [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5438.700000000001s)]
*  that's just like a giant mess [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5443.76s)]
*  and you have to basically do print of debugging. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5445.06s)]
*  What's the process of going into a code base [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5447.7s)]
*  and figuring out like, what the fuck? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5449.58s)]
*  How does this work? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5451.22s)]
*  What are the flaws? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5452.04s)]
*  What are the assumptions? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5452.88s)]
*  You have to reverse engineer [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5453.72s)]
*  what all these other engineers did in the past [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5455.22s)]
*  and the mess across the space of months and years. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5457.66s)]
*  And you have to figure out how all that works [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5460.86s)]
*  in order to make improvements. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5463.0199999999995s)]
*  The reason why I've always just been good [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5465.0199999999995s)]
*  at print of debugging, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5467.0199999999995s)]
*  because one of my first kind of side quest jobs [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5467.86s)]
*  that I got was writing robots for the government [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5469.7s)]
*  when I was still at school. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5471.78s)]
*  And so I had to kind of do this contractually [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5473.099999999999s)]
*  for so many hours. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5475.0199999999995s)]
*  So many hours a week and my boss, Hunter Lloyd, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5477.82s)]
*  great professor by the way, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5480.0599999999995s)]
*  he just said, hey, here's your computer, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5481.54s)]
*  here's the robot, here's how you plug it in, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5484.38s)]
*  here's how you run the code. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5486.54s)]
*  Can you write the flash driver, the ethernet driver? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5487.78s)]
*  Can you write the planetary pancake motor? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5489.86s)]
*  Here's some manuals. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5491.5s)]
*  I'm missing some, just figure it out, I'll be back. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5493.7s)]
*  So that was government work for me. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5496.099999999999s)]
*  So I was like, okay, I'll figure all these things out [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5497.42s)]
*  and I figured them all out. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5499.0s)]
*  And the only way to really get anything out of the machine [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5500.2s)]
*  was to print. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5503.32s)]
*  And so it's like, I had to become really good [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5504.78s)]
*  at printing my way through problems. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5508.400000000001s)]
*  And so that kind of became this like skill, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5510.0s)]
*  I guess I adopted is that I can just kind of print [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5511.6s)]
*  after bug my way through a lot of these problems. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5513.64s)]
*  Obviously I'm not a game developer, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5516.120000000001s)]
*  probably a different world, probably should use. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5517.400000000001s)]
*  I think John Carmack was on here [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5519.320000000001s)]
*  and talked to how great the debugger is, different world. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5520.64s)]
*  Because when I was at Netflix, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5523.120000000001s)]
*  there's machines that exist somewhere on AWS. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5524.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not logged into them. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5527.400000000001s)]
*  I don't even know how to log into them. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5528.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not even sure if I have credentials to log into them. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5529.72s)]
*  They run once somewhere and I have to figure out [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5532.160000000001s)]
*  what happened and why it's happening. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5534.320000000001s)]
*  So it's like, I'm gonna become, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5535.5s)]
*  this is what I've trained for. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5537.26s)]
*  I'm a print after bugging champion. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5539.18s)]
*  So it's just like, I could just run through these things [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5540.86s)]
*  really quickly and figure out why they're happening [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5542.78s)]
*  the way they're happening. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5545.26s)]
*  You're a special human. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5546.1s)]
*  I think that's an incredible skill set to have, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5547.02s)]
*  to be able to drop in into any code base, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5548.94s)]
*  drop into any situation and do print after bugging. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5551.58s)]
*  Meaning like, you're in a dark room [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5554.34s)]
*  and you're feeling around that room [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5556.94s)]
*  to try to figure out what the room is. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5558.12s)]
*  Well, I had the code, so it's like, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5560.22s)]
*  I can kind of blueprint what's happening. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5561.38s)]
*  Like I don't understand the services [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5563.22s)]
*  or anything that's happening. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5564.42s)]
*  You can start guessing pretty quick [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5565.860000000001s)]
*  as to what's going wrong. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5567.34s)]
*  Right, but then the print side of that [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5568.7s)]
*  helps you confirm your intuitions, test your intuitions [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5572.42s)]
*  and build up more and more information. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5576.780000000001s)]
*  And then you start to accumulate [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5578.58s)]
*  like this bigger picture from that. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5580.06s)]
*  What the edge cases are that break the system or not. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5582.04s)]
*  I mean, I think that just, that kind of space, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5586.3s)]
*  like that kind of situation is intimidating [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5590.14s)]
*  for a lot of engineers. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5593.34s)]
*  They break down at that point. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5595.0199999999995s)]
*  I think this really is a powerful thing [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5596.82s)]
*  to be able to come into a code base. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5598.3s)]
*  That's generally a skill set of like, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5600.18s)]
*  very few of us start from scratch. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5603.68s)]
*  And actually this is the fundamental problem [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5606.3s)]
*  of web development and in general, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5608.66s)]
*  where they're like, I don't know what's going on, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5611.5s)]
*  I'm going to write my own thing from scratch. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5614.099999999999s)]
*  As opposed to like actually doing print out, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5617.139999999999s)]
*  debugging on the space of languages, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5619.58s)]
*  on the space of problems, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5622.22s)]
*  because there's a lot of wisdom [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5624.06s)]
*  and solved problems already in this code base. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5627.080000000001s)]
*  It's a much more important skill set to understand, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5630.820000000001s)]
*  to learn from the mistakes and the wisdom of the past, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5633.900000000001s)]
*  of the ancestors that came before. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5637.3s)]
*  And build on them as opposed to throw it all out [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5640.0s)]
*  and start from scratch. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5643.18s)]
*  This is something obviously you see a lot [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5644.1s)]
*  with a JavaScript framework that comes out [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5645.580000000001s)]
*  and you want every single day. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5647.860000000001s)]
*  I have a very great story about that. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5649.580000000001s)]
*  This is what like, I think has shaped me the most [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5651.7s)]
*  about my perspective of other devs. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5654.0599999999995s)]
*  There's this dev and he always just wrote things [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5656.26s)]
*  in just what I thought was such a bizarre and weird way. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5658.5s)]
*  And this had to do with Falcor, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5662.0199999999995s)]
*  so our data fetching library for Netflix. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5663.86s)]
*  This would run on mobile, so I had to write in Objective-C, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5666.86s)]
*  it had to run on television and it had to also run on web. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5669.5s)]
*  So it ran on everything. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5673.26s)]
*  And it mean one other person were responsible [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5674.82s)]
*  for this thing working. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5676.94s)]
*  And the request side where we'd had to [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5678.0199999999995s)]
*  dedupe the information that we already have, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5680.82s)]
*  the requests that were pending and the new data. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5683.0199999999995s)]
*  So I had to figure all that out based on [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5685.62s)]
*  what someone's requesting and then just only optimally [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5686.94s)]
*  request the stuff that we don't have. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5689.7s)]
*  He wrote it in such a goofy way and I'm thinking, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5692.66s)]
*  man, this guy is just, what a goofball. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5694.66s)]
*  So I delete it all and I start writing and I'm like, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5697.42s)]
*  look at how much nice of this is, it's looking so good. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5700.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, ooh, there's that one edge case. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5702.66s)]
*  Okay, I can see why he wrote it this one way. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5705.54s)]
*  That's not a big deal though. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5707.38s)]
*  The rest of my code is really great. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5708.34s)]
*  By the end of it, I'm like, I literally almost line for line [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5709.7s)]
*  just reproduced what he already wrote. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5712.74s)]
*  It's like slightly different towards my style, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5715.22s)]
*  but I just wrote the same code. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5717.139999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I'm an idiot. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5719.099999999999s)]
*  I am the idiot in this situation [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5720.62s)]
*  because it was already a solved problem. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5722.62s)]
*  I just didn't take the time to learn what he did. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5724.58s)]
*  Instead, I relearned what he did [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5726.54s)]
*  by rewriting the entire thing. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5728.099999999999s)]
*  I think that's the skill set that is extremely important [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5729.54s)]
*  for people to learn. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5731.86s)]
*  I see that in myself. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5733.179999999999s)]
*  That's a constant struggle for myself. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5734.179999999999s)]
*  When facing a code base, for example, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5736.66s)]
*  but this applies generally in life, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5740.099999999999s)]
*  where somebody did a lot of work to do a thing, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5742.3s)]
*  you should invest a huge amount of time [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5745.34s)]
*  and get really good at figuring out what they did, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5747.58s)]
*  why they did it, do a lot of printout debugging [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5750.74s)]
*  to understand what they did. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5754.22s)]
*  It's a much more efficient way to understand a problem [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5755.38s)]
*  deeply than to start from scratch, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5758.42s)]
*  even though there's a constant temptation [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5760.74s)]
*  to start from scratch, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5763.5s)]
*  because starting from scratch is fun. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5765.14s)]
*  You do get the puzzle solving, all that kind of stuff. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5766.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just not going to be the right thing to do. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5770.62s)]
*  Usually pain is the right thing to do, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5774.26s)]
*  and it is for most people painful [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5777.06s)]
*  to understand other people's code bases. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5778.860000000001s)]
*  I highly recommend starting from scratch [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5781.18s)]
*  if you want to understand a concept. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5783.62s)]
*  You don't know how an HTTP server works? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5785.46s)]
*  Create a TCP socket, learn how to parse HTTP. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5788.06s)]
*  It'll become very easy, and you'll go, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5792.1s)]
*  this is the reason why whenever I get a request, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5793.58s)]
*  I have to await the text. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5796.66s)]
*  I now understand why the text is, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5798.54s)]
*  for whatever reason, not there. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5800.98s)]
*  I get it, I now understand it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5802.22s)]
*  And so you kind of gain these new perspectives [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5804.34s)]
*  just by simply parsing something out. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5806.74s)]
*  All right, back to the wisdom of Reddit. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5810.0199999999995s)]
*  Apparently there are memes and legends [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5812.3s)]
*  about your programming arc in Netflix. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5814.7s)]
*  This Falcor system you mentioned, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5818.22s)]
*  somebody, I think it was Tiege, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5820.82s)]
*  how do you pronounce his name, by the way? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5823.14s)]
*  Tiege. Tiege, okay, Tiege. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5824.34s)]
*  It's Teejay would be his name, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5826.46s)]
*  but we call it Tiege, or Telescopic Johnson. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5827.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow, so many names. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5830.620000000001s)]
*  You know, DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service attacks, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5833.14s)]
*  you apparently were able to accomplish [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5836.820000000001s)]
*  the simplified version of that, of just DOS. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5838.620000000001s)]
*  That's a legend. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5841.780000000001s)]
*  So you basically broke down the system somehow. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5842.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so- Can you tell the story of that? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5845.820000000001s)]
*  I'd be glad to. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5848.02s)]
*  So there's this Falcor business, right? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5848.860000000001s)]
*  And I kind of, I did discover the bug before anybody else, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5851.02s)]
*  and I did report it to security, and it was so bad. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5855.9800000000005s)]
*  It actually got its own name, Repulsive Grizzly Attack, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5859.660000000001s)]
*  and they even give examples of how to do it. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5862.900000000001s)]
*  Effectively, what it means is that there is a request [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5866.3s)]
*  that targets both memory and CPU and will destroy, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5868.660000000001s)]
*  there you go, look at that, how Netflix, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5871.38s)]
*  the next one down was the article that was actually written. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5872.820000000001s)]
*  I don't get mentioned, which is a little bit upsetting, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5875.860000000001s)]
*  considering I was the one that discovered it [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5878.02s)]
*  and told everybody how bad it was. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5879.54s)]
*  Anyways, and had to write the fix for it, or the first fix. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5881.62s)]
*  So this is how it works, is that you can do [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5885.0199999999995s)]
*  something pretty similar, I believe, with GraphQL as well. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5889.94s)]
*  It has the same kind of danger. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5892.94s)]
*  Any of these kind of RPC requests, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5894.7s)]
*  as much or as little of the data as you would like frameworks [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5897.0199999999995s)]
*  are vulnerable to this kind of attack. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5900.38s)]
*  So with Falcor, what you do is you give it an array. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5902.26s)]
*  This array is called a path, and that's the path to the data. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5905.0199999999995s)]
*  But sometimes you don't want to have to write out, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5908.14s)]
*  I want row zero, or list zero, or row zero, column zero, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5910.660000000001s)]
*  title, I want row zero, column zero, description. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5916.06s)]
*  You don't want to have to write out all that. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5920.06s)]
*  So instead, you could just be like, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5921.900000000001s)]
*  I want rows zero through 10, columns zero through 10, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5923.42s)]
*  titles and descriptions. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5930.02s)]
*  So you can write in a very compact, nice little format, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5931.9400000000005s)]
*  and it'll give you all that data. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5934.18s)]
*  It'll go to the server, the server will fill that all in [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5935.34s)]
*  and give it to you. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5937.42s)]
*  Oh, dang it. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5938.42s)]
*  List three, it only had three videos in it. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5939.780000000001s)]
*  So what happens when I try to re-request the data? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5943.06s)]
*  Well, I need a way to be able to tell my system [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5945.18s)]
*  that you'd have requested the data [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5948.02s)]
*  and there's nothing there. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5950.22s)]
*  So this is called like a, call this like a boxed value. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5951.58s)]
*  So it's going to be like type something, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5954.58s)]
*  value, there's nothing there. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5957.1s)]
*  We've already requested it and there's nothing there. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5958.26s)]
*  They call, you know, it's like a sentinel value, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5959.860000000001s)]
*  if you will, a boxed value. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5961.38s)]
*  And we have this little special flag we'd pass [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5962.780000000001s)]
*  called materialize, meaning that when you ask for a path, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5966.74s)]
*  we will make sure we fill it out [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5970.0199999999995s)]
*  so we don't actually erase anything. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5971.54s)]
*  And at the very end, we'll say, okay, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5973.219999999999s)]
*  the thing does the request you've made [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5975.42s)]
*  has already been made and there's nothing there. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5977.34s)]
*  Well, what happens if I request rows zero through 10,000, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5979.5s)]
*  columns through 10,000, one more item through 10,000 [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5982.62s)]
*  and then a whole bunch of properties [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5986.26s)]
*  and then ask it to materialize? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5987.98s)]
*  Well, I'm about to go create billions of objects [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5989.82s)]
*  in the JVM and what happens to the machine? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5993.099999999999s)]
*  It stops running. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5996.34s)]
*  And then if we try to JSON, even if it could create them all, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5997.5s)]
*  we then ask it that JSON serialize, it's not going to do it. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6000.18s)]
*  Or like it's impossible. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6004.3s)]
*  And so that was the attack vector is a simple while loop [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6005.66s)]
*  would have taken down and held down Netflix [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6010.22s)]
*  for a very long time. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6013.5s)]
*  Cause one request would kill one machine on AWS. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6015.06s)]
*  And so that means it would just turn it all off. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6019.14s)]
*  And this was on the website. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6020.9800000000005s)]
*  This was on TV. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6022.62s)]
*  This was on mobile. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6025.1s)]
*  Like this was profound. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6026.820000000001s)]
*  And here's the worst part. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6027.700000000001s)]
*  It was in production for years. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6028.660000000001s)]
*  So we couldn't even roll it back. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6030.660000000001s)]
*  There was no like, oh crap, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6032.9400000000005s)]
*  let's just roll back to two weeks ago [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6034.26s)]
*  and we'll kind of fix forward and figure out. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6035.9400000000005s)]
*  No, it's like, we could roll back to 2011. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6037.42s)]
*  Like that's our option is 2011 and that's it. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6040.18s)]
*  So we had to figure out a way forward and all that. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6043.06s)]
*  And so it was like, the amount of problems [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6045.18s)]
*  that would have happened [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6049.42s)]
*  if someone would have discovered this is unstatable. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6050.860000000001s)]
*  Just to be clear, the infrastructure [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6055.26s)]
*  that's serving the videos would shut down. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6056.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the UI, like you couldn't perform any actions [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6060.18s)]
*  on the UI. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6062.66s)]
*  You'd surprisingly could still stream video, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6063.5s)]
*  but you would never be able to get to a video to stream [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6064.9400000000005s)]
*  cause every action you would take [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6066.9400000000005s)]
*  would be completely shut down. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6068.38s)]
*  And so it wasn't a DDoS cause you didn't need [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6069.66s)]
*  a bunch of computers to try to overwhelm the system [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6072.1s)]
*  by making a bunch of requests. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6074.34s)]
*  One request, one machine. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6075.900000000001s)]
*  If we had 50 machines serving the millions of requests, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6077.62s)]
*  it only take 50 requests to shut down the entire UI. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6080.900000000001s)]
*  Isn't it possible to do DDoS or DDoS [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6083.58s)]
*  on basically any software system? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6086.7s)]
*  Like defending against all the, you know, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6088.66s)]
*  closing all those attack factors [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6091.54s)]
*  is probably really difficult. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6093.0199999999995s)]
*  If you take any soft, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6094.34s)]
*  sufficiently complicated software system, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6096.38s)]
*  there's probably so many ways to overwhelm it. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6099.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's, I mean, this is why people use Cloudflare. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6102.74s)]
*  I think DHH said it best, which is like, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6105.74s)]
*  we have our website and we have a strong body guard [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6108.0599999999995s)]
*  on the outside. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6110.54s)]
*  So Cloudflare has a bunch of utilities all built in [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6111.62s)]
*  cause you know, obviously this is why everyone hates [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6114.34s)]
*  all these Bluetooth devices that connect to the internet [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6117.74s)]
*  because they just turn into attack vectors [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6119.9s)]
*  where people use those to DDoS or DDoS other sites. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6121.42s)]
*  And so you don't need something sophisticated. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6124.26s)]
*  You just need a bunch of requests to come in [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6126.18s)]
*  and you can take down websites. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6128.0599999999995s)]
*  And so that's why these fronts are really good [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6129.34s)]
*  at kind of discovering where these problems are. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6131.46s)]
*  But DDoS is a bit different [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6133.78s)]
*  because it doesn't have to be overwhelming [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6135.0599999999995s)]
*  by using resources with a whole bunch of requests. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6137.22s)]
*  It really just means simply that [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6140.0599999999995s)]
*  there's a denial of service attack. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6142.54s)]
*  One of them could be, there's a regex attack that existed [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6144.38s)]
*  where Cloudflare actually did it to itself [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6146.9s)]
*  and shut itself down, which is there's a regex expansion [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6149.38s)]
*  attack where given the right kind of regex, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6151.86s)]
*  if you know someone's running a specific regex, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6153.86s)]
*  you can actually provide input that is maximally bad. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6156.18s)]
*  And that thing goes to like super processing. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6159.38s)]
*  It takes 10 seconds to process a single request. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6162.0599999999995s)]
*  Then you only need to make hundreds of requests [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6164.58s)]
*  and you shut down the whole service. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6166.7s)]
*  It's not like you need some giant machinery [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6168.0199999999995s)]
*  and requests, you only need just some small amount [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6170.22s)]
*  to completely destroy a service. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6171.9400000000005s)]
*  And so there's, the web is an extremely difficult place [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6173.42s)]
*  to do it correct. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6177.58s)]
*  This is super fascinating. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6179.14s)]
*  I do also wonder how many ultra competent, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6180.62s)]
*  what is it, black hat hackers there are [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6186.5s)]
*  versus sort of the good guys versus the bad guys, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6189.3s)]
*  how many bad guys there are and what is the average, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6193.3s)]
*  what is the distribution of skillset on the bad guy side [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6198.18s)]
*  that are constantly trying to attack? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6201.34s)]
*  I assume there's probably a huge number [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6203.38s)]
*  of just really simple ones, script kiddies, right? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6204.9400000000005s)]
*  Just people trying to just do things. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6206.900000000001s)]
*  And then there's a huge amount of like social engineering [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6208.660000000001s)]
*  that just goes in where hacking is done, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6210.9800000000005s)]
*  not with a computer, but just by, you know, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6212.42s)]
*  one of the classic ones, Kevin Mitnick had this one [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6215.34s)]
*  in his book, which was you'd call up somebody pretending [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6217.22s)]
*  to be like, Charlene, we're doing some auditing [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6220.34s)]
*  and I think your pin's out of date on file. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6223.22s)]
*  Is it two, three, two, three still? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6226.54s)]
*  And they're like, no, it's four, seven, four, seven. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6228.22s)]
*  You're like, oh, thanks Sharon. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6230.34s)]
*  Boom, you just hacked them, right? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6232.54s)]
*  Like the classic, people love correcting bad information. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6233.58s)]
*  This is like a standard. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6237.46s)]
*  So like, there's all these ways people hack. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6238.58s)]
*  And so my assumption is that there are really great [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6240.46s)]
*  white hat hackers, there's really great black hat hackers, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6243.82s)]
*  but the vulnerability space, the thing is, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6246.94s)]
*  is that discovering a vulnerability [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6249.82s)]
*  and you don't let anyone know, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6253.54s)]
*  the white hat hacker still has to make that same discovery. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6255.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6258.46s)]
*  And that's where I think the real thing is, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6259.3s)]
*  is that black hat hacking in some sense [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6260.38s)]
*  has a fundamentally easier job, or at least a job [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6262.34s)]
*  in which they can take advantage of [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6265.22s)]
*  for much longer periods of time. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6266.46s)]
*  One's the process of discovering who's breaking the system. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6268.18s)]
*  The other one's trying to figure out how to break the system. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6271.3s)]
*  And it seems like most software is held together [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6273.54s)]
*  by toothpicks and glue. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6276.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6277.46s)]
*  And there is a lot of dangers in every piece. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6278.3s)]
*  And also the social engineering aspect, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6280.3s)]
*  that's a real attack vector. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6283.66s)]
*  I think that's the attack vector that will do, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6285.700000000001s)]
*  in the long-term, the most damage in the world. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6286.900000000001s)]
*  Especially as AI tooling becomes easier and easier [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6290.06s)]
*  to convince people at scale, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6292.820000000001s)]
*  sort of do that kind of email grandma. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6295.38s)]
*  I think that's a really serious attack vector, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6298.3s)]
*  like human psychology and all that. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6300.860000000001s)]
*  I kind of assume whenever there's a girl that approaches me, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6302.580000000001s)]
*  it's some kind of social engineering project, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6305.26s)]
*  some attack vector, some intelligence agency. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6308.02s)]
*  In fact, I'm pretty sure. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6311.780000000001s)]
*  We're back to a beautiful mind, aren't we? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6312.9400000000005s)]
*  Beautiful mind, yeah. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6314.34s)]
*  I have a whiteboard upstairs that I calculate everything, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6316.02s)]
*  everybody's trajectory and move. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6318.900000000001s)]
*  You're not wrong though with the attack vector, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6320.900000000001s)]
*  especially in the day of AI. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6322.66s)]
*  One thing that I don't think a lot of people [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6324.06s)]
*  are talking about as we integrate more and more AI, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6325.54s)]
*  is that prompt injection is like an extremely hard thing [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6328.58s)]
*  to defend against, because it's not really clear [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6334.14s)]
*  how you defend against it. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6336.42s)]
*  If it's just a, at the end of the day, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6337.58s)]
*  word calculator make word come out, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6339.42s)]
*  if you can figure out the proper word calculator input, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6341.42s)]
*  it might just break its bounds [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6343.74s)]
*  and start doing something it's not supposed to do. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6345.74s)]
*  And there's a whole future where there's all these products [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6347.58s)]
*  that are gonna be vulnerable [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6350.66s)]
*  to things they never thought about. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6351.5s)]
*  Like you, it's one thing where you forget an edge case [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6353.179999999999s)]
*  while you're programming. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6356.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you have to guess what people might be able to think [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6357.26s)]
*  of making something that has access [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6359.639999999999s)]
*  to a system be able to do, right? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6361.36s)]
*  And you don't have a way to reason about it. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6363.099999999999s)]
*  Its reasoning came from Reddit and other words [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6365.099999999999s)]
*  that it's read and how to put things together. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6367.66s)]
*  Like this is a very, it's a massive space [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6369.139999999999s)]
*  that's gonna be happening. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6372.66s)]
*  It's why I'm personally thinking, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6374.5s)]
*  don't give too many powers yet. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6375.3s)]
*  Like we don't know the attacks that are about to happen. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6376.58s)]
*  Yeah, the more power we give to software systems, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6380.94s)]
*  the more damage they can do. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6383.26s)]
*  That certainly is the case, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6384.14s)]
*  but the more awesome they could do. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6385.3s)]
*  And that's the knife's edge that we all walk along [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6386.46s)]
*  as a human civilization together, hand in hand. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6390.14s)]
*  Will we flourish or destroy ourselves? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6393.96s)]
*  Question mark. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6396.099999999999s)]
*  Folks on Reddit, the good folks on Reddit, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6398.8s)]
*  demanded that I ask you about the time you broke production. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6401.58s)]
*  Is this related to Falcor? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6405.06s)]
*  Did you break production? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6406.78s)]
*  Is this fake news? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6407.78s)]
*  I broke production quite a few times. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6408.62s)]
*  I've broken productions for so many stupid reasons. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6409.58s)]
*  One time I broke production because I came up in the PHP [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6411.58s)]
*  and PHP static means static for the lifetime of the PHP [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6415.66s)]
*  and PHP was the lifetime of every request, right? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6419.26s)]
*  That's why PHP was so inefficient [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6422.1s)]
*  was that every request was its own instance [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6423.9s)]
*  and therefore static memory was for the lifetime. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6426.14s)]
*  I guess I never put that together. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6428.86s)]
*  And so I had some objects that I made static [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6430.76s)]
*  because I was like, oh, I just need this for the lifetime [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6433.12s)]
*  of the request. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6434.76s)]
*  And lo and behold, those weren't lifetime. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6435.96s)]
*  Whole bunch of bad data got all over the place. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6438.320000000001s)]
*  People were showing up saying they were [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6440.16s)]
*  from all these different countries [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6441.4400000000005s)]
*  and everything was all wrong. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6442.72s)]
*  Cause I just, whoopsie daisies. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6443.68s)]
*  I just made a whole conundrum with that. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6445.4800000000005s)]
*  So that was one time I did it. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6447.46s)]
*  Another time is I took down, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6448.8s)]
*  if you were on the homepage, on the website, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6450.52s)]
*  waiting for Lady Gaga's video to come out [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6453.96s)]
*  and you are watching the countdown go down, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6456.8s)]
*  if it reached zero, the billboard would freeze [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6459.04s)]
*  and it wouldn't work. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6462.88s)]
*  If you refreshed it would work, but the reveal, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6463.84s)]
*  the big reveal, I screwed that up [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6468.44s)]
*  and my boss got real upset. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6470.0s)]
*  And so did other people in Hollywood [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6471.5199999999995s)]
*  got upset about that one. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6472.8s)]
*  That was like a my bad. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6474.12s)]
*  Sorry, Jeff Wagner again. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6475.58s)]
*  I remember that one. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6477.36s)]
*  I remember that one specifically one time [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6478.24s)]
*  I released a bug where again, on the billboard, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6479.92s)]
*  if you pressed add to my list, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6482.18s)]
*  I accidentally programmed in an infinite loop [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6484.74s)]
*  your whole webpage would just freeze. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6489.52s)]
*  Are some of these bugs difficult to discover [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6491.280000000001s)]
*  until you sort of run? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6493.96s)]
*  That one seems really easy looking back on it. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6494.8s)]
*  In front of the loop, yeah. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6496.92s)]
*  And there was, we actually, during those days, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6497.76s)]
*  we had manual QA that are supposed to go through everything. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6499.5s)]
*  So I didn't feel as bad because my manual QA counterpart [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6502.46s)]
*  also missed it. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6506.4800000000005s)]
*  Like we all missed it, but it was just so simple. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6507.68s)]
*  Just press that button, boom. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6509.72s)]
*  It just completely freezes the website. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6510.76s)]
*  Polluting the code with sort of global variables [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6513.0s)]
*  that are holding values as PHP, I think allows you to do. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6516.04s)]
*  That's a tricky one to discover. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6520.64s)]
*  Cause you rely on it, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6522.42s)]
*  but then there could be somebody else's signs of value to it. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6524.24s)]
*  It could be a generalist. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6527.84s)]
*  Yeah, to jade erases everywhere. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6528.68s)]
*  And I just didn't understand, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6529.5199999999995s)]
*  like in my head static was like, oh, this is for the life. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6530.48s)]
*  Like I was just so locked into the PHP world at that time [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6533.44s)]
*  that I just made a, just such a, like looking back on it, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6536.2s)]
*  it's so obvious, but during the time it was, it's hard. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6540.48s)]
*  So in general, pushing to production, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6544.48s)]
*  I talked to Peter levels about this. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6546.04s)]
*  He, I mean, obviously he's operating as a, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6547.799999999999s)]
*  mostly a solo developer, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6550.32s)]
*  but he often on the websites that thousands, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6552.959999999999s)]
*  not hundreds of thousands of people use, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6556.4s)]
*  he often ships to production, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6558.48s)]
*  pushes to production, meaning like just no testing, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6562.4s)]
*  just like push to fix. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6565.28s)]
*  What are the pros and cons of that approach in general [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6567.759999999999s)]
*  to you? What do you think? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6569.639999999999s)]
*  It's obviously much easier the smaller your organization is. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6571.04s)]
*  I think everyone, I think no one would argue that, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6575.26s)]
*  that sentiment. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6577.02s)]
*  If it's just you working on a singular project, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6577.86s)]
*  it is obviously much easier for you to push directly [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6580.62s)]
*  to production because you were the only one working. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6583.46s)]
*  You know all the ins and outs. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6586.02s)]
*  And if something were to break, you would discover it. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6587.38s)]
*  So to me, that makes sense. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6589.58s)]
*  Like, I think the way he operates is perfect [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6591.14s)]
*  for what he does. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6592.9400000000005s)]
*  You couldn't take what he does and move it to say, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6594.22s)]
*  Microsoft or Netflix or Google, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6596.3s)]
*  because that would obviously, it would just be a disaster, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6597.9800000000005s)]
*  just due to the amount of people all pushing to production. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6600.74s)]
*  And so, I mean, I personally love that. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6603.26s)]
*  I think that you have to, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6606.18s)]
*  you have to gauge both the application you're building [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6608.34s)]
*  and its complexity and what you're pushing [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6611.22s)]
*  and how many people are working on it. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6613.5s)]
*  I think those all go into how you can kind of do that. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6614.9800000000005s)]
*  Because not all applications are created equal either. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6617.820000000001s)]
*  Like that application I was making was zooming [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6620.22s)]
*  and scrolling where we had all of our own everything. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6622.14s)]
*  It was a very deep, like heavy logic app. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6624.5s)]
*  And that was regardless of what was happening [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6628.1s)]
*  on the website. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6629.900000000001s)]
*  Most of the code was library code. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6630.82s)]
*  And that becomes way harder [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6633.219999999999s)]
*  if you don't have a good test suite and stuff [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6635.219999999999s)]
*  to kind of run before you push it out. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6636.86s)]
*  Because when you squeeze that ball, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6638.299999999999s)]
*  different things come popping out in different areas. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6641.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's a very harder problem than, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6644.139999999999s)]
*  say, if you're doing more of like a heavy visual one. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6648.0199999999995s)]
*  Because a heavy visual one, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6650.62s)]
*  you're affecting just this one area's visual stuff [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6651.7s)]
*  and you can test it. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6653.7s)]
*  And that's normally the end of it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6654.62s)]
*  Whereas, so it depends on the coupling and everything. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6657.58s)]
*  I love his approach, by the way. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6661.3s)]
*  I have such mad respect for anyone that operates that way [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6662.34s)]
*  because I think it's a great way. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6665.34s)]
*  It just is so good because it kind of breaks this notion [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6667.42s)]
*  that tech Twitter has that, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6671.3s)]
*  oh, we got to use all these expensive services. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6672.66s)]
*  You need to use all these kinds of things. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6674.74s)]
*  Because if you don't use all this kind of stuff, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6675.94s)]
*  if you're not using the latest version of React, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6677.26s)]
*  if you're not using the latest version of this, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6678.74s)]
*  you're simply not gonna make it as a startup. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6680.22s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6683.099999999999s)]
*  And it's just like, no, no, that's not software. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6683.94s)]
*  Like most of software isn't the new stuff. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6686.66s)]
*  Most of software is old crappy software [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6688.38s)]
*  that someone has to maintain. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6691.3s)]
*  And it actually is really, really great [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6693.1s)]
*  and has lots of really hard problems. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6694.62s)]
*  And if you look at it differently, it's actually fantastic. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6695.9800000000005s)]
*  For people who don't know his tech stack [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6698.02s)]
*  in terms of web development is PHP, jQuery and SQLite. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6701.3s)]
*  Yeah, all great stuff. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6705.62s)]
*  I'm just surprised he still uses jQuery [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6707.26s)]
*  just given the fact that at this point on the modern web, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6708.82s)]
*  everything is, I mean, you have document query selector [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6711.5s)]
*  and add event listener click, right? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6714.02s)]
*  It pretty much has everything you already need. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6716.22s)]
*  Content load, like all the reasons I used jQuery [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6719.02s)]
*  back in the day was adding a click on a button was like hard. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6721.06s)]
*  You had to deal with IE7, IE8, IE9. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6725.38s)]
*  All right, like those are hard differences. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6728.38s)]
*  Whereas now it's just so easy. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6730.42s)]
*  I'm just surprised it's even that. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6731.54s)]
*  I mean, that's definitely a trade off. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6733.14s)]
*  I have, I still use the exact same stack, PHP, jQuery [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6734.5s)]
*  and different flavors of SQL. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6738.54s)]
*  But the question there is, you know, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6741.700000000001s)]
*  you keep using jQuery because you can get the job done [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6745.34s)]
*  really fast and there's no significant performance hit [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6747.7s)]
*  that you detect. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6751.26s)]
*  So like why switch to something else? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6752.5s)]
*  But it's always probably, as we'll talk about, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6754.82s)]
*  good to explore and to learn. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6756.86s)]
*  Not all tools are great at solving all problems. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6759.26s)]
*  And so what you think is really like, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6762.7s)]
*  the problem is, is you run into this kind of trade off, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6765.98s)]
*  which is you have some tool belt [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6768.099999999999s)]
*  that you're very adept with. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6771.26s)]
*  You know, all the ins and outs, there's no unknown unknowns, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6772.98s)]
*  but there's no surprises in this. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6775.82s)]
*  You know what you're building, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6778.38s)]
*  you know what you're getting into. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6779.219999999999s)]
*  You will go through and you will be able to solve [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6780.38s)]
*  the problem. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6784.82s)]
*  But if you ever use a different language [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6786.0199999999995s)]
*  or a different experience, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6788.54s)]
*  you can find that some things are able to represent states [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6789.46s)]
*  way easier in a way more efficient way. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6792.259999999999s)]
*  And you can solve problems really efficiently in some [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6794.66s)]
*  versus the other. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6797.54s)]
*  And so it's like, if you don't take the time to explore [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6798.38s)]
*  as well, you could be missing out on something [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6800.42s)]
*  that makes you twice as good on this one specific problem, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6802.179999999999s)]
*  like subset. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6804.82s)]
*  And so I kind of value being able to look at all problems. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6805.78s)]
*  And so I don't want to get stuck on one thing, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6808.98s)]
*  though I see why people do, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6810.7s)]
*  which is for the efficiency sake. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6812.0599999999995s)]
*  Let's just return to the infrastructure, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6814.38s)]
*  the platform of Netflix and speak more generally, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6816.139999999999s)]
*  Netflix, Twitch, YouTube. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6818.46s)]
*  Like anytime I use any of these services, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6820.5s)]
*  I'm just blown away by the infrastructure it takes [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6822.099999999999s)]
*  to deliver this service. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6826.74s)]
*  YouTube and Twitch are unique versus Netflix, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6828.259999999999s)]
*  where the creators can roll in themselves and upload stuff. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6831.34s)]
*  So on the consumption side, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6835.26s)]
*  YouTube has over 100 billion views a day, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6836.78s)]
*  over 1 billion hours watch time. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6840.06s)]
*  But on the sort of creator side, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6843.34s)]
*  1 million hours of videos are uploaded every day, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6845.58s)]
*  1 million hours. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6848.22s)]
*  It's like you have to service both [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6850.860000000001s)]
*  and you have to deliver everything. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6853.34s)]
*  It's incredible to me. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6858.18s)]
*  Can you maybe speak to your own intuition, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6859.86s)]
*  just zooming out on it, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6861.78s)]
*  what it takes to deliver that kind of infrastructure? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6862.9s)]
*  For me, the thing that I find vastly complicated, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6865.62s)]
*  and I can't imagine the engineering hours, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6869.54s)]
*  is how do you even create an edge in that situation? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6872.54s)]
*  And what I mean by an edge, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6875.7s)]
*  I mean like when people say this phrase, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6876.62s)]
*  if you're unexperienced, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6879.0199999999995s)]
*  an edge is where you deliver data to be, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6880.62s)]
*  you want that edge to be as close to the customer as possible, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6882.38s)]
*  because that's where the data lives. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6884.62s)]
*  And then the communication between the customer [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6885.94s)]
*  and what you're doing is really, really small. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6887.7s)]
*  Obviously the speed of light adds up, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6889.54s)]
*  the amount of hops adds up, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6890.98s)]
*  the amount of services that you have to remotely call adds up, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6892.1s)]
*  they all add up and they all add inefficiencies [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6894.46s)]
*  to the system. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6896.34s)]
*  So something like YouTube, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6897.3s)]
*  they want to be able to serve that data as quick as possible, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6898.7s)]
*  but their data changes constantly, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6901.74s)]
*  and relevance is almost directly tied [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6904.5s)]
*  with the newness of the item. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6907.14s)]
*  So it's like, how do you even cash these things out? [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6909.0199999999995s)]
*  How are you doing this? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6911.1s)]
*  So they must have such an incredible caching network [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6911.94s)]
*  that I can't even fathom what it takes to do that. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6914.66s)]
*  That just to me, it's just so impressive. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6918.38s)]
*  A million view hours in how many different resolutions [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6919.860000000001s)]
*  with how much data, what is a million view hours? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6923.1s)]
*  Is it 4K million view hours, along with 1080p, [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6925.26s)]
*  along with 720p, along with 1440p? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6928.74s)]
*  Like that number is an insane number. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6931.14s)]
*  Actually, it is brilliant what you said, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6933.860000000001s)]
*  which is for YouTube, often the new thing [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6936.34s)]
*  is extremely important to show to everybody. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6939.14s)]
*  And so you can't rely on caching [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6943.46s)]
*  or trivial kind of caching. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6946.22s)]
*  You have to deliver the new thing as quickly as possible. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6948.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6952.26s)]
*  So there's the entire system, the recommendation system [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6954.18s)]
*  that knows each individual human watching YouTube, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6959.22s)]
*  and it has to integrate into that the new thing, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6962.54s)]
*  while also caching this incredible cluster [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6965.660000000001s)]
*  of possible videos that you're potentially interested in. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6969.58s)]
*  And integrate into that ads, right? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6973.54s)]
*  In the case of YouTube and Twitch and so on. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6977.22s)]
*  It's a really tough problem because you have to think, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6979.38s)]
*  what is the cache hit rate on this? [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6982.54s)]
*  Because there's so much, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6984.14s)]
*  because the problem now actually comes down to space. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6985.26s)]
*  Space actually becomes a real problem. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6987.26s)]
*  How many hundreds of petabytes do they have [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6989.62s)]
*  that they have to like, okay, what do we cache [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6993.02s)]
*  and where do we cache this? [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6995.26s)]
*  The number, I mean, I think in the terms of gigabytes [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6997.34s)]
*  or maybe megabytes, they have to think [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7000.46s)]
*  in probably versions of bytes, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7002.7s)]
*  I don't even know the name for. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7004.58s)]
*  It's like such a different problem. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7006.14s)]
*  And that's why I said Netflix, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7007.660000000001s)]
*  Netflix has a much easier job when it comes to caching. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7008.9400000000005s)]
*  So if you've never looked it up, it's called the OCA. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7011.820000000001s)]
*  And that, we know what videos we're releasing. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7014.02s)]
*  We know what videos are hot in specific areas. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7017.3s)]
*  It's a very limited set. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7020.54s)]
*  We're not gonna all of a sudden get, oopsies, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7021.860000000001s)]
*  we got a million new view hours, right? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7023.58s)]
*  We don't even have to worry about that as a problem. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7024.900000000001s)]
*  And so it's like, okay, we know Stranger Things season five [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7026.660000000001s)]
*  is about to drop. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7029.5s)]
*  We're gonna pre-cache Stranger Things season five [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7030.54s)]
*  in every single OCA across the world [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7033.74s)]
*  because that thing's about to get hammered, right? [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7036.179999999999s)]
*  And so it's like, it's able to do such a different [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7038.219999999999s)]
*  kind of decision-making than what you have to do [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7040.219999999999s)]
*  with something like YouTube. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7043.099999999999s)]
*  And then Twitch is even more wild [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7044.46s)]
*  because now you're actually ingesting video [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7046.26s)]
*  and trying to make it go out all at the exact same time [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7048.58s)]
*  for all video. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7050.94s)]
*  And you have to transform that video from whatever format [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7052.099999999999s)]
*  and whatever the bit rate is into something [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7055.62s)]
*  that's more efficient in a system like that. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7057.78s)]
*  Hats off to Twitch engineering, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7059.82s)]
*  because that's some serious work. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7061.9s)]
*  And here's some asshole Lex coming out and tweeting [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7064.179999999999s)]
*  about YouTube features. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7068.099999999999s)]
*  So like, listen. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7069.62s)]
*  You're not wrong on the features you're asked for though. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7073.58s)]
*  I think this is an engineering problem [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7076.34s)]
*  of how do you allow fast iteration and addition of features [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7079.0599999999995s)]
*  that shouldn't have to be integrated [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7084.38s)]
*  or impact the whole code base. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7087.0199999999995s)]
*  So at the edges of the code base, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7088.94s)]
*  you sort of improve on certain features [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7090.74s)]
*  without like having to consult the mothership of the code. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7094.0599999999995s)]
*  It's the large team, right? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7099.3s)]
*  That's the fundamental problem. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7100.74s)]
*  When you get into YouTube size, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7102.38s)]
*  there is the team slash organization [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7104.34s)]
*  that deals with data warehousing. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7106.7s)]
*  There's the team slash organization [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7108.74s)]
*  that deals with delivery. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7110.26s)]
*  There's a team slash organization [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7111.86s)]
*  that's like the middle layer, how you even, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7113.26s)]
*  they're gonna be like the little microservices [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7115.26s)]
*  to talk to these places. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7116.98s)]
*  Then you have this front-end engineer. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7118.58s)]
*  So like for a small feature, you have to get middle team. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7119.78s)]
*  You have to get back-end team. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7124.099999999999s)]
*  You have to get all these things. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7125.139999999999s)]
*  Quick example, Netflix. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7126.3s)]
*  Are you familiar with the dystopian Black Mirror? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7128.38s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7131.54s)]
*  Season one, episode one. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7132.54s)]
*  Do you know season one, episode one? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7133.46s)]
*  Everyone who watches Black Mirror [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7134.62s)]
*  typically knows this episode. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7135.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7137.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't remember what it is. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7137.86s)]
*  Forgive my language, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7138.7s)]
*  but they call it the pig fucker episode. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7139.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7141.62s)]
*  Once you've seen the episode, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7142.86s)]
*  you will then know this episode. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7144.58s)]
*  Well, when Netflix adopted it, I got pulled into a room. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7146.34s)]
*  There's like a VP, a VP, a product designer, a VP, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7148.86s)]
*  and they said, hey, we're about to release [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7151.94s)]
*  our own version of Black Mirror, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7154.0599999999995s)]
*  season three, I think, at that time. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7155.7s)]
*  We need episode one, season one [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7158.7s)]
*  to not be the first thing people see. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7161.42s)]
*  So let's just reverse the season order. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7163.9s)]
*  That required me, I had like 20 engineers [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7167.86s)]
*  I had to gather together to be able to have this happen. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7170.66s)]
*  And that's just the problem of big companies [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7173.58s)]
*  is that eventually every little thing [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7175.42s)]
*  has to become its own team. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7177.62s)]
*  And so even small, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7179.38s)]
*  there's no such thing as a small feature. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7180.54s)]
*  Reversing the order of the dropdown [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7181.98s)]
*  that selects the seasons [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7184.66s)]
*  is a meeting with a bunch of VPs and engineers. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7186.18s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7189.26s)]
*  There's gotta be a way to accelerate that. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7190.62s)]
*  The natural scaling of a company [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7192.42s)]
*  and the bureaucracy that grows, yes, slows that down, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7195.099999999999s)]
*  but just having seen Elon work a lot, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7197.46s)]
*  his teams are able to like still keep it very fast, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7199.74s)]
*  even as the company grows. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7203.42s)]
*  There's gotta be like a process to doing that, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7204.9s)]
*  especially for, yeah, for the pig fucker episode. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7208.94s)]
*  I don't know where that's in the priority list, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7216.139999999999s)]
*  but for important things like that, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7218.78s)]
*  you should be able to do that quickly. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7220.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7221.98s)]
*  Can you speak to like, how would you do that? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7222.82s)]
*  Well, I can tell first how it was done. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7225.46s)]
*  Remember, so at a place like Netflix, [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7227.339999999999s)]
*  there would be, I think that at that point [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7228.94s)]
*  it was called a product called Dexter. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7230.58s)]
*  I can't remember. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7232.42s)]
*  Our actual like movie metadata warehouse, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7234.02s)]
*  that's gonna be highly integrated with Hollywood. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7237.14s)]
*  That's gonna be, you know, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7239.06s)]
*  where that side is able to manage all that. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7240.1s)]
*  So I'm like, hey, you need the ability to mark things [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7242.54s)]
*  that need to be reversed, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7245.18s)]
*  because we're gonna run into this a bunch. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7246.18s)]
*  And we did, we ran into quite a few topical shows [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7247.7s)]
*  that all need to be reversed and all that. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7250.1s)]
*  And so it's like, we need to be able to reverse [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7251.66s)]
*  episode numbers, season numbers. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7253.22s)]
*  We need to be able to hide season or episode numbers. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7254.780000000001s)]
*  Like in the case of the Chelsea Handler show, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7257.62s)]
*  it was like a daily show. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7260.14s)]
*  So it's like, you don't need episode numbers. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7261.26s)]
*  You just need the latest one. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7263.26s)]
*  And so like, there's this whole problem that exists. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7264.46s)]
*  And so it's like, okay, you need to work on that [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7266.58s)]
*  for your UI over there. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7268.7s)]
*  Then you need to be able to store that data. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7270.22s)]
*  Then we need to be able to go to the, like, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7271.820000000001s)]
*  the people that can actually get the video data out of that [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7273.38s)]
*  and provide it to our service layer. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7276.02s)]
*  I need to go talk to them and convince them [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7279.26s)]
*  they need to be able to give me the new methods [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7280.780000000001s)]
*  and everything to do that. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7282.74s)]
*  Then I need to be able to go write the methods [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7283.860000000001s)]
*  to get it down. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7285.46s)]
*  And then I need to go to the UI and make that accessible. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7286.3s)]
*  Now I need to go to a website people. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7288.02s)]
*  I need to go to the mobile people. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7289.46s)]
*  I need to go to the TV people. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7290.46s)]
*  And so it's like, you can see this thing like snowballing. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7291.86s)]
*  And for us, the big thing that Netflix did [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7294.86s)]
*  that was so well is after I met with these people [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7297.02s)]
*  that were high level, I was the captain. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7299.66s)]
*  I'm the captain now. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7302.5s)]
*  So I went to all these teams and said, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7303.86s)]
*  hey manager, I need an engineer. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7305.1s)]
*  We need to get this done within the next couple of months [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7306.94s)]
*  because we got Black Mirror coming out. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7308.42s)]
*  So she would go, okay, here you go. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7310.58s)]
*  The map team, I need someone to help me [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7312.62s)]
*  with being able to get data out of the LoloMo for this. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7314.02s)]
*  And so it's like, all right, [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7317.14s)]
*  you're working with this engineer. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7318.58s)]
*  I'd go to the VMS team. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7319.82s)]
*  Okay, I need this engineer. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7321.0599999999995s)]
*  I'd go to the billboard team. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7321.9s)]
*  I need this engineer. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7323.259999999999s)]
*  Go to all of these little places [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7324.179999999999s)]
*  to get all these little pieces of data. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7325.7s)]
*  And then I was the captain. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7327.219999999999s)]
*  So I was like, you're working on this, you're doing this, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7328.34s)]
*  you're doing this, you're doing this, I'm doing this. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7330.179999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7331.58s)]
*  Right. And so it's like that worked [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7332.42s)]
*  and we were able to go pretty fast for a big company. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7334.179999999999s)]
*  And the fact that it required like 20 engineers [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7337.0199999999995s)]
*  to do such a simple task. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7339.139999999999s)]
*  We were able to do it in like, [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7340.82s)]
*  gosh, I'd say about like three weeks worth of effort [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7342.5s)]
*  but that was still, I thought that was amazing [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7344.82s)]
*  comparatively to how many people move. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7347.5s)]
*  Well, because you have the freedom of the agency to do it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7349.22s)]
*  You said the captain of the ship. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7351.46s)]
*  That's really powerful. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7352.54s)]
*  For big companies, that's a risk [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7353.900000000001s)]
*  because you can fuck it up. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7355.780000000001s)]
*  You might not see the bigger context legally [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7357.38s)]
*  or any sort of the bigger context [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7361.54s)]
*  of the impact on the industry [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7363.66s)]
*  or all the contracts that are made, all that. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7364.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's a risk. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7366.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a risk, but it's a risk you have to keep taking. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7367.820000000001s)]
*  And then if when you fuck up, you fix [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7369.780000000001s)]
*  and then maybe pay the cost legally for that and whatever. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7371.9800000000005s)]
*  But the long-term, that risk pays off [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7374.5s)]
*  because you're going to keep creating [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7378.9s)]
*  better and better product, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7381.0599999999995s)]
*  evolving where the industry is going, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7382.66s)]
*  constantly innovating ahead [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7384.42s)]
*  of where the industry is going and so on. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7386.379999999999s)]
*  And not only that, I think one thing [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7388.66s)]
*  that is just so important is that, [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7390.179999999999s)]
*  yes, the product will get better, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7392.62s)]
*  but the people that you hire [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7394.139999999999s)]
*  and the people that you keep around are better [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7396.179999999999s)]
*  because they're the ones that show maturity. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7398.74s)]
*  They're the ones that can just, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7400.54s)]
*  you give them something and they can rally the troops [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7401.78s)]
*  and make something happen. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7403.9s)]
*  Like that's a very great group of people to hire. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7405.339999999999s)]
*  And so you also naturally select out great engineers [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7408.22s)]
*  that aren't just simply good at coding. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7410.860000000001s)]
*  They're good at coding and they're good at explaining [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7412.7s)]
*  and they're good at convincing and they're good. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7414.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, like you have to create a very lean audience [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7416.58s)]
*  that can move fast. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7419.46s)]
*  And I think for great engineers, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7421.1s)]
*  having to wait for like, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7424.22s)]
*  okay, let's schedule a meeting for next Wednesday [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7426.9400000000005s)]
*  with the VPs and that destroys their soul. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7429.54s)]
*  And they either don't want to contribute anymore. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7433.1s)]
*  They leave the companies or they just kind of tune out [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7434.9400000000005s)]
*  and take the golden handcuffs and just, you know, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7438.860000000001s)]
*  buy a nice house and focus on the family. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7441.22s)]
*  And I feel like I would die under that. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7444.14s)]
*  Like honestly, like that is my death sentence [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7445.900000000001s)]
*  is where it's just that there's no reason to try. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7448.540000000001s)]
*  There's no reason to do anything. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7451.5s)]
*  I'm just gonna go in there, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7452.660000000001s)]
*  like effectively zombie through my day and call it like, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7453.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't wanna live like that. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7457.02s)]
*  I want to feel like I'm trying to do something. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7458.06s)]
*  I should also mention on top of that. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7461.820000000001s)]
*  So you've brilliantly laid out [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7463.46s)]
*  how incredible the challenge that Netflix has to solve. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7466.3s)]
*  On top of that with YouTube, you know, the metadata thing, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7468.9800000000005s)]
*  because users are able to upload video [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7473.78s)]
*  and there's an API where they can upload automatically [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7476.66s)]
*  and change all this kind of stuff automatically. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7479.3s)]
*  Every one of those things is an attack vector, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7481.78s)]
*  as we mentioned. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7485.06s)]
*  That's something they have to consider seriously [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7486.22s)]
*  on the engineering side and on the sort of the legal side, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7487.78s)]
*  they can get into trouble all kinds of ways. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7491.9800000000005s)]
*  So they have to consider all of that. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7494.58s)]
*  So it's just fascinating. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7496.78s)]
*  The legal side is obvious, but it's not really like, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7498.9s)]
*  I would never have initially thought someone would say [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7501.78s)]
*  upload images that you're not allowed to own or have, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7504.46s)]
*  but that guarantee you that happens. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7507.7s)]
*  Then you have the whole kid side, right? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7509.22s)]
*  I think about when you mark something as kid friendly, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7511.22s)]
*  how many times have they snuck porn [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7513.38s)]
*  into a Taylor Swift video or whatever? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7515.14s)]
*  That was like a few years back, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7516.9s)]
*  there was that whole Taylor Swift or whatever. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7517.9s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7519.5s)]
*  I thought it was Taylor Swift, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7520.34s)]
*  but there'd be these mock videos that come up [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7521.34s)]
*  and then boom, it's like, that is such an awful problem. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7523.54s)]
*  And I'm so happy that is not a problem [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7528.14s)]
*  I have to try to figure out. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7529.62s)]
*  Yep. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7531.3s)]
*  Okay, so yes, YouTube and Twitch and Netflix [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7532.14s)]
*  are doing an incredible job. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7535.74s)]
*  You eventually chose the madman you are to leave Netflix [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7537.74s)]
*  and to start on a new journey [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7544.78s)]
*  of being a Wolf Pack of one, start streaming. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7546.54s)]
*  What was that? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7549.1s)]
*  What was the story of that? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7549.98s)]
*  So I was streaming for almost seven years now. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7552.1s)]
*  It started actually at Netflix. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7556.1s)]
*  We did a charity, Extra Life, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7557.38s)]
*  shout out Extra Life for starting my streaming career. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7559.5s)]
*  Effectively is just you stream [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7562.02s)]
*  and whatever money you raise, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7563.660000000001s)]
*  it goes to Kids with Cancer Research. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7565.02s)]
*  They are a great charity in the sense [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7566.9400000000005s)]
*  that they take no overhead [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7569.1s)]
*  and they raise their own donations [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7570.5s)]
*  for their website and everything. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7572.02s)]
*  And so it's like a very great, straightforward charity, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7573.22s)]
*  really love like what they've done. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7574.9800000000005s)]
*  It was super cool because I live in South Dakota now, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7577.3s)]
*  but I actually could choose a hospital directly [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7580.5s)]
*  where the money goes to. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7582.42s)]
*  So there's like a direct impact from A to B. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7583.3s)]
*  So it's like, it's a pretty cool organization. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7587.14s)]
*  And so my friend, Guy Serino, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7589.06s)]
*  nice try Guy is what I like to call him. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7591.38s)]
*  He was probably the single greatest engineer [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7593.26s)]
*  I've ever met in my lifetime. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7596.42s)]
*  And he was just like, hey, come do this. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7597.5s)]
*  We're gonna all do this. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7599.06s)]
*  And so I played Fortnite. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7599.9s)]
*  And so before I did that, I was like, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7600.94s)]
*  oh, I better learn how to stream first. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7602.38s)]
*  I better get affiliated so I can like take subscriptions. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7604.62s)]
*  And then if anyone gives me a subscription, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7607.7s)]
*  I'll also pay that forward. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7609.1s)]
*  And so June, 2018 or something like that, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7610.780000000001s)]
*  I start streaming and I start streaming some Fortnite, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7613.820000000001s)]
*  end up getting affiliated, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7618.3s)]
*  end up doing the whole extra life thing. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7620.02s)]
*  I ended up really enjoying it. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7621.820000000001s)]
*  I'm like, this is a lot of fun. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7623.18s)]
*  I'm playing Fortnite at that point. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7624.14s)]
*  Okay, so mind you, I'm a Fortnite streamer at that point. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7625.34s)]
*  And I start really enjoying it and I keep doing it. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7628.58s)]
*  And then one day I decide I'm gonna do some programming [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7630.620000000001s)]
*  because I really love Vim [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7633.02s)]
*  and I think I'm kind of fast at Vim. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7634.620000000001s)]
*  And maybe people think programming is kind of cool [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7636.780000000001s)]
*  because there was no really programming section [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7638.94s)]
*  at that point. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7641.139999999999s)]
*  And I did it and I had like 30 people show up, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7642.219999999999s)]
*  which was just like, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7646.139999999999s)]
*  and it felt like incredible numbers at that point. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7646.98s)]
*  So I was like, oh my gosh, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7648.82s)]
*  there's like 30 people watching me program. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7650.139999999999s)]
*  And so it just kept on going and it kept on happening [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7652.7s)]
*  and it just kept on growing. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7655.339999999999s)]
*  And I did it for year after year. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7656.54s)]
*  I would do my job. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7658.78s)]
*  I would come home. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7660.98s)]
*  I'd eat dinner with the kiddos. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7661.9s)]
*  I would read them Lord of the Rings [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7663.419999999999s)]
*  and the Hobbit during that time. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7664.78s)]
*  I'd read to them for a half an hour. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7666.339999999999s)]
*  And I'd set that down and then three nights a week, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7668.14s)]
*  I would program until like two in the morning [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7669.900000000001s)]
*  or play video games until two in the morning streaming [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7672.06s)]
*  and building up this like whole side thing. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7674.18s)]
*  And I did this for a long, long time. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7676.02s)]
*  And then eventually it just kept working out so well. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7678.26s)]
*  And I started making YouTube videos [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7681.54s)]
*  and then that started getting better. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7682.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was just like a long, long grind. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7684.3s)]
*  Until April of last year, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7686.700000000001s)]
*  I went to the streamer awards [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7688.780000000001s)]
*  and I got to like announce the programming category [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7690.54s)]
*  and pirate software one. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7693.18s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7694.38s)]
*  It was a great time. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7695.22s)]
*  And during that time, he gave me a challenge coin [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7696.18s)]
*  and just said like, you just gotta go for it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7698.34s)]
*  Just go full time. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7700.900000000001s)]
*  And so I just sat there and my wife can attest to it. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7702.3s)]
*  It was kind of like an emotional turmoil thing. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7705.34s)]
*  And it just took a lot of, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7709.02s)]
*  it was pretty awful, you know, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7712.34s)]
*  cause I didn't, Netflix is very safe option. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7714.3s)]
*  It was both very fun. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7717.5s)]
*  It was challenging. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7718.700000000001s)]
*  I liked a lot of the people I worked with. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7720.14s)]
*  It was overall a really great thing. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7722.22s)]
*  I had a really great boss. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7723.46s)]
*  I really appreciated him. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7725.58s)]
*  I still have every text of now and then. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7726.62s)]
*  He's really great guy. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7728.14s)]
*  So it's just like, I'm leaving all these things [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7729.54s)]
*  for something that's unsure. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7731.9s)]
*  And the reality is, is that streaming [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7733.14s)]
*  and all these things, you know, people love you one day, [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7735.78s)]
*  they could hate you the next day. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7738.62s)]
*  There's like all this stuff that goes into [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7739.86s)]
*  being on the public side. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7742.58s)]
*  And I had Netflix as the backing. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7744.18s)]
*  So it's like, if public hate me the next day, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7745.62s)]
*  I'd be like, deuces, I'm out. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7746.98s)]
*  Like, I don't care. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7748.38s)]
*  Now it's like, now I'm gonna do this as a job. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7749.7s)]
*  And so there was like a whole huge turmoil [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7751.58s)]
*  to this whole thing. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7754.3s)]
*  I kind of went through it. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7755.42s)]
*  And eventually I just said, okay, I'm gonna make this. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7756.54s)]
*  It kind of, it resonated with me [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7760.34s)]
*  when I first made the decision to join Netflix. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7762.06s)]
*  I'm getting older. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7765.3s)]
*  There's not a lot of chances to do something unusual. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7767.22s)]
*  Like that, those chances go down constantly [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7769.9800000000005s)]
*  as you get older. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7772.3s)]
*  This might be the last crazy thing I get to do. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7773.78s)]
*  Let's just try it. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7776.7s)]
*  So in April, I went full time [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7777.900000000001s)]
*  and I guess I haven't looked back. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7779.820000000001s)]
*  I'm only not even a year into doing this [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7782.62s)]
*  as a full time gig. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7784.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's just been a lot of fun. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7785.9400000000005s)]
*  And the biggest thing is just being, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7787.42s)]
*  you know, just being able to really explore [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7788.9800000000005s)]
*  and do these things on stream [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7792.06s)]
*  where people really enjoy watching and engaging [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7793.66s)]
*  has just been, it's been a great, hard, fun, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7796.02s)]
*  amazing, difficult experience. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7799.58s)]
*  I mean, it's a really inspiring leap. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7802.06s)]
*  It's a really hard one to take for many reasons [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7803.42s)]
*  like you outlined, but also like the loneliness of it. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7805.780000000001s)]
*  I think it's a pretty lonely pursuit. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7809.82s)]
*  It is, yeah. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7814.34s)]
*  Just you and the camera and the audience [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7815.179999999999s)]
*  and the ups and downs of that. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7817.7s)]
*  And there's not really a team. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7819.219999999999s)]
*  I do have one lucky thing. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7821.58s)]
*  I'd say that my editor Flip, shout out Flip, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7822.98s)]
*  he was the one who said it. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7825.38s)]
*  It would mean the world to him if I said shout out Flip. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7826.219999999999s)]
*  I love you Flip. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7828.86s)]
*  I love you Flip. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7829.94s)]
*  We all love you. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7830.78s)]
*  Oh man, he had, you know, as he would say, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7831.62s)]
*  he had nothing going for him. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7835.299999999999s)]
*  He had a really hard growing up, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7836.34s)]
*  a lot of rough life decisions have gone into his life [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7838.62s)]
*  and he's kind of crawling back out of it. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7842.54s)]
*  And he just said, hey, I will edit full time for you. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7844.099999999999s)]
*  So I just said, all right, like 50-50, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7846.26s)]
*  whatever I make on YouTube, you get, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7848.0199999999995s)]
*  we're gonna do this together. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7849.62s)]
*  And we did that for years, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7850.58s)]
*  making zero dollars a month pretty much, you know? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7851.94s)]
*  And so it's just like, that was an incredible jump. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7854.74s)]
*  And now like we get to work together. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7857.42s)]
*  So that I do get that one team aspect [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7859.38s)]
*  that I think is really nice, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7861.14s)]
*  but it's not like it was at Netflix [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7862.099999999999s)]
*  where I could hear about stuff people are building. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7865.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't have a team. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7867.5s)]
*  I don't have like product or cycles. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7868.62s)]
*  I don't have a manager that I have to try to make happy. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7870.22s)]
*  It's just like, it is very lonely. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7872.18s)]
*  And I don't think a lot of people realize [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7874.9s)]
*  how lonely it actually can be. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7876.46s)]
*  Yeah, so combine that loneliness with, in my case, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7879.22s)]
*  I don't know how many people attack you. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7882.7s)]
*  If, you know- [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7884.82s)]
*  I have a shockingly low amount of attack rate, I feel like. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7886.18s)]
*  Yeah, people generally, I mean, it's sometimes fun [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7888.86s)]
*  sort of teasing that kind of thing, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7892.86s)]
*  but it's mostly just really, I mean, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7894.06s)]
*  you give so much love to the world [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7896.22s)]
*  and inspire so many people, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7897.820000000001s)]
*  even when you're like making fun of stuff, yeah. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7899.14s)]
*  But with me sort of taking the loneliness of it [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7902.3s)]
*  combined with just really intense attacks, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7905.38s)]
*  it's tough, it can be rough. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7907.34s)]
*  Psychologically, really a tough journey. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7908.9800000000005s)]
*  You miss working with a team? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7913.3s)]
*  Just from even a software engineering side, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7914.5s)]
*  like where you can share code or talk over code or- [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7918.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7922.38s)]
*  Yeah, the collaborative aspect of it. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7923.22s)]
*  Yeah, multiple things there. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7925.14s)]
*  One, hey, we love you, Lex, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7927.62s)]
*  so don't let the things get you down. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7929.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7932.38s)]
*  Thank you, I love you too. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7933.22s)]
*  Thank you, hey, little bonding moment you're going on. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7935.22s)]
*  But one thing I really miss- [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7938.26s)]
*  Not in a sexual way, just to be clear. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7940.18s)]
*  The tension is a little tense here. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7941.900000000001s)]
*  I'm getting uncomfortable. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7943.58s)]
*  Anyway, team. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7945.42s)]
*  It's just the, one thing I really miss is just, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7946.820000000001s)]
*  even when I hated how people did it, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7950.14s)]
*  just seeing how other people solved things, right? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7951.900000000001s)]
*  It's really amazing just the raw creative power [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7955.26s)]
*  so many people have and just being like, [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7958.7s)]
*  oh, wow, I would have never done it this way. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7961.179999999999s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7964.5s)]
*  Wow, this is awesome. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7965.7s)]
*  And then you kind of internally process this [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7967.62s)]
*  and you're like, oh, I now have a new little tool [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7969.26s)]
*  in my tool belt. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7971.58s)]
*  Because at some point, it's really hard to find a mentor. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7972.94s)]
*  When you're first young [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7976.0199999999995s)]
*  and you're just starting out programming, [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7977.179999999999s)]
*  anyone with a couple years of experience [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7979.7s)]
*  will be not just a little bit better than you, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7981.3s)]
*  but infinitely better than you. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7983.3s)]
*  It feels crazy how much better people are. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7985.22s)]
*  And so you have to get mentors and you learn from people. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7987.9800000000005s)]
*  And then as you get better, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7990.3s)]
*  that amount of availability gets really small. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7991.54s)]
*  And so it's something that I really do miss [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7994.34s)]
*  is the forced hard problem solving together. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7995.9400000000005s)]
*  I think there's also a skill to sort of mining the wisdom [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7999.860000000001s)]
*  from other people. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8003.06s)]
*  I generally try to approach even junior people, [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8004.38s)]
*  young folks, just mentally, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8008.54s)]
*  at least for me it works as a hack, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8012.54s)]
*  to assume they're the smartest person in the world, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8014.34s)]
*  way smarter than me. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8018.26s)]
*  And so I take every single word they say [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8019.62s)]
*  as potential wisdom. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8021.86s)]
*  And that helps me as sort of mine [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8023.7s)]
*  for potential wisdom there. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8025.36s)]
*  Because it's so easy once you get older [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8027.62s)]
*  to sort of judge, to be like, oh yeah, okay, okay. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8029.1s)]
*  I've been through that, I remember feeling like that. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8032.3s)]
*  I remember thinking that, that's incorrect, whatever. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8034.26s)]
*  But you just kind of assume that I don't know [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8036.7s)]
*  what the fuck I'm doing. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8039.62s)]
*  And the other person is this like sage. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8040.9s)]
*  And from that, in that kind of interaction, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8043.42s)]
*  I think you could actually learn a lot. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8045.74s)]
*  And my favorite interactions is when we both [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8047.3s)]
*  think that way. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8050.38s)]
*  From there, I think that's a catalyst [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8053.3s)]
*  for a great, great collaboration and interaction. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8056.3s)]
*  It just also makes everything much nicer. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8059.66s)]
*  It really stinks to work with someone [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8062.099999999999s)]
*  that's combative and negative. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8064.0599999999995s)]
*  Like I don't mind combativeness [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8066.139999999999s)]
*  if it's like I'm trying to figure out [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8068.38s)]
*  what's best to do right now versus combativeness [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8070.58s)]
*  just because you're a negative person [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8073.740000000001s)]
*  and things have to be this one particular way. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8075.1s)]
*  Because if they're not this one particular way, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8076.9400000000005s)]
*  it's the end of the world. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8078.3s)]
*  And that's actually really hard for me to work with. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8079.54s)]
*  What's the origin story of the Primogen name? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8083.700000000001s)]
*  The origin story of the Primogen name was, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8087.54s)]
*  are you familiar with the video game called Turok? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8091.700000000001s)]
*  Nintendo 64. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8093.860000000001s)]
*  So Turok had Turok 1 and then Turok 2. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8095.660000000001s)]
*  Turok 2 was a brutally hard game. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8099.38s)]
*  This is back when first person shooters, [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8101.54s)]
*  they would only give you a certain amount of health [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8104.14s)]
*  and you had to go discover health and get that health. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8106.58s)]
*  And you had to beat the whole game without effectively dying. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8109.58s)]
*  That's like the first version right there. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8112.62s)]
*  That's like Turok 1 and Turok 2. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8114.62s)]
*  Turok is a renowned first person shooter video game series [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8116.9800000000005s)]
*  featuring dinosaurs, action and sci-fi elements. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8120.5s)]
*  The franchise has evolved significantly [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8123.14s)]
*  since its inception in 1997. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8124.74s)]
*  Yep, there you go. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8127.54s)]
*  1998, there you can see it right there. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8128.54s)]
*  Turok 2, Seed of Evil followed in 1998, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8130.14s)]
*  featuring larger levels, more challenging puzzles [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8133.66s)]
*  and deadlier enemies. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8136.38s)]
*  The notable difficulty, it was very, very, very difficult. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8137.54s)]
*  And so I spent, when I got it, it came in a black cartridge, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8141.3s)]
*  not like your standard gray Nintendo 64, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8144.7s)]
*  the black cartridge is a bad ass game. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8146.78s)]
*  And I got it and I put it in and I played [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8149.82s)]
*  and I played every day for like 10 hours a day [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8153.22s)]
*  for a month straight and I beat it. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8155.94s)]
*  And it was like such an incredible great experience. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8158.82s)]
*  And the last leader of Turok 2 is called the Primogen. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8161.219999999999s)]
*  And so when I was a kid, when you're in like fifth grade, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8164.379999999999s)]
*  that's like super cool, like named after the bad guy. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8166.98s)]
*  And so like for a long time on any internet thing, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8169.62s)]
*  like Grail Online that I mentioned earlier, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8172.299999999999s)]
*  the name was the Primogen, it was great. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8174.139999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, I became an adult eventually [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8176.339999999999s)]
*  and it's just like, okay, I'm an adult, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8178.94s)]
*  my name is Michael Paulson underscore, you know. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8180.82s)]
*  That's what I was on the internet for a long time, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8183.139999999999s)]
*  was that. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8185.14s)]
*  And I remember it was like 2017, 2018, somewhere in there. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8186.42s)]
*  I remember just how bad the tech world had kind of become. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8195.94s)]
*  It was just like this super pretentious place, [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8200.220000000001s)]
*  tons of dick measuring, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8203.42s)]
*  just everything that just was the worst. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8205.34s)]
*  Ken Wheeler got canceled over playing the circle game. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8207.86s)]
*  It was just like, it's so hard to describe to people [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8210.62s)]
*  that weren't there, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8214.82s)]
*  but it was just the worst place to be. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8215.66s)]
*  Tech was extremely unfun. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8217.26s)]
*  It was extremely awful. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8219.699999999999s)]
*  Everything was just so, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8221.9s)]
*  it wasn't academic because it was research. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8223.46s)]
*  It was like, we're building the most sophisticated things [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8225.619999999999s)]
*  and this is for the smart people [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8229.14s)]
*  and everyone else is the dumb people. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8230.779999999999s)]
*  Don't worry, we'll design for you, dummy. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8232.06s)]
*  We got the, we'll show you how to make [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8233.34s)]
*  the perfect architecture. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8235.02s)]
*  And I remember changing my Twitter handle [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8236.1s)]
*  because I got so upset [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8238.34s)]
*  and just went back to my video game name [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8239.58s)]
*  because I was like, I want things to be fun. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8241.74s)]
*  I want this to stop. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8244.5s)]
*  And so while I started, when I started streaming tech, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8245.9s)]
*  my goal became to destroy whatever that tech mentality was [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8249.34s)]
*  because it includes nobody. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8253.34s)]
*  Everyone thinks that they're the smart people [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8255.54s)]
*  and they design for the dummies. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8257.42s)]
*  And it's just like, no, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8258.58s)]
*  like I want tech to be this place [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8259.94s)]
*  where people feel like they can be creative and excited [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8261.74s)]
*  and actually build something. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8265.02s)]
*  And if you're new, like it's okay to be dumb [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8266.18s)]
*  and ask dumb questions, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8268.42s)]
*  like learn from your dumbness. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8269.78s)]
*  No one's expecting you to be smart. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8271.42s)]
*  Pick whatever you want. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8272.86s)]
*  Actually do something and have fun [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8274.18s)]
*  and build like your crazy ideas. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8275.54s)]
*  Oh, you're gonna reinvent the wheel? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8277.300000000001s)]
*  Reinvent the wheel, understand what you're doing, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8278.54s)]
*  learn it really good and like interact and stuff. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8281.02s)]
*  And it's just so different than what was out there. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8284.060000000001s)]
*  And that the name, [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8286.5s)]
*  Arnold Schwarzenegger talks about this thing [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8288.1s)]
*  where when he first started acting, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8289.58s)]
*  his name was like the thing that people hated. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8291.820000000002s)]
*  As he once said, you have a strange voice, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8294.58s)]
*  you have a strange body and your name, [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8297.1s)]
*  your name's unpronounceable. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8298.66s)]
*  No one's gonna, Schneitzinfinitzel, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8299.78s)]
*  no one's gonna remember that. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8301.460000000001s)]
*  And he said, but now the name is the strong part. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8302.98s)]
*  And for me, I just, I've always felt akin to that, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8305.939999999999s)]
*  though my name's not nearly as cool, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8308.02s)]
*  Norma is as popular as Arnold, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8309.199999999999s)]
*  Norma as tough or good looking or successful, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8310.939999999999s)]
*  but nonetheless, it's just the name represented [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8313.3s)]
*  this like counterculture like movement within myself [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8315.98s)]
*  in which I just hated what was there [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8319.779999999999s)]
*  and I wanted to defeat it. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8321.939999999999s)]
*  And so this has like been the thing. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8323.3s)]
*  And now people remember me so well [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8324.98s)]
*  because of how weird my name is. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8327.22s)]
*  And so it's just like, for whatever reason, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8329.26s)]
*  it became its own thing. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8331.78s)]
*  And so that's kind of the, now I would never change it. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8333.54s)]
*  And back then I would never change it [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8337.1s)]
*  because it was my rage against the machine moment, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8338.220000000001s)]
*  if you will. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8340.7s)]
*  Yeah, I love that as a symbol of rage against the machine [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8341.86s)]
*  and the rage being fun. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8345.18s)]
*  Yeah, I just want people to like be creative [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8347.66s)]
*  and have fun again, it's okay. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8350.08s)]
*  What about the mustache? [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8351.62s)]
*  It's an epic mustache, it's an epic stash. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8353.060000000001s)]
*  It has a life of its own. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8355.42s)]
*  Is there an origin story or did you guys discover each other [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8357.460000000001s)]
*  at some point or was it, did it emerge from the darkness [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8360.78s)]
*  of the struggle that is your life or where does it come from? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8365.460000000001s)]
*  Well, the original mustache is that [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8369.460000000001s)]
*  it was no shave November back before it became November. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8372.300000000001s)]
*  It was no shave November back in the day. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8375.5s)]
*  And after no shave November, you had all this hair. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8377.380000000001s)]
*  And so what's the natural thing you gotta do? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8380.300000000001s)]
*  You gotta sport a mustache for a day, right? [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8381.980000000001s)]
*  So whenever I'd forget to not shave for a long time [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8384.220000000001s)]
*  and then I'd let it start growing out really big, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8387.460000000001s)]
*  I'd just go, oh, this is kind of funny. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8389.06s)]
*  I'll have a mustache. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8390.82s)]
*  And so one day when I was streaming, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8392.42s)]
*  it's just one of those times I just didn't shave [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8394.0s)]
*  and then I started just letting it go [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8396.22s)]
*  and then I got kind of a beard and then I just had a mustache. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8397.58s)]
*  And when I did it, people were just like, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8400.26s)]
*  hey, it's mustache time. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8402.58s)]
*  And I was just like, it feels like a lifestyle decision. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8403.9s)]
*  It's like the fun times. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8407.18s)]
*  And so all of a sudden it was just like exciting [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8408.74s)]
*  to have a mustache. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8410.74s)]
*  And I shaved it off and I was like, oh, okay. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8411.58s)]
*  But then part of me is like, there's this weird energy [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8414.06s)]
*  that comes from just having a mustache. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8416.46s)]
*  I was like, I'm going back. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8419.66s)]
*  Told my wife, forgive her. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8420.82s)]
*  She was very not as thrilled about my decisions [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8422.720000000001s)]
*  to have a mustache long-term, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8425.58s)]
*  but I just decided to have it back. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8426.980000000001s)]
*  And it's just like, it was the right thing. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8429.300000000001s)]
*  It's always been the energy that I had with the mustache. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8433.58s)]
*  It was always been there. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8436.18s)]
*  It just never was visible until later on, it feels like. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8437.1s)]
*  Yeah, we're chatting offline [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8439.960000000001s)]
*  how one of the components of a successful relationship [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8441.7s)]
*  is sacrifice and your wife was willing to take the sacrifice [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8444.18s)]
*  of allowing you to have a mustache. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8447.220000000001s)]
*  I clearly was not willing to sacrifice not having one. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8449.619999999999s)]
*  So. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8452.02s)]
*  You do this incredible thing [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8453.06s)]
*  where you tried a bunch of different programming languages [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8456.18s)]
*  when you stream. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8458.66s)]
*  You go all out on certain programming languages [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8462.98s)]
*  like Rust and then Go and then try to pick a new one, [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8465.539999999999s)]
*  but also are like experimenting constantly. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8469.18s)]
*  So maybe one question I can ask is about learning. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8471.78s)]
*  What's your approach to learning a new programming language? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8477.26s)]
*  And maybe what's your advice [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8480.300000000001s)]
*  on learning a new programming language [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8481.62s)]
*  when you begin that journey? [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8483.300000000001s)]
*  So I've kind of done a bunch of different ways [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8486.44s)]
*  to go through this learning process. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8488.54s)]
*  And I've tried a lot of different ones. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8491.060000000001s)]
*  Something that is obviously successful [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8493.1s)]
*  is just start building something. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8495.800000000001s)]
*  Just put your hands on the keyboard. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8498.320000000002s)]
*  Especially if you already know how to program, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8501.58s)]
*  you're like, okay, I'm now using Zig. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8503.460000000001s)]
*  How do I do a main function so I can just run the program? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8505.7s)]
*  Okay, now I know how to build. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8507.78s)]
*  Okay, how do I do an if statement? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8508.820000000002s)]
*  What does it look like? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8510.2s)]
*  Okay, how do I do declare my own functions? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8511.04s)]
*  How do I do modules? [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8512.880000000001s)]
*  You just kind of like Google your way through it, [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8513.900000000001s)]
*  if you will, to get to the end product and build something. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8515.42s)]
*  It's a great way to do things [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8519.34s)]
*  because I find that repetition, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8520.980000000001s)]
*  like rote learning is obviously the best way to do this. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8522.66s)]
*  You have to kind of go over it a bunch [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8525.42s)]
*  and you can definitely get out [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8526.62s)]
*  and build a lot of stuff with that. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8528.300000000001s)]
*  I like that initial kind of get used to things. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8529.460000000001s)]
*  But on top of it, I find that by doing that, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8532.92s)]
*  you also fall into traps. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8536.66s)]
*  You kind of Google and you try to solve a problem [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8537.5s)]
*  in the language based on all of your previous experience. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8541.539999999999s)]
*  And so you don't have what makes that language special. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8544.94s)]
*  You kind of have what all the other languages make special. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8548.84s)]
*  And so you end up kind of not really being able [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8550.9s)]
*  to use it very effectively, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8553.02s)]
*  but you can certainly kind of learn it [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8554.68s)]
*  and get kind of good at it. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8556.14s)]
*  And so the second approach I've been doing lately, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8557.3s)]
*  and this has been inspired by the creator of Ghosty, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8559.3s)]
*  Mitchell Hashimoto, is to just start [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8561.18s)]
*  by reading the language reference, the whole thing. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8563.1s)]
*  And so lately I've been just kind of going through [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8565.34s)]
*  and just reading the entire manual for these languages. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8567.26s)]
*  Like Zig, I'm almost done with that one. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8570.34s)]
*  It's like eight to 10 hours of just sitting down reading [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8572.62s)]
*  and I'll whip out my computer [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8575.02s)]
*  and kind of practice a couple of the things [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8576.3s)]
*  from the actual docs. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8577.76s)]
*  And that way I can learn all the things. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8578.66s)]
*  So then when I start building again, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8581.380000000001s)]
*  I remember, okay, I know there's a thing over here. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8583.380000000001s)]
*  Let me go reread about it [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8585.62s)]
*  because now I have it indexed in my brain somewhere [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8586.58s)]
*  that it will kind of remember. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8588.58s)]
*  And so I don't think there's like a right or wrong way. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8590.22s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8593.42s)]
*  the right way is always that you have to build [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8594.26s)]
*  something eventually. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8596.02s)]
*  You cannot just read about it. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8596.86s)]
*  You have to put your hands on the keyboard. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8598.06s)]
*  You have to build something out. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8599.74s)]
*  And then once you do that, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8601.02s)]
*  that's where you really discover what makes it painful [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8602.06s)]
*  or what makes it great. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8604.1s)]
*  And if you don't have the breadth of what the language offers, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8605.380000000001s)]
*  you just may make it painful by simply being bad at it. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8607.86s)]
*  What exactly are you reading? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8610.74s)]
*  Like the language reference? [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8612.02s)]
*  The language reference. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8614.7s)]
*  So it just goes through like every feature [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8616.380000000001s)]
*  top to bottom, right? [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8617.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8618.9s)]
*  Every way it's described, all the different things. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8619.74s)]
*  I think Ziggs is, you know, it's a decent size, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8622.220000000001s)]
*  but it's not just simply read the words. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8625.220000000001s)]
*  You want to internalize each concept as well. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8627.02s)]
*  So it takes a long time. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8629.5s)]
*  So I'm a slow reader. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8630.58s)]
*  So you're like building in AI terms, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8631.58s)]
*  like a background model. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8634.220000000001s)]
*  Cause I don't think you can just start building [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8638.300000000001s)]
*  once you're done reading. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8640.060000000001s)]
*  Cause you probably forgot, you know, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8641.42s)]
*  how to do a for loop. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8644.34s)]
*  You kind of forget the specifics. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8646.060000000001s)]
*  You just are building up the design choices, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8648.62s)]
*  the set of features available, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8651.86s)]
*  what are the strengths and weaknesses, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8653.140000000001s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8654.34s)]
*  And then you start building. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8655.820000000002s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8657.02s)]
*  Probably not the thing you would recommend [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8658.1s)]
*  to a junior developer, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8659.62s)]
*  somebody who's just starting out at first. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8662.140000000001s)]
*  If you don't know what an if statement is, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8664.1s)]
*  that's not a good way to learn. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8665.820000000002s)]
*  Like to me, the best way to learn that [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8667.34s)]
*  is really hands on the keyboard [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8668.7s)]
*  and building extremely simple things [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8670.1s)]
*  and slowly growing in complexity. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8671.740000000002s)]
*  Because understanding what a class and methods [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8673.7s)]
*  and instances versus the blueprint, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8675.42s)]
*  which is the class versus functions [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8676.980000000001s)]
*  versus modules versus all that stuff. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8679.22s)]
*  I like that's, that just takes time to learn. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8680.22s)]
*  And so that's a completely different style of learning. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8682.38s)]
*  I wonder, cause for me learning right now, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8686.06s)]
*  AI is a huge help, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8689.58s)]
*  but I already have a lot of experience. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8691.66s)]
*  I wonder if you're starting from scratch, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8693.22s)]
*  whether that's a good idea, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8695.62s)]
*  but I still think it's probably a really good idea. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8696.62s)]
*  But basically generate some code using AI [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8698.62s)]
*  and figure out what it's doing [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8702.86s)]
*  by playing with different parts. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8705.86s)]
*  Maybe can you comment on that aspect, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8708.42s)]
*  like the use of AI as part of the learning process? [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8710.3s)]
*  This is where I have both the hopeful [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8715.1s)]
*  and the doomer take at the exact same time. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8716.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8718.54s)]
*  And it's the same thing with Google or Stack Overflow. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8721.42s)]
*  Like this, it's all the same kind of take, [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8723.5s)]
*  which is it's just making things [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8726.18s)]
*  more democratized in some sense. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8727.94s)]
*  I get to ask questions [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8730.3s)]
*  in probably the most personal possible way [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8731.94s)]
*  with my own voice in my own words, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8734.3s)]
*  and it's able to produce out answers [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8736.22s)]
*  and kind of hopefully help guide me. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8738.26s)]
*  Now, regardless of just say the errors [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8740.179999999998s)]
*  and the incorrectness of it, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8741.82s)]
*  like ultimately just using it as a learning tool [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8743.58s)]
*  and being able to just formulate [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8746.82s)]
*  and read answers in your own voice, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8748.98s)]
*  I think it's super powerful. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8750.14s)]
*  And I think it's super amazing. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8751.66s)]
*  But the part that I think is gonna be really difficult [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8753.939999999999s)]
*  is that we don't value remembering things anymore [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8758.699999999999s)]
*  as a society. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8764.019999999999s)]
*  Like since the internet came about, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8765.1s)]
*  I can just look that up. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8766.9s)]
*  I can just look that up. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8768.54s)]
*  No need to like, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8769.380000000001s)]
*  you don't need to memorize your times tables, right? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8770.380000000001s)]
*  You can just use your calculator. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8772.26s)]
*  You can just do all that. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8773.74s)]
*  I remember I just was sitting on the airplane [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8774.58s)]
*  and I watched someone do the world's most simple addition [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8776.94s)]
*  and subtraction like 10 times on their phone. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8779.62s)]
*  And like, why are you not just, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8781.66s)]
*  like you should already know these things, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8784.5s)]
*  you should be able to do these things. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8785.94s)]
*  And I realized that we kind of offload our brains, right? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8787.06s)]
*  Oh, I don't need to know these things [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8789.66s)]
*  because I can look them up. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8791.1s)]
*  And that's not a bad answer in some sense. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8792.380000000001s)]
*  I can understand that. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8794.62s)]
*  Like I don't need to remember every last thing. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8795.740000000002s)]
*  But then it also makes me realize [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8798.26s)]
*  that you kind of develop this learned helplessness [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8799.78s)]
*  that a new error comes up. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8802.380000000001s)]
*  I'll just ask the AI. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8804.78s)]
*  AI says, oh, okay, I gotta fix this line. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8806.1s)]
*  I fixed the line. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8807.660000000002s)]
*  You didn't actually learn anything. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8808.58s)]
*  You kind of just used it as a quick means [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8809.62s)]
*  to get something out and move on. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8811.220000000001s)]
*  And so you sacrifice knowledge for speed, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8812.660000000002s)]
*  which is a great thing in some, [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8815.34s)]
*  like we have to make those trade-offs [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8816.94s)]
*  all the time in engineering. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8819.300000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you have to move fast [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8820.900000000001s)]
*  at the sacrifice of knowledge. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8822.54s)]
*  And I'm totally on board for that. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8823.58s)]
*  But I worry that what we'll create [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8825.58s)]
*  is an entire generation of incompetent programmers [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8828.02s)]
*  who can do some amount of things well. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8832.14s)]
*  But anything that is unique, bespoke, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8834.94s)]
*  or require some extra like little elbow grease [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8837.46s)]
*  might become very difficult. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8840.02s)]
*  It might cause a whole chasm [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8842.18s)]
*  where juniors remain juniors forever. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8843.46s)]
*  And I don't wanna see that. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8846.34s)]
*  I wanna see people grow. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8847.3s)]
*  I wanna see people actually be able to take this [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8848.34s)]
*  as a craftsmanship thing. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8851.06s)]
*  And so that's kind of what I, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8852.86s)]
*  that's like both my hope and my worry is [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8854.38s)]
*  is that AI I think can do both really. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8857.1s)]
*  Cause if you could ask whatever question you want [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8859.78s)]
*  and you don't have to rely on say a book [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8861.46s)]
*  to give you that exact answer. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8862.9s)]
*  And if the book just said it wrong [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8864.06s)]
*  and you can't understand it's just like, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8865.22s)]
*  sorry, you don't get to learn what this is [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8866.5s)]
*  like recursion for me. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8868.38s)]
*  I spent way too much time [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8869.619999999999s)]
*  until someone gave me the right problem [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8870.82s)]
*  to understand recursion. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8872.22s)]
*  You could imagine AI could have solved that for me way faster [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8873.5s)]
*  because it could have gave me the right problem [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8876.22s)]
*  and walked me through much better. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8877.5s)]
*  But what happens if I just always have recursion [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8879.699999999999s)]
*  solved by them and not actually learn it myself? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8881.46s)]
*  So if I ask AI to generate code to do a certain thing, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8883.699999999999s)]
*  some actually large percentage of time, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8888.259999999998s)]
*  most of what AI generates is going to be correct for me. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8891.06s)]
*  But some percent of time it's not like fundamentally not. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8894.74s)]
*  And for me to recognize the difference between those two, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8899.82s)]
*  I think it takes a lot of experience. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8902.099999999999s)]
*  Like I think to learn that skill of knowing like, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8904.46s)]
*  no, no, no, a different new out of the box solution [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8907.9s)]
*  is needed here than the one you're providing. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8912.539999999999s)]
*  You're missing the point. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8914.38s)]
*  That's a skill. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8918.14s)]
*  And how do you learn that? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8919.06s)]
*  You learn that by building from scratch. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8919.98s)]
*  So both are probably really necessary. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8922.22s)]
*  But I think as a first step of learning how to program, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8924.94s)]
*  it's pretty nice to generate a function, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8928.58s)]
*  to generate for loops and all that kind of stuff. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8931.3s)]
*  And they've just fuck with the different lines [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8933.38s)]
*  and like modify them to try to adjust [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8936.02s)]
*  the behavior of the program. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8939.7s)]
*  And from the way the behavior of the program adjusts [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8940.74s)]
*  or bugs are created, [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8944.94s)]
*  you learn about the syntax of the language, [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8946.02s)]
*  the behavior of the language, all that kind of stuff. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8950.140000000001s)]
*  So I think it's a super powerful way to learn, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8951.94s)]
*  but yeah, you need to also write from scratch. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8954.82s)]
*  At some point you have to take off the training wheels [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8957.82s)]
*  because I think what you're really spotting [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8960.82s)]
*  is the difference between reading and writing code. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8962.26s)]
*  Like I can read a lot of languages very well. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8964.9s)]
*  I can see what's happening. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8967.38s)]
*  I can understand it, [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8968.5s)]
*  but like I would not be very good at writing it. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8969.82s)]
*  I can understand a lot of things about C++ [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8971.98s)]
*  and I can read it, but I'm just not that, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8973.779999999999s)]
*  cause I just don't, I haven't done it in so long. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8975.699999999999s)]
*  I can't remember all, or all the semi-colons and colons [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8977.5s)]
*  and like, you know, you do public and private [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8980.06s)]
*  and how you should do naming, like, you know, [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8982.42s)]
*  all those things kind of add all together. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8984.26s)]
*  And then you're just like, oh, I'm really bad at writing it [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8986.58s)]
*  though I can read it. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8988.94s)]
*  And so there's like this, [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8989.9s)]
*  there's a skill gap chasm that exists between those two. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8991.1s)]
*  All right, well, let me talk about the various languages. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8995.98s)]
*  The cheesy ridiculous question [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8999.5s)]
*  of what's the best programming language. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9003.94s)]
*  Let's say what's the best programming language [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9007.62s)]
*  that everybody should learn. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9009.1s)]
*  Maybe let's go with the top five. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9010.54s)]
*  I'm gonna pull up the stack overflow developer survey [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9013.02s)]
*  cause I think we have a, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9016.06s)]
*  yeah, those are, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9016.9s)]
*  what you don't like them. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9017.9s)]
*  No, no, those aren't, you gotta remember [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9019.1s)]
*  because I mean, you're a data guy. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9021.220000000001s)]
*  You know about biases and data. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9022.94s)]
*  What does stack overflow naturally bias towards? [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9025.06s)]
*  Well, they have the different slices [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9028.26s)]
*  of professional developers, junior developers, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9029.58s)]
*  they have different slices. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9033.26s)]
*  Okay, what is the bias? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9034.5s)]
*  I hear you, but who fills out a stack overflow survey? [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9035.98s)]
*  Someone who participates on stack overflow. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9038.7s)]
*  Who's participating on stack overflow? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9040.66s)]
*  Largely very, very new people [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9042.82s)]
*  and that one guy that loves answering questions. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9044.42s)]
*  And so I'm not sure if that like, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9046.26s)]
*  stack overflow is a great place to get data. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9048.06s)]
*  It could be a very biased set of data. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9050.3s)]
*  Is it really only new people? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9052.14s)]
*  I mean, who's using stack overflow? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9055.02s)]
*  All right, most popular technologies on this. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9058.22s)]
*  JavaScript, HTML, Python, SQL. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9062.38s)]
*  SQL is the more general kind of, [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9065.18s)]
*  I'm sure they're not doing the individual [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9067.98s)]
*  sort of flavors of SQL. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9071.42s)]
*  By the way, pronounce SQL versus SQL. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9073.9s)]
*  It's squeal. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9075.78s)]
*  Squeal? [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9076.94s)]
*  Squeal. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9077.74s)]
*  Squeal. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9078.58s)]
*  I think is the correct way. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9079.42s)]
*  Squeal. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9080.26s)]
*  I did SQL because I didn't know the audience. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9081.1s)]
*  I don't know if they can handle the truth. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9082.74s)]
*  Okay. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9084.34s)]
*  Which is it's squeal. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9085.18s)]
*  Squeal of joy, squeal. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9086.02s)]
*  Squeal light, my squeal, postgres squeal. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9087.74s)]
*  By the way, I had a lot of joy from earlier saying [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9091.02s)]
*  pig fucker for some reason. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9093.06s)]
*  It's such a ridiculous, I mean, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9094.74s)]
*  can you believe that that was a real conversation [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9096.18s)]
*  that I had? [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9098.1s)]
*  Yeah, that was. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9098.94s)]
*  TypeScript, Bass, Java, C Sharp, C++, CPHP. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9101.02s)]
*  Largely kind of aligns with the world you'd expect, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9105.5s)]
*  but like assembly. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9107.54s)]
*  Why is assembly more popular than Ruby? [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9108.78s)]
*  Who is writing just assembly by, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9110.7s)]
*  no one writes assembly by hand other than like [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9113.3s)]
*  maybe that one guy that's developing TLS 1.3 [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9115.18s)]
*  and hand rolling a cryptography algorithm [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9118.42s)]
*  to be the fastest possible algorithm. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9120.38s)]
*  Right? [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9122.94s)]
*  Yeah, assembly is a weird one. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9123.78s)]
*  Maybe people write it as maybe in school, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9124.6s)]
*  but even in school now for like operating system scores [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9127.06s)]
*  or something like that, or systems engineering. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9131.74s)]
*  I don't know if they write assembly anymore. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9133.54s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9135.86s)]
*  Yeah, and Swift and Ruby being less popular [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9137.380000000001s)]
*  than assembly seems ridiculous. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9140.94s)]
*  But nonetheless, okay, so you get my ideas behind that, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9143.220000000001s)]
*  but as far as top five languages go, [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9145.94s)]
*  that's probably too broad [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9147.5s)]
*  because you could just name so many. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9148.5s)]
*  I think you should probably archetype it [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9150.060000000001s)]
*  by what do you want to do. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9151.54s)]
*  So if you want to get into game development, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9153.460000000001s)]
*  perhaps C Sharp, C++ could be good choices [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9156.5s)]
*  or JavaScript and doing canvas games. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9160.34s)]
*  I could see that also working, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9163.2s)]
*  but you're limited by doing JavaScript obviously, [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9164.320000000002s)]
*  because you can't do as much [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9167.16s)]
*  because the language is just not fast enough to do as much. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9168.400000000001s)]
*  So it's like a good thing to remember. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9171.2s)]
*  If you're going to be doing backend stuff, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9174.76s)]
*  if you want a job, if you're looking for a job, [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9176.960000000001s)]
*  maybe C Sharp slash Java or JavaScript [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9179.6s)]
*  or Go would be great choices. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9183.400000000001s)]
*  If you're looking to do embedded, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9185.16s)]
*  you probably want to do C, C++. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9186.240000000002s)]
*  Like that would probably be a good choice. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9188.960000000001s)]
*  And so you kind of have to, [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9190.18s)]
*  I think you have to first determine [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9191.62s)]
*  what do you really want to get out. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9192.86s)]
*  If you're just curious about programming, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9194.34s)]
*  I talked to a lot of people who are, [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9195.900000000001s)]
*  yeah, you can consider jobs, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9197.94s)]
*  but basically their question is, [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9199.300000000001s)]
*  okay, what's the first language I should learn? [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9200.54s)]
*  And maybe what are the several languages I should explore? [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9203.140000000001s)]
*  Can I say something [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9208.300000000001s)]
*  that's going to make a lot of people angry? [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9209.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9210.02s)]
*  I think the first language people should learn [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9210.86s)]
*  if they have no idea about anything is JavaScript. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9212.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, why would that make people angry? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9215.34s)]
*  Oh, because people just, [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9217.58s)]
*  first off, I'm not supposed to say anything nice [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9219.18s)]
*  about JavaScript. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9220.86s)]
*  Yeah, usually that's the meme that you hate JavaScript. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9221.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, JavaScript's a beautiful language [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9224.060000000001s)]
*  and it has a lot of things that are very great for it. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9226.58s)]
*  And one of them is that you can express anything [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9228.58s)]
*  with very little effort. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9230.5s)]
*  And so someone that's new, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9232.220000000001s)]
*  I think it's really great to be able to draw a box [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9234.26s)]
*  and move a box. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9237.7s)]
*  Like that's great. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9239.58s)]
*  You get to see it visually. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9240.58s)]
*  I think that's one thing that's really great [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9241.7s)]
*  about JavaScript is that you can do that. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9242.86s)]
*  Then you can go, okay, I want to learn about the backend. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9244.82s)]
*  I'm going to make a request now. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9247.140000000001s)]
*  You can write a quick backend in it. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9248.400000000001s)]
*  Now you're starting to get familiar [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9249.660000000002s)]
*  with programming a little bit. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9250.900000000001s)]
*  I can save this to a database. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9251.980000000001s)]
*  I can bring it down. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9253.62s)]
*  I can put it on a screen and I can animate it all around. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9254.54s)]
*  And I can even put it on a canvas [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9256.820000000002s)]
*  and render it in 2D or 3D. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9258.34s)]
*  So it's like, there's so much variety [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9260.140000000001s)]
*  of what you can do with JavaScript. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9261.78s)]
*  It's a great way to get introduced into programming. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9264.26s)]
*  But then at some point you have to go, okay, [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9267.220000000001s)]
*  I now need to learn more about this whole thing. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9269.08s)]
*  I mean, yeah, just like you said, you can make games. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9271.86s)]
*  You can do front-end, backend for web development. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9274.740000000002s)]
*  You can even do embedded. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9277.660000000002s)]
*  They actually have, like there's West Boss is building [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9278.7s)]
*  his Roomba or something and programming it with JavaScript [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9281.94s)]
*  and React, which is just the world's worst language [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9285.1s)]
*  to choose from embedded, but you can still do it. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9287.800000000001s)]
*  Also, we mentioned sort of in terms of applications, [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9291.26s)]
*  anything that relates to data or machine learning, [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9294.62s)]
*  Python is the sort of the leader there. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9297.94s)]
*  So that's a great one. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9300.740000000002s)]
*  It seems like Python, CUDA stuff and C++ [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9301.640000000001s)]
*  would be a dynamite in that [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9304.140000000001s)]
*  because a lot of these Python libraries are assumed are just, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9305.34s)]
*  you're just smuggling in C++ underneath the hood or C. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9309.1s)]
*  Okay, so JavaScript, I would say Python. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9311.66s)]
*  Python's a great one too. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9314.86s)]
*  You can get quite far with it, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9315.86s)]
*  but you can't write the front end. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9316.82s)]
*  So why even if you love the front end, right? [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9317.92s)]
*  Why even if you really just want to design things [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9320.34s)]
*  and you just didn't know that? [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9322.66s)]
*  Well, it's okay. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9324.38s)]
*  So for that JavaScript. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9325.22s)]
*  But Python's a good choice [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9326.78s)]
*  because you can't do the ML stuff in JavaScript now. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9327.7s)]
*  It's easy. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9329.62s)]
*  Do we count HTML and CSS as programming languages? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9330.460000000001s)]
*  I think there's like some technical definition [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9333.62s)]
*  that it is if you put it up. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9335.62s)]
*  If you use this certain amalgamation of CSS plus HTML, [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9337.14s)]
*  it actually has like, it can be a Turing complete language. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9340.26s)]
*  But I mean, for practical purposes, no. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9343.3s)]
*  HTML is not a language. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9345.06s)]
*  For me, yes, the Turing test is a good one. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9349.06s)]
*  But for those that are just not wanting to be as academic, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9351.26s)]
*  if I can't write a function in an if statement, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9354.939999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like that's a, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9357.06s)]
*  if I can't loop if and function, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9358.939999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like that's a good, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9360.9s)]
*  that's a programming language. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9361.98s)]
*  Although modern HTML has a lot of features. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9363.38s)]
*  It's crazy how much it has, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9365.58s)]
*  but it's more of a specification than anything else. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9367.26s)]
*  I specify it to be a popup. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9369.62s)]
*  I specify it to have this kind of like accessibility, [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9371.98s)]
*  this kind of look, this kind of, you know, [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9374.82s)]
*  under these conditions, look like this, [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9377.34s)]
*  transform like this, move down here. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9379.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9380.98s)]
*  I kind of like these popular programming languages [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9381.8s)]
*  in this list that like JavaScript. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9383.26s)]
*  You like Bash? [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9385.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, I like Bash a lot. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9386.66s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9387.86s)]
*  Okay. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9388.7s)]
*  Bash is kind of one of those ones where it's like, [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9389.62s)]
*  do you really like it? [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9391.5s)]
*  I like it up until I need an array. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9393.22s)]
*  Oh, as a programming language, no, [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9394.94s)]
*  but I like the command line. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9397.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9399.380000000001s)]
*  That's why, yeah, do you like Bash? [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9400.220000000001s)]
*  No, nobody likes Bash. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9401.26s)]
*  Do you mean, I meant like more- [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9402.68s)]
*  Someone is so offended right now. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9406.140000000001s)]
*  Means do you use it a lot? [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9408.300000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9409.980000000001s)]
*  It's good to, I mean, it's good to learn, right? [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9410.82s)]
*  It's good to be comfortable on the command line [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9414.36s)]
*  because it's a bit of a superpower. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9416.9s)]
*  It's like, I think I follow on Twitter, ffmpeg. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9418.74s)]
*  Great account. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9422.380000000001s)]
*  Like there's certain Twitter accounts [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9423.22s)]
*  that are just like legit. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9426.099999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I think ffmpeg, [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9427.939999999999s)]
*  like they have all these sort of parameters [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9431.619999999999s)]
*  that you can add on the command line that, [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9434.46s)]
*  it's like one of those cryptic languages [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9437.3s)]
*  that only very few wizards understand. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9439.16s)]
*  But once you begin to slowly understand, [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9442.46s)]
*  and I'm only at the very sort of beginning stage [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9444.26s)]
*  of that journey to mastery, [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9447.099999999999s)]
*  the powers you gain at every step [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9448.859999999999s)]
*  is like, it grows exponentially, it feels like. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9451.58s)]
*  I mean, ffmpeg is just this incredible, [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9454.1s)]
*  like what would you call a library system? [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9456.66s)]
*  There's just, the people behind them [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9458.56s)]
*  must be just brilliant masterminds [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9461.3s)]
*  because they have to work with all these codecs, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9463.3s)]
*  with all these containers, with all this, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9465.06s)]
*  the mysteries of the media codec universe, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9467.7s)]
*  they're like masters of. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9471.76s)]
*  And they understand compression, [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9473.26s)]
*  which is another super fascinating technical [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9474.7s)]
*  set of problems that, I don't know, I just, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9478.98s)]
*  ffmpeg just fills me with joy that it exists. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9481.98s)]
*  But you need kind of bash type comfort, [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9484.5s)]
*  command line comfort to work with it, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9487.179999999998s)]
*  to really unlock its power, yeah. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9489.439999999999s)]
*  I think ffmpeg is probably one of the most [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9492.019999999999s)]
*  consequential libraries of our day. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9494.64s)]
*  And the Twitter account is so unhinged. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9497.619999999999s)]
*  It's the most amazing thing to see [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9502.82s)]
*  because I think ffmpeg does not get the love it deserves. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9504.099999999999s)]
*  Every single application, OBS, [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9507.599999999999s)]
*  probably ffmpeg underneath the hood. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9509.22s)]
*  Everything, ffmpeg underneath the hood. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9511.92s)]
*  And then, and yet, they do not get the love they deserve. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9513.96s)]
*  I just love it. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9518.0s)]
*  I just think they're the best. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9518.84s)]
*  Yeah, I would say JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9519.82s)]
*  I mean, that is, SQL squeal is a programming language. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9523.72s)]
*  It's an incredibly sophisticated programming language, yeah. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9528.48s)]
*  SQL is interesting. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9532.2s)]
*  I believe you can classify it as a programming language. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9533.28s)]
*  It does have like if, you have case statements [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9537.0s)]
*  and it's pretty crazy what you can do with it. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9539.0s)]
*  It has different functions. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9540.84s)]
*  You can do all that stuff. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9541.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's, you shouldn't. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9542.5s)]
*  Stored procedures, that's how you make your life hell. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9543.34s)]
*  I will say that all the top languages right there [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9547.24s)]
*  are, none of them are like strict static typed languages. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9551.48s)]
*  And so even TypeScript, you can, you know, [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9556.92s)]
*  I don't like this any. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9558.72s)]
*  And so for people that are learning, [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9560.08s)]
*  doing something that's much more strict would be great. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9561.76s)]
*  Something like Go, Rust, even, I mean, even C-sharp, C++, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9563.82s)]
*  like anything that kind of changes your perspective of types, [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9569.38s)]
*  I think is really helpful to kind of go through. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9572.38s)]
*  They're not getting nearly as much love [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9574.58s)]
*  on this most popular language list, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9575.94s)]
*  but I think they're very fantastic. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9577.38s)]
*  All right, well, if I put a gun to your head, [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9578.9s)]
*  five top five languages, let's list them all. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9580.66s)]
*  There's a bright eyed 20 year old asking you, [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9584.38s)]
*  what are the top languages, five languages to learn? [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9587.3s)]
*  If I were to pick five languages [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9590.94s)]
*  that I think people should learn, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9592.98s)]
*  or at least, let's restate it this way. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9594.4s)]
*  I'm gonna say a couple of languages [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9597.54s)]
*  and you should at least explore some of them. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9598.94s)]
*  I think you should explore a Lucy language. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9601.86s)]
*  So Python slash JavaScript, [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9604.86s)]
*  where there is truly only one type, [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9606.9s)]
*  which is a boxed value, [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9608.66s)]
*  which is a multivariate different types [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9609.68s)]
*  underneath the hood, right? [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9611.74s)]
*  What'd you call it, a Lucy language? [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9612.74s)]
*  A Lucy Goosie language, right? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9614.22s)]
*  It's a dynamic language. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9615.5s)]
*  Okay. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9616.74s)]
*  And so I think it's really good to explore one of those too. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9617.64s)]
*  So I'd put Python or JavaScript right there, even Lua, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9619.86s)]
*  throw Lua in the bunch. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9622.26s)]
*  I think you should explore a strict language. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9623.42s)]
*  So I'd do something like Rust, Go. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9625.82s)]
*  I think those are both really, really great. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9629.76s)]
*  C++? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9631.34s)]
*  You can do C++. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9632.34s)]
*  You can do some type erasure in C++. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9633.46s)]
*  You can do it with Go as well, but it's for the most part, [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9635.22s)]
*  it's a great language to do that in. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9637.779999999999s)]
*  It can get a little wild. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9639.779999999999s)]
*  New C++ seems great. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9640.74s)]
*  Everyone keeps telling me new C++ is great. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9641.9s)]
*  It has every feature you've ever wanted [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9644.58s)]
*  and all the features you don't want. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9646.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9647.6s)]
*  I mean, there's smart pointers, there's dumb pointers, [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9648.539999999999s)]
*  there's all kinds of pointers. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9651.14s)]
*  There's no memory leaks. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9652.619999999999s)]
*  That's not an issue. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9654.02s)]
*  Face guns, soft beds, there's everything in there. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9655.02s)]
*  Unless you like memory leaks, it has that too. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9657.98s)]
*  If you want that kind of thing, it's great. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9660.58s)]
*  Okay, how about this one? [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9662.1s)]
*  Languages that I actually want to really learn [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9662.94s)]
*  that at least sit in my curiosity bank. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9666.74s)]
*  There's three languages, which is going to be [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9669.24s)]
*  Swift, Elixir, OCaml, [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9672.34s)]
*  and then I'm gonna throw Odin in there [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9675.78s)]
*  just because Gingerbill's great. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9676.9s)]
*  But Elixir and OCaml, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9679.34s)]
*  I don't have a strong functional language [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9680.98s)]
*  underneath my belt. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9682.9s)]
*  That's something that I just genuinely lack. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9684.24s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard incredible things about Elixir, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9685.96s)]
*  about Odin, about OCaml. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9688.24s)]
*  Obviously I'm a person, as you know, who loves Lisp. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9690.24s)]
*  I have never done Lisp. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9693.68s)]
*  Lisp could be in that category too, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9694.52s)]
*  just like learn or closure. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9695.84s)]
*  I think at this point is what everyone tells you to use. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9697.56s)]
*  So in the case of Lisp, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9699.72s)]
*  sure, I don't want to speak negatively about Lisp, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9701.68s)]
*  but it's important about like modern community, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9703.24s)]
*  what the community looks like. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9705.68s)]
*  And it seems like there's an excited, [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9707.44s)]
*  maybe small, but an excited community around Elixir, [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9709.199999999999s)]
*  Odin, and OCaml. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9711.68s)]
*  So that helps. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9712.52s)]
*  Because then you can post shit on Twitter [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9714.960000000001s)]
*  that you're like, I accomplished this, [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9716.240000000002s)]
*  and people get excited, and it's nice. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9717.960000000001s)]
*  It's a good feeling. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9719.92s)]
*  You can post something on Twitter, [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9721.0s)]
*  and you'll get like a thousand likes [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9722.320000000002s)]
*  if you do something cool in Elixir. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9723.76s)]
*  Which is a pretty big, [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9725.880000000001s)]
*  that's like a pretty big amount of people [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9726.720000000001s)]
*  to like a post for such a niche topic. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9728.800000000001s)]
*  Programming's already a pretty small topic. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9731.76s)]
*  Then you get into functional programming. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9733.480000000001s)]
*  That's a small topic in a small topic. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9734.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't get that much. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9737.52s)]
*  If I post something about Emacs, I'll get crickets. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9738.800000000001s)]
*  If I post something, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9741.480000000001s)]
*  if I proudly use NeoVim, [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9742.72s)]
*  there'd be a lot of people like, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9745.24s)]
*  yeah, good job. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9746.6s)]
*  It's because it is the best editor. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9747.44s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it's just hype. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9749.76s)]
*  Come back to the Civil War, Lex. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9751.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes you have to sacrifice [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9753.64s)]
*  and go from the superior editor that is Emacs, [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9755.4s)]
*  and choose NeoVim just to be popular. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9758.92s)]
*  You sacrifice integrity and values and quality [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9761.56s)]
*  for just popularity. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9764.199999999999s)]
*  So that's the choice you made. Absolutely. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9765.48s)]
*  I love how you put it. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9766.76s)]
*  Okay, anyway, what were we talking about? [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9768.199999999999s)]
*  I like how you're doing this in bunches. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9770.92s)]
*  That's great. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9772.68s)]
*  Right now, my kind of side honeys that I'm exploring is- [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9773.52s)]
*  Side honeys. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9777.28s)]
*  Yeah, side honeys. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9778.12s)]
*  They're not my mainstay. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9778.960000000001s)]
*  Right now Go's kind of my favorite one to build a web app in. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9779.8s)]
*  Like if I'm gonna build some sort of backend [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9783.64s)]
*  with a lot of complicated logic, [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9785.12s)]
*  Go's just so convenient, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9786.84s)]
*  but I get really frustrated with its ability [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9788.72s)]
*  to express everything that I need. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9790.52s)]
*  Like if you have a list, a heterogeneous list, [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9792.8s)]
*  a list that contains two types, [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9794.8s)]
*  Go's just really not that fun to use. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9797.56s)]
*  And so I could see, [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9800.2s)]
*  so the ones I'm exploring is Jai, or J, or the language, [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9801.68s)]
*  as Jonathan Blow says, and Zig. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9805.640000000001s)]
*  And both of them have a lot of power to them. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9808.76s)]
*  They're both very interesting. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9810.52s)]
*  They definitely have foot guns in them. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9811.880000000001s)]
*  They're definitely more, you know, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9813.800000000001s)]
*  they don't take it easy on you. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9815.92s)]
*  Zig seems like it's a really amazing language, [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9817.68s)]
*  and so does Jai. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9820.480000000001s)]
*  They're both very cool. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9821.52s)]
*  Yeah, actually I saw Dave Plummer's testing [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9822.92s)]
*  of close to 100 languages for speed, [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9827.04s)]
*  and Zig came out on top. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9828.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was a mistake. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9830.76s)]
*  I mean, when I say mistake, nothing against Dave Plummer. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9831.88s)]
*  He's an extremely talented engineer. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9834.2s)]
*  It's just that Zig, C, C++, [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9836.12s)]
*  all those languages that were being tested, [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9839.2s)]
*  they're all LLVM backends, right? [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9840.72s)]
*  That's the one that actually turns the thing [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9842.28s)]
*  into the executable part. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9844.24s)]
*  And if there's a variation in speed, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9845.88s)]
*  it just means in one language, [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9847.28s)]
*  you didn't quite express what you're supposed to correctly. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9848.56s)]
*  Like there's the language ball test [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9851.88s)]
*  that's been bouncing around on Twitter. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9853.68s)]
*  Zig was like sixth or seventh below. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9855.2s)]
*  I forget what language is. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9857.6s)]
*  I played around with the example, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9859.720000000001s)]
*  added the word no alias to the argument, [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9861.08s)]
*  which means that the piece of memory [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9864.6s)]
*  that's coming into this function, [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9866.800000000001s)]
*  there's no global pointers, there's nothing to it. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9867.92s)]
*  And so the compiler can make these really cool optimizations, [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9869.960000000001s)]
*  and I made it faster than the C version. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9873.52s)]
*  So it just means that it's just not correctly specified [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9876.52s)]
*  is all that means. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9879.04s)]
*  Yeah, but it's still exciting. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9880.2s)]
*  To me, the competition between Zig, Rust, [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9882.0s)]
*  and C++ is really interesting. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9884.24s)]
*  Like part of this for speed, [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9886.400000000001s)]
*  part of this for how easy it is to write performant code. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9888.44s)]
*  I'll say something that's, [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9891.2s)]
*  the reason why I think Zig is so interesting [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9892.12s)]
*  comparatively to say C or Rust, [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9894.0s)]
*  C is like the ultimate language. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9896.560000000001s)]
*  It can do anything. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9898.2s)]
*  You have pre-processed or macros. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9899.08s)]
*  You can do quite a bit with it, [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9900.6s)]
*  but it's also really difficult, [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9902.04s)]
*  and it's also really simple and you can learn it. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9904.28s)]
*  So it's kind of it's like own unique beast. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9906.12s)]
*  And when you get really good at C, [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9907.880000000001s)]
*  C is a magical language, [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9909.28s)]
*  and people are really great at it, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9910.720000000001s)]
*  and people speak very highly of it. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9912.36s)]
*  Rust is like this ultra safe language. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9914.48s)]
*  What you can do and see, [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9916.4s)]
*  you just can't even express in Rust. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9917.24s)]
*  Rust is gonna be that safe, [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9918.6s)]
*  the safe man that holds you at night keeping you warm, right? [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9919.8s)]
*  It's gonna be just the greatest. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9922.199999999999s)]
*  But somewhere in the middle lies Zig. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9923.96s)]
*  Zig has optionals. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9925.56s)]
*  If you're not familiar with optionals, [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9926.72s)]
*  that just simply means there's a value here or there's not, [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9927.76s)]
*  but you first have to check that before you can use it. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9930.8s)]
*  So it prevents that whole null pointer dereferencing [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9933.279999999999s)]
*  seg fault problem. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9935.68s)]
*  And that's not available in C just by default. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9936.76s)]
*  You have to kind of build that thing in. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9939.4s)]
*  It is the only option in Rust, [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9940.96s)]
*  but Zig says, hey, if you have a pointer, [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9943.96s)]
*  you can't express it as null [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9945.599999999999s)]
*  unless if you mark it that it can be null. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9946.88s)]
*  There's ways around it. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9948.56s)]
*  There's like other types of pointers [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9949.4s)]
*  and stuff like that that can do that. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9950.599999999999s)]
*  But for the most part, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9952.16s)]
*  Zig will give you safety for the most part, right? [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9953.0s)]
*  So it's like a little bit of safety, but more like C. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9956.4s)]
*  So it kind of gives you like everything you kind of want [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9958.8s)]
*  in that region where you can express safe code [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9960.759999999998s)]
*  and unsafe code. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9963.48s)]
*  It's very easy to write. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9964.56s)]
*  So it's very pretty, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9965.96s)]
*  or at least the idea behind it is very pretty. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9968.16s)]
*  The language itself is bland, but. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9970.119999999999s)]
*  Wow, there's beauty in everything. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9972.16s)]
*  Yeah. Prime. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9973.68s)]
*  You've programmed in Rust a lot. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9975.28s)]
*  What do you love about Rust? [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9977.32s)]
*  What are the strengths? [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9979.56s)]
*  What are the weaknesses? [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9980.4s)]
*  Maybe you can speak about memory management [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9981.32s)]
*  that you already mentioned. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9983.72s)]
*  Yeah. The challenge of memory management [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9984.8s)]
*  that several of these languages address. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9986.68s)]
*  But yeah, what do you love about Rust? [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9989.28s)]
*  What I love about Rust, [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9991.2s)]
*  I love that the ability to free the memory [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9992.76s)]
*  that you're using is directly tied to the stack. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9997.08s)]
*  So whenever you create something, [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9999.84s)]
*  there's a stack variable [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10001.72s)]
*  or there's some amount of stack memory, [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10002.96s)]
*  whether it's a pointer off to the heap, [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10004.72s)]
*  a pointer and a length. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10006.84s)]
*  So, you know, some amount of memory on the stack [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10008.16s)]
*  and then some memory on the heap, [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10010.24s)]
*  because like a string is not all on the stack. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10011.64s)]
*  It's some on the heap, some on the stack. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10014.279999999999s)]
*  And when that stack variable goes out of scope [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10016.0s)]
*  and gets cleaned up, [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10018.64s)]
*  it also cleans up what's on the heap. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10020.039999999999s)]
*  So it kind of simplifies this whole idea of, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10021.96s)]
*  whoops, I forgot to free my memory. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10024.519999999999s)]
*  It just does it for you. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10026.24s)]
*  So it's not a garbage collector, [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10027.4s)]
*  which will do it sometime later. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10028.88s)]
*  It's not like C where you have to call it yourself. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10030.52s)]
*  It's somewhere in between. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10033.4s)]
*  Now there's a lot of strategies people use, [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10034.800000000001s)]
*  arenas and all that, that make that C part much easier. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10037.1s)]
*  I'm just not even mentioning it, [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10039.960000000001s)]
*  but it just makes it a lot easier. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10041.04s)]
*  But Rust does that really beautifully. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10042.76s)]
*  And it's just like a really cool idea about it. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10044.68s)]
*  And I really like that. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10047.720000000001s)]
*  And the second thing that I think Rust does really, [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10048.800000000001s)]
*  like it's such a good thing, [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10050.92s)]
*  is that mutability of something is, [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10053.2s)]
*  you have to specify it. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10056.84s)]
*  So you don't just create a variable and then mutate it. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10058.86s)]
*  You have to say, this is not only a variable, [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10061.84s)]
*  it's a mutable variable. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10063.44s)]
*  And I think that just makes code really readable [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10065.140000000001s)]
*  and really understandable. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10067.140000000001s)]
*  Cause anything that does not have the word mute next to it, [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10068.58s)]
*  you know for a fact, it cannot change. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10071.04s)]
*  So there's some rules around that, [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10074.62s)]
*  but you get the general idea. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10076.060000000001s)]
*  Unlike most programming languages, [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10077.060000000001s)]
*  you have to explicitly state that this is going to be changed. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10078.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10082.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's really interesting. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10083.5s)]
*  I mean, it's safe. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10084.32s)]
*  It's trying to be, and the safety might be, [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10085.62s)]
*  create limitations. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10089.619999999999s)]
*  Let us consult the AI overlords. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10091.98s)]
*  Rust is a blazing fast memory efficient systems programming [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10095.34s)]
*  language that emphasizes performance, [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10097.98s)]
*  type safety and concurrency. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10099.98s)]
*  The language enforces memory safety [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10105.22s)]
*  without using a garbage collector, as you said, [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10106.82s)]
*  instead utilizing the unique quote borrow checker [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10109.26s)]
*  that tracks object lifetimes at compile time. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10112.3s)]
*  This prevents common programming errors, [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10116.26s)]
*  like null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks and so on. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10118.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10121.76s)]
*  So you've also spoken about meta programming. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10123.5s)]
*  Which of these languages do you like for the meta programming? [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10126.42s)]
*  I love meta programming in C++, but it's a giant mess. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10129.300000000001s)]
*  At least when I program C++, C++17, [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10132.74s)]
*  standard, it's just a mess, especially a mess to debug. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10135.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10140.22s)]
*  I would consider myself kind of a meta programming newbie. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10141.04s)]
*  I have only solved some amount of problems with it. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10143.8s)]
*  I love, that's kind of like what this year is for, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10146.359999999999s)]
*  is for me to really, I want to see where the ends can go [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10148.84s)]
*  in that so I don't have a strong opinion on this one. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10151.72s)]
*  Zig, one thing I really like about Zig is that [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10154.56s)]
*  the meta programming is also the language itself. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10157.199999999999s)]
*  So you don't have to, like, there's not an alternative. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10160.08s)]
*  So with Rust, there's an alternative. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10162.939999999999s)]
*  When you create a macro, you have to do the macro syntax. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10164.66s)]
*  With Zig, it's just, it is the thing. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10167.64s)]
*  You just program it and you add the word comp time [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10169.279999999999s)]
*  if you want it to be a compile time only. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10171.08s)]
*  So you can do like, you can create the list of prime numbers [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10173.2s)]
*  at compile time in Zig, which is kind of an interesting, [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10177.560000000001s)]
*  unique thing. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10180.820000000002s)]
*  So you have code that executes at compile time [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10181.66s)]
*  and then you can take advantage of the result of it [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10183.220000000001s)]
*  at runtime. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10185.320000000002s)]
*  So neat, right? [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10186.54s)]
*  Like that's how I'd look at it. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10188.2s)]
*  But again, I haven't used it to the point where I feel like [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10190.36s)]
*  I can super authoritatively talk about it. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10192.960000000001s)]
*  You have been undecided. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10195.76s)]
*  What language are you going for this year? [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10197.28s)]
*  I'm gonna keep Go as my mainstay. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10199.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10201.800000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna use Jai and Zig. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10202.64s)]
*  I'm going to explore and try to build out a service in them [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10204.199999999999s)]
*  that can do a bunch of talking to say, Chad Jippity [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10207.96s)]
*  and Eleven Labs and send stuff down to client [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10210.359999999999s)]
*  and work with WebSockets. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10212.8s)]
*  And I wanna make sure that, I just wanna see kind of [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10214.0s)]
*  how do they perform in this realm? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10216.92s)]
*  And you know, I may be using the language incorrectly, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10218.48s)]
*  like Jai, I'm not exactly, [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10220.279999999999s)]
*  it's not really been designed for the web world. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10221.4s)]
*  I just got done writing the ability to read Twitch chat [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10223.76s)]
*  and it required me to do Berkeley Sockets. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10227.24s)]
*  So if you're unfamiliar with Berkeley Sockets, [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10229.18s)]
*  it's like the old way of doing it, [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10231.16s)]
*  it's how you do it in C. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10232.76s)]
*  So you have to kind of go through the whole nine yards [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10233.88s)]
*  of creating your own connection. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10235.96s)]
*  I had to create my own connection. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10238.36s)]
*  I have to read from the socket [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10239.64s)]
*  and I have to parse out all the IRC, right? [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10241.16s)]
*  Like you have to kind of build it from scratch. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10242.84s)]
*  There's not like a new TCP connection to this server. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10244.52s)]
*  You have to be like, I'm creating a socket. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10247.4s)]
*  You're gonna be of the IPv4 family and TCP [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10248.88s)]
*  and you're gonna do, you know, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10252.32s)]
*  I'm gonna now have to take your address [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10253.84s)]
*  and go look up your address with DNS, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10255.36s)]
*  get that address back and then connect to a TCP. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10257.2s)]
*  So it's a lot more manual still. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10259.36s)]
*  It's a lot more raw in that area, but it's fun. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10262.12s)]
*  What are some epic projects you've built on a stream [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10263.6s)]
*  that jumped to memory? [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10266.560000000001s)]
*  My most favorite, sorry for interrupting you. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10268.6s)]
*  So I'm getting, I'm really jazzed right now. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10271.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10273.800000000001s)]
*  Okay, so jazzed. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10274.640000000001s)]
*  Jazz hands. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10275.76s)]
*  My most favorite project was the one I did last year. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10277.04s)]
*  There, someone built a Doom ASCII port [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10281.28s)]
*  so you could play Doom with ASCII. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10284.08s)]
*  So that means you could play it in your terminal. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10286.560000000001s)]
*  Very, very fun, very exciting. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10288.6s)]
*  So I made a Go program that could spawn out the Doom ASCII. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10290.64s)]
*  Then I took that Doom ASCII and I sent it to the browser [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10294.64s)]
*  so that people could play Doom ASCII in the browser. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10297.48s)]
*  But then I made it so that Twitch chat could control [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10300.359999999999s)]
*  that instance of Doom ASCII by piping in Twitch chat, [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10303.16s)]
*  taking the average of the movements over so much time [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10307.039999999999s)]
*  and replaying it as if it was a controller. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10309.279999999999s)]
*  And I had a Twitch chat beat level one by spamming it. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10311.76s)]
*  But the fun part was I used a bunch [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10315.76s)]
*  of fun encoding techniques. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10317.4s)]
*  I used like quad trees to be able to take smaller amounts, [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10318.6s)]
*  to use run length encoding, [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10321.48s)]
*  try to create my own compression algorithm. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10323.02s)]
*  Because if you're sending out a bunch of ASCII stuff, [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10325.42s)]
*  it's still pretty expensive [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10328.52s)]
*  because you have to represent color. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10329.48s)]
*  Color's not cheap. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10331.04s)]
*  On top of it, you have to represent [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10332.36s)]
*  what does it look like? [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10333.52s)]
*  What does the ASCII look like? [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10334.36s)]
*  Well, I realized there's all these fun techniques [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10335.800000000001s)]
*  you can do for compression. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10337.84s)]
*  Like the shape of the ASCII you send down [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10338.800000000001s)]
*  in a lot of these engines are actually just proportional [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10342.720000000001s)]
*  to the lumosity of that pixel. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10345.800000000001s)]
*  So like you'd use an eight to represent [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10347.92s)]
*  or a pound sign to represent like white, [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10350.16s)]
*  but black you're gonna wanna do like a period [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10352.4s)]
*  or a comma or a bar, something smaller. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10354.88s)]
*  So it's like, I then developed all these different [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10356.88s)]
*  compression algorithms that turn a bunch of data, [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10359.24s)]
*  which would take, I forget how much it would take. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10361.3s)]
*  It'd take gigabytes upon gigabytes [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10364.24s)]
*  to be able to send out to thousands of people [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10365.72s)]
*  to all see the same image at the same time, [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10367.36s)]
*  to all be able to interact with doom at the same time. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10369.04s)]
*  I turned it from gigabytes into kilobytes [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10371.24s)]
*  by just trying to figure out how to make it [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10374.14s)]
*  as small as possible and send it all out. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10375.76s)]
*  So it was super fun, absolutely had a great time. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10378.12s)]
*  So you're actually sending it to all the people in chat. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10380.28s)]
*  So where's that pipeline, how chat is able to control [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10383.0s)]
*  the doom thing? [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10388.720000000001s)]
*  Twitch chat. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10389.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so they would go, people would span W. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10390.6s)]
*  And if you said W, it would hold down W for 150 milliseconds [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10394.2s)]
*  if the majority of people during that time period said W. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10398.060000000001s)]
*  Nice, okay. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10401.52s)]
*  So how are they getting the input [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10402.720000000001s)]
*  of where you are on screen? [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10404.880000000001s)]
*  So originally I was gonna send that through Twitch, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10406.38s)]
*  but Twitch is like five seconds behind. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10408.98s)]
*  So that's why I piped it out to a website. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10410.939999999999s)]
*  So everybody could see from my computer to the website [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10413.74s)]
*  in typical lag was right around 70 milliseconds. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10416.58s)]
*  So it's like they could mostly see what was happening [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10420.14s)]
*  in that short period of time. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10422.839999999998s)]
*  It was pretty exciting. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10423.939999999999s)]
*  So we had a thousand people or I had somewhere [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10425.38s)]
*  between a thousand to 1400 people smashing Ws [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10427.9s)]
*  and pressing F to fire and turning [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10430.939999999999s)]
*  and we killed some zombies. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10432.779999999999s)]
*  We blew up the barrel at the very end of level one [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10434.54s)]
*  to kill the imp. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10436.42s)]
*  How are you getting the Ws from the Twitch chat? [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10437.26s)]
*  Is there an API? [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10440.1s)]
*  I was using IRC. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10441.660000000002s)]
*  So just a little TCP socket and then you just parse out IRC. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10442.62s)]
*  Okay, and there's very little lag there, okay. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10446.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a couple hundred milliseconds though. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10448.800000000001s)]
*  It's enough that it actually made it a little bit difficult [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10450.78s)]
*  because people would often overturn and then go forward [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10452.94s)]
*  and like miss the door and then they had to go back. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10455.460000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10459.300000000001s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10460.140000000001s)]
*  So that was my favorite, I think project of all time, [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10460.960000000001s)]
*  I never got to do like a lot of encoding. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10463.92s)]
*  Encoding is kind of like, what do you normally do? [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10466.36s)]
*  Okay, I need to send something down. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10469.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know, Gzip it. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10470.24s)]
*  Server will just do it. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10471.18s)]
*  Server just does the right thing. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10472.039999999999s)]
*  I don't need to think about it. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10473.119999999999s)]
*  So instead it's like, I think about it. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10474.0s)]
*  I'm gonna set the right thing. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10476.56s)]
*  Yeah, you have to think about the compression. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10477.56s)]
*  Yeah, and there you go. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10479.32s)]
*  That's some more love towards FFmpeg. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10480.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10482.76s)]
*  Because they have to think about that a lot. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10483.6s)]
*  Ultimately inspired by FFmpeg and their awesomeness. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10484.76s)]
*  So can you speak to just the chat community in general? [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10489.84s)]
*  A big part of what you do in terms of streaming [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10493.8s)]
*  is the humans that are communicating with you live. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10497.839999999998s)]
*  Can you talk to the different chat communities? [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10501.8s)]
*  First of all, which is the best chat community? [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10505.8s)]
*  YouTube, Twitch or X? [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10509.08s)]
*  This is where I feel bad for YouTube. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10511.119999999999s)]
*  Cause I do think it's technically the worst, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10513.439999999999s)]
*  but it's not YouTube's fault. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10515.96s)]
*  And let me kind of explain why. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10517.119999999999s)]
*  And then I will explain why you're wrong, but go ahead. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10519.24s)]
*  I know you love YouTube, but let me explain why. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10522.16s)]
*  Is that when you go on Twitch, you go to anyone's channel, [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10524.72s)]
*  they have this like cultural human centipede thing [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10530.16s)]
*  that's happening where as the memes flow in, [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10533.72s)]
*  all of Twitch kind of reacts and morphs to all those memes. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10536.92s)]
*  So every channel you go to has this like same culture. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10540.32s)]
*  Everyone, there's a lot of similar emotes and everything. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10543.199999999999s)]
*  So it's very tight knit. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10545.96s)]
*  So when I stream, I get all the same jokes [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10547.56s)]
*  that you would pretty much see if you saw, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10551.08s)]
*  I don't know, Soda Poppin or some big streamer, [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10552.72s)]
*  Asmongold, whoever, Pratata Software streaming, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10554.84s)]
*  all the same memes would all flow [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10558.039999999999s)]
*  through the exact same kind of pipe. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10559.84s)]
*  And so it's a very holistic kind of community. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10561.68s)]
*  So every time you're making jokes, [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10564.64s)]
*  you're making jokes that are like in the ether. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10565.96s)]
*  Twitter kind of has that too. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10568.56s)]
*  Tech Twitter kind of has like a set of jokes. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10569.88s)]
*  And so you can kind of see it. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10571.8s)]
*  The problem with Twitter chat [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10573.44s)]
*  is that there's just nobody there right now. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10574.76s)]
*  Typically like just put it into perspective. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10577.2s)]
*  I have somewhere between like 1500 to 3000 people on Twitch, [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10579.560000000001s)]
*  somewhere between 800 to 2000 on YouTube [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10587.48s)]
*  and like 50 people on Twitter. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10589.960000000001s)]
*  So it's like the difference is massive, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10592.24s)]
*  but Twitter has that same thing that's developing [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10594.720000000001s)]
*  where there's like memes [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10597.960000000001s)]
*  that are constantly flowing through it. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10598.84s)]
*  And so they're very highly connected. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10600.32s)]
*  YouTube just doesn't seem to have that. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10602.880000000001s)]
*  They're just a bunch of people [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10605.28s)]
*  and people go to YouTube for various reasons. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10606.4s)]
*  I'm going to YouTube to learn. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10608.32s)]
*  As they come in, they want to learn. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10609.8s)]
*  So they're not like on the meme train. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10611.32s)]
*  They're not in this like cultural zeitgeist train. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10613.52s)]
*  They're just like, but why would you use this if statement [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10615.48s)]
*  when a switch statement in this one particular case? [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10617.72s)]
*  And you're just like, well, that's not [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10619.44s)]
*  what I'm trying to do here. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10620.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're, you want to captain the meme train [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10622.32s)]
*  or you want to ride on the meme train. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10625.36s)]
*  Yeah, or you just want to be able to like [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10627.44s)]
*  create a culture on your chat. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10628.68s)]
*  Cause your chat's gonna be some variation [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10631.64s)]
*  of that kind of zeitgeist that's flowing through Twitch. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10633.0s)]
*  And it kind of is very contiguous between X and Twitch. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10636.240000000002s)]
*  It just feels really out of sync with YouTube. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10639.480000000001s)]
*  And then YouTube particularly does a bad job. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10641.400000000001s)]
*  And some people would argue a good job [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10644.240000000002s)]
*  because you can swim. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10646.04s)]
*  Swim being you can actually change what timestamp you're at. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10647.36s)]
*  So all of a sudden you'll be like, oh yeah, you know, I, [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10650.16s)]
*  you know, something about like driving to soccer [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10653.44s)]
*  in my minivan and then 20 minutes later [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10655.92s)]
*  you'll be talking about Zig. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10658.36s)]
*  And someone's like, I personally use whatever [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10659.68s)]
*  to drive to soccer. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10662.08s)]
*  And you're like, what are we talking about? [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10662.92s)]
*  So YouTube is a very disjointed chat as well. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10665.0s)]
*  Cause it depends on where they're at within the video. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10667.32s)]
*  Swim comes from Netflix by the way. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10669.76s)]
*  Called swim, swim. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10671.96s)]
*  The term. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10673.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's that we, people said swim. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10674.64s)]
*  Oh, so you're, you're okay. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10677.72s)]
*  Swimming through the. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10679.24s)]
*  Yeah, so you're not just making up the term. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10680.48s)]
*  Thank you, wow. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10682.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's probably made up [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10682.96s)]
*  and probably only 10 people said it at Netflix. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10683.779999999999s)]
*  And so no one's gonna know it. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10685.279999999999s)]
*  And they're gonna be like, yeah, right. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10686.119999999999s)]
*  That's all that happens on Netflix. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10687.4s)]
*  So guys, going back to projects, [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10690.279999999999s)]
*  what projects on stream or in general? [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10691.92s)]
*  No, you need to answer why YouTube chat's the best chat. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10694.64s)]
*  Well, you kind of convinced me. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10698.279999999999s)]
*  Okay, why YouTube is the best chat? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10699.32s)]
*  Well, I think I'm just a hater. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10703.539999999999s)]
*  That's basically what it boils down to. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10705.519999999999s)]
*  And I'm just talking shit. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10707.24s)]
*  And I'm probably just like from the outside shooting, [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10708.759999999998s)]
*  you know, shooting in because Twitch is such a fun culture, [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10711.64s)]
*  you know, of memes. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10716.46s)]
*  And so it's just fun to shoot from the outside [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10717.759999999998s)]
*  to like egg the house of Twitch. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10720.560000000001s)]
*  And then I just sit back on my lawn chair [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10724.960000000001s)]
*  and with the small YouTube community, just talking shit. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10727.160000000002s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10731.240000000002s)]
*  There's a real sort of sense of community [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10732.36s)]
*  that Twitch can form. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10735.0s)]
*  But I just like the openness of YouTube. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10736.84s)]
*  It's just better at opening to the world. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10738.84s)]
*  It's more accessible. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10742.800000000001s)]
*  It's easier to share. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10744.720000000001s)]
*  It's just a more established platform, that's all. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10746.960000000001s)]
*  Fully on that theme. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10748.880000000001s)]
*  For the open world. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10749.8s)]
*  Like I can send it to people [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10754.8s)]
*  that don't usually watch video game streaming [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10756.199999999999s)]
*  or that kind of stuff. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10758.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if you send a Twitch link, they're like, [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10759.359999999999s)]
*  I don't like video games. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10761.039999999999s)]
*  And you're like, oh, actually it's not video. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10761.96s)]
*  That talk happens every single time you mention Twitch [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10765.72s)]
*  because Twitch does have a perspective about it [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10767.92s)]
*  that YouTube does not. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10770.64s)]
*  I was just on Rogan's podcast and I think it came up. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10772.179999999998s)]
*  He asked something like, is Twitch still a thing? [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10777.98s)]
*  So that just gives you an example. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10781.78s)]
*  And then Jamie said, yeah, yeah, it's definitely still a thing. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10784.06s)]
*  It's still growing and so on. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10788.380000000001s)]
*  And so yeah, there's just a big slice of humans [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10790.18s)]
*  that don't dissipate in the Twitch sphere. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10793.66s)]
*  Yeah, I just like talking shit. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10798.18s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10799.460000000001s)]
*  That's a beautiful answer. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10800.5s)]
*  But it's cool that you sort of make it accessible [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10801.42s)]
*  on all these different platforms. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10805.300000000001s)]
*  And I have high hopes for X, but yeah, it's feature wise, [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10806.94s)]
*  it still has a lot of growing up to do. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10809.82s)]
*  And just like, why do people use X? [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10811.86s)]
*  You typically are going there [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10815.22s)]
*  for like a text-based interaction you wanna look through. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10816.14s)]
*  So I also think they just have like a user expectation [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10818.16s)]
*  change that needs to happen. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10821.9s)]
*  And that just takes a while. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10823.22s)]
*  That's gonna take a little bit before people get to it. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10824.86s)]
*  I think their idea of audio first is a great first step [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10826.86s)]
*  where people can kind of listen to it [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10829.66s)]
*  and have the phone away maybe. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10831.3s)]
*  There's a lot of changes that have to happen [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10833.539999999999s)]
*  before X can be successful, Matt. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10835.62s)]
*  I mean, X is this incredible comment section, [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10837.42s)]
*  just like Reddit, right? [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10840.12s)]
*  So it's like. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10841.220000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, you said incredible. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10842.380000000001s)]
*  That's not Reddit. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10843.820000000002s)]
*  Comment section, correct. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10845.460000000001s)]
*  Comment, yeah. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10846.7s)]
*  Incredibly dynamic and vibrant, even if it's... [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10847.86s)]
*  Yeah, what is the technological platform? [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10853.1s)]
*  Like how does the interface and the technology [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10858.1s)]
*  shape the discourse? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10862.5s)]
*  It's fascinating, [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10865.7s)]
*  because X has a different style than Reddit, [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10866.86s)]
*  different style than like Facebook, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10871.02s)]
*  different style than Instagram. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10872.86s)]
*  It's interesting. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10875.42s)]
*  And all those comment sections are different technologically. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10876.26s)]
*  Like how the sorting is done, [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10880.2s)]
*  how easy it is to sort of build a community around it. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10882.26s)]
*  Because YouTube is not really a community. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10887.94s)]
*  Every single video on YouTube has its own mini community. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10890.660000000002s)]
*  You're like all talking shit on just that one video. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10894.26s)]
*  But you're not, you can't jump across. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10897.060000000001s)]
*  There's no like, hey Bill, hey George. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10900.220000000001s)]
*  There's no crosstalk that happens in multiple videos. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10902.18s)]
*  Yeah, but community is awesome. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10904.740000000002s)]
*  I love community. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10907.5s)]
*  I love the feeling of community. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10908.34s)]
*  And I guess that's what Twitch really provides. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10909.58s)]
*  YouTube also does have it though. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10912.220000000001s)]
*  Like they have an aggregate community. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10913.58s)]
*  There's a lot of fun comments and all that on the videos [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10916.02s)]
*  and a lot of thumbs up. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10918.460000000001s)]
*  And then you see the fun discourse that happens. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10920.06s)]
*  And it's like, that's the community. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10921.98s)]
*  It's just only a certain slice sees it. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10923.94s)]
*  I think that's even more so on YouTube for live streaming. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10926.199999999999s)]
*  Though all the same folks show up and they talk shit. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10930.1s)]
*  They celebrate. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10933.46s)]
*  They all like the meme train arrives. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10934.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10936.619999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now what projects shape you as a programmer? [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10937.619999999999s)]
*  What are the ones you've streamed or offline? [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10941.94s)]
*  For me, I don't know if there's like a one project [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10947.539999999999s)]
*  I can point to, but I can point to a specific spot [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10949.3s)]
*  where I think it happens [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10952.74s)]
*  and where I think you can learn a lot from. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10953.939999999999s)]
*  Any small program you write will be somewhere [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10956.42s)]
*  between like a thousand to 5,000 lines of code. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10958.699999999999s)]
*  I consider like a pretty dang small project. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10960.519999999999s)]
*  You can kind of correlate this to any feature [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10963.22s)]
*  within a larger system as well. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10965.539999999999s)]
*  You know, a specific feature on a website [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10967.34s)]
*  could be a thousand lines, a couple thousand lines. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10969.22s)]
*  There's a point in which all of your choices add up. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10971.92s)]
*  And that's, I typically find that right around [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10974.98s)]
*  five to 10,000 lines of code. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10977.22s)]
*  The choices you've made either weigh you down [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10979.14s)]
*  or kind of free you up. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10981.18s)]
*  And so it's right in that that I feel like I learned the most [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10983.5s)]
*  is because I love getting to that point in a project [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10986.699999999999s)]
*  or in some small part of the code base, [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10989.359999999999s)]
*  because at that point I get a test A, [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10991.3s)]
*  how good were my initial gut decisions [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10993.24s)]
*  about how I designed software? [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10995.74s)]
*  But B, now I need to go back and think about like, [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10997.42s)]
*  how am I going to do testing across this [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10999.779999999999s)]
*  in a more effective way? [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11001.4s)]
*  How can I scale this out to 20,000 lines of code? [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11002.32s)]
*  How can I do all these things with what I've got [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11004.539999999999s)]
*  or do I need to kind of rethink it? [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11007.06s)]
*  And I find that that's really where the best learning happens [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11009.74s)]
*  is that everybody has probably a different number [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11012.34s)]
*  that exists. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11014.9s)]
*  And as you go to each one of these numbers [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11016.539999999999s)]
*  or how well or holistic you want your project to be, [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11018.42s)]
*  I think that you'll come up with different numbers. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11022.46s)]
*  And I think that number should just get bigger [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11024.34s)]
*  as you get more experienced. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11026.14s)]
*  Cause you know, there's like, [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11027.46s)]
*  there's projects that are a million lines of code, [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11028.5s)]
*  but they're most certainly not holistic, right? [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11030.5s)]
*  Like every part of the code base is some age [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11032.58s)]
*  at some capsule of time with some sort of programming style. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11034.96s)]
*  Some is more functional, more class-based, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11038.34s)]
*  more God help your soul if it's pre-processed or macros [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11040.62s)]
*  and C++, right? [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11044.16s)]
*  Like there's like all of these different kind of things [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11045.06s)]
*  you'll find throughout time. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11047.380000000001s)]
*  And so that's why I kind of try to think about it [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11048.7s)]
*  as like the feature or the thing you're working on. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11051.26s)]
*  It's usually about 5,000 lines is where I find [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11053.9s)]
*  that things get kind of, did I make good or bad decisions? [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11056.74s)]
*  And that's where I do all my learning is right on that phase. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11059.94s)]
*  I'm trying to get it to the point where I should be able [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11062.1s)]
*  to shoot from the hip and do 20,000 lines [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11063.58s)]
*  and not be upset about it. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11065.86s)]
*  So first of all, just enjoying the thing you create part. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11067.14s)]
*  Yeah, about there, you can sit back and see all the parts [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11070.26s)]
*  dancing together. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11075.34s)]
*  For me also, debugging, you get to see the choices [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11076.98s)]
*  you make materialize as like how easy it is to debug. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11081.699999999999s)]
*  Like I'm a big proponent. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11084.939999999999s)]
*  I think you've mentioned this in the past. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11086.699999999999s)]
*  I put asserts everywhere. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11088.939999999999s)]
*  No, you are the reason why I do that. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11091.68s)]
*  You're like the first one, keep on going, sorry. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11094.26s)]
*  Really? Okay. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11096.12s)]
*  So for me, one of the joys, whether it's try catch blocks, [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11098.960000000001s)]
*  whether it's assert, whether it's with the testing, [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11103.84s)]
*  I get to see the payoff of all the mine field of asserts [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11108.240000000002s)]
*  I've laid out before me in my kingdom [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11114.68s)]
*  by how quickly I can debug a system as it grows larger. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11117.44s)]
*  And I can, first of all, discover errors [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11120.800000000001s)]
*  before they become real bugs. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11124.640000000001s)]
*  And also how quickly I can solve those errors. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11126.76s)]
*  And that brings me joy. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11129.12s)]
*  For me, a lot of the joys of programming [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11131.26s)]
*  is creating powerful systems that don't break down, [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11133.08s)]
*  that work correctly. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11139.2s)]
*  They work correctly in majority of the cases. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11140.6s)]
*  And they're sort of the stress testing the system [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11142.92s)]
*  and getting all the signals from that system [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11146.78s)]
*  that everything is working correctly [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11149.960000000001s)]
*  is something that fills me with joy. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11151.84s)]
*  And makes sure that the system actually works. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11155.32s)]
*  So yeah, at that, I don't know if it's five, [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11157.24s)]
*  10,000 lines of code, if it's Java or C++, [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11159.359999999999s)]
*  it's millions lines of code, but yeah. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11162.56s)]
*  In Python, yeah, I would say 10,000 lines of code. [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11165.64s)]
*  That's when you first get to see the magic. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11168.359999999999s)]
*  But anyway, you were saying. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11170.76s)]
*  Okay, so you and John Carmack had a conversation [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11171.76s)]
*  about asserts. Yes. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11173.68s)]
*  You talked about this idea of putting asserts everywhere [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11174.8s)]
*  that effectively crash the program [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11177.16s)]
*  when you have some state in your program [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11179.6s)]
*  that should not be represented [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11183.32s)]
*  and you have made this choice actively. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11185.279999999999s)]
*  And so I've never done that before. [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11186.64s)]
*  And I know this is like an old technique [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11188.52s)]
*  and I obviously must be too young or too dumb [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11190.119999999999s)]
*  to know that this was a thing people did. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11192.72s)]
*  I grew up in Java and I think that's probably why [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11194.16s)]
*  I didn't run into this. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11196.44s)]
*  So I saw that and I was like, [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11198.119999999999s)]
*  I'm curious about how to use asserts more. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11199.52s)]
*  And then I ran into a person named Yoron. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11201.32s)]
*  He's the CEO and creator of Tiger Beetle. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11203.279999999999s)]
*  It's like the world's fastest, greatest financial database. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11205.52s)]
*  And it was spawned out of a company [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11209.72s)]
*  that needed to do a bunch of financial transactions [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11211.039999999999s)]
*  and it's written in Zig. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11212.96s)]
*  And what they do is they do deterministic simulation testing [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11214.039999999999s)]
*  and they just use NASA's kind of guarantee [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11217.839999999998s)]
*  for creating really great software. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11221.56s)]
*  So like, don't use you size, [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11223.0s)]
*  specify your exact size of into you expect everywhere. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11224.599999999999s)]
*  All these kinds of like things they do to be very specific. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11227.119999999999s)]
*  And one of them is that every function [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11230.64s)]
*  should contain two asserts, [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11232.279999999999s)]
*  whether it's positive space, like, you know, [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11235.08s)]
*  these things should happen or negative space. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11238.119999999999s)]
*  Like you should, this pointer should never be null. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11239.84s)]
*  You're programming into things that should never happen. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11243.08s)]
*  Normally you just never specify that. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11245.76s)]
*  You'd never think about that. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11247.2s)]
*  So every single function everywhere has all these asserts [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11248.56s)]
*  and these asserts run both in production and in testing. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11251.28s)]
*  They're always on. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11254.52s)]
*  And then they take deterministic simulation testing [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11255.76s)]
*  and run like 200 years of just random data, [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11260.32s)]
*  just complete slop going through the system [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11264.08s)]
*  and seeing how far it goes. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11265.960000000001s)]
*  And when an assert happens, [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11267.4s)]
*  they're like, here's the input that caused it. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11268.480000000001s)]
*  Here's every last little bit that happened. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11270.12s)]
*  And now you can identify where this went wrong. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11272.08s)]
*  And it was so cool. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11274.44s)]
*  So between you, John Carmack and your on, [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11275.76s)]
*  that's where I like, okay, I got a real, [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11278.480000000001s)]
*  and NASA, I'll throw NASA bone as well. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11280.12s)]
*  NASA can join in on that one. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11282.28s)]
*  I was like, okay, I want to try this. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11284.44s)]
*  And I did try it. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11286.0s)]
*  I built kind of like this big reverse proxy [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11286.84s)]
*  for me trying to do some game development stuff. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11288.880000000001s)]
*  And I just went ham on the asserts. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11291.08s)]
*  And then I built the whole simulation testing thing [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11294.08s)]
*  that could do everything deterministically. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11296.0s)]
*  So, even the result of requests [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11297.4s)]
*  would all come in specific orders. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11299.96s)]
*  And I found a bunch of bugs [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11301.199999999999s)]
*  that I just would never have found. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11302.6s)]
*  And then I did it for a game I was making. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11303.76s)]
*  I found some bugs where my cursor went off screen. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11305.0s)]
*  It would cause all these different problems [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11307.16s)]
*  because I just never tested them. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11308.44s)]
*  And it was super fun. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11310.039999999999s)]
*  And it's like a really great way to program. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11311.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a skillset you go over time. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11313.279999999999s)]
*  It's not just that you have to specify the preconditions, [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11315.84s)]
*  like everything that has to be true. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11319.039999999999s)]
*  It's also adding things that are like, [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11322.279999999999s)]
*  you might not even think about. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11326.199999999999s)]
*  You have to sort of anticipate really weird things. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11328.8s)]
*  And if you add asserts, [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11332.88s)]
*  especially in complicated functions [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11334.44s)]
*  or in complicated classes [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11335.96s)]
*  that are able to catch really weird things, [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11338.0s)]
*  that's going to save you so many headaches. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11343.119999999999s)]
*  And it's going to help you learn about your own code. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11345.72s)]
*  This is one of the things, [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11349.92s)]
*  I think it was Jonathan Blow [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11351.36s)]
*  that either in conversation with you [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11354.240000000002s)]
*  or was it in presentation, [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11357.36s)]
*  he said that when he's starting on a project, [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11360.28s)]
*  he usually doesn't know how to implement it, [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11362.76s)]
*  how it's going to work. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11369.480000000001s)]
*  And I think he was saying [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11371.800000000001s)]
*  that he wants a programming language. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11373.52s)]
*  This might've been a criticism of C++, I'm not sure. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11375.36s)]
*  Where he wants a programming language [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11378.480000000001s)]
*  that makes it as painless as possible for him [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11379.84s)]
*  to not know what he's doing, [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11384.76s)]
*  how he's going to implement it [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11385.6s)]
*  and to quickly get to a place where he figures it out. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11387.0s)]
*  I think there's a fundamental part of programming [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11390.8s)]
*  is building stuff while not really knowing [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11394.52s)]
*  what the next thing you're doing is. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11398.960000000001s)]
*  You kind of have a loose design, maybe a strict design, [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11402.0s)]
*  but really you're solving puzzles that are not, [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11404.88s)]
*  it is a dark room in a fundamental sense. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11407.52s)]
*  And there you have to anticipate [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11410.84s)]
*  the kind of weirdnesses that might emerge [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11412.68s)]
*  while not really knowing everything, [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11416.24s)]
*  just this full fog, fog of war. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11417.92s)]
*  And there, that's a real skill to anticipate [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11423.76s)]
*  the kind of issues that might arise [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11426.48s)]
*  and put asserts on top of them. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11429.08s)]
*  And it's also spiritually, for me, [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11430.84s)]
*  been a really nice way of programming, [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11435.48s)]
*  of building, of living life, [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11437.44s)]
*  is having very strict asserts that say, [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11438.72s)]
*  you're gonna fix this problem if it ever arises. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11445.279999999999s)]
*  You can't just look the other way. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11448.119999999999s)]
*  This idea of treating warnings as errors. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11449.56s)]
*  Make sure your code compiles without any warnings. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11452.679999999998s)]
*  That was a big leap for me. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11455.279999999999s)]
*  It's like, but there's so many of them. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11456.4s)]
*  And it's not really that important. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11458.96s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no warnings. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11461.119999999999s)]
*  Make sure you treat every single problem, [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11464.48s)]
*  even like fuzzy problems, seriously, [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11467.88s)]
*  because that's actually long-term, [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11470.439999999999s)]
*  is going to create code that's much easier to work with, [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11472.88s)]
*  much more fun to work with, much more robust, [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11476.439999999999s)]
*  resilient to all kinds of weirdnesses, [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11478.519999999999s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11480.24s)]
*  So it's a different way of approaching coding, [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11481.08s)]
*  probably more NASA-like versus like web programming style. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11483.96s)]
*  But yeah, it has made programming, [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11489.92s)]
*  for me personally, much more fun. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11492.599999999999s)]
*  Because one of the most painful things about programming [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11494.88s)]
*  is creating when you get past 10,000, 20,000 lines of code [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11498.4s)]
*  and you have to find a bug. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11502.8s)]
*  And that bug can take hours, it could take days to find. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11505.72s)]
*  And that's torture. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11509.8s)]
*  Yeah, when your system gets sufficiently large, [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11510.88s)]
*  some of these bugs are just, they're very difficult. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11512.88s)]
*  I, you know, bless anyone's soul [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11516.039999999999s)]
*  that's working on million line code bases, [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11518.08s)]
*  because it does. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11520.08s)]
*  It just, I can't tell you how many times [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11520.92s)]
*  I've spent multiple days just trying to figure out [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11522.199999999999s)]
*  the root cause of the bug. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11524.76s)]
*  Not even the fix, just like, why does this happen? [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11525.76s)]
*  And that's hard. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11528.960000000001s)]
*  So I love it. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11529.800000000001s)]
*  I just love the asserts, because I'm not good at them. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11530.64s)]
*  I can see it's definitely a skill that I don't, [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11533.44s)]
*  I don't put into practice constantly, [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11535.880000000001s)]
*  which means it's just not like a muscle memory type thing. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11537.68s)]
*  And so it's just one of those things I just love. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11540.32s)]
*  It's just, it's such a fascinating way [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11542.800000000001s)]
*  to approach a problem. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11544.68s)]
*  Cause I would have never thought, [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11546.36s)]
*  you know what I'm gonna do? [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11547.52s)]
*  If I'm wrong, I'm gonna crash this thing. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11548.72s)]
*  I'm gonna crash it right here, [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11550.68s)]
*  because I should never be wrong. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11551.880000000001s)]
*  But instead you're like, [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11553.72s)]
*  actually that makes perfect sense. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11554.68s)]
*  I should crash this thing. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11556.039999999999s)]
*  I've done something terribly wrong here. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11557.16s)]
*  Why would this ever exist? [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11558.56s)]
*  And then you're like, [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11560.16s)]
*  this is gonna solve a whole class of problems. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11561.0s)]
*  Yeah, and especially if it's in productions, [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11562.72s)]
*  like, well, the user is gonna see this crash. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11564.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, well, you should minimize [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11567.359999999999s)]
*  the number of times any user ever sees the crash. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11569.88s)]
*  Not by like having a nice blue screen or whatever the fuck, [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11573.48s)]
*  but like actually stopping everything. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11577.76s)]
*  And that's going to be, [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11580.8s)]
*  that's gonna create an incentive for you [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11582.96s)]
*  to never have that happen. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11584.56s)]
*  You're actually going to put in the time [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11586.48s)]
*  to make sure it never happens. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11588.039999999999s)]
*  And the nice part is like with the web and all that, [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11589.759999999998s)]
*  you can always pop up something and say, [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11591.64s)]
*  hey, things have gone very, very wrong. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11593.48s)]
*  We're unable to recover. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11595.24s)]
*  You can like give them a nice message [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11596.16s)]
*  and then log it off so you can see it [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11597.359999999999s)]
*  and then measure how often are you doing it. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11599.08s)]
*  You know, I understand that there's a bit of [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11601.56s)]
*  interestingness to a web project. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11603.4s)]
*  Like, do you want to always crash a server? [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11605.96s)]
*  There's a bit of a gamble if you release a bad version [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11609.919999999998s)]
*  and you crash all your servers constantly, you know, [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11612.04s)]
*  like that's a pain you're gonna have to accept. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11613.720000000001s)]
*  I think this is more applicable for single systems [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11616.240000000002s)]
*  like robots and so on. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11619.480000000001s)]
*  You have struggled with ADHD. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11621.640000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people are really inspired by the fact [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11625.240000000002s)]
*  that you're able to be productive and flourish [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11628.52s)]
*  while having ADHD. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11633.720000000001s)]
*  How'd you overcome it? [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11635.28s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of things that ADHD affects. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11637.04s)]
*  And so, [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11639.88s)]
*  I'll start with some of the easiest things [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11643.4s)]
*  because there's like directly applicable [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11645.56s)]
*  than like these kind of collateral damage applicable [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11646.88s)]
*  things that happen. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11648.839999999998s)]
*  So one thing that has really helped me with ADHD is maturity. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11650.039999999999s)]
*  I think that's just like, [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11655.279999999999s)]
*  just a thing that everyone needs more of, [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11656.359999999999s)]
*  meaning that I found myself getting so wiggly [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11659.119999999999s)]
*  and so out of control when I would try to sit down and read [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11662.24s)]
*  and I just couldn't handle it. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11665.08s)]
*  I just felt like I'd read a page and didn't read anything. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11666.48s)]
*  And the part of me that just went, [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11670.2s)]
*  oh my gosh, I just can't even do this. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11671.04s)]
*  I had to just simply quit listening to it and said, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11672.84s)]
*  no, I'm rereading this page. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11674.84s)]
*  I remember reading some pages in college [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11676.24s)]
*  like 18 times in a row, [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11678.640000000001s)]
*  just like I'm going to force myself [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11680.44s)]
*  to just do this the correct way. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11682.0s)]
*  And so there's an aspect of maturity that really helps. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11683.4s)]
*  No matter what, I will do the thing I'm going to do [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11686.4s)]
*  and I'm going to do it well. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11689.0s)]
*  And maybe it takes me a lot longer and that's okay. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11690.36s)]
*  That's not the point of it. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11693.720000000001s)]
*  It's that I'm doing it and that's the point. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11694.76s)]
*  And so that's kind of like one thing [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11696.68s)]
*  I think just generally helps in ADHD, no ADHD, [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11697.84s)]
*  the resilience, emotional resilience, [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11702.36s)]
*  is just like a really important aspect that just helps. [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11705.04s)]
*  And so I think that has been a large part [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11707.960000000001s)]
*  that really helps me. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11709.6s)]
*  There's things that I still obviously struggle with. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11711.12s)]
*  Like it's clear where I'm really bad at stuff [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11713.880000000001s)]
*  and just trying to like think through [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11718.32s)]
*  all the different things that I'm bad at. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11724.72s)]
*  There's more things I'm bad at than I'm good at. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11727.72s)]
*  And so programming obviously has something [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11729.359999999999s)]
*  that just allows me to remain focused [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11731.32s)]
*  and it's like a strength of mine. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11733.439999999999s)]
*  And so I started off where I could just do it [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11735.039999999999s)]
*  for a little bit. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11737.599999999999s)]
*  And then just through kind of that emotional resilience, [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11738.439999999999s)]
*  I was able to start doing it more and more. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11740.48s)]
*  And so now I can just do it for like 10, 12, [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11741.76s)]
*  15 hours at a time. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11744.039999999999s)]
*  And I absolutely love it. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11746.0s)]
*  And so it's become kind of like a joy. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11747.0s)]
*  It's like playing a musical instrument. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11749.08s)]
*  I'm really into it. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11750.359999999999s)]
*  But then if it came down to, [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11751.519999999999s)]
*  hey, you need to go schedule your own dentistry [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11754.48s)]
*  and go do all of these other things [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11758.28s)]
*  or make sure the kids have this type of stuff ready for, [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11759.12s)]
*  the meals in the pack throughout the week. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11762.560000000001s)]
*  I'm historically very bad at that [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11764.6s)]
*  and will probably continue to be very bad at that. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11768.36s)]
*  And so I must say that one of the reasons why I excel [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11770.640000000001s)]
*  so much is because I also have a wife who is so good to me [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11774.720000000001s)]
*  and she helps clear out a lot of the things in my life [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11778.92s)]
*  that cause a lot of like me kind of getting snowballed [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11781.720000000001s)]
*  into a weird spot where I'm just like distracted [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11785.4s)]
*  getting nothing done. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11787.76s)]
*  And so she's really helped me. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11788.88s)]
*  So it'd be foolish of me to claim [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11790.119999999999s)]
*  that I've defeated ADHD by myself. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11791.56s)]
*  But instead I find that the places [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11794.08s)]
*  that I can really control, I've done a very good job at. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11797.64s)]
*  And the things that I obviously need to do much better at, [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11800.279999999999s)]
*  my wife has helped me a whole bunch. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11802.84s)]
*  And so I've kind of cheated. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11804.52s)]
*  Maybe I found a cheat code, a loving wife, [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11805.88s)]
*  but that has been the thing that has really helped. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11808.0s)]
*  You said a lot of interesting things. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11810.8s)]
*  So on the reading and for me it's also audiobook side, [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11812.28s)]
*  I do the same thing and I've gotten much better at it, [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11816.04s)]
*  which is like, I tune out mentally [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11819.6s)]
*  and I'll read a page [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11822.76s)]
*  and you don't understand anything on the page. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11825.800000000001s)]
*  You didn't actually read it. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11828.720000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I forced myself to just reread it [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11830.2s)]
*  or re-listen to it in the audio book, [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11833.960000000001s)]
*  which is much more common problem for me now [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11835.560000000001s)]
*  and forcing myself to really pay attention. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11838.76s)]
*  Because I listen to audio books often when I run [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11841.44s)]
*  and it's so easy to just tune out. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11843.68s)]
*  It's a skill. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11846.24s)]
*  I didn't realize how much of a skill [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11847.24s)]
*  listening to an audio book is, [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11848.560000000001s)]
*  especially when there's other sensory inputs, [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11850.6s)]
*  like when you run. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11853.24s)]
*  So I have to force myself to really pay attention [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11854.52s)]
*  to every single word. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11857.84s)]
*  And if I don't tune out and don't remember [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11858.92s)]
*  what I just listened to in the past 30 seconds, [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11862.12s)]
*  I forced myself to re-listen to it. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11864.28s)]
*  And sometimes that means like five times [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11866.640000000001s)]
*  until I like, it's like punishing myself to like, [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11869.6s)]
*  you're gonna listen to this boring shit over and over [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11871.76s)]
*  until you get good at that little skill of like, [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11873.519999999999s)]
*  zoom in and you're like, yeah, there's people, [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11877.88s)]
*  they're like doing stuff, there's nature, [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11881.08s)]
*  doesn't matter, you're listening to every single word [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11883.119999999999s)]
*  and loading it in and trying to stay focused. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11885.359999999999s)]
*  Even there's just so many distractions all around you. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11888.24s)]
*  It's definitely a learned skill and it takes a lot of time. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11890.88s)]
*  And when I say, oh, I was able to do from here to here, [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11893.359999999999s)]
*  I'm speaking over the course of like five years [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11896.279999999999s)]
*  of doing this every day. [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11898.12s)]
*  Like it's not some small, there's no, [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11899.640000000001s)]
*  you could, the nice part about that decision though [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11901.720000000001s)]
*  is you can make that decision today. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11904.480000000001s)]
*  You can make it right now. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11907.320000000002s)]
*  You're gonna be like from here on out, [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11908.160000000002s)]
*  I'll never make that mistake again. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11909.04s)]
*  I will say I'm gonna read 50 pages, [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11910.52s)]
*  I will sit down and read 50 pages. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11912.640000000001s)]
*  And when I get distracted, [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11914.08s)]
*  I'll go back to the last place I remember [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11915.08s)]
*  and I'll start again. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11916.560000000001s)]
*  And like, that's a decision you can make. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11917.52s)]
*  That's a mature, non-emotional decision to make. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11919.0s)]
*  And you can do that. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11922.44s)]
*  It just may be really painful [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11923.44s)]
*  for the first couple years of making said decisions. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11925.92s)]
*  And then it gets easier and then it gets easier. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11928.44s)]
*  And then it just, it becomes more natural [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11930.44s)]
*  to change yourself. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11932.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11933.68s)]
*  And with every media, with every platform, [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11934.52s)]
*  I think it's like a new skill. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11937.36s)]
*  For me, like using social media has been that. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11940.0s)]
*  Just like I ended up doing doom scrolling [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11942.76s)]
*  too easily on platforms. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11945.44s)]
*  So, and one solution is not to look at all, [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11947.88s)]
*  which is kind of what I lean on mostly these days. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11951.72s)]
*  But I feel like I should be able to check, [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11954.48s)]
*  just read, okay, feel a thing, learn a thing, [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11956.52s)]
*  and then put it down. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11960.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11961.6s)]
*  Versus like, this glazed look over your eye [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11962.439999999999s)]
*  and you're not really paying attention anymore [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11966.16s)]
*  and you're dead inside and you feel horrible afterwards. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11968.039999999999s)]
*  I don't understand. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11970.76s)]
*  The horrible afterwards is real serious. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11973.119999999999s)]
*  I've definitely, I can 100% notice [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11974.84s)]
*  that I am a more anxious person [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11977.92s)]
*  the more time I spend scrolling. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11979.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11981.279999999999s)]
*  I can just feel it. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11982.76s)]
*  It's like something inside of me that's kind of, [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11983.6s)]
*  I don't know how to say it other than it wants to get out, [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11985.720000000001s)]
*  but I don't really know what that is. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11987.56s)]
*  It's not anger, but it's not, it's very anxious. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11988.68s)]
*  It's like the opposite of the feeling I have [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11992.720000000001s)]
*  when I wake up in the morning and I'm feeling good [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11995.0s)]
*  and I look out in nature and look at the sun [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11996.720000000001s)]
*  and just, and it's like a bird chirping [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12000.68s)]
*  and this kind of thing. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12004.0s)]
*  Scrolling through social media, [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12005.720000000001s)]
*  even if it's like super positive stuff or whatever, [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12007.28s)]
*  it's still not the same feeling as the bird chirping. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12009.720000000001s)]
*  Bird chirping on Instagram [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12012.24s)]
*  is a different bird chirping than real life. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12014.0s)]
*  Cause bird chirping on Instagram, [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12016.8s)]
*  I'll start swiping until there's demons [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12017.96s)]
*  of different types fighting inside my head. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12021.199999999999s)]
*  And then I, yeah, different anxiety, insecurity, [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12023.4s)]
*  whatever the hell, just the mixture of chaos [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12027.36s)]
*  versus the bird chirping in real life. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12031.28s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12033.72s)]
*  But again, that's the same thing as with the audio book. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12034.76s)]
*  It boils down to like, man, [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12037.119999999999s)]
*  these people that talk about meditation, [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12039.52s)]
*  I think that's probably, they're onto something. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12041.04s)]
*  Cause like that's what it is, [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12043.480000000001s)]
*  is be able to like focus calmly and deliberately on a thing, [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12045.400000000001s)]
*  whether it's reading or audio book or existence. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12051.960000000001s)]
*  When they have sort of observed the breath, [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12058.04s)]
*  you're able to silent out everything else [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12059.84s)]
*  and remove everything else from focus. [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12063.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's a skill. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12064.560000000001s)]
*  I heard it put really beautifully, [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12065.880000000001s)]
*  which is that we in America really have misunderstood [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12067.240000000002s)]
*  because we typically have liberty [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12071.8s)]
*  as just the freedom to do whatever you want. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12073.0s)]
*  And the argument was that it's not the freedom [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12075.04s)]
*  to do whatever you want. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12076.8s)]
*  It's the freedom to be able to do what you will. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12078.08s)]
*  And how often is what you actually want to do, [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12080.88s)]
*  you don't do cause you get trapped doing something [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12084.08s)]
*  that you've convinced yourself [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12086.24s)]
*  in this quick moment you want to do. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12087.32s)]
*  And so it's like, I want liberty. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12089.2s)]
*  I want the ability to control my energy [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12090.76s)]
*  and to be able to like do the thing I want to do, [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12093.76s)]
*  not to get distracted and destroyed [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12096.6s)]
*  in all the millions of distractions. [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12098.48s)]
*  And some of us get handed a worse deck of cards. [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12101.48s)]
*  Some of us get a better deck of cards, [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12103.24s)]
*  but I don't think there's anybody that doesn't struggle [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12104.56s)]
*  with it in the technological age. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12106.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the skill. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12108.08s)]
*  What can you say to the skill [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12109.519999999999s)]
*  of achieving focus in programming? [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12112.24s)]
*  Like do you have a process of how you sit down [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12114.16s)]
*  and try to sort of approach a problem? [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12118.519999999999s)]
*  So all the different, not just distractions, [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12120.68s)]
*  but the challenges of starting a project, [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12124.279999999999s)]
*  of thinking through like the design, [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12127.599999999999s)]
*  how to maintain like real focus [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12129.52s)]
*  cause it's really difficult intellectual endeavor. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12131.44s)]
*  I guess at this point I'm lucky, [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12134.84s)]
*  but when I first started, [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12137.12s)]
*  I can remember that every last part of programming, [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12138.6s)]
*  I had to go look up, I had to go read. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12142.960000000001s)]
*  I had side quests at all time. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12144.640000000001s)]
*  Like every step was a side quest. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12147.0s)]
*  Why is my screen blinking [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12148.84s)]
*  when I'm trying to render this thing out? [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12150.04s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know about double buffering. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12151.16s)]
*  Why is this happening? [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12152.560000000001s)]
*  How do I even write to the screen? [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12153.48s)]
*  How do you know like everything was a question? [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12154.800000000001s)]
*  I had more questions than answers. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12156.92s)]
*  And so I constantly had this, [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12158.96s)]
*  like the problem of side quests. [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12160.16s)]
*  And I find that to be a very exhausting thing. [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12161.759999999998s)]
*  But as I learned my instrument very, very well, [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12164.039999999999s)]
*  I don't have as many side quests. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12167.679999999998s)]
*  I become more and more able to just focus [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12169.84s)]
*  on the thing I want to do. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12172.08s)]
*  And I find that to be something [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12173.84s)]
*  that is just super, super useful. [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12175.64s)]
*  So when I say I'm kind of lucky, [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12177.56s)]
*  meaning that I've spent so much of my life [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12179.08s)]
*  preparing for this moment, [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12182.16s)]
*  that now when I have the opportunity to do something, [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12184.0s)]
*  I can just do that thing and I don't, [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12186.48s)]
*  like I can be just on an airplane [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12188.12s)]
*  and I can just program for hours. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12189.400000000001s)]
*  I don't have to look up a single thing. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12190.480000000001s)]
*  I don't have to do anything. [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12191.68s)]
*  I don't even have to test the code. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12192.52s)]
*  I can write a thousand lines of code on an airplane. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12193.76s)]
*  And I'm very confident that it's going to be 98% [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12196.560000000001s)]
*  and pretty dang good. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12198.960000000001s)]
*  And I'm very happy about that [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12200.04s)]
*  because that allows me just to be in the moment [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12201.160000000002s)]
*  solving the problem I'm trying to solve. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12203.68s)]
*  Then I have 100% of my brain power solving a problem. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12205.68s)]
*  And this is why I also, [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12209.960000000001s)]
*  it's the same reason why I recommend learning how to type [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12210.800000000001s)]
*  and learning your editor so well, [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12212.84s)]
*  you don't even have to think about the action [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12214.2s)]
*  because the people that have to, [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12215.800000000001s)]
*  even if you just look down, [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12217.44s)]
*  that's still mental processing power. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12219.16s)]
*  You have to spend looking at a keyboard [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12221.16s)]
*  in which you already know where the key is. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12223.12s)]
*  Like you do, at this point, [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12225.04s)]
*  if you've been typing for thousands of hours, [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12226.4s)]
*  you know where the key is, [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12228.32s)]
*  just stop looking down, you'll learn really quickly. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12229.36s)]
*  And so it's like this thing where it's like, [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12231.36s)]
*  I'm not going to spend all that time [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12233.16s)]
*  and all that mental effort, [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12235.24s)]
*  like looking up the thing, [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12237.36s)]
*  I'm going to just memorize, [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12239.0s)]
*  I'm just going to get it in me and then I can go fast. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12240.2s)]
*  And it feels good. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12243.480000000001s)]
*  And so that's how I'd kind of defeat that [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12245.640000000001s)]
*  because now I get to do something where it's like, [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12246.96s)]
*  there's no more questions. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12249.0s)]
*  It's now me just expressing myself into this medium. [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12250.4s)]
*  And it feels really good. [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12254.119999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there's still like things that pull at you, [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12255.32s)]
*  like curiosities, distractions, [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12257.72s)]
*  like, ooh, I wonder how, you know, [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12259.759999999998s)]
*  anytime I guess you have access to the internet, [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12263.4s)]
*  you're going to like get- [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12265.199999999999s)]
*  Twitter's a big one on that one, yeah. [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12266.679999999998s)]
*  You're going to get curious about stuff, [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12268.0s)]
*  including, I guess you're talking, [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12270.359999999999s)]
*  speaking about everything in the editor is optimized, [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12272.039999999999s)]
*  but you're okay, you can always improve stuff. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12274.519999999999s)]
*  You can always find better sort of plugins and macros. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12276.44s)]
*  And, oh, let me, you know what? [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12279.28s)]
*  This thing that took this pain point I just found, [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12281.04s)]
*  this tiny pain point, [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12285.0s)]
*  let me spend the next five days creating a plugin [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12286.2s)]
*  for my editor or whatever the fuck [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12289.6s)]
*  to remove that one pain point [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12292.32s)]
*  when you should have just kept going [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12294.720000000001s)]
*  as opposed to taking the side quest. [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12297.24s)]
*  So I have a rule, [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12298.960000000001s)]
*  which is I do not edit my RC [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12300.4s)]
*  other than some kind of cataclysmic thing, [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12303.68s)]
*  like someone updates a plugin, [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12305.36s)]
*  I didn't know they updated it, [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12306.400000000001s)]
*  now there's like a hard error in my editor [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12307.24s)]
*  and I have to like move forward. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12308.640000000001s)]
*  But I have a rule where I will edit my RC, [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12311.44s)]
*  my Neo Vim RC or anything, once a year. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12314.480000000001s)]
*  Something that bothers me, I will write it down. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12317.640000000001s)]
*  I'll remember it. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12320.92s)]
*  I'll be like, okay, I want to change that, [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12321.76s)]
*  but I will just not go back to it. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12323.04s)]
*  Now every now and then I'll break that rule [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12324.880000000001s)]
*  if I know it's like, oh, I want a new remapped [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12326.560000000001s)]
*  to be able to do this one command, [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12328.6s)]
*  and that takes like literally 13 seconds, [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12329.92s)]
*  like copy paste, do this, bop, bop, bop, done. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12331.68s)]
*  Okay, I have this new remap, it made perfect sense, [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12333.6s)]
*  in this situation, but I don't go plug and exploring, [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12335.32s)]
*  I don't try to solve every problem, [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12337.8s)]
*  I don't want a perfect editor, [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12339.4s)]
*  because that is a pursuit that will never stop. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12341.039999999999s)]
*  I just go, this is good, good break point, [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12344.0s)]
*  I won't do it again. [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12346.86s)]
*  So I spent, last month I probably spent 100 hours, [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12347.699999999999s)]
*  just like editing every possible thing I could [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12351.539999999999s)]
*  about how I start up my system. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12353.76s)]
*  And I can have a computer from zero to 60 [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12356.8s)]
*  in almost no time now, everything the way I exactly want it, [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12359.84s)]
*  NeoVim, everything all perfectly set up, happy enough. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12363.12s)]
*  I'm not gonna touch that system again, [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12366.0s)]
*  maybe I'll touch it next year, maybe I'll take a year off. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12367.76s)]
*  You know, it's just, I'm fine with that, [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12369.92s)]
*  I'm fine with not being perfect. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12371.68s)]
*  All right, zero to 60, let's talk about the perfect setup. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12373.44s)]
*  What's your perfect programming setup? [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12378.240000000002s)]
*  Keyboard, operating system, how many screens, chair. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12380.720000000001s)]
*  All right, I like all these. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12384.52s)]
*  I-D-E, let's go. [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12387.480000000001s)]
*  So keyboard, you're using my favorite keyboard, [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12389.160000000002s)]
*  right there, the Kinesis Advantage, save my career, [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12391.16s)]
*  beautiful keyboard, [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12394.84s)]
*  concavity and thumb clusters are just so important. [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12396.36s)]
*  Cause if you really think about it, [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12399.039999999999s)]
*  especially if you're using QWERTY, [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12400.76s)]
*  when you're pressing the symbols, like on a standard keyboard, [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12402.36s)]
*  you're just doing this the whole time, backspace, enter, [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12405.08s)]
*  symbols, like you're just doing this [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12407.76s)]
*  and it just screws up your wrist constantly doing this. [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12409.039999999999s)]
*  And this one, you're constantly doing like control and shift [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12411.119999999999s)]
*  and it's just as like messing you up. [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12413.48s)]
*  So it's just like right here, that's so much nicer in life. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12414.88s)]
*  So keyboard, most important, I'd say, get that one done. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12417.92s)]
*  For people who don't know, Kinesis keyboard, [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12421.72s)]
*  I think the thing that you experience the most [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12424.6s)]
*  is exactly the thing you just said now, [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12427.4s)]
*  which is the backspace is really easy to press [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12429.52s)]
*  versus what it is on normal keyboards. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12432.960000000001s)]
*  So backspace in general symbolizes, [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12435.24s)]
*  like you're deleting a thing, it symbolizes a mistake. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12438.12s)]
*  Not symbolizes, it usually means a mistake. [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12442.48s)]
*  And so not only did you just make a mistake [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12445.32s)]
*  in what you were typing, [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12449.039999999999s)]
*  you also have to take a physically painful action, [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12449.88s)]
*  annoying action to fix that mistake. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12452.44s)]
*  And for most of us, we make a lot of mistakes. [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12456.64s)]
*  So Kinesis just makes it pleasant and fast and easy, [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12458.36s)]
*  physically, to correct a mistake. [[03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12463.16s)]
*  And that's probably for me the number one reason of Kinesis. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12465.6s)]
*  Everything else, yeah, super plus with the macros [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12468.64s)]
*  and the position and the concavity, like you mentioned, [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12471.32s)]
*  but their mistakes are pleasant. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12473.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm on that team. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12477.880000000001s)]
*  That's why I love that. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12479.320000000002s)]
*  So I would say that's one of the most important things. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12480.76s)]
*  The next thing that I find to be very, very important [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12483.560000000001s)]
*  is that one monitor. [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12485.76s)]
*  I'm a one monitor kind of guy. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12487.800000000001s)]
*  What, really? [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12489.12s)]
*  So when I program, when I do anything, [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12490.04s)]
*  now when I stream, I obviously have a second computer [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12491.880000000001s)]
*  that runs the stream, [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12493.800000000001s)]
*  because I sometimes crash my computer [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12494.640000000001s)]
*  at the restart or whatever. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12496.16s)]
*  So I do have a second screen there that I put stuff up, [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12497.16s)]
*  but most of the time you'll notice that [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12499.720000000001s)]
*  even when I'm streaming, you've been there, [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12500.88s)]
*  I have to physically switch to the streaming channel [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12503.519999999999s)]
*  for me to read it. [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12507.32s)]
*  And that's because I'm operating off of one screen. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12508.16s)]
*  And so I have this whole style in which I like to navigate, [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12510.48s)]
*  inspired by StarCraft, [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12516.039999999999s)]
*  is that I believe in the press one key, [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12517.359999999999s)]
*  go where you want to be mentality. [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12519.16s)]
*  And so everything about my setup is press one key. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12521.72s)]
*  So when I wanna go to Twitch chat, alt two, Twitch chat. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12524.56s)]
*  When I wanna go to my browser, alt one, that's my browser. [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12528.279999999999s)]
*  Alt three, that's where I go to my programming. [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12531.64s)]
*  That's power finger, obviously. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12533.359999999999s)]
*  A big middle finger right there, just smash it down. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12535.0s)]
*  Alt six is gonna be GIMP. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12537.48s)]
*  So my GNU image manipulation program. [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12539.16s)]
*  So if I want to draw, I go there. [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12541.64s)]
*  When I used to have Slack, it was alt five. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12543.4s)]
*  If I have a spare terminal where I need to run [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12545.439999999999s)]
*  some extra things, that's alt four. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12547.4s)]
*  I had all these kind of, [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12549.119999999999s)]
*  everything is perfectly mapped out to single key. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12550.599999999999s)]
*  And then when it comes down to using say, TMUX, [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12553.16s)]
*  I have all my terminals into one single terminal. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12556.0s)]
*  So I'm able to kind of switch between there. [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12559.12s)]
*  Prefix one goes to my VIM editor, whatever project I'm in. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12561.44s)]
*  It's always the first TMUX tab, if you will. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12564.68s)]
*  I'm not sure, they call it a session, [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12567.880000000001s)]
*  but I'm not sure how to describe it [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12569.12s)]
*  if you're not familiar with TMUX, a tab. [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12570.68s)]
*  Second one is like my spare terminal. [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12573.08s)]
*  Third one is my long running process terminal. [[03:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12575.480000000001s)]
*  My fourth one is a long running process terminal. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12577.480000000001s)]
*  So I have it all set up. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12579.2s)]
*  So every project I go to automatically spawns session one, [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12580.04s)]
*  VIM, session two, spare terminal, [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12583.36s)]
*  session three will also open it. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12585.240000000002s)]
*  So it's like, everything's just ready to rock. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12587.08s)]
*  Everything has been optimized to where I do that. [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12589.48s)]
*  If I wanna go to a project, [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12591.44s)]
*  it's control F and any terminal will bring up [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12593.0s)]
*  a fuzzy find list of every one of my folders [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12595.52s)]
*  on my operating system in which I can go to [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12598.24s)]
*  with just a couple keystrokes and boom, I'm in that one now. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12599.96s)]
*  And so it's like very oriented to find [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12602.96s)]
*  where I need to be as quickly as possible. [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12605.16s)]
*  Via keyboard. [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12606.76s)]
*  Via keyboard. [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12607.58s)]
*  Then in VIM, I developed a plugin called Harpoon, [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12608.56s)]
*  which is I press one button and I can pin one of the files [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12611.16s)]
*  to like a temporary buffer. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12616.0s)]
*  I think projectile is potentially close to this in Emacs. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12617.68s)]
*  I can't remember projectile. [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12621.8s)]
*  I think projectile is closer to my sessionizing script. [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12622.92s)]
*  Anyways, so now I have four pinned files [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12626.32s)]
*  in which I can go to any of those pinned files [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12630.4s)]
*  with just a single keystroke. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12632.26s)]
*  And so now it's just like, [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12633.96s)]
*  because every time you develop a feature, [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12635.48s)]
*  usually you have like three files [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12636.88s)]
*  you're kind of primarily working in [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12638.08s)]
*  and I can fuzzy find for the other files and that's that. [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12639.64s)]
*  But usually I just have like these three power files [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12642.8s)]
*  that I'm always swapping in between. [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12645.06s)]
*  And so it's like, now everything is just, [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12646.42s)]
*  I wanna go to the browser, that's one press. [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12648.619999999999s)]
*  I wanna go to my workstation, that's one press. [[03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12650.22s)]
*  I wanna go to a specific folder. [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12651.74s)]
*  I need to change folders. [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12653.18s)]
*  Sometimes you work between two different projects. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12654.66s)]
*  So in TMUX, that's prefix capital L [[03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12657.74s)]
*  will swap between your last two. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12660.74s)]
*  So I have alternate projects. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12662.539999999999s)]
*  I can even swap between projects in pretty much one key. [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12663.619999999999s)]
*  So it's just like, do, do, do, just trying to optimize it [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12666.5s)]
*  so I don't think as much. [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12669.1s)]
*  Cause I think search fatigue is a massive fail [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12670.3s)]
*  where you have to look for it. [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12673.9s)]
*  Like when I see people on a Mac do this [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12674.82s)]
*  and then explode all the different ones, [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12677.86s)]
*  that gives me anxiety. [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12680.06s)]
*  I'm like, why are you using your eyeballs [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12680.98s)]
*  to search for what you want to do? [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12682.619999999999s)]
*  Like make it into a key press [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12683.86s)]
*  and never think about it again, ever. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12685.619999999999s)]
*  You're making me think a lot [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12687.98s)]
*  whether I can live with your system, [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12689.06s)]
*  whether it's better, cause it feels better. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12691.74s)]
*  It at least intellectually feels better. [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12693.9s)]
*  It may not be great for some people. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12695.42s)]
*  There's a few profound things you said, [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12697.3s)]
*  which is like really what you're, [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12698.539999999999s)]
*  the number of windows or tasks [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12701.22s)]
*  you're switching between, whether it's programming, [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12704.1s)]
*  the number of files you're working on is small. [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12705.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12708.26s)]
*  Any one time at any one like space of like 20 minutes [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12709.1s)]
*  or something like that. [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12712.54s)]
*  So, okay, that's a profound truth. [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12713.94s)]
*  Sometimes we think like, oh, I need the full freedom [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12715.9s)]
*  to search, but you don't. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12718.78s)]
*  You usually work on a very small slice. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12720.66s)]
*  But I guess the trade off there, [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12723.380000000001s)]
*  like I always have three monitors, [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12724.9s)]
*  not when I'm traveling, but my happy place is three monitors. [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12727.02s)]
*  It's like, do you really need all of them [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12731.54s)]
*  to be present there? [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12734.42s)]
*  So you're turning your head. [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12735.78s)]
*  Now the monitors I have is two vertical ones, [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12737.460000000001s)]
*  which is just better for certain kinds of content. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12740.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're positioned vertically. [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12744.460000000001s)]
*  So you can read, you can use your eyes to scan quickly. [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12746.060000000001s)]
*  Interesting. So I don't even do that. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12749.5s)]
*  I even have it so zoomed in that I probably only have [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12750.86s)]
*  like maybe 25 lines of code at any one time [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12752.820000000002s)]
*  on my 27 inch monitor. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12755.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's okay. [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12757.1s)]
*  I think I feel fundamentally constrained [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12760.06s)]
*  when I can't see more. [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12763.38s)]
*  Cause your eyes are just good at jumping. [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12765.1s)]
*  Like, okay, like you could like. [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12769.5s)]
*  Why not search? [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12772.5s)]
*  Why not press a couple of keystrokes? [[03:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12773.34s)]
*  Control U, Control D, jump up and down by half page. [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12775.26s)]
*  Because the APE visual system was designed to, [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12778.46s)]
*  like you're loading a lot of information. [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12781.46s)]
*  Like what, if every time you have to investigate this table, [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12783.859999999999s)]
*  what's on this table, you had to press a keystroke. [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12788.42s)]
*  You could develop the skillset [[03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12792.66s)]
*  that integrates that information. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12795.18s)]
*  But like it's really, there is an effective thing [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12797.5s)]
*  where if you have a sheet of paper like this [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12800.18s)]
*  and I'm looking at it, my eyes will be able to load in [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12802.86s)]
*  the structure of the information, [[03:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12809.7s)]
*  the topics of the information. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12813.78s)]
*  You just can do it faster, I think. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12816.3s)]
*  There's a big cost because it's an extra monitor. [[03:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12818.619999999999s)]
*  But there is some stuff that's vertical, [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12822.02s)]
*  when vertically positioned. [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12824.46s)]
*  Code, see code is an iffy one. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12826.38s)]
*  Cause code you really, 25 lines at a time, [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12828.9s)]
*  I think you can do a lot. [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12831.66s)]
*  This is more for like articles and especially [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12833.9s)]
*  with visual information in them or documentation. [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12838.539999999999s)]
*  You can just jump faster. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12841.22s)]
*  But I'm trying to, as you were speaking so eloquently, [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12842.58s)]
*  I was wondering, am I just deceiving myself [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12846.62s)]
*  that I need that? [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12851.140000000001s)]
*  Can I just keyboard shortcutify everything [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12852.980000000001s)]
*  and just have everything on one monitor? [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12855.980000000001s)]
*  That's something I should probably try. [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12858.5s)]
*  Cause I'm a big proponent of just automating everything [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12860.1s)]
*  with the keyboard. [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12862.34s)]
*  Cause you can just move really, really fast. [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12863.58s)]
*  You don't have to think. [[03:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12865.26s)]
*  One of my, cause I also do creative stuff like, [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12866.900000000001s)]
*  whether it's recording music or video editing, [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12872.02s)]
*  it's hard, some of these programs don't make it [[03:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12876.1s)]
*  super easy for you. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12879.5s)]
*  On Windows with auto hotkey, you can do quite a lot, [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12881.14s)]
*  but still there's limitations on how much you could do [[03:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12883.9s)]
*  with the keyboard. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12886.14s)]
*  So that's, it really is a pain in the ass [[03:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12887.1s)]
*  to have to use the mouse. [[03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12889.06s)]
*  But man, you're really making me think. [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12890.54s)]
*  It's, even the text one, the reading one, [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12892.98s)]
*  like fundamentally, I think I agree with you [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12896.1s)]
*  that you can see a lot more and you can kind of [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12897.78s)]
*  look up and down and see those two things. [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12900.34s)]
*  And probably in articles or things like that, I could, [[03:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12901.9s)]
*  if there's like a graph down here, that's really big, [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12905.26s)]
*  that take up your whole screen plus text, [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12907.26s)]
*  I could see why that would be very beneficial to zoom out, [[03:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12908.78s)]
*  to be able to have all that information. [[03:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12911.380000000001s)]
*  But for me, I can only look at like a square inch. [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12912.62s)]
*  Like really that's all my eyes can actually focus on. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12915.66s)]
*  So when I'm reading, I'm right here. [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12917.7s)]
*  Then I have to like structurally try to pattern match [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12919.380000000001s)]
*  what I think the information looks like. [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12921.82s)]
*  Then I just have to start reading it. [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12923.14s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure if I actually get any real benefit [[03:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12924.66s)]
*  of having a lot of stuff on screen, [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12927.460000000001s)]
*  as opposed to I can relax my eyes so much, [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12929.5s)]
*  I don't even have to focus, the words are so big. [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12932.42s)]
*  Like I actually program pretty zoomed in. [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12934.42s)]
*  My text is bigger than this when I program. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12937.3s)]
*  And so it's just that it's so comfortable. [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12939.7s)]
*  I don't even have to exert any effort to read the code. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12943.02s)]
*  But you have to kind of train your brain [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12946.02s)]
*  to know that you can navigate in like spatially using keys. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12947.9s)]
*  Yeah, the NeoVim by the way. [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12953.62s)]
*  Oh, maybe it has everything to do with NeoVim, okay. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12956.54s)]
*  And then NeoVim is obviously the next big one. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12959.66s)]
*  I love NeoVim. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12961.18s)]
*  Reason being is that I think you can make all the arguments [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12962.22s)]
*  that you want about which editor is the best. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12965.26s)]
*  I do not think you can make an argument [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12966.98s)]
*  that Vim motions aren't superior. [[03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12968.5s)]
*  Here we go, can you explain Vim motions? [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12970.14s)]
*  Okay, so. What is this? [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12972.5s)]
*  So NeoVim, Vim is a old school editor. [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12973.42s)]
*  NeoVim. [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12976.619999999999s)]
*  It's a modern take on an old school editor. [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12977.66s)]
*  Yeah, and what's ELI5? [[03:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12979.42s)]
*  ELI5, what does it take to work with NeoVim? [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12982.82s)]
*  Okay, I thought you were talking about a Vim motion there. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12989.34s)]
*  That's how, you know that meme that's just like, [[03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12991.5s)]
*  hey Jarvis, can I tell you about Vim motions? [[03:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12995.3s)]
*  Cause they can't fit anything else in their head [[03:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12997.58s)]
*  cause they only have Vim motions. [[03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12999.18s)]
*  You said EL5, like explain it like a five. [[03:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13000.54s)]
*  But in my head it's like, okay, [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13002.7s)]
*  E is jump to the end of the word, L is one more word. [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13003.82s)]
*  It's like, dude, I'm so like broken. [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13006.3s)]
*  I'm like, okay, Vim motion for my hear letters. [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13007.74s)]
*  Yeah, so you can think of it like this, [[03:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13010.7s)]
*  is that Vim has a language to describe movements in text [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13013.460000000001s)]
*  because its primary mode of operation [[03:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13018.94s)]
*  is manipulating or editing text. [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13020.94s)]
*  So it is a well thought through set of movements, [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13023.7s)]
*  deleting, yanking, pasting, copying, [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13026.900000000001s)]
*  all that kind of stuff that goes in, [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13029.42s)]
*  motions that are optimized for working [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13031.86s)]
*  with pretty much code. [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13033.58s)]
*  Good example, say you have three lines of code [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13035.42s)]
*  you want to delete. [[03:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13037.62s)]
*  If you're in VS code, take your little beautiful mouse, [[03:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13039.1s)]
*  highlight those things, press the backspace. [[03:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13041.66s)]
*  That's lovely. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13043.74s)]
*  Your hand left the keyboard, very simple to do though. [[03:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13044.66s)]
*  It's very beginner friendly. [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13046.7s)]
*  I was a huge Vim hater by the way. [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13048.26s)]
*  So I just want you to know that before we go into this, [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13049.98s)]
*  I was probably the biggest Vim hater. [[03:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13051.54s)]
*  If there was like Saul to apostle Paul, [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13053.82s)]
*  I am like the Saul to apostle Paul of Vim. [[03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13057.42s)]
*  So you see how big the gap was. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13060.02s)]
*  Or you can do something that's like, [[03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13062.58s)]
*  I don't know what the VS code shortcut is, [[03:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13064.34s)]
*  but I'm sure there's some keys you can press [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13065.78s)]
*  to delete the current line you're on. [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13067.78s)]
*  Delete, delete, delete. [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13069.26s)]
*  You can just do that. [[03:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13070.62s)]
*  In Vim I can go DAP, delete around paragraph, [[03:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13071.74s)]
*  all contiguous code in that thing, I'm going to delete. [[03:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13074.460000000001s)]
*  So D, then I can choose my motion I want to take, [[03:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13076.820000000002s)]
*  AP around paragraph. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13079.86s)]
*  Or maybe I want to D, F mean jump up to the next character [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13081.7s)]
*  that matches the next character I'm going to press. [[03:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13085.380000000001s)]
*  So DF opening parenthesis will delete everything [[03:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13087.02s)]
*  from your cursor up to the first opening parenthesis. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13089.66s)]
*  So you get to describe your motion [[03:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13092.460000000001s)]
*  in these little keystrokes. [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13094.5s)]
*  And as you get really good, [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13095.460000000001s)]
*  you've seen people that can master Fortnite. [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13097.34s)]
*  It's the same thing with mastering Vim motions. [[03:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13099.1s)]
*  When you get so good, [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13101.02s)]
*  you no longer think about each individual movement. [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13101.86s)]
*  Instead you're just like, get rid of the paragraph, [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13104.18s)]
*  jump here, jump this, highlight this, yank this, do this. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13105.98s)]
*  It becomes so fast that you can superiorly edit text [[03:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13108.86s)]
*  at a very fast rate. [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13112.22s)]
*  And there comes a point [[03:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13113.34s)]
*  when you know your language really well, [[03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13114.7s)]
*  you know the problem you're really working on really well, [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13116.82s)]
*  where editing text and getting code out [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13119.1s)]
*  actually becomes one of the many bottlenecks. [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13121.22s)]
*  People always talk about, well, most of the time I think. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13123.62s)]
*  Most of the time I'm not thinking, I'm programming. [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13125.66s)]
*  I know what I want to do. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13127.74s)]
*  I want to go as fast as possible [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13128.66s)]
*  because I've been just doing it for so long. [[03:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13129.7s)]
*  And I'm so familiar with kind of the general space [[03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13131.18s)]
*  that it becomes a huge problem for me. [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13133.9s)]
*  I cannot tell you how many times [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13136.14s)]
*  that I've been purely bottlenecked by the fact [[03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13137.26s)]
*  that I just can't type fast enough. [[03:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13139.539999999999s)]
*  I just need to get it out of my head onto the text editor. [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13141.14s)]
*  And so that's why I think Vim motions [[03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13145.02s)]
*  are superior in all aspects. [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13147.5s)]
*  Keep your hands on the keyboard, on the home row, [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13149.66s)]
*  and can manipulate text in very wide and fast ways. [[03:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13151.66s)]
*  So this is not just about writing text. [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13154.62s)]
*  This is about modifying text. [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13156.660000000002s)]
*  It's primarily about modifying text. [[03:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13157.7s)]
*  And I'm sure that most editors, including Emacs, [[03:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13159.54s)]
*  including VS Code, can do all those same things, [[03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13162.740000000002s)]
*  but there is something that just don't encourage you [[03:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13165.460000000001s)]
*  to discover those things. [[03:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13169.34s)]
*  That's like an important thing about a lot of technologies [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13171.26s)]
*  and programming languages, [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13174.94s)]
*  that a lot of them can do a lot of the stuff. [[03:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13177.460000000001s)]
*  But it's something about whether it's the community [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13181.220000000001s)]
*  or the style of the language or anything like this [[03:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13183.62s)]
*  that encourages you to not be lazy in the beginning [[03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13185.78s)]
*  and learn the fast way to edit text [[03:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13189.5s)]
*  in this particular example. [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13193.34s)]
*  How to use the keyboard. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13195.820000000002s)]
*  That's a fascinating sort of just reality [[03:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13197.140000000001s)]
*  of how technology is used. [[03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13200.300000000001s)]
*  You wanna be encouraged to find the fast thing [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13201.460000000001s)]
*  as quickly as possible so that long-term, [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13203.7s)]
*  it's efficient and fun to use. [[03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13207.060000000001s)]
*  It takes a long time for dividends, like a long time. [[03:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13209.660000000002s)]
*  But on top of that, notice I didn't say Vim. [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13212.82s)]
*  I'm not saying go use Vim. [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13214.94s)]
*  I'm saying Vim motions. [[03:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13216.14s)]
*  Let me give you one more example, okay? [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13218.42s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13219.74s)]
*  Okay, let's say you have a line [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13220.74s)]
*  that contains some function you're calling something [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13222.619999999999s)]
*  that takes in a string. [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13226.9s)]
*  And you need to do that again. [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13228.34s)]
*  So you would typically copy that line, [[03:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13229.34s)]
*  you'd paste that line below, [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13233.34s)]
*  you'd go into the string and you'd change the string. [[03:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13235.02s)]
*  Let's say it's calling some sort of configuration. [[03:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13237.699999999999s)]
*  You need to call it three times [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13239.14s)]
*  with three different configuring strings. [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13240.3s)]
*  In Vim, I like to do shift V [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13242.14s)]
*  to highlight the whole line, then Y. [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13244.66s)]
*  Some people do YY, but I don't like to do double ones. [[03:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13246.14s)]
*  I like to be able to do two different fingers [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13248.22s)]
*  because you can do that way faster than one finger twice. [[03:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13249.82s)]
*  Just a little optimization for me [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13253.26s)]
*  because you can't press that as fast. [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13254.58s)]
*  So anyways, very optimized in my approach. [[03:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13257.42s)]
*  So I yank the line, paste the line, [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13259.58s)]
*  CI double quotes will delete everything [[03:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13261.859999999999s)]
*  inside the first occurring string. [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13263.939999999999s)]
*  Then I can type the string, escape, save. [[03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13265.859999999999s)]
*  And so it's like so optimized [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13268.099999999999s)]
*  that I can just jump so fast in between that. [[03:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13270.3s)]
*  Whereas the copying and pasting lines, [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13272.34s)]
*  probably the same speed, but the navigating to the string, [[03:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13274.779999999999s)]
*  deleting what's currently in the string. [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13277.699999999999s)]
*  And then, like that's such a fast motion in Vim. [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13279.38s)]
*  And I just do that all the time. [[03:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13282.5s)]
*  To backtrack, really dumb question, CI, [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13283.74s)]
*  what's the difference between typing the letters [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13287.259999999998s)]
*  and using the letters to navigate? [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13290.22s)]
*  How do you switch between the two modes? [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13292.619999999999s)]
*  Okay, so insert mode means that you're just putting in text. [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13294.259999999998s)]
*  And then normal mode means that you're moving your cursor. [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13297.06s)]
*  And how do you switch between the two? [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13300.46s)]
*  Escape. [[03:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13301.98s)]
*  Escape goes from insert mode into normal mode. [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13303.06s)]
*  And to go into insert mode, [[03:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13306.18s)]
*  press I to take your current cursor [[03:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13308.3s)]
*  and go to the beginning, [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13309.859999999999s)]
*  A to go to the end of the year cursor, [[03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13310.699999999999s)]
*  capital A to go to the end of the line, [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13311.939999999999s)]
*  capital I to go to the beginning line, [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13313.26s)]
*  O to put a new line below, [[03:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13314.939999999999s)]
*  and then put your cursor at the proper intended [[03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13316.46s)]
*  for the language, shift O to shift your current line down [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13318.1s)]
*  and then put a new line in. [[03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13320.82s)]
*  Like you can see. [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13322.38s)]
*  Yeah, there's like a lot. [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13323.22s)]
*  So you're pressing escape a lot. [[03:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13324.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mapped mine. [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13325.82s)]
*  I do control C, control C does the same thing [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13327.34s)]
*  except for in one edge case, people hate that. [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13328.820000000002s)]
*  I got used to it just due to the fact [[03:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13331.54s)]
*  that I was using IntelliJ [[03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13333.060000000001s)]
*  and I really hate pressing the escape key. [[03:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13334.060000000001s)]
*  So I just got used to pressing escape. [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13336.26s)]
*  That seems like an essential thing to do [[03:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13337.58s)]
*  if you're using U of M to map escape to something. [[03:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13339.380000000001s)]
*  Cap lock would be like your standard go-to. [[03:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13342.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, I map it too. [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13344.58s)]
*  Cool, I got you. [[03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13345.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so then it's just really easy to press it [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13347.220000000001s)]
*  and boom, boom, boom, not a big deal at all. [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13349.26s)]
*  But yeah, I think that if you're willing to learn it, [[03:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13352.060000000001s)]
*  the motions are superior. [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13354.380000000001s)]
*  But if you're not willing to learn it, [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13355.42s)]
*  then they're not superior. [[03:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13356.9s)]
*  You should just not do it. [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13358.02s)]
*  If you're willing to endure pain, it's good. [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13359.7s)]
*  If you're not, it's actually way worse. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13361.58s)]
*  It's a hundred times worse. [[03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13363.62s)]
*  Right, so if you like pain, you use Neo of M. [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13365.38s)]
*  Totally, I understand. [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13368.14s)]
*  Yeah, you're totally on board. [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13368.98s)]
*  See, now you get it. [[03:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13369.82s)]
*  If you like joy, you use Emacs. [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13370.66s)]
*  So. [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13372.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, sorry, sorry. [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13373.3s)]
*  Did Emacs ever get a good text editor? [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13374.14s)]
*  I know they're a great operating system [[03:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13376.62s)]
*  but I never caught up if they got a good text editor. [[03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13377.94s)]
*  Operating system. [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13380.02s)]
*  I think you've been miseducated, my friend. [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13381.460000000001s)]
*  At least 30 minutes on Emacs versus Neo of M [[03:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13384.5s)]
*  is what Reddit requested. [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13387.06s)]
*  Have you actually used Emacs [[03:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13390.14s)]
*  in order to be able to talk some shit or no? [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13391.78s)]
*  I used it for a year. [[03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13393.86s)]
*  You used it for a year? [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13395.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Doomac, SpaceMax and regular Emacs. [[03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13396.26s)]
*  But you don't know Lisp. [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13398.98s)]
*  So did you really use it? [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13400.14s)]
*  I kind of hacked my way through kind of like, [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13401.9s)]
*  okay, so this is how the config, you know, [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13404.34s)]
*  like you can kind of get your way through and do all that. [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13405.94s)]
*  So you recommend to sort of master Neo of M [[03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13408.62s)]
*  and really learn the depths of it. [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13411.58s)]
*  But Emacs is okay to just kind of use [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13413.5s)]
*  before making a judgment. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13415.7s)]
*  I think everybody. [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13417.22s)]
*  You got me on that one. [[03:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13418.46s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13419.46s)]
*  And what's Neo of M written? [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13421.02s)]
*  It's Lua? [[03:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13422.62s)]
*  Yeah, so Lua would be the configuration language [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13423.46s)]
*  but you have, it's written in C but you have Lua for. [[03:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13425.3s)]
*  And Lua is just a dead simple language. [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13428.46s)]
*  Anyone can program Lua. [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13429.94s)]
*  I actually don't know why. [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13431.22s)]
*  I think it's because my love for Lisp [[03:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13433.3s)]
*  that I went with Emacs. [[03:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13434.86s)]
*  I think you just choose a path [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13435.82s)]
*  and you walk down that path. [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13437.7s)]
*  And because there's just such a vibrant intense battle [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13440.3s)]
*  between the two communities, you just start fighting [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13446.3s)]
*  just because everybody else is fighting. [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13449.26s)]
*  And then one day you're like an old warrior, [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13451.5s)]
*  like on a horse and you're wondering what, [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13453.98s)]
*  what was this all for? [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13456.380000000001s)]
*  And I mean, it's quite sad, you know, [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13458.98s)]
*  seriousness that I haven't to this day tried Neo of M. [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13462.5s)]
*  It's, I think because there is a learning curve, [[03:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13466.220000000001s)]
*  there's a learning curve to a lot of these editors. [[03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13469.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13472.02s)]
*  To really learn. [[03:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13472.86s)]
*  To really learn it. [[03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13473.94s)]
*  And I think this is some of the criticism [[03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13474.9s)]
*  of maybe VS Code or Sublime or Atom, [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13477.98s)]
*  that it's so easy to not learn it, [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13481.82s)]
*  to just kind of half-ass use it. [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13484.1s)]
*  And there is a big benefit to having editors [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13487.300000000001s)]
*  that like force you to have some learning curve [[03:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13490.74s)]
*  where you like take the art, the science, [[03:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13492.82s)]
*  the procedure of editing seriously. [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13497.66s)]
*  Cause like you spend so much time in it. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13500.1s)]
*  You might as well like learn like how to use the thing. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13501.82s)]
*  My big takeaway really, like what I'm trying to say [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13505.1s)]
*  with all these words is that I honestly don't actually think [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13507.22s)]
*  that the editor obviously does not make the programmer. [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13510.82s)]
*  But I think it says a lot about your character [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13513.98s)]
*  as a programmer, if you don't know how to use [[03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13516.619999999999s)]
*  your editor well. [[03:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13518.94s)]
*  There's something about a person who's willing [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13521.14s)]
*  to commit their life to programming [[03:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13523.46s)]
*  and spending literally 50,000 hours doing an activity [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13525.619999999999s)]
*  over the course of their lifetime [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13530.9s)]
*  and never take the time to learn their editor [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13532.58s)]
*  through and through. [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13534.42s)]
*  It just seems strange, like, right? [[03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13535.9s)]
*  You'd never see that in another world [[03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13537.14s)]
*  where people would be able to build something [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13538.939999999999s)]
*  or do something and just completely forget [[03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13541.14s)]
*  how these things work and only just focus [[03:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13543.26s)]
*  on one part of like their craft. [[03:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13545.019999999999s)]
*  And so to me, it's just like, [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13547.3s)]
*  it doesn't matter how you use it. [[03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13548.74s)]
*  I want to see the person that just knows how to use it. [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13551.42s)]
*  And they know how to use it well. [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13554.78s)]
*  When there's a problem, they can say why the problem exists [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13556.06s)]
*  and then go and fix the problem. [[03:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13558.1s)]
*  To me, that's like, there you go, you've done it. [[03:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13559.46s)]
*  You now know your tool, go forth and conquer with said tool. [[03:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13560.86s)]
*  Especially for tools you use a lot. [[03:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13564.5s)]
*  You have to look at like your whole life, your life, [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13567.58s)]
*  whatever, if you're a developer or anything, [[03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13570.1s)]
*  like what is the thing you do a lot? [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13573.94s)]
*  Meetings. [[03:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13576.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13577.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13579.1s)]
*  I mean, ask a question like, [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13579.94s)]
*  how can this be done a lot better? [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13582.78s)]
*  Because every single day you do this for hours a day, [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13584.46s)]
*  how many hours did you spend on thinking [[03:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13590.18s)]
*  how to do this better or whether to do it at all [[03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13592.98s)]
*  in the case of meetings? [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13596.1s)]
*  People surprisingly just don't do this enough. [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13599.14s)]
*  I see this just to go back to jujitsu. [[03:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13601.699999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people that show up and do jujitsu [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13604.06s)]
*  or martial arts and they do it the same way [[03:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13606.9s)]
*  over and over and over and they invest [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13609.539999999999s)]
*  a tremendous amount of energy and they don't ask like, [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13611.18s)]
*  how do I do it differently to improve faster [[03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13614.3s)]
*  in the case of jujitsu or any kind of sport? [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13617.5s)]
*  Same with practicing the piano or the guitar. [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13619.5s)]
*  They just religiously put in a lot of time [[03:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13622.619999999999s)]
*  and derive a lot of joy from getting better. [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13627.539999999999s)]
*  They don't enough ask the meta question of like, [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13630.5s)]
*  how can I do this better? [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13632.94s)]
*  And with editors, it's surprisingly how often [[03:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13635.14s)]
*  people do just that. [[03:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13638.539999999999s)]
*  With typing, it's surprising how many people do just that. [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13640.42s)]
*  Like you said, they're pecking or looking down. [[03:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13643.82s)]
*  It's like the quality of life improvement you can have [[03:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13648.58s)]
*  by learning to touch type, [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13652.66s)]
*  by just like typing without looking. [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13654.859999999999s)]
*  It's like immeasurable. [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13656.38s)]
*  You're bringing a lot of joy to your life [[03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13659.34s)]
*  because all of us are typing a lot. [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13660.779999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, the reason by the way, [[03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13663.22s)]
*  I was extremely efficient with Emacs. [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13667.26s)]
*  I'm sure, you know, all jokes aside, [[03:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13669.66s)]
*  it feels like Neo of M has more room [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13672.46s)]
*  for the kind of efficiency I've had with Emacs [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13677.539999999999s)]
*  to be able to move really fast as you described me to edit. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13680.3s)]
*  There is a real joy. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13682.9s)]
*  It's not just efficiency. [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13684.619999999999s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's a freedom that you can get [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13685.74s)]
*  when you get really good with an editor. [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13689.74s)]
*  The reason I chose to go with VS Code [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13692.18s)]
*  is it felt like there's going to be an acceleration [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13693.94s)]
*  of features to which Neo of M or Emacs [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13700.74s)]
*  will not be able to catch up in the, [[03:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13704.26s)]
*  and I don't mean in the next five years. [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13706.1s)]
*  I mean in the next 30 years. [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13707.5s)]
*  Like, and it felt like I almost wanted to take the pain [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13709.02s)]
*  of learning new editors constantly and just switching [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13712.7s)]
*  and learning that, [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13715.62s)]
*  because I was getting so comfortable in Emacs. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13716.58s)]
*  You know, this is this keyboard, everything, [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13719.1s)]
*  all the shortcuts, I know how to program. [[03:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13721.06s)]
*  And it felt like this is not, you know, [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13722.9s)]
*  Neo of M will not be here in 50 years. [[03:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13725.42s)]
*  Possibly might be, I don't know. [[03:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13727.859999999999s)]
*  But it felt like you want to learn [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13729.66s)]
*  these constant sort of different technologies. [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13731.82s)]
*  Now, Cursor's example, a great example [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13734.9s)]
*  that I've primarily been using Cursor now. [[03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13737.06s)]
*  I'll go back to VS Code and Cursor. [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13739.82s)]
*  The, just the skill of using AI is a real skill. [[03:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13742.22s)]
*  Like, you know, with, from the shortcuts [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13746.699999999999s)]
*  to the timing, to the layout of the windows, [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13750.18s)]
*  to how I think about where, when, [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13752.98s)]
*  and how to use the AI that doesn't distract me, [[03:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13755.54s)]
*  that it empowers me, not just for the fuck of it [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13758.460000000001s)]
*  or for the fun of it, [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13761.380000000001s)]
*  for the actual measure of productivity. [[03:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13762.34s)]
*  It's a skill, and I feel like I would be stuck [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13764.9s)]
*  in local maximal of comfort if I stayed with Emacs. [[03:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13768.94s)]
*  And maybe the same should be true for me with Neo of M. [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13773.26s)]
*  I should try it seriously. [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13776.74s)]
*  I'm sure there's a plugin, like a copilot type of situation [[03:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13778.18s)]
*  that you could set up with Neo of M. [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13781.460000000001s)]
*  I should possibly consider that. [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13783.02s)]
*  But like, Cursor is doing a lot of really fascinating stuff [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13785.220000000001s)]
*  on the IDE side, not just sort of generate code [[03:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13788.06s)]
*  and like edit that code manually. [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13793.34s)]
*  It's like continuously be able to rewrite code. [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13797.26s)]
*  It's like the idea of tap, tap, tap, tap. [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13800.82s)]
*  Move the cursor around, but also modify parts of code [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13803.460000000001s)]
*  and do the diff really nicely. [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13806.58s)]
*  That, whether it's cursor or VS code, [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13808.58s)]
*  that wins that battle out with copilot, I don't know. [[03:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13810.46s)]
*  But like that feels like a fun with a different experience. [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13813.78s)]
*  Then the really efficient, joyful experience [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13817.06s)]
*  that you just described, [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13819.74s)]
*  and you're selling me on this as Neo of M. [[03:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13820.78s)]
*  That doesn't have AI in the picture, obviously immediately, [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13823.82s)]
*  but you can, yeah, absolutely. [[03:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13828.22s)]
*  I would have 100% agree that Cursor [[03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13830.06s)]
*  seems like such a cool product. [[03:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13833.66s)]
*  I actually think there's like a lot of really neat things [[03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13836.74s)]
*  coming down with all of that. [[03:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13838.58s)]
*  And I could change from Neo of M. [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13839.74s)]
*  I don't use Neo of M because I love Neo of M. [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13842.539999999999s)]
*  I use Neo of M because I love the instrument I play. [[03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13844.539999999999s)]
*  And so it's like, if Cursor can meet those needs, [[03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13847.38s)]
*  I could see myself moving over. [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13849.539999999999s)]
*  I don't have some sort of obsessed attachment with it. [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13850.98s)]
*  I am curious though that every time I use, [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13854.859999999999s)]
*  I think I just have skill issues. [[03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13858.9s)]
*  I think I'm just so riddled with skill issues [[03:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13860.22s)]
*  when it comes to using AI. [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13861.98s)]
*  I've yet to be able to use it [[03:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13863.62s)]
*  in a way that I really love it. [[03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13864.740000000002s)]
*  We'll talk about it before then. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13866.660000000002s)]
*  Oh, ball to sit on. [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13868.460000000001s)]
*  I forgot to say that, ball to sit on. [[03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13869.7s)]
*  Desk needs to be properly hided, one monitor. [[03:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13871.62s)]
*  I should be two thirds way up the screen. [[03:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13874.26s)]
*  I don't like to turn my head. [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13876.42s)]
*  I prefer my hands in kind of like a pistol neutral position. [[03:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13878.7s)]
*  And there you go. [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13884.18s)]
*  A ball to sit on, yoga ball. [[03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13885.140000000001s)]
*  Yoga ball. [[03:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13886.660000000002s)]
*  What's that about? [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13887.5s)]
*  It just helps just maintain good posture [[03:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13888.34s)]
*  because when I have something to lean against, I do this. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13890.380000000001s)]
*  So you're for hours sitting without, [[03:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13893.660000000002s)]
*  wait, what are you doing? [[03:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13896.18s)]
*  I sit on a ball and then I bounce. [[03:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13897.26s)]
*  Is your back leaning on a thing? [[03:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13900.18s)]
*  No. [[03:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13901.660000000002s)]
*  What the fuck? [[03:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13902.5s)]
*  Well, how else do you like the problem? [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13903.34s)]
*  How else do you? [[03:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13904.980000000001s)]
*  You're the only person in the world sitting on a yoga ball [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13905.820000000002s)]
*  as you program for hours. [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13909.7s)]
*  You do realize that, right? [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13911.820000000002s)]
*  It feels great. [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13912.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, the problem is, is whenever I get a back, [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13913.740000000002s)]
*  I just slouch and I find myself just getting uncomfortable [[03:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13917.740000000002s)]
*  and I'm like, why am I uncomfortable? [[03:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13920.820000000002s)]
*  My shoulders are kind of getting goofed up. [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13923.3s)]
*  I just like, I'm chicken necking, like constantly. [[03:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13925.9s)]
*  Like, ah, you know, it's just like. [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13928.779999999999s)]
*  But you're able to keep your posture [[03:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13929.86s)]
*  for hours on the yoga ball? [[03:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13931.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13932.619999999999s)]
*  And so I can just do that. [[03:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13933.46s)]
*  And then I find myself, if I slouch, [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13934.5s)]
*  I'm like, okay, nope, gotta get back. [[03:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13935.94s)]
*  You have like incredible back muscles or what? [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13936.779999999999s)]
*  No, I won't. [[03:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13939.34s)]
*  I don't think it takes incredible back muscles [[03:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13940.94s)]
*  to keep posture. [[03:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13942.98s)]
*  Remain upright. [[03:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13944.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a pretty basic human function. [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13945.02s)]
*  I would not consider myself a strong person. [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13947.02s)]
*  Yeah, basic human function. [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13949.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13951.14s)]
*  Facts and logic. [[03:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13952.98s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13954.779999999999s)]
*  With one screen, [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13955.619999999999s)]
*  Neo Vim with operating system. [[03:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13959.38s)]
*  Linux, just because I want a good window manager. [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13961.86s)]
*  That's the whole press one button, bring up Chrome. [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13967.3s)]
*  I just use i3. [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13969.619999999999s)]
*  I'm sure I could use something better than i3. [[03:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13971.02s)]
*  People always tell me all these window managers [[03:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13974.06s)]
*  are really great, but I just want, [[03:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13975.5s)]
*  I just have like those three screens I switched between, [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13976.539999999999s)]
*  so it doesn't really, I don't really care what I use, [[03:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13978.58s)]
*  just as long as I can press one button and go. [[03:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13980.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the same, so half and half. [[03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13982.26s)]
*  So half Linux, the other half Windows with Linux, [[03:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13984.26s)]
*  meaning WSL, what's that? [[03:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13988.1s)]
*  Windows Subsystem for Linux. [[03:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13991.14s)]
*  Weasel. [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13992.5s)]
*  Weasel. [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13993.34s)]
*  See, no, there's gotta be a better one [[03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13995.62s)]
*  that's more positive. [[03:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13997.22s)]
*  Weasel just sounds. [[03:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13998.06s)]
*  Seems right up Microsoft's alley. [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=13999.26s)]
*  That seems perfect. [[03:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14001.22s)]
*  So people often accuse me of being a shill for somebody. [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14004.14s)]
*  Sometimes dictators, if I'm a shill for anybody, [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14008.18s)]
*  it's for Windows. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14010.380000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14011.580000000002s)]
*  I get paychecks every week from- [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14012.42s)]
*  Bought by Bill Gates. [[03:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14015.62s)]
*  Well, he's not Microsoft anymore. [[03:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14016.980000000001s)]
*  A ball, developers, developers, developers. [[03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14018.78s)]
*  No, I'm just joking. [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14021.34s)]
*  I think, man, I need to try Mac. [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14022.18s)]
*  I need to try. [[03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14025.34s)]
*  I'm surrounded. [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14027.02s)]
*  I'm surrounded by people with iPhones. [[03:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14028.220000000001s)]
*  I use Android. [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14031.94s)]
*  I use Android. [[03:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14032.86s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[03:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14033.7s)]
*  See, oh. [[03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14035.02s)]
*  We're losers together. [[03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14035.86s)]
*  Losers on a sinking ship. [[03:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14036.740000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14040.1s)]
*  So just to stay in the event for a sec [[03:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14041.86s)]
*  and to give love and a shout out to your friend, Teej. [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14045.86s)]
*  He streams, by the way. [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14049.58s)]
*  He's a streamer and I subscribed [[03:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14050.82s)]
*  and I've been enjoying it. [[03:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14054.02s)]
*  My allegiance is slowly shifting from you to him. [[03:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14055.66s)]
*  The quality is far superior with him. [[03:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14059.300000000001s)]
*  The looks, the intelligence, the skillset, everything. [[03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14062.78s)]
*  Just far superior. [[03:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14065.86s)]
*  No. [[03:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14067.300000000001s)]
*  So he. [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14068.38s)]
*  You know you're making his day. [[03:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14069.82s)]
*  All right. [[03:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14072.82s)]
*  So he mentioned that he loves NeoVim [[03:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14075.099999999999s)]
*  because it gives him the ability to eliminate [[03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14077.98s)]
*  having to do things he doesn't like. [[03:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14080.18s)]
*  That's just a nice way to frame [[03:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14082.34s)]
*  sort of what the automation process that you described [[03:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14086.26s)]
*  of automating a way, assigning shortcuts [[03:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14090.74s)]
*  to things that are painful. [[03:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14094.46s)]
*  So that procedure. [[03:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14096.7s)]
*  I mean, I wonder if you agree with that. [[03:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14098.26s)]
*  Fully agree. [[03:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14100.900000000001s)]
*  We have very similar mentalities [[03:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14101.740000000002s)]
*  when it comes to usage of NeoVim, [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14102.86s)]
*  why people should use it, all that kind of stuff [[03:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14104.78s)]
*  and how to even use it well. [[03:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14106.66s)]
*  He definitely takes it probably to a further degree. [[03:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14107.900000000001s)]
*  He spends more time automating and all that. [[03:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14110.58s)]
*  I don't necessarily derive a lot of joy [[03:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14113.94s)]
*  from getting the perfect setup. [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14115.740000000002s)]
*  And so, but a lot to learn from him. [[03:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14117.980000000001s)]
*  He's very, very good at what he does. [[03:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14119.820000000002s)]
*  He is by far probably one of these. [[03:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14121.58s)]
*  He's 30 years old, been programming [[03:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14123.66s)]
*  for not too many years. [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14125.66s)]
*  And he is one of the most talented developers for sure. [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14127.22s)]
*  It's very shocking to see how smart someone can be. [[03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14129.46s)]
*  So people should check him out at t-e-e-j underscore d-v. [[03:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14132.46s)]
*  Yep. [[03:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14136.9s)]
*  Tej. [[03:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14137.74s)]
*  His last name is DeVries. [[03:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14138.58s)]
*  Oh, it's not a developer. [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14141.06s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14142.02s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just T-J. [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14142.86s)]
*  That's just his name. [[03:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14144.1s)]
*  Just spelled kind of fun. [[03:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14145.22s)]
*  What do you love about him? [[03:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14146.82s)]
*  Wow, how much did he pay you to ask these questions? [[03:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14147.9s)]
*  Thousands of dollars. [[03:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14151.22s)]
*  Just so many dollars. [[03:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14153.26s)]
*  I can't even count that many dollars. [[03:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14155.66s)]
*  He is a trust. [[03:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14158.3s)]
*  Obviously trust is the biggest thing, [[03:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14160.02s)]
*  especially in the quote unquote streaming YouTube [[03:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14161.78s)]
*  kind of world, if you will. [[03:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14164.74s)]
*  It's very easy to find people that will want to [[03:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14167.18s)]
*  like be a part of stuff. [[03:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14170.1s)]
*  People tend to latch onto things [[03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14171.86s)]
*  and it's very hard to find someone [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14173.46s)]
*  that you can really, really trust. [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14174.56s)]
*  And so he's just somebody whom I can genuinely trust. [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14176.18s)]
*  He'll always tell the truth. [[03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14179.14s)]
*  He's all the right things for a good friend [[03:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14180.94s)]
*  in this kind of endeavor. [[03:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14183.78s)]
*  So as a good friend, he told me questions [[03:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14185.14s)]
*  I could backstab you with. [[03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14189.18s)]
*  Okay, I hate him. [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14190.58s)]
*  I forgot how much I don't trust him. [[03:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14191.42s)]
*  So speaking of Harpoon, you mentioned it. [[03:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14195.019999999999s)]
*  He said, you know, to ask you about whether, [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14197.699999999999s)]
*  basically how many years or decades it's gonna take [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14203.34s)]
*  to transition to Harpoon 2, [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14206.019999999999s)]
*  to actually release it, develop it and so on. [[03:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14207.82s)]
*  Can you describe what Harpoon is [[03:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14210.06s)]
*  and why you seem to be incapable [[03:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14212.58s)]
*  of finishing a single project? [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14215.62s)]
*  Okay, that was a lovely framed question. [[03:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14217.34s)]
*  So Harpoon 2 is actually done. [[03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14220.06s)]
*  This is what I did. [[03:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14221.78s)]
*  To avoid the swirl and the thousands of questions [[03:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14222.62s)]
*  I will inevitably get. [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14225.22s)]
*  I kept the master branch as Harpoon 1 [[03:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14226.66s)]
*  and I've kept Harpoon 2 as Harpoon 2 branch. [[03:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14228.46s)]
*  And people that don't read the readme to say [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14231.38s)]
*  that I just use Harpoon 2 now, that's their fault. [[03:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14233.3s)]
*  That's it. [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14238.039999999999s)]
*  I just don't want, I really don't like answering [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14238.88s)]
*  hundreds of questions about open source stuff. [[03:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14240.84s)]
*  I used to love doing open source and all that, [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14243.48s)]
*  but I kind of got my soul crushed during the Falcor years. [[03:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14245.36s)]
*  And so I guess I'm just kind of allergic [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14247.92s)]
*  to being a really active maintainer. [[03:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14249.880000000001s)]
*  I build everything just for me. [[03:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14253.48s)]
*  Like Harpoon's just literally just built for me. [[03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14254.76s)]
*  It's just what I spent three months trying to figure out [[03:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14256.64s)]
*  the most optimal navigation for files. [[03:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14260.28s)]
*  And that's what I came up with. [[03:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14262.880000000001s)]
*  So Harpoon, it's a take on alternate file. [[03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14263.76s)]
*  If you're familiar with alternate file, [[03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14266.04s)]
*  typically you'll have this in all editors [[03:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14267.960000000001s)]
*  where you can go back to the file you were just in. [[03:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14269.56s)]
*  And so that means you can have effectively two files [[03:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14272.88s)]
*  you swap back and forth in. [[03:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14274.84s)]
*  You probably used it a bunch, really fast way to navigate. [[03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14276.119999999999s)]
*  Pretty nice thing to do. [[03:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14278.48s)]
*  I wanted something with, I want alternate file, [[03:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14280.08s)]
*  but like three of them or four of them. [[03:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14281.92s)]
*  And so that's all Harpoon is, [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14284.48s)]
*  is just being able to pin a file. [[03:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14285.68s)]
*  And so I have one button to press to go to a file, [[03:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14287.519999999999s)]
*  another for another, another for another. [[03:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14289.439999999999s)]
*  And so I can have up to four. [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14290.84s)]
*  So I just had my four power fingers for Dvorak. [[03:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14291.8s)]
*  What is that? [[03:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14294.519999999999s)]
*  That's HTN-S. [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14295.359999999999s)]
*  So if I go Control-HTN or S, [[03:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14296.519999999999s)]
*  it goes to one of the four files. [[03:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14298.92s)]
*  And that's it. [[03:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14300.12s)]
*  That's all it is. [[03:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14300.960000000001s)]
*  And you could technically make it [[03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14301.8s)]
*  so you can add in functions [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14302.88s)]
*  and be able to execute things externally. [[03:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14303.960000000001s)]
*  So you can open up terminals. [[03:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14305.44s)]
*  You can send requests off to servers. [[03:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14307.28s)]
*  You can do anything you want with it. [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14308.92s)]
*  I just have it primarily designed for opening files. [[03:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14310.72s)]
*  Since you mentioned it, [[03:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14313.6s)]
*  what keyboard layout do you use? [[03:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14314.44s)]
*  Do you use Dvorak? [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14315.68s)]
*  I use Dvorak, but I use the custom version of Dvorak. [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14316.72s)]
*  The reason why I used it is in 2017, [[03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14319.28s)]
*  we were just having my second kid. [[03:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14322.44s)]
*  It was Christmas and I'm having so much pain in my arm [[03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14324.68s)]
*  and I'm sitting there freaking out like, [[03:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14327.68s)]
*  oh my gosh, is this the end of my career? [[03:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14329.16s)]
*  Am I done programming? [[03:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14331.16s)]
*  Is this all over? [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14332.44s)]
*  And so I decided that I was going [[03:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14333.720000000001s)]
*  to create my own keyboard layout, [[03:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14335.12s)]
*  optimized to prevent the pain that I'm experiencing. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14336.6s)]
*  So I used a Dvorak as the base [[03:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14339.44s)]
*  and then laid out the symbols [[03:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14341.16s)]
*  in a symmetrical, reasonable way [[03:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14342.800000000001s)]
*  so that it's opening, closing, opening, closing, [[03:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14345.28s)]
*  opening, closing, right? [[03:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14348.24s)]
*  And so it's, and they all are right here. [[03:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14349.32s)]
*  I actually have to hold Shift to press a number. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14351.24s)]
*  So symbols are actually my first thing I get to press. [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14354.24s)]
*  And so it's very optimized for a laptop keyboard layout. [[03:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14356.8s)]
*  So I can use my laptop in a very efficient, nice way. [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14361.4s)]
*  That's how I got started on Dvorak and all that. [[03:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14364.72s)]
*  I wouldn't actually recommend it if you, [[03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14367.039999999999s)]
*  cause I didn't have a Kinesis at the time. [[03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14369.039999999999s)]
*  I didn't even know Kinesis existed at that time. [[03:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14370.439999999999s)]
*  And so when I discovered Kinesis in also 2017, [[03:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14372.519999999999s)]
*  that's when I was like, oh, okay. [[03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14376.359999999999s)]
*  Would you recommend Kinesis to people? [[03:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14377.76s)]
*  I am technically sponsored by Kinesis. [[03:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14380.0s)]
*  So people, you know, it's hard for someone to believe [[03:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14383.08s)]
*  someone that's sponsored by it, [[03:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14386.24s)]
*  but I did use it before I ever became sponsored. [[03:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14387.08s)]
*  They're the only sponsor that I reached out to and said, [[03:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14388.92s)]
*  I need a sponsorship from you. [[03:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14391.24s)]
*  You are the key, I'm going to use you either way. [[03:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14392.68s)]
*  You don't, you can say no, but I really love it. [[03:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14395.36s)]
*  And for the first three years of using Kinesis, [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14397.36s)]
*  they gave me free Kinesis, Kinesi as my sponsorship. [[03:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14399.56s)]
*  Kinesi. [[04:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14404.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm always torn. [[04:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14405.4s)]
*  I tried to leave so many times. [[04:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14406.6s)]
*  You can't, it's too good. [[04:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14408.84s)]
*  But see, I have this absurd situation [[04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14410.56s)]
*  of like traveling with it. [[04:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14413.28s)]
*  I relate. [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14415.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm literally, you know, [[04:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14417.8s)]
*  going to war zone in Ukraine, a Kinesis keyboard, [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14419.039999999999s)]
*  a laptop and like just a few other small things [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14426.279999999999s)]
*  and that's it. [[04:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14430.0s)]
*  And it's like, is Kinesis keyboard really going to be [[04:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14430.84s)]
*  30% of volume that you're bringing to a war zone? [[04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14432.759999999998s)]
*  You know. [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14437.24s)]
*  Looks like the answer is yes. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14438.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14438.92s)]
*  Like, do you really derive that much value? [[04:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14440.0s)]
*  I think it's probably spiritual or psychological for me. [[04:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14443.12s)]
*  It feels like home. [[04:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14445.76s)]
*  It's just comfort associated with it. [[04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14446.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14448.480000000001s)]
*  I try to leave. [[04:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14449.36s)]
*  And I love this experience. [[04:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14450.68s)]
*  You just, it's like a relationship you have with the thing. [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14451.960000000001s)]
*  It is. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14456.08s)]
*  It's, I'm trying to figure out if it's a toxic relationship. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14456.92s)]
*  I think it's mostly love. [[04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14459.68s)]
*  I think it's love. [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14462.04s)]
*  Like all relationships, there's some, you know, [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14462.880000000001s)]
*  push and pull complications, but. [[04:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14464.880000000001s)]
*  They say that distance makes the heart grow fonder. [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14466.6s)]
*  So maybe sometimes the Kinesis keyboard needs to stay at home [[04:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14468.84s)]
*  and the laptop keyboard can be the one [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14472.56s)]
*  so that your heart grows even more fond [[04:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14473.599999999999s)]
*  and that connection grows even deeper. [[04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14476.32s)]
*  I already miss it as you say it. [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14478.32s)]
*  So I don't know. [[04:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14479.72s)]
*  I think it's coming, coming along to all the trips. [[04:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14480.56s)]
*  If it breaks down though, you know, [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14483.24s)]
*  I was worried that Kinesis was shut down as a company. [[04:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14484.96s)]
*  I'm like, what's the business model here? [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14487.279999999999s)]
*  Who actually uses these keyboards, right? [[04:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14488.96s)]
*  But apparently it's still going strong. [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14491.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14493.56s)]
*  Who uses these keyboards as you use the keyboard? [[04:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14495.48s)]
*  You're like, I have to take it with me everywhere. [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14497.88s)]
*  I wonder who uses these keyboards. [[04:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14500.32s)]
*  Yep. [[04:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14502.36s)]
*  I should mention that one of the things, [[04:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14503.68s)]
*  when I first became a fan of yours, [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14507.08s)]
*  I heard you talk about coffee and terminal. [[04:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14508.76s)]
*  I still don't, by the way, [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14511.68s)]
*  understand what you've been talking about. [[04:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14512.96s)]
*  I need to actually use it, but you are, [[04:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14515.279999999999s)]
*  you run amongst many things, a coffee company. [[04:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14518.32s)]
*  Man, this smells so good. [[04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14523.52s)]
*  So this one is dark mode, dark roast whole coffee beans. [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14525.24s)]
*  There is a seg origin, dash dash location. [[04:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14528.84s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff on there. [[04:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14534.04s)]
*  Stuff on there that's very devy, shop, server, web. [[04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14536.32s)]
*  Can you legit order coffee via SSH? [[04:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14541.48s)]
*  So as of right now, [[04:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14545.44s)]
*  it's the only way you can get the coffee is via SSH. [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14546.44s)]
*  That was kind of, okay, so can I just origin story you? [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14550.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14553.44s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[04:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14554.52s)]
*  I was going to do some kind of command line, [[04:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14555.36s)]
*  command to request or like dash dash help or something, [[04:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14557.72s)]
*  or like man. [[04:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14560.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man coffee. [[04:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14561.24s)]
*  Man coffee. [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14562.96s)]
*  Okay, so TJ and I, again, same Teej, Teej TV, [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14564.199999999999s)]
*  about, by the way, very amazing designs done by David Hill. [[04:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14568.56s)]
*  They're very, very good. [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14572.279999999999s)]
*  So let me kind of give the basic ideas. [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14573.8s)]
*  Like it must've been about a year, a year and a half ago, [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14575.64s)]
*  TJ and I were talking like, hey, you know, [[04:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14579.119999999999s)]
*  every one of these people that have like [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14582.0s)]
*  some sort of following, some sort of online presence, [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14583.359999999999s)]
*  they're always like selling a thing. [[04:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14585.32s)]
*  I got nothing to sell. [[04:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14588.36s)]
*  I don't really want to do merch. [[04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14589.2s)]
*  I've never really enjoyed doing merch. [[04:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14590.04s)]
*  I just find that, I don't know, [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14591.52s)]
*  it's just not as much fun for me. [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14593.12s)]
*  Don't want to have a tequila. [[04:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14594.720000000001s)]
*  I don't want a tequila. [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14596.28s)]
*  I want something that, [[04:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14597.44s)]
*  and I also want something [[04:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14599.4s)]
*  that I really don't feel bad about selling. [[04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14600.24s)]
*  You know, there's like a lot of people [[04:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14603.24s)]
*  that will go on the internet [[04:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14604.24s)]
*  and they'll show for a whole bunch of products. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14605.28s)]
*  Like, oh, okay, try this, try this. [[04:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14607.04s)]
*  And this is why I've only ever really done kinesis [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14608.640000000001s)]
*  is because it's like, well, [[04:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14610.560000000001s)]
*  I can point to something that was really bad in my life. [[04:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14611.84s)]
*  I was very scared and now it's not bad anymore. [[04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14614.36s)]
*  So it's like, okay, that one made sense, [[04:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14616.36s)]
*  but everything else always has been, [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14618.0s)]
*  you know, it's harder for me. [[04:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14620.08s)]
*  And so we just talked for so long and we love NeoVim. [[04:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14621.880000000001s)]
*  So we're just like, [[04:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14624.720000000001s)]
*  why haven't we could do something from NeoVim? [[04:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14625.560000000001s)]
*  And we're kind of like laughing about that. [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14627.36s)]
*  Like ordering from NeoVim is just so ridiculous. [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14628.84s)]
*  And then at some point we're just like, [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14631.68s)]
*  well, wait a second. [[04:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14634.12s)]
*  And maybe we could do like coffee. [[04:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14635.2s)]
*  Like every developer loves coffee. [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14637.76s)]
*  Maybe we could figure out this coffee business. [[04:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14639.28s)]
*  And so I had a good friend named Dax, THDXR. [[04:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14641.68s)]
*  Dax, yeah, Dax. [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14646.68s)]
*  He, the most sassiest man alive. [[04:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14648.439999999999s)]
*  Sassiest? [[04:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14651.119999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, he has a lot of sass. [[04:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14651.96s)]
*  Beard? [[04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14653.16s)]
*  Yep, he has a beard. [[04:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14654.0s)]
*  Very, he does SST. [[04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14656.199999999999s)]
*  He does a lot of stuff. [[04:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14658.599999999999s)]
*  Very, very talented. [[04:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14659.48s)]
*  We'll call him DevOps engineer. [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14661.199999999999s)]
*  He's more than that, but very talented guy. [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14662.72s)]
*  Him and another person named Adam.dev, vegan, by the way. [[04:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14665.76s)]
*  Great guy. [[04:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14669.4s)]
*  We take him to Korean barbecue all the time. [[04:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14670.24s)]
*  He eats nothing. [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14672.0s)]
*  And Liz, she has been super important [[04:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14674.92s)]
*  to the Terminal Coffee Company. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14677.36s)]
*  I think without her, we would not have been able to do [[04:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14679.0s)]
*  what we have done. [[04:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14681.119999999999s)]
*  And then also David Hill designer. [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14682.119999999999s)]
*  He does Laravel. [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14683.68s)]
*  He designs for Laravel. [[04:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14685.56s)]
*  Very talented designer. [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14686.44s)]
*  And so we all kind of came together [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14687.8s)]
*  and we were just laughing about how can we like, [[04:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14690.199999999999s)]
*  could we do something that's just ridiculous? [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14692.8s)]
*  And that's kind of what we came up with. [[04:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14695.84s)]
*  Yeah, you like, there you go. [[04:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14697.48s)]
*  You just opened the website. [[04:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14698.48s)]
*  You literally cannot order. [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14699.880000000001s)]
*  We actually do not allow you to order. [[04:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14702.44s)]
*  The website is something that kind of looks [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14704.960000000001s)]
*  like the terminal use command below [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14708.44s)]
*  to order your delicious whole coffee. [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14710.16s)]
*  SSH terminal dot shop. [[04:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14711.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so you can only SSH into it. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14714.2s)]
*  So you have to copy that command and throw it in there. [[04:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14716.24s)]
*  If you want to add in the little terminal shop [[04:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14718.640000000001s)]
*  for your known host, you could do that. [[04:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14720.36s)]
*  How do you handle payment? [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14721.960000000001s)]
*  Through Stripe. [[04:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14724.16s)]
*  And so one of the things where we'll be adding [[04:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14725.84s)]
*  a mobile checkout to where I'll show a QR code [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14727.12s)]
*  in the terminal and you can just like check out [[04:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14730.04s)]
*  on your phone, but right now you enter in your credentials, [[04:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14731.28s)]
*  it goes to Stripe. [[04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14733.960000000001s)]
*  Via all terminal. [[04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14734.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, SSH is obviously, it stands for secure shell. [[04:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14736.640000000001s)]
*  It uses elliptical, quantum safe algorithms [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14738.960000000001s)]
*  to ensure that your data is not being intercepted. [[04:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14742.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but does it use AI? [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14745.320000000002s)]
*  I'm pretty sure DAX uses AI. [[04:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14748.28s)]
*  So that counts. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14750.2s)]
*  You said quantum, so I don't know. [[04:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14751.04s)]
*  Quantum AI, fusion quantum AI. [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14752.480000000001s)]
*  Can this even be a company if it's not using AI? [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14755.84s)]
*  We have some crypto chains with some quantum AI [[04:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14759.92s)]
*  that's powered by fusion. [[04:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14761.48s)]
*  So it's pretty wild. [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14763.2s)]
*  Anyway, so yeah, we just kind of came together [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14764.68s)]
*  where we thought what is the most, [[04:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14766.36s)]
*  that was from the Mike Tyson fight. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14767.92s)]
*  All right, it was literally that night, [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14769.4s)]
*  Mike Tyson kissed the reporter and then walked out [[04:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14771.32s)]
*  without any clothes. [[04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14774.64s)]
*  We did an ad for somebody. [[04:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14776.08s)]
*  But we decided to make a coffee shop. [[04:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14777.6s)]
*  And then we thought, instead of just making it Neovim, [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14779.96s)]
*  what if we made it from SSH? [[04:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14781.96s)]
*  Cause everybody has SSH. [[04:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14785.76s)]
*  You have VS code, launch VS code. [[04:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14787.16s)]
*  You can order coffee from within VS code, right? [[04:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14789.2s)]
*  Cause your little bottom terminal has access to SSH. [[04:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14792.16s)]
*  Bada bing, bada boom. [[04:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14794.92s)]
*  It's kind of fun. [[04:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14795.76s)]
*  And so we kind of really, [[04:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14796.64s)]
*  I love this. [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14799.36s)]
*  We just wanted to do something where there's no level [[04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14800.2s)]
*  and there's no world that makes me feel bad [[04:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14802.72s)]
*  about selling this and people buying it. [[04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14805.0s)]
*  It's good, ethical coffee. [[04:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14806.72s)]
*  We developed the entire supply chain and everything. [[04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14809.039999999999s)]
*  It's all packaged, it's all boutique. [[04:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14811.96s)]
*  It's all really like, it's pretty high-end coffee. [[04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14813.68s)]
*  It tastes really, really good. [[04:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14816.72s)]
*  At this point, I don't like drinking other coffee. [[04:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14817.92s)]
*  I get kind of upset about it cause it's not as good. [[04:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14819.8s)]
*  And so it's kind of funny that I've fallen [[04:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14822.08s)]
*  for my own stuff. [[04:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14824.119999999999s)]
*  I'm high on my own supply pretty hard right now. [[04:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14824.96s)]
*  I just got done ordering 16 bags and gave it out [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14827.56s)]
*  to my family to try to convince them. [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14829.56s)]
*  But it's just something where it's like, [[04:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14831.199999999999s)]
*  I didn't sell you a software product [[04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14834.48s)]
*  that's gonna influence your startup [[04:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14836.0s)]
*  that could potentially lead to disaster. [[04:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14837.56s)]
*  I didn't convince you to do a bunch of stuff [[04:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14839.84s)]
*  that's gonna change your career. [[04:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14842.48s)]
*  I just said, hey, here's some coffee. [[04:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14844.199999999999s)]
*  It's like a fun experience. [[04:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14846.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14847.76s)]
*  Everything, the humor on is great. [[04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14848.6s)]
*  People should go to terminal.shop. [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14850.84s)]
*  SSH, terminal.shop. [[04:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14852.92s)]
*  I was speaking to people that don't know what SSH is. [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14854.720000000001s)]
*  And there you can read the command [[04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14857.36s)]
*  and then figure out how to use SSH in order to, [[04:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14860.28s)]
*  I mean, it's the kind of documentation, right, [[04:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14863.6s)]
*  on the website. [[04:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14865.36s)]
*  If you can't use SSH, you probably should just not [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14867.0s)]
*  worry about buying your coffee. [[04:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14870.16s)]
*  Like that's the whole- [[04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14871.560000000001s)]
*  Well, you can learn. [[04:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14872.4s)]
*  You can learn. [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14873.220000000001s)]
*  If you're active and you're a computer person, [[04:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14874.06s)]
*  you'd like to launch the terminal [[04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14875.46s)]
*  and feel like a hacker, go for it. [[04:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14876.58s)]
*  We even have subscriptions. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14878.06s)]
*  What I would love to see, [[04:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14879.82s)]
*  this is how it came up, I think, [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14881.779999999999s)]
*  on the cursor conversation is that [[04:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14882.82s)]
*  I would love it if an AI agent did this, [[04:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14885.859999999999s)]
*  like Anthropis computer use or something like that. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14890.34s)]
*  Actually took the action of ordering the coffee [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14894.3s)]
*  while it was programming. [[04:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14896.42s)]
*  Yeah, like, hey, order me some coffee. [[04:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14897.5s)]
*  And it'd actually go off. [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14899.18s)]
*  Give me dark roast, order coffee. [[04:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14900.199999999999s)]
*  It could actually go through the whole flow of ordering. [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14901.5s)]
*  The whole flow, but even better, [[04:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14904.300000000001s)]
*  if you didn't ask it to order coffee, [[04:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14905.980000000001s)]
*  you asked it to do something. [[04:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14907.820000000002s)]
*  And as a tangent, as a side quest, it did that, [[04:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14909.34s)]
*  which is computer use does that, right? [[04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14913.94s)]
*  They showed off that it's able to go to, I think, [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14915.86s)]
*  like Google for some images, take a pause, [[04:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14920.66s)]
*  and then continue doing other stuff. [[04:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14922.7s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, super cool idea. [[04:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14925.060000000001s)]
*  Love it. [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14926.68s)]
*  Speaking of which, let's talk about AI. [[04:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14927.54s)]
*  All right. [[04:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14929.980000000001s)]
*  You've been both sort of positive and negative [[04:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14930.82s)]
*  on the role of AI in the whole programming, [[04:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14933.82s)]
*  software engineering experience. [[04:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14936.539999999999s)]
*  As it stands today, what do you think, [[04:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14938.38s)]
*  what's your general view about AI? [[04:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14940.779999999999s)]
*  What is it effective at? [[04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14942.98s)]
*  What is it not so good at? [[04:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14944.3s)]
*  Okay, so my general view is, [[04:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14946.42s)]
*  it comes down to something that's pretty simple, [[04:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14949.34s)]
*  which is that if you're doing something [[04:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14951.58s)]
*  in which is very predictable, AI is really nice. [[04:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14955.42s)]
*  When you're doing something that is just not predictable, [[04:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14960.9s)]
*  AI is not very nice to use. [[04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14963.86s)]
*  If you're using anything that's more cutting edge, [[04:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14966.74s)]
*  AI will not be using it, [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14968.98s)]
*  or AI won't be very good at doing stuff with it. [[04:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14970.38s)]
*  Like it's not great at Zig, [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14973.26s)]
*  because Zig is just like, say, less documented. [[04:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14975.26s)]
*  It's really great at TypeScript. [[04:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14977.539999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of interesting things [[04:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14979.3s)]
*  that are going to come down through AI [[04:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14983.46s)]
*  that I think a lot of people aren't really prepared for [[04:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14985.74s)]
*  or thinking through. [[04:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14988.119999999999s)]
*  TJ is kind of the genesis of this idea, [[04:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14989.26s)]
*  but the idea that I think there's going to be a lot of [[04:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14991.02s)]
*  kind of market manipulation, if you will, through AI, [[04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14994.34s)]
*  meaning like, hey, you want to research, say, [[04:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=14997.06s)]
*  best woodworking tools. [[04:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15001.5s)]
*  Someone's going to be buying an ad spot. [[04:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15003.14s)]
*  Someone's going to be buying premium training data. [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15004.66s)]
*  They're the ones that get the big boosts in the LLMs, [[04:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15007.74s)]
*  but LLMs don't really have to market as an advertisement, [[04:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15010.42s)]
*  because it's not really directly an advertisement. [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15012.42s)]
*  They just had a more premium spot, per se, [[04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15015.62s)]
*  in the training data. [[04:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15018.22s)]
*  A little bit extra learning to it. [[04:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15019.9s)]
*  It's like, there's a lot of things about AI [[04:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15021.46s)]
*  that I fear upcoming. [[04:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15022.699999999999s)]
*  A lot of it just comes down to people not learning [[04:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15025.019999999999s)]
*  or making the trade-off where productivity [[04:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15028.779999999999s)]
*  is the only thing that matters. [[04:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15030.46s)]
*  And I don't think productivity [[04:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15032.3s)]
*  is the only thing that matters. [[04:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15033.619999999999s)]
*  If you want to build something complex and difficult, [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15034.539999999999s)]
*  productivity is not the only thing. [[04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15036.779999999999s)]
*  You actually are going to have to do deep learning [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15038.5s)]
*  and kind of pursue it beyond the basics. [[04:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15040.26s)]
*  And so I see AI as kind of like this really cool thing. [[04:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15042.46s)]
*  It feels like a magic trick. [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15047.46s)]
*  I remember the first time I used it, [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15049.38s)]
*  I got early access to GitHub Copilot. [[04:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15050.699999999999s)]
*  In fact, Nat Friedman saw my Twitch clip [[04:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15053.179999999998s)]
*  of me asking GitHub for it, [[04:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15055.259999999998s)]
*  and he sent me early access himself. [[04:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15056.98s)]
*  It was awesome. [[04:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15059.019999999999s)]
*  And when I used it, it predicted an if statement correct, [[04:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15060.099999999999s)]
*  and my mind was just absolutely blown, [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15063.22s)]
*  because I had nothing before then. [[04:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15065.9s)]
*  And now it's just like first time ever. [[04:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15067.699999999999s)]
*  And I just remember thinking, [[04:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15069.419999999998s)]
*  man, this is going to change programming so much. [[04:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15070.259999999998s)]
*  And then the more I used it, the more I just... [[04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15072.38s)]
*  For me personally, I kept introducing bugs. [[04:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15075.38s)]
*  And I couldn't figure out why. [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15079.019999999999s)]
*  And what I realized is that I kind of developed, [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15080.339999999998s)]
*  I wasn't copiloting well, I was autopiloting much better. [[04:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15082.66s)]
*  And my ability to read code versus my ability [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15086.019999999999s)]
*  to critically think and write code, [[04:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15088.46s)]
*  they're definitely different sets of skill levels. [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15090.179999999998s)]
*  I don't consider as well when I just read code [[04:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15091.939999999999s)]
*  as opposed to when I write code. [[04:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15095.22s)]
*  And so I struggled there. [[04:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15096.38s)]
*  I do think that's the skill set. [[04:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15098.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, skill issue for sure. [[04:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15100.339999999998s)]
*  Skill issue. [[04:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15102.14s)]
*  For people who are not aware, that's like a hashtag thing. [[04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15103.300000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you use mockingly. [[04:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15106.42s)]
*  In this case, there's like several layers, [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15107.62s)]
*  mockingly, but also seriously. [[04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15110.380000000001s)]
*  Meaning like the criticism is grounded in the fact [[04:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15112.54s)]
*  that you lack the skill versus [[04:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15115.22s)]
*  of some kind of fundamental truth. [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15117.86s)]
*  Yes. [[04:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15119.82s)]
*  I think that that's the reason I use actually [[04:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15120.66s)]
*  copilot cursor a lot, [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15124.02s)]
*  is for developing the skill of editing AI. [[04:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15127.78s)]
*  So I can just learn how to do that better and better. [[04:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15131.46s)]
*  Because I think as I do that better and better, [[04:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15134.779999999999s)]
*  I start to utilize AI better. [[04:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15136.699999999999s)]
*  At this time, it is a bit of a boilerplate code thing. [[04:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15141.98s)]
*  But you can do out of the box kind of novel design decisions [[04:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15147.539999999999s)]
*  or tricky design decisions from scratch, [[04:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15151.58s)]
*  but fill out stuff using AI [[04:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15155.58s)]
*  and then just learn the skill of modifying. [[04:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15160.7s)]
*  I personally just, [[04:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15163.9s)]
*  it's more fun to program with AI. [[04:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15166.98s)]
*  Even when I delete a lot of the code, it's more fun. [[04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15169.38s)]
*  It's less lonely. [[04:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15172.9s)]
*  It's more, it's what I imagine like pair programming to be, [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15175.18s)]
*  but I've never done it. [[04:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15180.26s)]
*  But it just feels like that friction that you get [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15181.42s)]
*  when you're like staring at an empty thing is not there. [[04:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15186.86s)]
*  Like empty function, empty class, [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15191.26s)]
*  it's just more fun, less lonely. [[04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15194.54s)]
*  And I do think that a lot of the easier type of coding, [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15199.26s)]
*  it really helps with like interacting with APIs, [[04:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15203.7s)]
*  basic things that I would usually have to look up [[04:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15209.22s)]
*  to stack overflow for, it's just really fast at that. [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15212.06s)]
*  As examples, just interacting with the YouTube API. [[04:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15217.06s)]
*  The YouTube API documentation is not very good [[04:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15221.82s)]
*  and you can just load it all in there [[04:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15225.26s)]
*  and ask it to generate a set of functions [[04:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15227.82s)]
*  that access the API, all kinds of read and write operations [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15232.38s)]
*  and it figures it all out. [[04:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15237.14s)]
*  And then you can just, well, you do have to read. [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15238.859999999999s)]
*  You have to read and check everything. [[04:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15241.3s)]
*  And you start to develop the skill of understanding [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15244.1s)]
*  where it misinterpreted the task. [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15247.300000000001s)]
*  So you're, what is that skill? [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15251.140000000001s)]
*  I don't even know. [[04:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15253.5s)]
*  You have to kind of be empathic about what the AI is, [[04:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15254.32s)]
*  what its limitations are. [[04:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15260.42s)]
*  A lot of the times that has to do with prompt engineering. [[04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15262.54s)]
*  You have to like at the same time understand [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15268.58s)]
*  what the AI is aware of. [[04:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15274.5s)]
*  Like what did you actually give it as data [[04:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15278.460000000001s)]
*  to be able to generate the code? [[04:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15282.34s)]
*  A lot of times we don't realize [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15284.78s)]
*  that we're not giving it enough information. [[04:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15286.5s)]
*  So you have to like, actually, okay, all right. [[04:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15288.380000000001s)]
*  You have to like be empathic, be like, okay, [[04:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15290.94s)]
*  these are the code, the files it's aware of. [[04:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15293.460000000001s)]
*  This is the specifics of the question you asked it. [[04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15297.42s)]
*  You have to imagine you're an intern [[04:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15301.800000000001s)]
*  that doesn't know anything else. [[04:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15305.44s)]
*  Oftentimes we want the AI to figure out the things [[04:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15309.08s)]
*  that's left unspoken, but you can't know those things. [[04:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15311.74s)]
*  You have to specify those things. [[04:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15315.44s)]
*  And so you have to actually be much more deliberate [[04:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15317.560000000001s)]
*  and rigorous in the things you specify. [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15320.720000000001s)]
*  It's a spell it out. [[04:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15323.2s)]
*  And so I just have this sea of prompts that I have saved up [[04:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15324.880000000001s)]
*  and I'm building these like library [[04:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15329.36s)]
*  of different templates for prompts. [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15331.68s)]
*  And it's a mess. [[04:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15333.6s)]
*  And I'm sure there's a lot of developers [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15335.0s)]
*  that have this similar kind of mess. [[04:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15336.68s)]
*  So a lot of it has to do long-term with the tooling [[04:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15338.76s)]
*  that's going to improve that. [[04:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15341.12s)]
*  One, the systems are gonna get much more intelligent [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15342.560000000001s)]
*  where you don't need the nuance. [[04:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15344.640000000001s)]
*  And two, there's going to be the tooling [[04:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15347.18s)]
*  that allows you to specify those things [[04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15349.1s)]
*  and load it in correctly and give all the context [[04:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15351.02s)]
*  that the system needs in order to make the good decisions. [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15353.78s)]
*  And maybe the system asks you follow-up questions [[04:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15356.56s)]
*  where here's things you didn't make clear, [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15359.359999999999s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[04:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15361.56s)]
*  A lot of that has to do with the interface, [[04:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15362.68s)]
*  with the actual design of the tools, [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15364.439999999999s)]
*  like we said with Cursor. [[04:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15366.32s)]
*  It's going to keep getting better and better and better. [[04:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15367.84s)]
*  So my sense is like developers in general [[04:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15369.859999999999s)]
*  should be learning this to see, to not be left behind, [[04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15373.56s)]
*  to see how that can be used as a superpower [[04:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15378.48s)]
*  to boost their productivity, their effectiveness, [[04:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15384.48s)]
*  their joy of programming versus like be seen [[04:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15387.439999999999s)]
*  as a competitor to them or something like that. [[04:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15390.84s)]
*  So, but for me already, [[04:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15393.32s)]
*  it's been a big boost to productivity. [[04:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15399.56s)]
*  Like actual, like if you measure the actual, [[04:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15403.359999999999s)]
*  how quickly you're able to get a thing done. [[04:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15406.08s)]
*  It's been a big, and measure not across minutes [[04:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15410.439999999999s)]
*  and hours, but days also. [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15414.18s)]
*  Like sometimes there's things I have to do [[04:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15415.02s)]
*  that are not that important that I'll just like [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15417.74s)]
*  out of procrastination, will push off. [[04:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15419.9s)]
*  And AI helps me actually get it done. [[04:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15422.66s)]
*  Like actually, cause like that thing, the empty page, [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15425.02s)]
*  like I mentioned before, it helps me write the thing, [[04:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15427.86s)]
*  get it done, get it tested, like ship the thing. [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15431.58s)]
*  Maybe it's just because it's just less lonely [[04:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15435.54s)]
*  to work with an AI. [[04:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15437.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[04:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15438.42s)]
*  I don't know if any of that made sense, but. [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15439.26s)]
*  It all made perfect sense. [[04:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15442.18s)]
*  I really do like that phrase. [[04:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15443.5s)]
*  It makes it less lonely. [[04:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15444.7s)]
*  I think there's something to that that's kind of interesting [[04:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15445.66s)]
*  having just some level of interaction [[04:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15447.86s)]
*  that's not just like an LSP autocomplete. [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15449.58s)]
*  Like having something that's actually a little bit more [[04:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15451.86s)]
*  than just that, where it actually is kind of thinking [[04:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15454.220000000001s)]
*  through and you can see a different thought. [[04:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15456.42s)]
*  And you're like, oh, wow, that's like, [[04:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15457.94s)]
*  that's a way different approach than I would have taken. [[04:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15459.36s)]
*  Hey, that's kind of cool. [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15461.18s)]
*  I like these kinds of things. [[04:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15462.300000000001s)]
*  And the thing is that I'm not like a AI negative person. [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15463.7s)]
*  I can see why people really, really like it. [[04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15466.960000000001s)]
*  I just haven't, like, I just, every time I used Copilot [[04:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15471.06s)]
*  from when Nat gave me the access all the way up [[04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15474.18s)]
*  until about six months ago. [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15477.9s)]
*  Like that's how I used it for quite some time. [[04:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15478.9s)]
*  And I really did enjoy the things I used out of it. [[04:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15480.7s)]
*  It just never, it kind of did the opposite for me. [[04:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15483.54s)]
*  I felt like I was more reviewing than writing. [[04:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15486.380000000001s)]
*  And I felt like I was more kind of just letting things slide [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15489.06s)]
*  or I just didn't really think too heavily about stuff. [[04:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15493.06s)]
*  And it just, I wasn't as engaged. [[04:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15496.34s)]
*  And so I'm like, okay, [[04:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15498.48s)]
*  so something's kind of wrong here. [[04:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15499.32s)]
*  And that's just like a me personal thing. [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15500.36s)]
*  So I recognize that is not how someone [[04:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15501.88s)]
*  should approach these things. [[04:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15503.68s)]
*  That's not a good reason for why you should [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15505.02s)]
*  or should not use AI. [[04:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15506.68s)]
*  Like, I just don't think that that's right. [[04:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15508.16s)]
*  Cause I could probably correct that [[04:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15509.279999999999s)]
*  and figure out a better way to do it. [[04:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15510.48s)]
*  I've been meaning to have another AI round. [[04:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15512.16s)]
*  And so I've been thinking about like, [[04:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15514.48s)]
*  maybe I just need to spend like two weeks in cursor [[04:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15516.0s)]
*  and just like fully embrace what does it mean [[04:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15518.72s)]
*  to be somebody like this? [[04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15520.94s)]
*  And what can I do with this, like these new powers? [[04:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15521.96s)]
*  Have they improved to the point [[04:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15526.02s)]
*  where they're actually good? [[04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15527.18s)]
*  And I mean, for me, [[04:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15528.56s)]
*  cause like a lot of the decisions I make, [[04:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15529.92s)]
*  a lot of the little functions I'm writing, [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15531.4s)]
*  it's not cause I'm trying to write this function [[04:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15532.8s)]
*  to solve this problem. [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15534.48s)]
*  It's cause I'm writing these functions or this set, [[04:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15535.8s)]
*  not just to solve this problem, [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15538.06s)]
*  but because I know in about another 2000 lines of code [[04:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15539.279999999999s)]
*  of building all these other things, [[04:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15542.24s)]
*  I'm gonna need to start doing this next activity. [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15543.359999999999s)]
*  So it's like, I'm trying to like really try [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15545.6s)]
*  to chess move myself into the exact things [[04:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15547.519999999999s)]
*  that as I let things go faster, [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15549.8s)]
*  I kind of fall apart on that chess move. [[04:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15552.0s)]
*  And again, skill issues for on my behalf. [[04:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15554.439999999999s)]
*  And I mean, in the truest sense of the word, [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15557.2s)]
*  where it's like, I'm making your critique [[04:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15558.92s)]
*  because I don't use it well enough. [[04:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15560.68s)]
*  The better you are programming, [[04:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15563.16s)]
*  I don't know if this is a general rule, [[04:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15564.640000000001s)]
*  this is my anecdotal data, [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15565.720000000001s)]
*  the better you are programming, [[04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15566.84s)]
*  the less you wanna use the AI, [[04:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15567.960000000001s)]
*  the more gets in the way. [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15570.2s)]
*  Like the good programmers- [[04:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15571.720000000001s)]
*  Fair enough as far as I can tell. [[04:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15572.880000000001s)]
*  So like the more sort of beginner programmers [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15574.28s)]
*  are much more happy to use AI. [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15576.960000000001s)]
*  You know, when I use AI is for basic, [[04:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15579.400000000001s)]
*  like for just like, I don't know if there's a better term, [[04:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15582.08s)]
*  it's not boilerplate, [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15585.76s)]
*  but it's like pretty easy programming. [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15587.4s)]
*  And that kind of programming is much easier to do. [[04:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15588.759999999998s)]
*  Like the sort of the 10X, not to use the meme, [[04:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15591.48s)]
*  sort of programmers that I know, [[04:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15594.16s)]
*  that are ultra productive and brilliant people, [[04:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15596.119999999999s)]
*  they just, they hate AI. [[04:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15599.359999999999s)]
*  They're like, this is nowhere close to what's needed. [[04:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15600.759999999998s)]
*  So that there's something to that. [[04:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15603.519999999999s)]
*  I still think they should be using AI just for the learning [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15605.24s)]
*  because it's gonna get smarter, it's going to get better. [[04:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15610.64s)]
*  And it's the same thing. [[04:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15612.92s)]
*  Because like when you super optimize NeoVim [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15615.32s)]
*  or super optimize EMAX, [[04:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15618.6s)]
*  you may not discover the new things that are in the pipeline. [[04:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15620.64s)]
*  So it's always good to be sort of training in that way. [[04:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15624.119999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you a question here, [[04:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15626.4s)]
*  just kind of from my understanding. [[04:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15627.8s)]
*  You talked about this idea that you have all these kind of [[04:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15628.96s)]
*  LLM kind of prompts all like this big backlog [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15631.16s)]
*  of messy LLM prompts that you kind of have these templates [[04:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15633.92s)]
*  for that you can do various actions. [[04:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15636.36s)]
*  You probably, you have these strategies of making it [[04:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15638.44s)]
*  self-explain itself and then do the right thing, right? [[04:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15640.44s)]
*  Like you have, as far as I can tell, [[04:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15642.36s)]
*  that's really built into a lot of people. [[04:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15644.48s)]
*  Well, then you make this phrase where like, [[04:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15646.8s)]
*  but then at some point the interface is gonna get better [[04:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15648.4s)]
*  and maybe it can do a lot of these things better [[04:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15650.6s)]
*  where I won't need that. [[04:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15652.119999999999s)]
*  Then my question is, [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15653.6s)]
*  well, is anyone actually falling behind for not using AI then? [[04:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15654.64s)]
*  Because if the interface is gonna change so greatly [[04:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15660.64s)]
*  that all of your habits need to fundamentally change [[04:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15662.52s)]
*  and it will be able to clarify and make all those statements, [[04:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15664.88s)]
*  have I actually fallen behind at all? [[04:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15667.279999999999s)]
*  Or will the next gen like actually just be so different [[04:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15669.359999999999s)]
*  from the current one that it's kind of like, [[04:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15671.92s)]
*  you're over there like actually doing punch card AI right now. [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15674.8s)]
*  I'm gonna come in at compiler time AI. [[04:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15677.88s)]
*  So different that it's like, what's a punch card? [[04:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15680.039999999999s)]
*  So obviously open question is a fascinating one. [[04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15683.52s)]
*  I personally think yes, you're falling behind, not you, [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15686.08s)]
*  but if you're not playing with it, you're falling behind [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15690.84s)]
*  because the thing I'm doing with the prompts [[04:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15694.56s)]
*  is you're learning, you're building up like this [[04:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15698.68s)]
*  intuition about how AI works. [[04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15703.84s)]
*  You're understanding like what is its strengths and weaknesses, [[04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15707.2s)]
*  not even the current version, [[04:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15711.08s)]
*  but the next version and so on. [[04:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15712.28s)]
*  Like what does it mean to teach an AI system about the world? [[04:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15714.16s)]
*  Like what kind of information does it need [[04:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15720.4s)]
*  to make effective decisions? [[04:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15724.52s)]
*  I think that does transfer to smarter and smarter models. [[04:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15726.2s)]
*  You'll need to make less rigorous [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15729.64s)]
*  and specific in details instructions over time, [[04:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15733.8s)]
*  but you still have to have that kind of thing. [[04:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15736.96s)]
*  I think it's a skill of almost empathy with an AI system [[04:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15741.119999999999s)]
*  because it doesn't know, you know what it's missing? [[04:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15744.0s)]
*  It's missing like common sense. [[04:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15747.119999999999s)]
*  It's missing long-term memory. [[04:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15749.32s)]
*  A lot of things when we talk to other humans, [[04:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15751.199999999999s)]
*  they have a basic common sense about reality. [[04:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15755.16s)]
*  And AI systems often lack that kind of common sense. [[04:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15758.08s)]
*  And they also don't remember things. [[04:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15762.44s)]
*  So you have to like realize there's a constant [[04:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15764.96s)]
*  blank slate happening. [[04:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15768.52s)]
*  So it's almost like just a skill of talking to an AI system [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15771.6s)]
*  that I'm training. [[04:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15776.64s)]
*  And by having to write all those prompts [[04:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15778.68s)]
*  and communicating back and forth to understand [[04:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15781.28s)]
*  what kind of prompts work better or not, [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15783.36s)]
*  you build up that intuition. [[04:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15785.24s)]
*  And also just raw the skill of reading somebody else's code. [[04:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15786.96s)]
*  Maybe for people who work on Mars teams, [[04:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15791.0s)]
*  that's a skill that's already developed. [[04:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15793.199999999999s)]
*  For me, not so much. [[04:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15794.679999999998s)]
*  So learning how to modify the code [[04:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15796.48s)]
*  that somebody else written is a real skill. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15799.279999999999s)]
*  And also the other thing you mentioned, [[04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15803.119999999999s)]
*  which is like considering another perspective [[04:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15805.88s)]
*  on a piece of code is really nice, [[04:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15809.599999999999s)]
*  but it is also a skill to understand, [[04:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15811.48s)]
*  okay, this is what you did. [[04:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15813.88s)]
*  There's a skill to asking a question [[04:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15816.439999999999s)]
*  about that code that's been generated [[04:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15818.76s)]
*  such that you can have a conversation [[04:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15823.08s)]
*  about the approach that was taken. [[04:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15825.08s)]
*  I think there's just a lot of subtle little skills [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15827.4s)]
*  involved in a cooperative endeavor to code. [[04:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15830.68s)]
*  Kind of like if there was a real skill issue [[04:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15836.16s)]
*  between you and Teej when you guys did the video [[04:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15838.72s)]
*  of two ideas, one keyboard, right? [[04:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15840.88s)]
*  People should go watch that video [[04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15843.32s)]
*  you guys obviously sucked at it. [[04:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15845.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cousing. [[04:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15847.199999999999s)]
*  That was pretty cool, which you guys did, [[04:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15848.8s)]
*  which is controlling one NeoVim interface [[04:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15850.199999999999s)]
*  from two different keyboards. [[04:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15853.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then we each get an allowance [[04:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15855.0s)]
*  of certain characters or motions we could perform. [[04:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15856.8s)]
*  Yeah, and so you both had to communicate together. [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15858.96s)]
*  That's a real skill. [[04:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15861.72s)]
*  I'm sure you can get super efficient with that, [[04:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15862.84s)]
*  but it just takes time to learn that kind of thing. [[04:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15866.199999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I think there's some value to it, [[04:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15868.96s)]
*  but I think there's a learning curve. [[04:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15871.439999999999s)]
*  So I do want one thing to be pretty clear [[04:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15873.44s)]
*  is that I actually use AI quite a bit. [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15878.04s)]
*  I just don't use it for programming. [[04:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15879.84s)]
*  And so one thing I've been trying to get it to [[04:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15881.44s)]
*  is to be able to have like a long interview [[04:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15882.960000000001s)]
*  or understand what Twitch chat is saying [[04:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15885.4s)]
*  and become Twitch chat and be able to speak [[04:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15887.12s)]
*  as if it is Twitch chat. [[04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15889.16s)]
*  Try to like learn how to prompt it in different ways. [[04:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15890.480000000001s)]
*  And so I think those things for me are just really fun. [[04:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15893.36s)]
*  I tried to get it to learn how to play tower defense. [[04:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15896.480000000001s)]
*  I made a tower defense game in Zig [[04:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15898.28s)]
*  and then made it play tower defense [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15899.560000000001s)]
*  and then played a Claude 3.5 against OpenAI. [[04:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15901.04s)]
*  Claude 3.5 would do better during the day times [[04:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15904.44s)]
*  and OpenAI did better during the night times. [[04:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15906.92s)]
*  I don't know why. [[04:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15908.84s)]
*  I have no idea what was going on there, [[04:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15909.68s)]
*  but one would just start winning [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15911.400000000001s)]
*  and the other one would start losing. [[04:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15913.6s)]
*  It was just very strange. [[04:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15914.640000000001s)]
*  And so it's just this, you know, I'm learning to prompt well, [[04:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15915.720000000001s)]
*  but I'm learning to prompt in a very different axi. [[04:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15919.0s)]
*  I just don't find it very useful yet in programming. [[04:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15921.320000000002s)]
*  And I should also say that I'm using it [[04:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15924.52s)]
*  in every walk of life, in every context, [[04:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15927.48s)]
*  I use that same kind of exploration about prompts [[04:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15932.16s)]
*  and so on I'm using and learning. [[04:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15935.52s)]
*  I think it legit is a whole field in itself. [[04:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15938.08s)]
*  Prompt engineering and how to interact with AI systems, [[04:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15941.960000000001s)]
*  I think it's worth the investment. [[04:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15944.720000000001s)]
*  Can you actually speak to that? [[04:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15947.04s)]
*  Cause I saw you're basically pulling from Twitch chat [[04:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15948.12s)]
*  and having an LLM speak. [[04:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15953.52s)]
*  I didn't realize, I thought you're, [[04:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15958.6s)]
*  so you're not reading the exact chat messages. [[04:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15959.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15964.0s)]
*  You're doing kind of some kind of summarization. [[04:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15964.84s)]
*  Yeah, so what I try to go through, [[04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15967.160000000002s)]
*  like I ended up making like eight queries off to OpenAI [[04:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15968.720000000001s)]
*  where it's just like, the first thing is like, [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15971.960000000001s)]
*  I have it have it like a default personality. [[04:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15973.960000000001s)]
*  Hey, you're Randall, the manager, [[04:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15976.2s)]
*  you're a software engineering manager, [[04:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15978.2s)]
*  kind of explain their position, what they like, [[04:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15979.84s)]
*  what they don't like. [[04:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15981.76s)]
*  And then be like, these are the list of thoughts [[04:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15982.72s)]
*  you have in your head. [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15984.32s)]
*  And you need to talk to this person [[04:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15985.64s)]
*  and ask them a question. [[04:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15987.12s)]
*  This is amazing. [[04:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15988.32s)]
*  Give me 10 of these responses that you think [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15989.16s)]
*  are probably thoughts that you have and you want to ask. [[04:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15991.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15994.52s)]
*  Make it kind of give you a list and then be like, okay. [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15995.36s)]
*  Then re prompt and be like, hey, you're Randall, [[04:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15997.72s)]
*  you're this, this, this, this, this, this, this. [[04:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=15999.24s)]
*  You have these 10 questions before you. [[04:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16001.28s)]
*  And now you need to select one of them [[04:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16003.48s)]
*  and reword it in a way that sounds more like you, [[04:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16005.48s)]
*  the engineering manager. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16007.76s)]
*  And so you're like, [[04:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16009.72s)]
*  I'm constantly trying to make it like iterate on itself [[04:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16010.92s)]
*  as opposed to just like one-shotting it. [[04:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16013.24s)]
*  And I found if I iterate too much becomes like, [[04:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16015.32s)]
*  it loses the value, it like loses what it was originally [[04:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16017.8s)]
*  trying to ask if I don't do it enough [[04:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16020.439999999999s)]
*  and it's just too degenerate from Twitch chat. [[04:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16022.24s)]
*  And so it's like, I have a lot of improvement to do [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16024.359999999999s)]
*  with this idea. [[04:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16027.119999999999s)]
*  Just to clarify, you're feeding in Twitch chat. [[04:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16027.96s)]
*  These are the thoughts you're a manager. [[04:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16032.32s)]
*  These are the thoughts you have in your head. [[04:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16035.199999999999s)]
*  Pick out some of the most profound thoughts. [[04:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16037.48s)]
*  Effectively is like, depending on what I wanted to do, [[04:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16040.36s)]
*  I'm trying to work on a better system still for it. [[04:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16042.960000000001s)]
*  And so it's like, how can I give voice to Twitch chat? [[04:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16045.44s)]
*  Can I make it so that I can get, [[04:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16047.480000000001s)]
*  create adversarial characters against Twitch chat [[04:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16048.880000000001s)]
*  or for Twitch chat? [[04:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16051.800000000001s)]
*  Can I incorporate YouTube, all that kind of stuff? [[04:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16052.880000000001s)]
*  And like, how do you describe to an LLM [[04:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16054.480000000001s)]
*  to role play into its position? [[04:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16056.800000000001s)]
*  And so, just thinking through those kinds of things. [[04:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16058.76s)]
*  So maybe I am having some prompt skills, [[04:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16062.04s)]
*  but just, it's just not in the coding world yet. [[04:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16064.32s)]
*  One day, one day I'll get there. [[04:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16067.24s)]
*  I saw that you were having like playing [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16068.68s)]
*  with different voices. [[04:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16071.32s)]
*  There was like a sexy voice. [[04:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16072.24s)]
*  That started off as a French voice. [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16074.52s)]
*  And then it turns out 11labs just cannot do a French lady. [[04:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16076.16s)]
*  And when you do multilingual French lady, [[04:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16080.12s)]
*  she starts talking. [[04:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16082.28s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, what? [[04:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16086.4s)]
*  I tuned into one of your streams. [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16088.08s)]
*  What is this? [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16090.0s)]
*  And there's this lady, like in a sexualized way. [[04:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16091.64s)]
*  It became too funny. [[04:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16096.76s)]
*  And so we call her not French Stormy Daniels. [[04:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16097.88s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[04:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16100.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I wanna go back to the AI [[04:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16101.279999999999s)]
*  and some of the aspects. [[04:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16102.96s)]
*  And so like my big gripe with AI [[04:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16105.24s)]
*  has nothing to do with its capabilities. [[04:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16106.88s)]
*  It's exactly capable as it should be capable [[04:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16108.92s)]
*  because that's what people programmed it as. [[04:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16110.8s)]
*  The things that I really dislike is A, [[04:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16112.759999999998s)]
*  there's a whole group of people that are just like, [[04:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16115.16s)]
*  the end is nigh, AI is here. [[04:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16116.8s)]
*  You just need to stop programming. [[04:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16118.359999999999s)]
*  Like I cannot see, I cannot tell you, [[04:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16119.759999999998s)]
*  even on like, you mentioned Peter levels earlier. [[04:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16122.0s)]
*  He made some sort of tweet. [[04:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16124.08s)]
*  And one of the person's responses was, [[04:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16125.24s)]
*  yeah, no one in this, like in 2025 or whatever [[04:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16127.48s)]
*  should be acquiring hard skills. [[04:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16131.359999999999s)]
*  You should rely on everything for the AI effectively. [[04:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16133.6s)]
*  And it's just like, [[04:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16136.439999999999s)]
*  these are really damning pieces of advice for young people. [[04:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16137.279999999999s)]
*  Like young people are being told [[04:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16140.32s)]
*  that you should never become an expert in anything. [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16141.48s)]
*  You should always offload. [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16143.16s)]
*  And the problem is, is that anyone worth any of their salt [[04:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16144.359999999999s)]
*  will tell you that AI though can produce code [[04:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16146.96s)]
*  is gonna get it wrong in a huge number of cases. [[04:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16150.56s)]
*  And as the code becomes bigger or more complex [[04:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16153.119999999999s)]
*  or more input, it's gonna just start kind of sloshing [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16155.76s)]
*  back and forth between bugs. [[04:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16158.44s)]
*  And so if you don't have those hard skills [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16160.08s)]
*  and you're not ultimately the driver at the end of the day, [[04:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16163.48s)]
*  like you're gonna really find some hard times [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16165.880000000001s)]
*  and your ability to progress will be directly bound [[04:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16167.68s)]
*  to how good the LLMs are. [[04:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16170.4s)]
*  So if you believe that the LLMs will be vastly superior [[04:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16172.52s)]
*  to humans in the next year, maybe that's a good bet. [[04:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16175.28s)]
*  But if they aren't, then your skill ceiling is bound [[04:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16178.2s)]
*  to whatever they are. [[04:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16181.08s)]
*  And even beyond that, there's just as like a whole, [[04:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16182.2s)]
*  there's just like a level of information problem, [[04:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16186.72s)]
*  which is like, can the thing actually navigate larger? [[04:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16188.039999999999s)]
*  Like, do we even have enough compute power [[04:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16190.84s)]
*  to be able to solve things at this real scale? [[04:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16193.199999999999s)]
*  And even if we did, if everybody started using it right now, [[04:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16195.64s)]
*  do we even have the compute power [[04:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16198.08s)]
*  for everybody to use it right now? [[04:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16199.24s)]
*  There's like a lot of kind of bounding questions. [[04:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16200.88s)]
*  There's privacy concerns. [[04:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16202.72s)]
*  And I just don't want people to make the immediate [[04:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16204.119999999999s)]
*  or what appears to be the obvious choice [[04:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16207.56s)]
*  where you don't need hard skills, you don't need these things. [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16209.8s)]
*  Our life is already gonna be, [[04:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16212.16s)]
*  we just need the only thing creatively. [[04:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16213.16s)]
*  It's like, no, I don't think so. [[04:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16214.8s)]
*  I think these hard skills are gonna be around [[04:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16216.359999999999s)]
*  for quite some time, even with a massive improvement [[04:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16217.84s)]
*  in the AI, like you're gonna really be needed [[04:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16221.24s)]
*  to step in regularly for quite some time, [[04:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16223.279999999999s)]
*  as far as I can tell. [[04:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16226.359999999999s)]
*  But I also think even on top of that, [[04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16227.679999999998s)]
*  just even acquiring the hard skills [[04:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16229.64s)]
*  or whether that means programming from scratch, [[04:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16231.199999999999s)]
*  for example, in the context of programming, [[04:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16234.359999999999s)]
*  that's going to make you better at steering the AI. [[04:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16237.72s)]
*  Not just correcting the AI, but steering the AI. [[04:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16242.279999999999s)]
*  I think there is some kind of, [[04:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16245.72s)]
*  if you know how a computer works, [[04:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16247.56s)]
*  you can program Python better. [[04:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16250.119999999999s)]
*  It's maybe counterintuitive, [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16252.679999999998s)]
*  but if you know the low level abstractions, [[04:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16254.199999999999s)]
*  like some intuition around that, [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16256.76s)]
*  you can steer the high level abstractions better. [[04:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16260.24s)]
*  But that just seems to be the case. [[04:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16263.24s)]
*  Unless of course AI becomes like truly super intelligent, [[04:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16264.56s)]
*  like many levels above, [[04:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16268.88s)]
*  but it's very unlikely in the short term. [[04:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16270.439999999999s)]
*  It's still good as it gets better and better and better [[04:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16273.279999999999s)]
*  to be able to steer, to ride the wave of the improvement. [[04:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16276.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm on that team very much so. [[04:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16279.199999999999s)]
*  A lot of people have written to me, [[04:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16281.4s)]
*  I think a lot of developers, programmers [[04:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16282.759999999998s)]
*  are really concerned about the future of their profession [[04:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16284.8s)]
*  in the context of quickly improving AI systems. [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16290.359999999999s)]
*  So do you think AI will eventually replace programmers? [[04:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16293.16s)]
*  The hard part about that phrase [[04:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16297.599999999999s)]
*  is use the term eventually. [[04:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16299.0s)]
*  I mean, do I think in five years, 10 years, 100 years, [[04:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16301.28s)]
*  like what does that term actually mean? [[04:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16304.12s)]
*  I think at some point, if we were able to scale, [[04:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16306.6s)]
*  if all things continue at the current rate of improvement, [[04:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16309.24s)]
*  there does come a point where programming [[04:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16312.08s)]
*  as a hard skill does become unnecessary, right? [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16314.560000000001s)]
*  At some eventual point way, way down the road. [[04:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16317.68s)]
*  Yes, I don't know what that point looks like. [[04:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16320.640000000001s)]
*  I don't know when it's going to happen. [[04:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16322.52s)]
*  I don't even attempt to make predictions about that, [[04:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16324.04s)]
*  but there are still some like leaps and bounds [[04:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16326.6s)]
*  we need to make. [[04:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16328.400000000001s)]
*  Just, I mean, even just like societally, [[04:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16329.24s)]
*  like there's plenty of companies [[04:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16333.56s)]
*  that don't even allow you to use AI, right? [[04:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16334.56s)]
*  Like that, I mean, there's just practical problems [[04:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16336.92s)]
*  that exist. [[04:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16339.0s)]
*  So that's like a question I just try not to answer [[04:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16339.84s)]
*  in the direct sense. [[04:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16341.96s)]
*  There will come a day if humanity continues [[04:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16343.4s)]
*  and all things continue in a good positive direction, [[04:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16346.6s)]
*  where a lot of skills will go out the window [[04:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16350.199999999999s)]
*  due to immense computing systems. [[04:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16351.96s)]
*  So yeah, I'll give you that one. [[04:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16354.199999999999s)]
*  But it's just like, if I don't think it has anything [[04:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16356.08s)]
*  in the near term, there's been no computer improvement [[04:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16359.32s)]
*  up to this date that did not result in more jobs. [[04:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16363.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[04:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16366.2s)]
*  I should say that I think it depends [[04:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16367.039999999999s)]
*  how you define programming also, because you know, [[04:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16369.12s)]
*  when the community moves from assembly to C, [[04:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16373.48s)]
*  from C to, I don't know, Python and JavaScript [[04:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16379.4s)]
*  like that's evolution that's really painful [[04:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16386.960000000003s)]
*  for a lot of people who are used to programming [[04:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16389.68s)]
*  that lower level language. [[04:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16393.160000000003s)]
*  So there's going to be a continuous evolution [[04:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16395.88s)]
*  and maybe that means with AI, there's going to be [[04:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16397.68s)]
*  more and more evolution towards natural language [[04:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16401.04s)]
*  as part of the tool chain, like being able to learn [[04:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16403.160000000003s)]
*  how to write proper prompts. [[04:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16406.160000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that might, you know, [[04:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16410.04s)]
*  because natural language is still a language. [[04:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16411.440000000002s)]
*  And in the long term, it's possible that a large percentage [[04:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16414.4s)]
*  of programming is natural language. [[04:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16418.04s)]
*  There are probably still going to be some percentage [[04:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16420.280000000002s)]
*  just not that's going to be extremely structured language. [[04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16422.68s)]
*  Right now, I don't think we are anywhere near [[04:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16425.72s)]
*  natural language being possible because it's ambiguous. [[04:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16427.600000000002s)]
*  And I think what we'll end up seeing [[04:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16430.84s)]
*  as people push really hard into this, [[04:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16432.36s)]
*  you're going to see some sort of like pseudo-lang, [[04:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16434.640000000003s)]
*  which is going to be a language for AIs [[04:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16436.600000000002s)]
*  in which you prompt, which is going to be less ambiguous. [[04:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16438.56s)]
*  Right, people keep striving towards the less ambiguous state. [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16441.88s)]
*  And at that point, you're just programming, [[04:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16445.120000000003s)]
*  you're just programming yet another evolution [[04:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16446.960000000003s)]
*  into a higher order language. [[04:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16448.760000000002s)]
*  And perhaps that is a future in which people [[04:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16450.36s)]
*  will have a more terse language. [[04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16452.48s)]
*  I'm just not sure how much more terse it can get. [[04:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16454.960000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, all I see is that if you say natural language [[04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16459.04s)]
*  can be used in the pipeline, [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16462.68s)]
*  you've just made that many more people [[04:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16464.04s)]
*  can become programmers, which means that much more software [[04:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16466.0s)]
*  will eventually be created, which means there's that much [[04:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16468.52s)]
*  more software that will need to be maintained [[04:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16471.36s)]
*  and just becomes a real big snowballing effect. [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16473.56s)]
*  But there's just people who are programmers [[04:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16477.0s)]
*  who are worried about their jobs. [[04:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16480.28s)]
*  Not a complete replacement, but maybe a rapid evolution [[04:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16482.56s)]
*  of what it means to be a programmer. [[04:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16485.0s)]
*  Like you mentioned, if natural language [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16486.24s)]
*  becomes a way that you can communicate, [[04:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16489.2s)]
*  that you can program, that means the pool of people [[04:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16492.08s)]
*  who can get programming jobs changes rapidly. [[04:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16497.600000000002s)]
*  So they're really concerned. [[04:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16500.4s)]
*  It to some extent, right? [[04:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16501.88s)]
*  Because no matter how much we want to say how good AI is, [[04:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16503.960000000003s)]
*  there comes a point where there exists a bug, [[04:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16508.52s)]
*  there exists a large piece of software [[04:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16511.2s)]
*  in which to describe the change requires just like pages [[04:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16513.08s)]
*  and pages of description to the point where it is [[04:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16517.4s)]
*  significantly just faster or easier for someone [[04:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16520.32s)]
*  to just whip something out. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16522.52s)]
*  There's definitely a balance there. [[04:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16524.0s)]
*  It's not like a perfect trade-off. [[04:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16525.4s)]
*  And so I think people need to quit worrying [[04:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16527.280000000002s)]
*  and think about how they can integrate it and try. [[04:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16531.800000000003s)]
*  Like prove it to themselves. [[04:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16534.56s)]
*  Do they actually make themselves irrelevant? [[04:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16536.16s)]
*  And if you truly make yourself irrelevant, [[04:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16537.920000000002s)]
*  I would challenge you that you're already, [[04:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16540.440000000002s)]
*  like you're just doing something that was just slightly [[04:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16542.120000000003s)]
*  too complicated to automate. [[04:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16545.4s)]
*  Like if you're only writing just straight up crud apps [[04:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16547.36s)]
*  from backend to front end and like simple table displays, [[04:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16549.920000000002s)]
*  like, yeah, maybe we just couldn't quite automate that away. [[04:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16552.72s)]
*  And now we just have something that can just do that [[04:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16556.56s)]
*  a little bit better. [[04:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16559.24s)]
*  So now that's automated away, [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16560.08s)]
*  but that's not really programming. [[04:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16561.56s)]
*  That's almost like building Legos at that point [[04:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16562.960000000003s)]
*  where the designs already set. [[04:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16565.920000000002s)]
*  You just simply have to move piece from bag [[04:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16567.4s)]
*  into correct position. [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16569.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16571.24s)]
*  Is there something you recommend how a developer [[04:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16572.48s)]
*  or programmer could avoid a situation [[04:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16577.32s)]
*  where AI can automate them away? [[04:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16579.120000000003s)]
*  I think that the bigger the project you can manage, [[04:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16583.16s)]
*  the bigger the thing you can build, [[04:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16586.64s)]
*  the more understanding both down and up the stack [[04:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16588.44s)]
*  you can go, the more valuable you become. [[04:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16590.48s)]
*  Because if you understand how to build something [[04:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16594.24s)]
*  in the front end, okay, well now you kick off some LLM task [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16596.84s)]
*  of some sort that's gonna go off [[04:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16600.36s)]
*  and make a change to the front end. [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16601.76s)]
*  Okay, while it's doing that, [[04:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16602.68s)]
*  you can go and kick off something in the CLI tool. [[04:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16603.96s)]
*  You can go and you can go kick off something somewhere else. [[04:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16606.04s)]
*  And as these things come back with results, [[04:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16608.12s)]
*  you can review the results, [[04:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16609.92s)]
*  make sure it's the way you want it, [[04:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16611.0s)]
*  change it, commit it, go to the next. [[04:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16612.48s)]
*  You only become more, as you said in the end, [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16614.239999999998s)]
*  more productive if we reach this state [[04:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16616.52s)]
*  where it's truly able to do that. [[04:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16618.68s)]
*  I think there is a skill to working together with AI, [[04:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16620.6s)]
*  which is why I'm kind of excited [[04:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16624.32s)]
*  to watch you keep trying to do it. [[04:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16626.239999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16628.56s)]
*  It's like we don't know how it fits exactly, [[04:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16629.399999999998s)]
*  but it feels like AI should be a boost to productivity. [[04:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16632.52s)]
*  And I definitely think it's a boost [[04:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16637.6s)]
*  to just the joy of programming. [[04:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16640.4s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people, yeah, it's a job, [[04:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16642.84s)]
*  but it's also a source of meaning, a source of joy. [[04:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16645.32s)]
*  Like programming is fun. [[04:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16648.960000000003s)]
*  You're creating something cool [[04:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16650.08s)]
*  and also potentially that a lot of people use. [[04:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16651.800000000003s)]
*  There's this one thing that just really frustrates me. [[04:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16654.440000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of going into the Devon category, [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16656.16s)]
*  which is that I want an intern that cares. [[04:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16658.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16661.920000000002s)]
*  You don't get that out of an LLM. [[04:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16662.88s)]
*  It does not care. [[04:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16664.04s)]
*  Meaning that I don't want it just to make a UI for me [[04:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16665.480000000003s)]
*  that displays these icons, like I asked. [[04:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16668.96s)]
*  I want it to care. [[04:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16670.64s)]
*  I want it to think about it. [[04:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16671.48s)]
*  I want it to present to me and mean to be like, [[04:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16672.559999999998s)]
*  oh yeah, yeah, that's great. [[04:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16675.239999999998s)]
*  And then me to make changes. [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16676.559999999998s)]
*  And then later on it's like, actually, you know what? [[04:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16677.64s)]
*  I really rethought about this. [[04:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16678.96s)]
*  And actually it'd be way better if we change, [[04:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16680.2s)]
*  you know, like it doesn't actually care about the craft, [[04:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16681.719999999998s)]
*  but when you work with an intern [[04:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16684.719999999998s)]
*  or you work with somebody else, they care. [[04:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16686.239999999998s)]
*  When they factor something, they actually go over and go, [[04:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16688.399999999998s)]
*  ah, yeah, this is actually kind of bad. [[04:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16690.16s)]
*  I'm gonna come back to that. [[04:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16691.64s)]
*  They finish this, they go back over [[04:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16692.68s)]
*  and they make this even better, right? [[04:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16693.96s)]
*  They like actually care about the thing itself. [[04:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16695.079999999998s)]
*  It's a completely different experience. [[04:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16697.6s)]
*  I just want something that also cares, [[04:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16699.12s)]
*  that wants to make the thing better, [[04:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16701.719999999998s)]
*  not just simply accomplish the task. [[04:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16703.079999999998s)]
*  And I know I'm asking way too much. [[04:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16705.12s)]
*  That's not, you know, now we're getting [[04:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16706.519999999997s)]
*  into like Blade Runner level AI. [[04:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16708.12s)]
*  I just want something that's, [[04:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16709.96s)]
*  it just feels like I'm missing that, [[04:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16712.32s)]
*  where it's just like, it will complete the task [[04:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16714.12s)]
*  to whatever level it understood what I was prompting, [[04:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16717.0s)]
*  but it just doesn't, it doesn't actually care about it. [[04:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16719.48s)]
*  I mean, there's so many aspects to caring, [[04:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16722.6s)]
*  but sort of the trivial version of that [[04:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16728.16s)]
*  is a kind of restlessness where you wanna keep improving. [[04:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16730.079999999998s)]
*  And I think that is very much AI can do. [[04:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16734.6s)]
*  Where it constantly just asks itself, [[04:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16738.0s)]
*  can I make this better? [[04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16739.559999999998s)]
*  And if it keeps doing that, [[04:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16741.32s)]
*  it probably is gonna take it to some ridiculous place. [[04:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16743.48s)]
*  So actually it's also knowing when to stop. [[04:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16746.239999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16750.24s)]
*  I think developing something you can call taste, [[04:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16751.24s)]
*  which is like trying, working extremely hard, [[04:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16755.88s)]
*  constantly improving until it just feels right. [[04:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16759.28s)]
*  This is it. [[04:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16762.36s)]
*  And I think that is a thing that AI is not good at. [[04:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16763.48s)]
*  It was just like, yes, this is it. [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16766.16s)]
*  I've iterated three times and three was the- [[04:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16768.44s)]
*  That's it. [[04:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16770.64s)]
*  We're now there. [[04:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16771.48s)]
*  And that, I think ultimately that is what humans [[04:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16772.96s)]
*  are amazing at, which is like, [[04:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16776.44s)]
*  knowing when something is right. [[04:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16780.28s)]
*  Like this is it. [[04:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16782.0s)]
*  This is, especially as you understand, [[04:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16782.84s)]
*  as you develop taste in the particular industry, [[04:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16785.8s)]
*  in the particular context application, [[04:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16787.88s)]
*  knowing like this is it. [[04:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16790.04s)]
*  Yeah, this, the rounded corners on this button, [[04:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16791.2s)]
*  that's exactly that. [[04:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16794.8s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[04:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16796.48s)]
*  So it's just a sense of beauty, [[04:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16797.72s)]
*  a sense of function and efficiency and so on. [[04:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16799.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16803.28s)]
*  But that, you know, humans could do almost like [[04:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16804.12s)]
*  supervision of AI systems in that context. [[04:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16806.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16808.48s)]
*  Yeah, you've ranted about Devon, [[04:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16809.4s)]
*  just full of rage. [[04:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16812.72s)]
*  I mean, first off, [[04:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16815.760000000002s)]
*  the people that run Devon are extremely nice. [[04:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16816.600000000002s)]
*  I want that to be understood. [[04:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16817.88s)]
*  I don't have some sort of upsetness against them [[04:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16819.280000000002s)]
*  or anything like that. [[04:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16821.16s)]
*  Second, Devon is just, it's kind of like the full, [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16823.760000000002s)]
*  it's like the full package when it comes to programming. [[04:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16827.04s)]
*  So it's gonna have, [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16829.600000000002s)]
*  you're gonna give it a task and a repo, [[04:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16831.0s)]
*  and it's gonna go through, [[04:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16833.2s)]
*  it's gonna try to understand the repo and the task, [[04:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16834.68s)]
*  make the change to the repo by exploring it, [[04:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16837.08s)]
*  then actually make a commit to GitHub [[04:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16839.600000000002s)]
*  and explain what it did so that you can have like, [[04:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16841.920000000002s)]
*  you know, so hopefully you have this whole offline thing, [[04:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16844.480000000003s)]
*  which is the other part of this AI part [[04:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16847.24s)]
*  that I actually really like, [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16849.600000000002s)]
*  or it's just like, go fix this thing. [[04:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16850.920000000002s)]
*  Then I can just go and unbroken fix this one thing [[04:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16853.120000000003s)]
*  and come back and go, okay, good enough merge, boom. [[04:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16855.56s)]
*  You know, like I want that kind of running, [[04:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16857.320000000003s)]
*  being able to complete things. [[04:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16859.320000000003s)]
*  I think the ideal solution is that you can start [[04:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16860.640000000003s)]
*  giving it small bugs and it goes and fixes these bugs [[04:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16862.760000000002s)]
*  and you can just come back to these backlog tickets [[04:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16865.56s)]
*  that no one ever does [[04:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16867.800000000003s)]
*  and it actually starts going through these backlog tickets [[04:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16868.640000000003s)]
*  and it's actually a really amazing experience. [[04:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16871.08s)]
*  So I love the idea, right? [[04:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16872.52s)]
*  I think we can all agree that that sounds great. [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16874.2s)]
*  But every time I've done it and I've asked it for many [[04:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16877.08s)]
*  and I try to keep narrowing down the problems, [[04:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16880.52s)]
*  the more narrow the problem, the better it does. [[04:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16882.56s)]
*  So if I'm like, just add one singular icon [[04:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16884.920000000002s)]
*  and when it gets clicked, I want you to do this, [[04:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16887.04s)]
*  just console, click me, like just at least create me an SVG [[04:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16889.48s)]
*  and place it so it's nicely placed. [[04:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16893.640000000003s)]
*  The more narrow the task, [[04:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16896.399999999998s)]
*  the more likely it's to be successful. [[04:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16897.239999999998s)]
*  There's like a certain level of specifying [[04:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16899.52s)]
*  where you specify too much, it just like can't do it. [[04:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16901.04s)]
*  If you specify too little, it just does weird things. [[04:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16903.36s)]
*  So it's kind of like this very kind of fun, unique way [[04:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16905.92s)]
*  you have to play the balance game. [[04:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16908.92s)]
*  But so far, every time I do these things, [[04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16910.239999999998s)]
*  I always end up going, gosh, you know what? [[04:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16912.399999999998s)]
*  I should just get better at Tailwind and write it myself. [[04:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16914.6s)]
*  Cause I always go back and I just rewrite it. [[04:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16917.399999999998s)]
*  And then it's just like, dang it, [[04:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16918.8s)]
*  what am I saving at the end? [[04:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16919.92s)]
*  I feel like I'm not saving anything yet. [[04:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16921.92s)]
*  And you know, it's just like this, [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16923.68s)]
*  I want it so bad. [[04:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16924.88s)]
*  Like I actually want AI to be great [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16926.440000000002s)]
*  because then I can really go fast. [[04:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16928.08s)]
*  I mean, I can go amazing fast, but then I always just go, [[04:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16929.64s)]
*  gosh, I should just learn Tailwind myself [[04:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16932.120000000003s)]
*  to like the nth degree and just go fast. [[04:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16934.36s)]
*  Yeah, we should also mention that debugging, [[04:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16937.04s)]
*  this might be intuitive or counter intuitive, [[04:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16940.600000000002s)]
*  is AI is really bad at. [[04:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16942.920000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16946.8s)]
*  Like that is one of the hardest, [[04:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16947.64s)]
*  it actually makes you realize how special humans are [[04:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16949.0s)]
*  and how difficult the task of debugging is. [[04:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16952.68s)]
*  Obviously for trivial debugging, maybe you can find bugs, [[04:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16954.920000000002s)]
*  but like that is the real art of programming. [[04:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16959.28s)]
*  Is finding bugs, logical bugs, [[04:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16963.24s)]
*  like extremely complicated, rare bugs, edge cases. [[04:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16966.760000000002s)]
*  AI can assist, but man, the hard ones are really, [[04:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16972.72s)]
*  require so much context, so much experience, [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16976.84s)]
*  so much intuition from again, [[04:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16979.4s)]
*  operating in a fog full of uncertainty. [[04:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16983.4s)]
*  It's hard. [[04:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16986.120000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16986.960000000003s)]
*  Of course, AI could maybe create like logs [[04:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16987.800000000003s)]
*  and do traces and do some kind of loading [[04:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16993.72s)]
*  a huge amount of data that humans can't. [[04:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=16998.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17000.4s)]
*  But ultimately that just means it could be a better assistant [[04:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17001.24s)]
*  in debugging versus the actual lead debugger. [[04:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17003.640000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it'd be great if they could, [[04:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17007.120000000003s)]
*  I mean, the more it can do that, the better, right? [[04:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17008.64s)]
*  Cause as far as I can tell, I mean, [[04:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17011.04s)]
*  correct me where I'm wrong on this, [[04:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17013.04s)]
*  current state debugging is really, it looks at the code, [[04:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17015.44s)]
*  it looks at the bug problem, [[04:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17018.76s)]
*  it just kind of tries to text predict [[04:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17020.16s)]
*  where it's most likely accurate [[04:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17021.8s)]
*  and then just tries to fix that spot. [[04:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17023.44s)]
*  And so it's like, it's likely this spot, [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17024.92s)]
*  you said admin panel slightly off, this, this, this, [[04:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17026.559999999998s)]
*  it's probably this location, [[04:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17029.079999999998s)]
*  which could actually be a really great way to do search, [[04:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17030.48s)]
*  right? [[04:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17032.52s)]
*  Let me do semantic searching, point to me where this is, [[04:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17033.36s)]
*  cause maybe that is a really great way [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17036.44s)]
*  to navigate large code bases is like smart, [[04:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17037.96s)]
*  intelligent search, as opposed to trying to make it [[04:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17040.16s)]
*  do the thing, ask it to just help you do the thing [[04:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17042.36s)]
*  in like pinpointing problems. [[04:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17045.239999999998s)]
*  Oh no, I'd love to see more of that. [[04:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17047.36s)]
*  Cause that's for me, it's like the exciting part. [[04:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17049.68s)]
*  And there's this really great article by creator [[04:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17051.16s)]
*  or maintainer of curl. [[04:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17053.52s)]
*  It's the I and LLM stands for intelligence. [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17055.04s)]
*  And he writes curl and maintains curl. [[04:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17058.079999999998s)]
*  Curl has been inundated with security problems [[04:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17061.44s)]
*  and all this, and it's all from LLMs being like, [[04:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17064.12s)]
*  oh, I found a security flaw. [[04:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17066.32s)]
*  Here's the security flaw, details it out in the code. [[04:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17068.4s)]
*  And he's just like, okay, how did you reproduce that? [[04:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17070.56s)]
*  Show me, because if you look at the code right here, [[04:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17072.48s)]
*  that's actually an impossible situation you're just [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17074.68s)]
*  speaking of. [[04:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17076.52s)]
*  And it's just like going in these circles and security [[04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17077.36s)]
*  right now is being inundated. [[04:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17079.64s)]
*  These bug bounty programs are being inundated by LLM [[04:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17081.6s)]
*  submitted responses, cause they can't actually, you know, [[04:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17084.72s)]
*  analyze the code beyond just like basic text prediction. [[04:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17088.2s)]
*  Oh, this is a stir copy, stir copy is commonly referred, [[04:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17091.84s)]
*  ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba-boom, there you go, here's the bug. [[04:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17094.760000000002s)]
*  And it's just like, no, that's actually impossible. [[04:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17096.88s)]
*  Cause the if statement right beforehand leaves the function [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17098.640000000003s)]
*  if the string is too long. [[04:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17101.760000000002s)]
*  So it's like, we don't even run into this case. [[04:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17102.84s)]
*  It's impossible what you're saying. [[04:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17104.640000000003s)]
*  So the bugging is very interesting. [[04:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17106.800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that for me would be the big, [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17108.56s)]
*  if it can solve that, not solve that, but improve that, [[04:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17110.88s)]
*  that would be huge, whether it's agents or just LLMs [[04:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17113.440000000002s)]
*  integrated into IDEs. [[04:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17116.2s)]
*  I think there's this whole idea I call a denial of attention. [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17119.04s)]
*  I think there's an entire attack vector [[04:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17123.04s)]
*  that's gonna be happening. [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17124.6s)]
*  We're using LLMs to generate fake bug reports, [[04:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17125.76s)]
*  fake all these things to just actually effectively [[04:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17128.08s)]
*  to demotivate and hurt open source maintainers. [[04:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17131.76s)]
*  Polykill was the first bug that kind of had this experience [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17138.44s)]
*  is this denial of attention where a active malicious [[04:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17141.72s)]
*  maintainer just hounded the owner. [[04:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17144.84s)]
*  And then a white knight came out and offered to buy this, [[04:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17148.36s)]
*  you know, buy some stuff from under them. [[04:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17150.92s)]
*  And when they bought it, they actually replaced it [[04:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17153.120000000003s)]
*  with a malicious piece of code and then used it. [[04:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17154.08s)]
*  So there's like this whole security world [[04:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17156.56s)]
*  that's developing around using these [[04:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17158.920000000002s)]
*  in a very aggressive format. [[04:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17160.640000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a fascinating world we're entering into, [[04:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17164.08s)]
*  but I do agree with you that humans, human developers [[04:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17166.56s)]
*  will be a huge part of that world. [[04:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17169.960000000003s)]
*  That this is not, the job might evolve, [[04:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17171.440000000002s)]
*  but it's going to be there. [[04:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17174.56s)]
*  If I can, I didn't really look at this page. [[04:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17176.36s)]
*  I thought it would be cool to go over with you. [[04:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17178.56s)]
*  This is again, the- [[04:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17180.48s)]
*  Stack Overflow, my favorite. [[04:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17181.68s)]
*  Stack Overflow developer survey talking about [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17183.04s)]
*  their sentiment and usage of AI systems. [[04:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17186.920000000002s)]
*  The general sentiment of yes, 61% say yes, they use it. [[04:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17190.04s)]
*  And 25% say no, don't plan to. [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17196.68s)]
*  So majority use it, majority have a favorable sentiment [[04:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17200.36s)]
*  over it, favorable or very favorable or indifferent. [[04:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17205.32s)]
*  That's like, it looks like over 90%. [[04:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17208.84s)]
*  That's really surprising that that many people [[04:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17212.48s)]
*  just have no plan in looking into AI. [[04:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17214.28s)]
*  Like as much as I don't like using it for coding, [[04:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17216.52s)]
*  I hope one day I can use it more, right? [[04:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17218.48s)]
*  And so it's like, to me, [[04:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17220.52s)]
*  I'm always looking for the next thing. [[04:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17222.28s)]
*  I'm just surprised that people are that, [[04:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17224.48s)]
*  I guess, obstinate for it. [[04:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17226.16s)]
*  Obviously the second one, the AI tool sentiment, [[04:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17227.8s)]
*  it must be only the users who responded [[04:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17230.36s)]
*  to the top two of that first one, [[04:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17234.12s)]
*  just given the amount of respondents. [[04:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17235.96s)]
*  I wonder if no and don't plan to are people [[04:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17237.72s)]
*  who have tried it and quickly built up the intuition [[04:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17240.68s)]
*  like this really sucks. [[04:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17243.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17245.56s)]
*  So, you know, it could be like experienced programmers [[04:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17246.4s)]
*  are like, no, this is not making me more productive. [[04:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17250.72s)]
*  81% agree that increasing productivity [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17254.32s)]
*  is the biggest benefit that the developers [[04:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17256.68s)]
*  identify for AI tools. [[04:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17258.32s)]
*  Okay, so this is what are the benefits. [[04:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17260.56s)]
*  Increased productivity, speed up learning, [[04:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17262.600000000002s)]
*  greater efficiency, improve accuracy in coding, [[04:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17264.68s)]
*  make workload more manageable, improve collaborate. [[04:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17267.760000000002s)]
*  Where's the fun? [[04:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17269.800000000003s)]
*  Increased fun, I would say that's like number one for me. [[04:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17271.480000000003s)]
*  Maybe speed up learning is like a subcategory of fun, right? [[04:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17275.2s)]
*  If you're able to learn more and be able to become better, [[04:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17279.2s)]
*  to me that sounds good. [[04:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17282.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, it's different [[04:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17285.16s)]
*  because like productivity is part of fun too. [[04:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17286.52s)]
*  There is just the lightness, [[04:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17288.88s)]
*  I mean, maybe improve collaboration, [[04:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17291.52s)]
*  all of these elements for sure. [[04:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17293.320000000003s)]
*  There was my time using Copilot, [[04:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17295.08s)]
*  there was certainly a level of wonder [[04:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17297.760000000002s)]
*  that would happen for quite some time [[04:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17299.56s)]
*  where it's just like, it's just amazing what it can do. [[04:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17300.960000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17303.640000000003s)]
*  I'm just super impressed by what it can do [[04:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17304.480000000003s)]
*  even though I don't use it. [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17305.800000000003s)]
*  Like it's amazing to me that we have something [[04:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17306.640000000003s)]
*  that can even get that close. [[04:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17309.600000000002s)]
*  In terms of accuracy of AI tools, [[04:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17311.600000000002s)]
*  only 2.7% highly trust. [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17314.08s)]
*  I would say that you have to be very green [[04:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17317.68s)]
*  to think that you should highly trust an AI output. [[04:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17319.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17321.600000000002s)]
*  You should be very skeptical. [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17322.440000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know where I stand, [[04:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17323.260000000002s)]
*  probably somewhat distrust, [[04:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17324.96s)]
*  highly distrust seems aggressive. [[04:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17325.8s)]
*  It does seem a little true. [[04:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17327.96s)]
*  Like you should definitely be in the somewhat, [[04:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17329.32s)]
*  like you should always assume that there's something wrong [[04:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17330.600000000002s)]
*  and then from there you can go and challenge it. [[04:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17333.48s)]
*  And then estimation of whether AI can handle complex tasks, [[04:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17337.16s)]
*  most people don't think it can handle complex tasks. [[04:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17341.4s)]
*  I mean, it seems like people have a good sense [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17344.36s)]
*  of what it's able to handle or not. [[04:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17346.16s)]
*  I would argue that people don't have a good grasp [[04:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17347.96s)]
*  of what complex is in programming. [[04:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17349.96s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[04:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17351.56s)]
*  If you say write to me, you know, write me quicksorts, [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17352.4s)]
*  some people will think quicksorts super complex, [[04:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17355.48s)]
*  but I would argue that that's actually probably [[04:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17357.12s)]
*  the simplest thing you could ask an AI to do, right? [[04:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17358.8s)]
*  Things that are so well documented, [[04:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17361.399999999998s)]
*  it's gonna do a great job at that. [[04:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17363.079999999998s)]
*  Yeah, probably high level design decisions, [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17366.48s)]
*  which people don't even use AI for right now. [[04:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17368.48s)]
*  I guess agents are supposed to be doing that kind of stuff. [[04:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17371.16s)]
*  That's probably the most difficult thing [[04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17373.64s)]
*  or the most impactful thing. [[04:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17376.399999999998s)]
*  Or the most difficult thing is finding bugs. [[04:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17379.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17382.239999999998s)]
*  AI tools next year, writing code and so on. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17383.44s)]
*  Now this one, the ethics part, [[04:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17387.12s)]
*  I'm actually super curious your take on the ethics. [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17388.68s)]
*  Will we see Europe laying down some new regulations? [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17392.16s)]
*  Oh boy. [[04:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17396.0s)]
*  What about artists, right? [[04:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17396.84s)]
*  What about people that are really, [[04:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17399.16s)]
*  because the difference between coding and artists [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17400.32s)]
*  is very, very simple. [[04:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17402.68s)]
*  If you gave me a sheet of paper, I could draw you a crab. [[04:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17404.0s)]
*  You go, that's a crab. [[04:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17407.039999999997s)]
*  But you can't do that with coding. [[04:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17409.039999999997s)]
*  It's like it's right or it's wrong. [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17410.68s)]
*  There's not a variation of interpretation [[04:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17412.4s)]
*  for what a crab is. [[04:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17414.16s)]
*  It's like, no, that statement's just, [[04:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17415.0s)]
*  you cannot make that statement. [[04:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17416.24s)]
*  You know, it's very bounded in what it can express. [[04:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17418.16s)]
*  And I could see why artists, [[04:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17420.600000000002s)]
*  like that's a very frustrating point. [[04:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17422.36s)]
*  And then who gets rewarded for all that? [[04:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17424.960000000003s)]
*  You know, obviously, [[04:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17427.2s)]
*  and then there's like the whole thing with coding [[04:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17428.280000000002s)]
*  and licenses, how much of it is GPL licenses? [[04:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17430.0s)]
*  Do you think they have scraped and used as training data? [[04:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17432.280000000002s)]
*  GPL forces open source. [[04:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17434.0s)]
*  What are you gonna do with that one? [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17436.480000000003s)]
*  Like that means your model might need to be open source. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17437.84s)]
*  Like open AI may have to get forced open [[04:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17440.78s)]
*  all their previous stuff. [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17443.66s)]
*  If there's any hint of GPL. [[04:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17445.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird one. [[04:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17448.1s)]
*  That's a really weird one. [[04:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17449.42s)]
*  Because most of these models, I think, [[04:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17450.98s)]
*  are training on data they don't technically have rights [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17452.34s)]
*  to be training on. [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17454.699999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot to question. [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17455.94s)]
*  There's an unspoken, it's a real wild west. [[04:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17457.739999999998s)]
*  Because like you could imagine that weapon if, [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17461.14s)]
*  you know, I always use Europe [[04:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17463.66s)]
*  because they tend to have like [[04:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17464.539999999997s)]
*  maybe the most consumer protection laws out there. [[04:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17465.86s)]
*  You could imagine what happened if a law came down [[04:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17468.98s)]
*  that said that if you used a model [[04:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17470.74s)]
*  that produced GPL potential code, you have to open source. [[04:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17474.100000000002s)]
*  Like how many companies are gonna be like, oh my gosh. [[04:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17477.06s)]
*  Right, like you have one year to get rid of all code [[04:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17479.780000000002s)]
*  that was generated that's potentially GPL source [[04:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17481.7s)]
*  from a model like that could, [[04:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17483.5s)]
*  you could imagine just the sheer panic that's gonna happen. [[04:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17484.980000000003s)]
*  It'd be a fire sale of code. [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17489.06s)]
*  So given all that, can you give advice to young programmers? [[04:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17491.74s)]
*  Like this is another question from Reddit. [[04:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17497.260000000002s)]
*  The infinite wisdom of Reddit. [[04:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17499.86s)]
*  What should a person in their early 20s do [[04:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17501.22s)]
*  to move forward in the tech industry? [[04:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17504.38s)]
*  And this is an interesting addition to the question. [[04:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17508.16s)]
*  And by doing it, [[04:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17512.78s)]
*  will this be walking on someone else's path? [[04:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17513.74s)]
*  I am going to try to answer that question, [[04:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17519.82s)]
*  I guess the best I can. [[04:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17523.06s)]
*  Which I think that if you're entering into the tech world, [[04:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17525.22s)]
*  one of the hardest pieces of advice [[04:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17531.100000000002s)]
*  that I took a long time to learn was [[04:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17533.100000000002s)]
*  I became enamored and addicted. [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17535.9s)]
*  Obviously we talked about that program [[04:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17537.66s)]
*  for way too many hours. [[04:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17539.420000000002s)]
*  For getting to spend the time I needed with my wife, [[04:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17541.9s)]
*  with my friends, all that stuff, [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17545.74s)]
*  like totally wrapping myself up into one activity. [[04:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17547.58s)]
*  I think though it made me who I am [[04:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17550.5s)]
*  was probably an unhealthy activity [[04:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17553.22s)]
*  and probably not a wise activity. [[04:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17554.82s)]
*  And so the best advice I can give is that [[04:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17556.54s)]
*  you got to develop the love, the skill, the desire for, [[04:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17558.58s)]
*  whether that's just only using AI agents, [[04:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17561.280000000002s)]
*  programming yourself, using Zig or programming JavaScript, [[04:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17563.54s)]
*  whatever that flavor is [[04:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17566.66s)]
*  that's going to get you coming back every single day, [[04:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17568.06s)]
*  getting the reps in the gym, if you will, for programming, [[04:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17570.56s)]
*  but also knowing how to value what is valuable [[04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17573.420000000002s)]
*  and not getting lost in the sauce [[04:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17576.780000000002s)]
*  where you're just so stuck on trying to [[04:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17578.300000000003s)]
*  make the next greatest startup [[04:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17580.98s)]
*  that you sacrifice your health, [[04:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17582.22s)]
*  you sacrifice your relationships, [[04:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17583.86s)]
*  or even worse, you sacrifice your own morals [[04:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17585.460000000003s)]
*  to take certain shortcuts [[04:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17587.460000000003s)]
*  that you probably shouldn't be taking in life [[04:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17589.100000000002s)]
*  to be able to achieve these things, [[04:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17592.2s)]
*  because I'm sure there's hundreds of horror stories [[04:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17593.260000000002s)]
*  you could hear where people definitely shortcut [[04:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17596.22s)]
*  of their morals for monetary success. [[04:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17598.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the golden handcuffs comfort [[04:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17602.18s)]
*  can destroy the soul in some sense. [[04:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17606.14s)]
*  Yeah, so that's really important to remember, [[04:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17609.72s)]
*  but would you, you know, there's young people [[04:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17612.36s)]
*  kind of thinking, do I even want to be a programmer now? [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17615.16s)]
*  It seems like AI is getting better and better and better [[04:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17619.24s)]
*  at these programming. [[04:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17621.34s)]
*  If they were trying to make that decision, [[04:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17624.800000000003s)]
*  would you still say, yeah, [[04:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17626.920000000002s)]
*  if this is something that fills you with joy? [[04:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17628.24s)]
*  I still want my kids to learn how to program, [[04:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17631.36s)]
*  if I can answer that, if that's a good enough answer, [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17633.84s)]
*  in the sense that my kids are decade younger [[04:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17637.04s)]
*  than a young person trying to learn how to program right now. [[04:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17640.44s)]
*  And so if I want, you know, I'm hoping that my kid [[04:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17643.0s)]
*  can run and build whatever he wants in Roblox. [[04:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17645.420000000002s)]
*  I'm showing him chat-gipity and be like, [[04:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17647.64s)]
*  all right, let's ask questions, how do we do this? [[04:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17649.08s)]
*  It's still extremely confusing for him [[04:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17651.12s)]
*  to do all these things. [[04:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17653.420000000002s)]
*  And so it's like, let's do this. [[04:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17654.26s)]
*  I want him to learn and be effective. [[04:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17656.02s)]
*  And maybe one day he has to throw away [[04:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17657.84s)]
*  all those skills in 20 years, [[04:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17659.08s)]
*  but I bet you that whatever skills he threw away [[04:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17660.72s)]
*  or whatever hard skills he had to throw away [[04:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17663.8s)]
*  an entirely new field that none of us have thought about. [[04:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17666.16s)]
*  Just like if you would have asked somebody in the 70s, [[04:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17669.24s)]
*  you know, about social networks, they'd be like, [[04:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17671.86s)]
*  what the heck are you even talking about? [[04:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17674.0s)]
*  Like things will exist in the future [[04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17675.74s)]
*  that are gonna be massively different [[04:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17677.52s)]
*  and crazy and exciting. [[04:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17678.88s)]
*  Maybe in virtual reality. [[04:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17680.4s)]
*  There you go. [[04:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17682.16s)]
*  Maybe all of us actually down the line [[04:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17683.0s)]
*  would just be building video games. [[04:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17684.48s)]
*  Just entertainment for all, [[04:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17686.68s)]
*  the brave new world of our world. [[04:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17688.12s)]
*  Well, I think entertainment is, [[04:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17691.24s)]
*  a kind of trivialized version of what a video game could be. [[04:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17696.2s)]
*  It's like, what is the purpose of life anyway? [[04:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17700.44s)]
*  I mean, it could be a deeply fulfilling video game. [[04:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17702.4s)]
*  It doesn't have to be just like dopamine rush. [[04:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17705.8s)]
*  It could be educational, it could be scary. [[04:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17709.4s)]
*  It could be challenging, forcing an evolution, [[04:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17711.72s)]
*  the leap into adventure that makes up a fulfilling life. [[04:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17717.4s)]
*  That could be video games. [[04:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17722.88s)]
*  Who knows, especially in virtual reality. [[04:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17724.4s)]
*  I tend to, that's the other thing. [[04:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17727.56s)]
*  I play a lot of video games. [[04:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17730.12s)]
*  I think there's a lot of room [[04:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17732.4s)]
*  to make video games deeply fulfilling. [[04:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17735.96s)]
*  Like there's a lot of space where that can go. [[04:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17739.420000000002s)]
*  I didn't know you played a lot of video games. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17742.16s)]
*  Cause when I asked you specifically, [[04:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17743.440000000002s)]
*  should I play World of Warcraft or do Advent of Code? [[04:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17745.4s)]
*  You're like, Advent of Code, Advent of Code. [[04:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17747.96s)]
*  Oh, well that might mean I've never played [[04:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17750.48s)]
*  World of Warcraft because there's certain games [[04:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17752.84s)]
*  I avoid, Fortnite by the way, I think was one of them. [[04:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17755.08s)]
*  Cause I was worried it'd become too addicted. [[04:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17758.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[04:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17760.88s)]
*  So there's certain games I just know [[04:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17761.8s)]
*  I won't get super addicted to. [[04:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17763.36s)]
*  For example, I'm terrified of civilization. [[04:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17765.4s)]
*  Like I have never played a Civs game because I'm worried. [[04:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17767.2s)]
*  I'm worried the dark path in my lead [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17772.0s)]
*  because there's some games just really pull you in. [[04:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17775.84s)]
*  I'm much better with, that's why I play Skyrim. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17778.32s)]
*  I can play these games or Baldur's Gate [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17781.32s)]
*  and moderate my, how much I play. [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17785.239999999998s)]
*  And they could be like a lifelong companion [[04:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17788.079999999998s)]
*  versus an addiction where I'm like, it's like sunrise [[04:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17790.16s)]
*  and you're like, what's happening with my life? [[04:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17793.72s)]
*  And I find myself naked behind a dumpster somewhere [[04:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17795.72s)]
*  just wondering what happened. [[04:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17798.16s)]
*  Yeah, so that's how I choose my video games. [[04:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17801.239999999998s)]
*  You're not the first person [[04:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17803.76s)]
*  who is specifically called out civilization. [[04:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17805.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17808.239999999998s)]
*  I've had more than one person, [[04:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17809.079999999998s)]
*  also very high up in the tech world be like, [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17810.2s)]
*  civilization is my downfall. [[04:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17812.32s)]
*  If I get near that game, I'm done. [[04:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17814.12s)]
*  Yep. [[04:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17816.0s)]
*  So. [[04:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17816.84s)]
*  I've never even played the game now. [[04:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17817.68s)]
*  It makes me be like, dude, I gotta give this a try. [[04:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17818.920000000002s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[04:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17820.68s)]
*  Yeah, and the new one is actually supposed to be [[04:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17822.12s)]
*  really, really good. [[04:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17824.0s)]
*  What were we talking about? [[04:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17825.08s)]
*  Yes, for that same young developer, [[04:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17826.36s)]
*  is there a trajectory through jobs [[04:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17827.88s)]
*  that you could give advice on? [[04:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17831.0s)]
*  So you started out with Schedulicity. [[04:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17833.760000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that was my first full-time, [[04:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17837.16s)]
*  when I had the government contracting one before [[04:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17839.64s)]
*  that wasn't quite full-time, it was in C, [[04:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17841.32s)]
*  it was a lot of fun. [[04:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17843.36s)]
*  And then building my own startup for quite some time. [[04:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17844.6s)]
*  So if you count either of those as full-time, [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17846.559999999998s)]
*  then those would be the full-time, [[04:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17848.92s)]
*  but Schedulicity was the official on the docks. [[04:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17849.88s)]
*  So is there some value to jumping around [[04:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17852.68s)]
*  like working in one company and another [[04:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17854.8s)]
*  to try to figure out like what brings you joy? [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17858.079999999998s)]
*  I think there's a lot to that [[04:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17861.399999999998s)]
*  because not every job you're gonna get is gonna be great. [[04:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17863.0s)]
*  Now your first job you could get could make you think [[04:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17867.68s)]
*  you hate programming. [[04:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17869.6s)]
*  It happened, I did an internship at a place, [[04:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17872.64s)]
*  I keep on like surprising you with more kind of things [[04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17874.239999999998s)]
*  I did in the past, did an internship at a... [[04:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17876.84s)]
*  Fuck, you did so many things, it's incredible. [[04:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17879.559999999998s)]
*  At a place called like Total Information Management System, [[04:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17881.92s)]
*  remember when I talked about that hours ago [[04:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17884.399999999998s)]
*  about healthcare and that, [[04:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17886.559999999998s)]
*  and industrial shipping and all that, [[04:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17888.399999999998s)]
*  it was a C-sharp shop. [[04:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17889.879999999997s)]
*  It was so bad that after I did that, [[04:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17891.0s)]
*  I went and changed my major to mechanical engineering [[04:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17892.8s)]
*  for a semester in college. [[04:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17895.359999999997s)]
*  Oh boy, oh boy. [[04:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17896.68s)]
*  I thought I, okay, actually I like computer science, [[04:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17897.519999999997s)]
*  I hate programming. [[04:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17899.56s)]
*  So, just because you've had a job doesn't mean [[04:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17901.48s)]
*  it's gonna be the one. [[04:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17904.2s)]
*  And the thing is, here's the best part though, [[04:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17905.52s)]
*  if you get a job and you like it and you want to do it [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17907.2s)]
*  and it's exciting, you don't need to change. [[04:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17910.52s)]
*  Right, I think a lot of people are like, [[04:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17913.960000000003s)]
*  oh, I gotta find the next thing, [[04:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17914.960000000003s)]
*  I've been here for two years. [[04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17916.04s)]
*  Like there's kind of this like, [[04:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17917.08s)]
*  you gotta move around mindset. [[04:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17918.280000000002s)]
*  I don't think you have to move around. [[04:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17920.36s)]
*  I don't think it hurts your career [[04:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17922.0s)]
*  because if anything, you'll gain more responsibility [[04:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17923.600000000002s)]
*  and you'll be able to talk with way more authority [[04:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17925.56s)]
*  and the next time you interview, [[04:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17927.04s)]
*  you're gonna be way more into like, [[04:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17927.96s)]
*  oh yeah, I had to get these ex people [[04:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17929.84s)]
*  and these ex people to be able to do all this stuff [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17931.68s)]
*  and it's like, you can talk with much more authority [[04:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17933.52s)]
*  if you stay out of place longer. [[04:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17935.239999999998s)]
*  And that's nothing but benefits in my book. [[04:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17936.719999999998s)]
*  It's only if you stay out of place because you're afraid [[04:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17938.96s)]
*  or you don't want to, you know, [[04:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17941.32s)]
*  you already have something that works for you [[04:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17943.12s)]
*  and you just never want to change [[04:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17944.559999999998s)]
*  and you're just like, [[04:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17945.8s)]
*  I gotta go in and just be completely mindless. [[04:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17946.64s)]
*  I think if you go mindless for a couple of years, [[04:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17948.92s)]
*  you'll find yourself, that's like the only real danger. [[04:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17950.52s)]
*  You just come out with nothing at all. [[04:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17953.559999999998s)]
*  Yeah, especially when you're younger, [[04:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17955.88s)]
*  that's the whole point. [[04:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17957.04s)]
*  Take the risk, take the leap out to the next thing, [[04:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17958.36s)]
*  to the next thing and not for money, [[04:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17960.36s)]
*  but for just personal joy. [[04:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17962.56s)]
*  And money could get at the end. [[04:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17964.88s)]
*  That's the best part is when you don't strive for the money, [[04:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17966.04s)]
*  sometimes the money just shows up anyways. [[04:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17967.760000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[04:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17969.48s)]
*  And some of the, what makes life worth living [[04:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17970.32s)]
*  is the people you work with, like a good team. [[04:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17973.0s)]
*  Some of it is like, not to be generic, [[04:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17976.36s)]
*  but you know, culture matters. [[04:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17978.440000000002s)]
*  It's whatever makes you happy. [[04:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17980.24s)]
*  Like for example, I just had, won't call out places, [[04:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17984.16s)]
*  but you know, there's certain companies [[04:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17987.399999999998s)]
*  where everybody is very nine to five [[04:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17988.879999999997s)]
*  and it's very, even if the work is exciting, [[04:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17991.079999999998s)]
*  they're not, they don't work hard enough, I would say. [[04:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17993.879999999997s)]
*  One of those people that likes to go all out, [[04:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17997.079999999998s)]
*  like likes to be surrounded by people [[04:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=17999.039999999997s)]
*  who are like super passionate. [[05:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18000.6s)]
*  Now, to be fair, a lot of them don't have families or don't. [[05:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18002.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18006.68s)]
*  It's a fascinating choice. [[05:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18007.52s)]
*  I really don't want to talk down on any choice, [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18008.36s)]
*  like work-life balance or not. [[05:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18010.8s)]
*  I think both are beautiful paths. [[05:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18013.56s)]
*  And like, if you really derive a lot of value [[05:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18015.52s)]
*  from joy from your work, going all in, [[05:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18019.2s)]
*  at least for some stretch of your life, [[05:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18023.280000000002s)]
*  is a beautiful thing to do. [[05:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18025.800000000003s)]
*  Just all out, full on passion, [[05:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18027.960000000003s)]
*  sacrifice a lot of social life, all that kind of stuff. [[05:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18033.52s)]
*  I don't know, that could also be beautiful. [[05:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18036.920000000002s)]
*  There could be something very, very exciting about that [[05:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18039.16s)]
*  in some sense, especially if you're building your own thing. [[05:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18041.36s)]
*  I can imagine that would be very exciting. [[05:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18044.16s)]
*  Like if I was Amazon, Jeff Bezos building Amazon, [[05:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18045.68s)]
*  one could imagine that those early years [[05:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18048.4s)]
*  were probably very rough [[05:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18049.920000000002s)]
*  and the amount of hours he probably put in [[05:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18051.84s)]
*  were very, very rough. [[05:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18053.36s)]
*  But I will say that there's this kind of unique aspect [[05:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18055.32s)]
*  in our culture where we kind of make this [[05:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18057.28s)]
*  as an equal trade-off between family or work. [[05:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18059.8s)]
*  Like, oh, you do or you don't have to have kids. [[05:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18063.12s)]
*  And my only kind of real notion with that one is that [[05:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18065.8s)]
*  you will never know your capacity for love [[05:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18069.399999999998s)]
*  until you have kids. [[05:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18074.12s)]
*  Like you just don't know. [[05:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18075.16s)]
*  And some people are like, oh yeah, but I love my dog. [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18076.879999999997s)]
*  It was just like, I loved my dogs too. [[05:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18079.199999999997s)]
*  And then I had kids and now my dogs are, they're all right. [[05:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18082.879999999997s)]
*  Like I like them. [[05:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18085.399999999998s)]
*  I could come home and I pet Indy and I'm like, oh Indy. [[05:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18086.76s)]
*  And then I'm just like, okay, bye Indy. [[05:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18088.879999999997s)]
*  Right, like it just, I can't even describe [[05:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18090.239999999998s)]
*  the difference between the two [[05:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18092.0s)]
*  because it's not even the same. [[05:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18093.68s)]
*  And so it's very, that trade-off you're making [[05:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18095.039999999997s)]
*  is no one can tell you what it's like [[05:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18097.52s)]
*  because there's a real reality that's right now. [[05:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18101.12s)]
*  And I'm sure I'm 100% positive this is with my wife as well. [[05:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18103.920000000002s)]
*  Where if right now we got news that said, [[05:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18107.84s)]
*  you have some medical procedure where if we do this, [[05:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18110.56s)]
*  you will die, but your kid will live. [[05:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18112.8s)]
*  There's not a question in my soul that I wouldn't do that. [[05:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18114.600000000002s)]
*  Right, if I was given, if I could look into the future [[05:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18117.28s)]
*  and if I had to die right now [[05:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18119.28s)]
*  knowing that my kids would have a better life, [[05:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18120.48s)]
*  they would be happier, they'd be more fulfilled [[05:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18121.88s)]
*  and all those things, I guarantee you either my wife [[05:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18123.68s)]
*  or I would take that every single time. [[05:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18126.68s)]
*  It's just like, you will never be able to say that [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18128.48s)]
*  about most things. [[05:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18130.12s)]
*  People will jokingly say that [[05:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18130.96s)]
*  until it's actually on the line. [[05:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18132.12s)]
*  But it's like with that, you just have this ferociousness. [[05:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18134.36s)]
*  I can break out in sweat thinking about somebody [[05:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18137.16s)]
*  fictionally pushing my kid to the ground. [[05:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18139.760000000002s)]
*  Like they actually get real adrenal responses [[05:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18142.08s)]
*  flowing through my body. [[05:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18146.08s)]
*  So it's just like such a different world [[05:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18146.96s)]
*  and it's hard to explain. [[05:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18148.64s)]
*  And you could never have convinced me when I was young [[05:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18149.6s)]
*  that it'd be this big. [[05:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18151.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[05:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18152.24s)]
*  I thought I knew, I didn't know. [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18153.28s)]
*  But to add on top of that, [[05:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18155.68s)]
*  some of the most successful people I know, [[05:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18158.08s)]
*  some of the most productive people I know have kids. [[05:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18160.36s)]
*  So like, I don't know if it's even a trade-off. [[05:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18162.800000000003s)]
*  Like that love you feel, [[05:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18165.920000000002s)]
*  it seems to be a catalyst for like, [[05:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18167.88s)]
*  to make sure you have less time [[05:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18170.52s)]
*  but you're gonna use that time better to be productive. [[05:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18173.120000000003s)]
*  I would argue that I'm, [[05:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18175.960000000003s)]
*  it definitely changed a lot of my life [[05:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18177.960000000003s)]
*  and how I approach problems and everything [[05:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18180.16s)]
*  in a very different way. [[05:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18182.16s)]
*  Let me ask some random questions from Reddit. [[05:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18183.920000000002s)]
*  On a scale of one to 10, [[05:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18187.52s)]
*  how much do you hate every product Microsoft [[05:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18189.32s)]
*  has ever created and why is it a 10? [[05:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18191.72s)]
*  Okay, I think we covered that. [[05:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18194.24s)]
*  We haven't technically covered it. [[05:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18195.960000000003s)]
*  There you go. [[05:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18198.280000000002s)]
*  All right, go ahead, go ahead. [[05:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18199.120000000003s)]
*  Okay, the only thing I'll say is that [[05:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18200.24s)]
*  I don't like that Microsoft pretends to be the good guy [[05:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18202.24s)]
*  when what they really wanted to get you addicted [[05:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18205.84s)]
*  to their products, [[05:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18207.760000000002s)]
*  to get you to use their products as much as possible [[05:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18208.600000000002s)]
*  so they can extract as much money out of you. [[05:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18210.280000000002s)]
*  Well, in this world, are there really good guys? [[05:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18212.04s)]
*  That's a great point. [[05:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18215.52s)]
*  I would argue NeoVim is a great guy. [[05:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18216.36s)]
*  There's no way they can make money. [[05:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18218.84s)]
*  Justin Keyes is the benevolent dictator [[05:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18220.56s)]
*  and he thinks deeply about the product [[05:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18222.52s)]
*  and tries to make it the best as possible. [[05:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18224.36s)]
*  Whereas something like Microsoft, [[05:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18226.280000000002s)]
*  they made VS Code as a loss leader. [[05:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18227.48s)]
*  Copilot's probably operating on a loss leader. [[05:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18231.36s)]
*  These things are all getting you so tied into GitHub, [[05:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18233.600000000002s)]
*  remote workspaces, CI, Copilot. [[05:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18237.0s)]
*  You become this trapped in permanent person [[05:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18239.96s)]
*  and if that price rises, [[05:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18242.52s)]
*  the switching cost is so great at some point [[05:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18244.12s)]
*  that you'll never be able to switch. [[05:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18246.16s)]
*  That's my only fear is that Microsoft was once accused [[05:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18247.559999999998s)]
*  of EEE and it feels like they're EEEing again. [[05:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18250.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm nervous about criticizing a good thing [[05:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18253.0s)]
*  because you could see an incentive to do that good thing. [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18256.96s)]
*  Google creating all these services that don't make money [[05:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18260.04s)]
*  like Gmail, for example. [[05:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18262.719999999998s)]
*  You can sort of cynically say they're only doing that [[05:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18264.16s)]
*  to tie you into an ecosystem [[05:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18268.96s)]
*  so they can basically keep you for life. [[05:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18270.239999999998s)]
*  But also it's awesome that they created Gmail [[05:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18274.6s)]
*  and they create an incredible product. [[05:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18277.6s)]
*  I can side with you on that one. [[05:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18280.8s)]
*  It is a good product. [[05:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18281.84s)]
*  VS Code is a good product. [[05:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18282.76s)]
*  Don't put that on the street. [[05:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18285.2s)]
*  But it was fine. [[05:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18286.84s)]
*  They did a great job. [[05:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18288.96s)]
*  Yeah, so there is going to be financial incentives [[05:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18290.2s)]
*  behind some of these companies. [[05:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18293.36s)]
*  And by the way, me defending, not defending, [[05:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18294.399999999998s)]
*  but saying positive things about Microsoft [[05:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18297.24s)]
*  is just so I could talk shit to Prime. [[05:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18298.84s)]
*  But that's. [[05:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18300.36s)]
*  I love that by the way. [[05:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18302.04s)]
*  Yeah, Linux is my first and last love. [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18303.24s)]
*  It definitely, the spirit of Linux in the open source [[05:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18305.960000000003s)]
*  is a beautiful thing. [[05:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18308.800000000003s)]
*  So I do think that when you have these large corporations, [[05:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18310.0s)]
*  even when they try to do good, [[05:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18315.52s)]
*  oftentimes the profit imperative just takes over [[05:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18317.04s)]
*  and they can corrupt themselves. [[05:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18321.68s)]
*  And Microsoft has a long history [[05:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18324.72s)]
*  of doing just that to themselves. [[05:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18326.16s)]
*  That said, they've done, you know, [[05:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18328.079999999998s)]
*  they have, you could say for cynical reasons [[05:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18330.56s)]
*  because they want to seem like the good guy [[05:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18332.52s)]
*  amongst developers, [[05:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18335.24s)]
*  but they've done a lot to support open source. [[05:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18336.079999999998s)]
*  It's just like same with Meta. [[05:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18338.56s)]
*  They've, Meta has done like insane amount [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18340.24s)]
*  to support open source. [[05:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18343.72s)]
*  And you can say, actually for that one, [[05:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18345.16s)]
*  I don't even, I don't know if I can even make a financial [[05:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18347.76s)]
*  or a cynical case for why Meta is open sourcing llama [[05:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18351.04s)]
*  and like these. [[05:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18354.32s)]
*  Yeah, that one's confusing. [[05:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18355.16s)]
*  It just seems great. [[05:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18356.16s)]
*  Maybe for hiring, but no, I think that's legit, [[05:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18357.0s)]
*  just an ethical, really powerful decision. [[05:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18360.64s)]
*  And sometimes these companies, [[05:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18364.8s)]
*  because they have a lot of cash, [[05:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18367.32s)]
*  can make the right, do the right thing. [[05:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18369.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18373.44s)]
*  It's a really positive way to look at it [[05:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18374.36s)]
*  and I think that's really nice. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18375.56s)]
*  But we should always be skeptical. [[05:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18377.079999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, cause at the end of the day, [[05:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18378.88s)]
*  companies, they're not good, they're not bad, right? [[05:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18380.2s)]
*  They're morally neutral. [[05:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18382.56s)]
*  It's the people that are running them the decisions [[05:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18383.48s)]
*  those people make that are really where the bad [[05:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18385.04s)]
*  or the good comes from. [[05:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18386.600000000002s)]
*  Another question asking if he knows how to milk a cow. [[05:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18388.52s)]
*  I've already asked that. [[05:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18391.120000000003s)]
*  The answer is no. [[05:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18392.52s)]
*  No, you don't know. [[05:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18394.32s)]
*  I've never milked a cow. [[05:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18395.16s)]
*  Never milked a cow. [[05:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18396.4s)]
*  Almost been killed by cow, but never milked a cow. [[05:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18397.8s)]
*  Do you ever ride a bull? [[05:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18400.24s)]
*  No. [[05:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18401.68s)]
*  All right. [[05:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18402.64s)]
*  Why male models? [[05:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18404.08s)]
*  Okay, so I can explain that one. [[05:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18406.8s)]
*  I will say something like, [[05:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18408.760000000002s)]
*  I really dislike the color purple [[05:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18410.760000000002s)]
*  because the color purple makes me upset. [[05:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18413.88s)]
*  I don't know, just something very benign, [[05:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18415.64s)]
*  but then someone right afterwards will be like, [[05:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18417.24s)]
*  but why don't you like the color purple? [[05:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18419.88s)]
*  And it's just be like, it's just like Derek Zulander. [[05:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18422.64s)]
*  It's just like, I get done on a five minute talk about it. [[05:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18425.44s)]
*  And then the next question is like, but seriously, why though? [[05:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18428.16s)]
*  It's just like, why male models? [[05:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18430.28s)]
*  Yeah, so that's the Zulander reference [[05:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18432.48s)]
*  when there's a long explanation why male models [[05:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18434.0s)]
*  and he agrees and then forgets. [[05:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18437.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18440.36s)]
*  What is Ligma? [[05:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18444.2s)]
*  You know, I've died by Ligma quite a few times. [[05:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18446.36s)]
*  Ligma, so do you know the origin story of Ligma? [[05:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18448.44s)]
*  No. [[05:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18450.72s)]
*  So Ninja, famous streamer, someone got him with Ligma, [[05:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18451.56s)]
*  said like, oh, something like, have you heard about Ligma? [[05:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18454.64s)]
*  And he was like, no. [[05:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18456.64s)]
*  And he's like, oh, Ligma balls, right? [[05:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18457.88s)]
*  And then after that, Ninja got like so hurt [[05:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18459.8s)]
*  by getting had by that, that he started banning it. [[05:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18463.2s)]
*  Anyone in chat who said the word Ligma or something like that. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18466.44s)]
*  And so then it'd be, you know, [[05:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18468.52s)]
*  if you don't embrace the meme, you get destroyed. [[05:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18469.36s)]
*  So of course it gets destroyed. [[05:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18472.2s)]
*  And so then the whole goal is that, [[05:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18474.4s)]
*  can people get me with Ligma? [[05:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18475.24s)]
*  TJ did Eyeladies. [[05:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18477.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, did you hear that? [[05:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18478.2s)]
*  E-girls got renamed to Eyeladies. [[05:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18479.280000000002s)]
*  And I just didn't even see it coming. [[05:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18480.88s)]
*  And I was just like, what? [[05:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18482.32s)]
*  And he's like, Eyeladies, nuts on your face. [[05:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18483.4s)]
*  And then it's just like, oh my gosh. [[05:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18485.04s)]
*  And then a pirate software has also got me like, [[05:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18486.84s)]
*  oh, have you heard about Google SEMA? [[05:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18489.0s)]
*  Which SEMA is a real product by Google. [[05:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18490.32s)]
*  And I'm like, oh yeah, I've heard about this. [[05:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18492.48s)]
*  What is this again? [[05:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18493.800000000003s)]
*  He's like, SEMA balls, right? [[05:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18494.640000000003s)]
*  It's just like, dang it. [[05:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18495.920000000002s)]
*  How do I keep? [[05:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18496.920000000002s)]
*  So I've just had it happen live on stream many, many times. [[05:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18497.760000000002s)]
*  I've died by Ligma the most. [[05:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18502.08s)]
*  Please ask him about the size of his Dict. [[05:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18504.4s)]
*  Okay, so that's D-I-C-T. [[05:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18508.72s)]
*  That's dictionary in Python. [[05:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18511.0s)]
*  Who doesn't love Dicts? [[05:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18512.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[05:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18514.160000000003s)]
*  Just a Dict party when you use Python. [[05:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18516.08s)]
*  I love Dicts. [[05:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18518.160000000003s)]
*  That should be a T-shirt. [[05:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18519.760000000002s)]
*  That's actually a hilarious T-shirt. [[05:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18522.480000000003s)]
*  But so on Stack Overflow, [[05:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18523.640000000003s)]
*  you can ask any question you want. [[05:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18526.320000000003s)]
*  And I decided to craft a question one day on Stack Overflow [[05:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18527.88s)]
*  that says how to measure your Dict in bytes. [[05:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18531.56s)]
*  And then I proceeded to really go to town [[05:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18534.48s)]
*  and explain all the different things like, [[05:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18537.68s)]
*  well, what about the cost of the strings and the references? [[05:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18539.48s)]
*  And when you really get both hands on your Dict [[05:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18542.04s)]
*  and really go after it, [[05:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18544.72s)]
*  very hard done, really threw in some innuendos. [[05:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18545.800000000003s)]
*  The Stack Overflow team deleted the question. [[05:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18548.56s)]
*  And then someone hand wrote me an email [[05:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18551.920000000002s)]
*  explaining why they deleted the question [[05:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18555.440000000002s)]
*  and complimented me on how thoroughly and thoughtful [[05:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18557.56s)]
*  the question was just to weave in innuendos [[05:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18560.68s)]
*  and that the entire team was impressed, [[05:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18563.96s)]
*  but it's inappropriate and it had to be deleted [[05:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18566.08s)]
*  and don't do it again or we're gonna ban your account. [[05:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18568.84s)]
*  And so it was like very funny moment. [[05:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18570.96s)]
*  And so I was like, oh, that's funny. [[05:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18573.08s)]
*  You know, that happened. [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18574.04s)]
*  That was about six years ago. [[05:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18576.08s)]
*  Last year I was at a conference [[05:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18578.8s)]
*  and there was a guy wearing a Stack Overflow name tag. [[05:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18580.84s)]
*  And I was like, oh, you work at Stack Overflow. [[05:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18584.16s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, I do. [[05:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18586.28s)]
*  I'm like, do I got a story for you? [[05:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18587.12s)]
*  And he goes, no, wait a second. [[05:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18588.44s)]
*  Are you the Dict guy? [[05:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18590.2s)]
*  Like that was his only question was that. [[05:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18591.76s)]
*  And I was just like, let's go. [[05:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18594.36s)]
*  I'd even say anything about me and he already knew. [[05:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18596.32s)]
*  Immediately I was the Dict guy. [[05:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18598.52s)]
*  I should say in all seriousness, [[05:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18600.88s)]
*  I think I've had a bunch of conversations [[05:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18602.2s)]
*  in the Python world where I would have to mention [[05:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18604.48s)]
*  the name of this data structure [[05:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18606.92s)]
*  and it makes me uncomfortable every time. [[05:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18608.079999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a very unfortunate shortening of a word. [[05:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18610.56s)]
*  Dict. [[05:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18613.16s)]
*  It's just like when I go to the hardware store [[05:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18614.32s)]
*  and ask for cock. [[05:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18616.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18617.84s)]
*  And there's always a nice old lady [[05:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18619.36s)]
*  and I ask her where to find and it's very uncomfortable. [[05:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18621.68s)]
*  I try to pronounce it as hard as I can. [[05:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18625.44s)]
*  Really get that L in there like call. [[05:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18627.4s)]
*  Call. [[05:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18629.76s)]
*  Just to be clear and try to avoid eye contact the whole time. [[05:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18631.04s)]
*  You said that God was a big part of your life. [[05:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18635.56s)]
*  Can you speak to that a little bit more? [[05:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18640.64s)]
*  Who is God and what effect, [[05:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18642.32s)]
*  what role do you play in your life? [[05:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18645.44s)]
*  I did talk about that one important evening [[05:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18648.48s)]
*  where I for whatever reason gained my conscious that moment. [[05:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18650.36s)]
*  So obviously for me that I grew up with a life [[05:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18656.84s)]
*  where I would probably argue myself as a functional atheist. [[05:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18660.32s)]
*  I went to church a handful of times. [[05:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18663.2s)]
*  I can't quite really remember actually going to church [[05:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18664.96s)]
*  as a family in any sort of sense. [[05:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18667.76s)]
*  So there wasn't like some super strong tie [[05:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18669.64s)]
*  or anything like that to it. [[05:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18671.84s)]
*  Like pretty much anyone else growing up in America [[05:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18673.36s)]
*  in the nineties, you had some sort of impact [[05:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18675.84s)]
*  or intersection with church at some point in your life. [[05:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18677.84s)]
*  That was just a very normal thing I would probably say. [[05:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18681.44s)]
*  And so when that happened, [[05:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18685.0s)]
*  it was a fairly big surprise for me. [[05:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18686.52s)]
*  I wasn't necessarily going that direction [[05:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18689.32s)]
*  or deciding to do any of those things. [[05:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18692.32s)]
*  And so for me it's obviously the turning point [[05:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18693.72s)]
*  of my entire life. [[05:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18696.96s)]
*  I cannot speak to who I would be now without that. [[05:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18699.28s)]
*  I can just tell you that I wouldn't have had the drive. [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18703.96s)]
*  I probably would not have completed college. [[05:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18706.079999999998s)]
*  I would not have found my wife or had my kids. [[05:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18707.8s)]
*  I wouldn't know how to value people. [[05:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18710.04s)]
*  I don't think without that whole thing, [[05:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18711.6s)]
*  my value for people would have been very, very small [[05:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18714.719999999998s)]
*  because I would have continued to just objectifying [[05:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18717.68s)]
*  in the way I was. [[05:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18720.0s)]
*  And then probably the biggest thing is there's this one verse [[05:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18721.079999999998s)]
*  I don't even know where it's at. [[05:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18725.399999999998s)]
*  It effectively says that we love because he first loved us. [[05:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18726.64s)]
*  And so for me it's like, [[05:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18730.12s)]
*  I don't think I would have ever lived a life [[05:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18734.2s)]
*  that was happy without this. [[05:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18736.879999999997s)]
*  And I just didn't even know that that was an option for me. [[05:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18738.84s)]
*  And I never really, [[05:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18742.239999999998s)]
*  it was a very tough set of years for me. [[05:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18743.96s)]
*  And I was very, very sad and just always kind of [[05:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18746.28s)]
*  just constantly looking for something to fulfill me. [[05:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18749.16s)]
*  And so it's like, I didn't have any confidence. [[05:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18752.04s)]
*  I didn't have any joy. [[05:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18754.6s)]
*  I felt very sad. [[05:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18756.52s)]
*  And so that was kind of this moment [[05:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18759.64s)]
*  where for the first time ever, [[05:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18762.84s)]
*  all of a sudden I just felt like I didn't have to live up [[05:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18766.120000000003s)]
*  to a standard, right? [[05:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18769.120000000003s)]
*  Like the standards have already been paid for. [[05:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18771.0s)]
*  Like everything's already, [[05:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18772.760000000002s)]
*  like that's the free gift. [[05:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18773.600000000002s)]
*  That's the exchange. [[05:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18775.48s)]
*  And so it's just like for the first time, [[05:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18776.8s)]
*  I didn't have to be the cool guy. [[05:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18778.36s)]
*  I didn't have to have all the right words. [[05:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18780.280000000002s)]
*  I didn't have to feel, [[05:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18781.64s)]
*  I didn't have to go on the conquest, [[05:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18783.4s)]
*  the sexual conquest to find validation. [[05:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18784.64s)]
*  Like I didn't have to do any of those things. [[05:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18786.760000000002s)]
*  And it was exceptionally liberating. [[05:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18789.04s)]
*  And so who is God? [[05:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18792.16s)]
*  That's more of like a catechism question perhaps. [[05:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18793.36s)]
*  What is man? [[05:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18796.48s)]
*  Who is God, right? [[05:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18797.32s)]
*  Like those are much, much harder questions. [[05:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18798.16s)]
*  I believe that anytime you tried to get too deep [[05:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18801.280000000002s)]
*  into describing who God is, [[05:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18803.48s)]
*  you typically fall into Christian heresy. [[05:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18804.600000000002s)]
*  But for you, he gave you a chance to be happy. [[05:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18807.56s)]
*  Yeah, he gave me a chance not just to be happy, [[05:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18811.16s)]
*  but also made it so that like the first time [[05:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18813.120000000003s)]
*  I can actually feel forgiven, I guess, in some sense. [[05:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18817.84s)]
*  And able to forgive people that hurt me. [[05:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18822.2s)]
*  Like for a long time, I had this like weight [[05:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18824.120000000003s)]
*  I'd carry around from like the things I hated [[05:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18827.120000000003s)]
*  about high school and all that kind of stuff. [[05:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18829.120000000003s)]
*  And through that experience, [[05:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18831.4s)]
*  I just wrote down every last person's name [[05:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18834.0s)]
*  and actually held them with me for quite some time. [[05:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18835.72s)]
*  And this was the list of people I forgave. [[05:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18837.960000000003s)]
*  And I read it a few times [[05:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18840.600000000002s)]
*  because like I couldn't let myself be angry [[05:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18841.56s)]
*  or consumed by that kind of stuff. [[05:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18844.64s)]
*  Because like hate is so sticky, right? [[05:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18846.120000000003s)]
*  It sticks for a lifetime. [[05:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18849.4s)]
*  And there really is only one cure for hate, [[05:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18850.8s)]
*  which is forgiveness. [[05:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18853.12s)]
*  Like I just don't think you can get rid of it without that. [[05:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18854.28s)]
*  And so I just had choose to forgive these people [[05:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18857.399999999998s)]
*  and to move on. [[05:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18859.88s)]
*  And it really kind of freed me. [[05:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18860.92s)]
*  And I would never have thought forgiveness [[05:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18862.44s)]
*  as a means for that change [[05:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18864.28s)]
*  if I didn't first experience it myself. [[05:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18867.079999999998s)]
*  What's the role of love in the human condition [[05:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18870.48s)]
*  to go to the philosophical? [[05:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18873.76s)]
*  And what's been the role of love in your life? [[05:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18875.96s)]
*  It's very obvious that every person wants or desires love. [[05:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18879.84s)]
*  My wife has recently convinced me [[05:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18886.6s)]
*  to watch Love is Blind with her one time. [[05:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18888.88s)]
*  And you watch the show and if you're not familiar with it, [[05:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18891.28s)]
*  it's just, it feels like it's just a disaster [[05:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18894.0s)]
*  of an experiment to just cause crazy filming. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18896.8s)]
*  But anyways, the idea is that if you just don't see somebody, [[05:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18899.56s)]
*  you can fall in love with somebody [[05:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18902.08s)]
*  and want to marry them after like 10 days [[05:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18903.16s)]
*  or some very small period of time. [[05:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18904.72s)]
*  And what you really end up seeing [[05:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18907.68s)]
*  is all these people who are just desperate for actually love. [[05:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18911.039999999997s)]
*  And there's like some part of it, [[05:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18914.44s)]
*  I always, I told my wife, it's like love gladiators. [[05:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18915.719999999998s)]
*  We're watching people battle it out for drama [[05:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18918.239999999998s)]
*  and really what they want is love. [[05:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18920.64s)]
*  And it's like they're fighting to the death in love, [[05:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18922.039999999997s)]
*  if you will. [[05:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18924.12s)]
*  And it's this almost kind of sad aspect to watch. [[05:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18924.96s)]
*  And so I think that it's hard to call like, [[05:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18928.8s)]
*  what is its role in the human experience? [[05:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18932.52s)]
*  Because I don't think, [[05:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18935.120000000003s)]
*  I think it's just something that we all naturally [[05:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18938.160000000003s)]
*  not just want, but need. [[05:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18940.440000000002s)]
*  And I don't think that you can really progress. [[05:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18942.440000000002s)]
*  And when I say the word love, [[05:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18945.24s)]
*  I would like to kind of narrow it down, maybe a bit more. [[05:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18946.960000000003s)]
*  And I don't mean like Eros, the Greek word, like sexy love. [[05:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18951.24s)]
*  I think that paternal and friendship love [[05:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18954.84s)]
*  are extremely important. [[05:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18957.04s)]
*  And I think agape, like God love is also very important. [[05:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18957.88s)]
*  Agape love is the one that is superior to them all, [[05:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18960.960000000003s)]
*  but obviously different. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18963.760000000002s)]
*  And also, you know, co-needed with the parental ones [[05:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18966.0s)]
*  and all that. [[05:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18968.16s)]
*  And so you kind of need this mixture of them all. [[05:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18969.0s)]
*  And each one is different for each reason [[05:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18971.8s)]
*  and where it's applied. [[05:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18973.600000000002s)]
*  And so I don't think, [[05:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18974.920000000002s)]
*  I just don't see a world in which [[05:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18978.920000000002s)]
*  is good of any kind without that [[05:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18983.920000000002s)]
*  as like a very foundational piece, right? [[05:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18986.440000000002s)]
*  Because, you know, again, not, you know, [[05:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18989.48s)]
*  I didn't come here trying to quote any sort of scripture, [[05:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18991.920000000002s)]
*  but it says that it's not the nails that hung on there, [[05:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18995.96s)]
*  it's love. [[05:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18997.04s)]
*  That's the reason why these things happen. [[05:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18997.88s)]
*  And so it's, if forgiveness is the requirement [[05:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=18999.4s)]
*  to kind of pay off hate in some sense, [[05:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19003.28s)]
*  then love has to be the motivation for forgiveness. [[05:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19005.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's the tragic aspect of life. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19008.56s)]
*  I think we're all, there's like a deep loneliness [[05:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19011.4s)]
*  in all of us and a longing, [[05:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19014.08s)]
*  longing to be a part of this bigger thing. [[05:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19017.16s)]
*  And that longing is a love and it has many names, [[05:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19022.36s)]
*  but yeah, the love aspect of it [[05:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19026.32s)]
*  is the beautiful aspect of life. [[05:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19029.600000000002s)]
*  The tragedies, the loneliness, [[05:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19031.32s)]
*  and the unfortunate suffering. [[05:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19033.800000000003s)]
*  That is a fundamental part of life. [[05:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19037.480000000003s)]
*  And the beautiful aspect is the love. [[05:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19039.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19042.4s)]
*  Which I think is a good time to mention more Reddit, [[05:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19044.440000000002s)]
*  the place for everlasting positivity and love. [[05:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19047.24s)]
*  Somebody wrote, please thank him, you, [[05:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19052.4s)]
*  for his everlasting positivity [[05:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19057.920000000002s)]
*  and give him a big hug for me. [[05:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19060.800000000003s)]
*  So I won't give you a big hug on camera [[05:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19064.24s)]
*  because I'm afraid I'll get a boner [[05:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19067.68s)]
*  and that will be very unfortunate. [[05:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19069.4s)]
*  Hey, let's not bring dicks into this again, okay? [[05:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19071.36s)]
*  It's my favorite data structure. [[05:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19073.640000000003s)]
*  Like I said, I love dicks. [[05:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19075.440000000002s)]
*  All kinds of dicks, ordered dicks. [[05:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19077.600000000002s)]
*  Unordered? [[05:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19079.84s)]
*  Unordered dicks. [[05:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19080.760000000002s)]
*  I don't discriminate. [[05:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19082.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19083.32s)]
*  But just that to say like big thank you. [[05:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19087.28s)]
*  For me, like I listen to you a lot [[05:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19091.84s)]
*  and I just really enjoy, [[05:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19094.72s)]
*  I've been going through a lot of shit myself [[05:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19096.8s)]
*  and just the positivity, [[05:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19098.84s)]
*  even when you're building the stupidest shit, [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19101.56s)]
*  it's just the positivity radiates from you [[05:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19104.28s)]
*  and you inspire me to be a good person, [[05:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19106.68s)]
*  you inspire me to build stuff. [[05:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19111.32s)]
*  So thank you. [[05:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19112.16s)]
*  And I'm sure there's many, many others [[05:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19113.399999999998s)]
*  who listen to you for the same reason. [[05:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19115.079999999998s)]
*  So thank you for your positivity. [[05:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19116.6s)]
*  Thank you for being the light in many people's lives [[05:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19118.44s)]
*  and thank you for talking to me, brother. [[05:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19121.84s)]
*  Dang, that was very, very kind. [[05:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19123.52s)]
*  I really do appreciate all those extremely nice words, [[05:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19125.56s)]
*  even from Reddit, that's very surprising, but thank you. [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19128.0s)]
*  I mean, I know you know that there's many people's lives [[05:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19133.0s)]
*  and I'm sure you've received the letters [[05:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19137.96s)]
*  that have been changed from actions [[05:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19139.16s)]
*  and things you've said and things you've done. [[05:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19141.56s)]
*  And so it's one of the best parts about doing this side [[05:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19143.12s)]
*  is that you get a chance to potentially [[05:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19148.88s)]

*  and saw his excitement for Swift [[05:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19158.84s)]
*  and probably went and learned Swift [[05:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19161.2s)]
*  and then got really amazing jobs [[05:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=19162.8s)]
