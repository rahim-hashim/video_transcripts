# Saagar Enjeti: Politics, History, and Power | Lex Fridman Podcast #167
**Lex Fridman:** [March 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grceJbuPUXI)
*  The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjati. He is a DC based political correspondent,
*  host of The Rising with Crystal Ball and host of the Realignment podcast with Marshall Kozlov.
*  He has interviewed Donald Trump four times and has interviewed a lot of major political figures
*  and human beings who wield power. He loves policy and loves history, which makes him a great person
*  to sail through the sometimes stormy waters of political discourse. He showed up to this
*  conversation with a gift of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's biography on Hitler, a two volume
*  set that is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, most definitive
*  studies of Hitler. Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting or first date than a great book
*  about the darkest aspects of human nature and human history. I think I started saying that as
*  a joke, but actually there's probably a lot of truth to it. I love it when we skip the small talk
*  and go straight to the in-depth conversation about the best and worst of human nature.

*  avoid the trap of surface political bickering of the day. I do find politics fascinating,
*  but not the talking points produced by the industrial engagement complex of Red vs. Blue
*  Division. Instead, I'm fascinated by human beings who seek power and how power changes them.
*  I don't have a political affiliation, and my ideas, at least I hope so, are defined more by
*  curiosity and learning in the face of uncertainty and less by the echo chambers who tell me what
*  I'm supposed to think. I'm constantly evolving, learning, and doing my best to do so without ego
*  and with empathy. Please be patient with me. As far as I'm aware, I do not have any derangement
*  syndromes, nor do I get a medical prescription of blue, red, white, or black pills. If I say something,
*  I say it because I'm genuinely thinking and struggling with ideas. I have no agenda,
*  just a bit of a hope to add more love to the world. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

*  There's no better gifts in this world than a book about Hitler. So thank you so much.
*  I've gotten a gift when I was, what were you talking about? Flying the watch from Joe Rogan,
*  and this almost beats it. So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is. So this is volume
*  two. Yes. So this is Ian Kershaw. He wrote the famous Two Volume on Hitler. I'm a big book nerd,
*  and I spend a lot of time reading biographies in particular. So this one, if you need a one volume,
*  Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, right? I think you talked about that, William Shire,
*  because that's like Hitler's rise, Nazi Germany, the war, et cetera. But I like bios because it's
*  the good biography story of the times, right? And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly
*  that, which is that it doesn't just tell the story of Hitler. It's the context of poor, you know,
*  this kid in Austria, and he's got all these dreams, but then actually pretty courageous in
*  terms of World War I, right? Gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser. And then what it's like to have
*  to lose World War I and actually like lose this stain and then the rise within, everybody knows
*  that story, the Beer Hall Putsch and all of that. This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw is
*  obviously number one, it's English, which is actually hard, right? Like in order to write
*  that story, who can do both the primary source material and then translate it for people like
*  us, but he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well in the second volume, just like the level
*  of detail. And you've talked about this, Lex, like what was it like inside that room, inside
*  with Chamberlain? Like what was it like in terms of who was this like magnetic madman who did convince
*  the smartest people in the world at the time? And, you know, up until like 1940, the Soviet gamble,
*  like was a tremendous, it took tremendous risks, but like highly calculated thinking, no, no, no,
*  I'm not going to pay for this one. I'm not going to pay for this one. And it put himself, he had a
*  remarkable ability, not just to put himself in the minds of the German people, but in terms of his
*  adversaries, like with when he was across from Mussolini, calculating, he's like, how exactly
*  did Mussolini, the guy who created fascism becomes like second fiddle to Hitler? I think it's an
*  amazing bio. And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans, two of my favorite authors on the
*  Third Reich, no question. Do you think he was born this way, that charisma, whatever that is, or was
*  it something he developed strategically? That's like the question you apply to some of the great
*  leaders. Was he just a madman who had the instinct to be able to control people when in the room
*  together with them? Or is this like, he worked at it? I think he worked at it. And but also there
*  is an innate quality. I'm forgetting his name, his lifelong, Rudolph, the one who flew to Berlin in
*  like 1940, I forget his name. Anyway, so he helped Hitler right, Mein Kampf. And he was like slavishly
*  devoted to him in prison. This is 1925 or something like that. And so you read that and you're like,
*  well, how does he get this like crank wacko to basically believe he's like the second coming,
*  help him write this book? I mean, literally, they live together in the prison cell and they
*  wake up every day and as he was composing Mein Kampf and because of the beer hall putsch,
*  and all that had this like absolute ability to gather people around him. I think his greatest
*  skill was as used a very good politician, truly. I mean, if you look at his ability in order to read
*  coalitional politics, and then convince exactly the right people in order to follow him. I think I
*  heard you asked this once and I've thought about it a lot, which is like, who could have stopped
*  Hitler in Germany, right? That's always like the ever present question, of course, like the whole
*  baby Hitler thing. Really, the answer is Hindenburg, like Hindenburg was the person who could have
*  stopped and had the immense standing within the German public. The only real like war hero,
*  definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism. And didn't like Hitler and didn't like him.
*  And he knew he was full of shit. He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous. I think this guy
*  could do a lot of damage to the republic, but he acceded basically to Hitler at the time. And I
*  think that he was one of the main people who could have done something about it. And also he was able
*  to convince the generals and military. I mean, that was, that was very interesting. And to convince
*  Chamberlain and the other political leaders. There's, there's something I often think about,
*  because we just reading books about these people. I think about what like Jeffrey Epstein, for example,
*  Oh yeah. Like evil people, not evil, but people have done evil things. Let's not
*  go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil. People that do evil things. I wonder what they're like
*  in a room because I know quite a lot of intelligent people that were, did not see,
*  did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein and spend time with them and not, were not bothered by it.
*  In the same sense, Hitler, it seems like he was able to get just even on a, before he would had
*  power, because people get intoxicated by power and so on. They want to be close to power, but even
*  before he had power, he was able to convince people and it's unclear. Like, is there something
*  that's more than words? It's like the way you, I mean, that people talk, tell stories about like
*  this piercing look and whatever, all that kind of stuff. I wonder if that, if that's somehow a
*  part of it, like that has to be the base floor of any of these charismatic leaders. You have to be
*  able to in a room alone, be able to convince anybody of anything. So I can tell you from my
*  personal experience, one of the best educated lessons I got was when I got to meet Trump.
*  So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist, spent like two and a half hours with
*  him in the Oval Office, not alone, but like me and one person and like the press secretary. And that
*  was it. So I actually got to observe him. And as a guy who reads these types of books, right? And,
*  you know, you think of Trump, obviously most people, what they see on television, you know,
*  in articles and more, but being able to observe it, like one-on-one, I was closer to him than,
*  you know, than I am right now from you. That was one of the most educational experiences I got,
*  because it's like you just said, the look, the leaning forward, the way he talks, the way he
*  is a master at taking the question and answering exactly which party wants. And then if you try
*  and follow up, he's like, excuse me, you know, he knows. And then whenever you're talking,
*  it's not that he's annoyed about getting interrupted. If he realizes he's been
*  merandering and then you interrupt him, all good. But if he's striving home a point, which he
*  has to make sure appears in your transcript or whatever, it's like, it really was fascinating
*  for me to look at. And what was also crazy with Trump is I realized how much he was living in the
*  moment. So like when I went to the Oval, you know, I've read all these biographies and like I walk in
*  and I'm like, holy shit. You're like, I'm in the Oval Office.
*  Were you interviewing him in the Oval Office?
*  In the Oval, every time. I was in the Oval Office.
*  You scared shitless? Sorry.
*  Well, I wasn't scared. I was just, look, it's the Oval Office, right? I mean, I'm this
*  nerd. He was like this kid. I'm so, I will admit this here, like I printed out on my dad's label
*  maker when I was like seven and I wrote like the Oval Office on my bedroom. So I was like, you know,
*  a huge nerd, like obviously you go maniacal even from seven. But so like for this, I mean,
*  it was huge, right? I'm like this 25 year old kid and like I walk in there and like I see the couch,
*  right? And I'm like, oh man, like that's Kissinger. Like, you know, I'm like, that's where like
*  Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees. And you see over by the door and you're like, are the scuff
*  marks still there from when Eisenhower used to play golf? You know, this is all running through
*  my mind. With Trump, none of it was there. None of it, right? So like-
*  It's all in the moment.
*  Even the desk, I put my phone on the desk to record. And I'm like, this is the fucking resolution.
*  Like I shouldn't put my phone on this thing. And I'm like HMS Resolute, you know, all the
*  international. Even for him, he doesn't think about any of it. It was like amazing to me. Like
*  he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson right next to his, to the, I think from on the fireplace,
*  like right here on the right. And the most revealing question was when I was like, Mr. President,
*  what are people going to remember you for in a hundred years? And he was like, he had, he was
*  like, I don't know, like veterans choice. He like has a list in front of him of like his
*  accomplishments, which is staff.
*  Good question, by the way.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know. And he's like, veterans choice. And I
*  remember looking at him being like, it's not going to be better. I'm like, I'm looking at you,
*  Donald Trump, the harbinger of something new. We still don't know what the hell it is. And so I
*  realized with these guys and their charisma and more is that they don't think about themselves the
*  way that we think about them. And that was actually important to understand. Cause a lot
*  of people like Trump is playing all this chess. I'm like, I assure you he's not like he's truly
*  one time I was interviewing him and he had like a certificate that he had to sign or something on
*  his desk. He's like, it was like child almost like he got distracted by the, he's like, oh,
*  what's this? You know, it's just like picking it up. And I was like, wow, like this, this is the
*  guy. Like this is what he is.
*  Well, I wonder if there was a different person because you were recording then
*  offline and I can tell you, well, here's the thing though, because that's another part of it,
*  because that two hours, I would say like half of that was not on the record. So like whenever he's
*  off the record, he changes completely. Right. I don't want to like go into too much of it or
*  whatever, but like he, uh, I mean, he is so mindful of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot
*  in terms of the language that he uses, what he's willing to admit, what he's willing to talk about,
*  how he's willing to even appear in front of his staff. Um, I think the most revealing thing
*  Trump ever did was there was this press conference, like right after he lost the,
*  the, uh, right after the midterm elections in 2018. And one of the journalists was like,
*  Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference. And he looks at him and he goes,
*  it's called earn media. It's worth billions. He just, he just like had so much disdain for him.
*  Cause he's like, I'm not doing this for you. He's like, I'm doing this for me.
*  So he's really aware of the narratives of the story. I mean that the people have talked about
*  that all comes from the tabloid media of the, from New York and so on. He's a master of that.
*  But I've also heard stories of just in private, he's a really, I don't want to overuse the word
*  charismatic, but just like he is a really interesting, almost like, um, friendly, like a
*  good person. Like, like that's what I heard. Uh, I haven't heard actually surprising the same thing
*  about Hillary Clinton. Uh, and like that, I can't tell you, but like the, the way they present
*  themselves is perhaps very different than they are as human beings. A one-on-one that that's
*  something, uh, maybe that's just like a skill thing. Maybe, maybe the way they present themselves
*  in public is actually their, their, uh, uh, I mean, almost their real self and they're just
*  really good in private one-on-one to go into this mode of just being really intimate in some kind
*  of human way. I think that's part of it because I noticed that with Trump, you know, he's like,
*  it's almost like a tour guide. It was very like, it's, it's, it's very crazy, right? Cause you're
*  like, you're in the oval. I mean, it's his office and he's like, he's like, do you guys want anything?
*  He's like, you want a diet coke? Cause he drinks like all this diet coke. You know, and yeah,
*  it's just like, he's like, you guys want a diet coke, right? And you're sitting there and you're
*  like the way he, he's able to like, like the last time we interviewed him, he, he wanted to do it
*  outside. Um, because he like, he studied himself from all angles and he knows exactly how he looks
*  on a camera and with which lighting. And so we were supposed to interview him on camera in the
*  oval office, which is actually rare. Like you don't usually get that. And they ended up moving
*  it outside at the last minute and he came out and he's like, I picked this spot for you. He's like,
*  great lighting. You are your own like,
*  but it's like you said, he's, he's very charismatic and friendly. I mean, you wouldn't know.
*  I mean, look, this is what I mean in terms of the dinet dynamism of these people that gets lost.
*  And I think even he knows that, like, I don't think he would want that side of him that I see,
*  you know, that you see in those off the record moments and more in order to come out, because
*  he's very keen about how exactly he presents to the public. It's like, you know, even his
*  presidential portrait, everybody usually smiles and he refused to smile. He was like, I want to
*  look like Winston Churchill, you know, like even he knew that. Do you think he believes that he, um,
*  what, what he kind of implies that he is one of, if not the greatest presidents in American history,
*  like people kind of laugh at this, but there's quite, I mean, there's quite a lot of people,
*  first of all, that make the argument that he's the greatest president in history. Like I've heard
*  this argument being made. Uh, and I mean, I don't know what the, first of all, I don't care.
*  Like you can't make an argument that anyone is the greatest. That's just, that's just, uh, I,
*  I come from a school of like being humble and modest and so on. It's like, even Michael,
*  you can't have that conversation. Okay. Uh, so I like that he's humble enough to say like, uh,
*  Abraham Lincoln and whatever, like he says, maybe Lincoln may remember that maybe, maybe.
*  Do you think he actually believes that or is that something he understands will, uh, create news and
*  also perhaps more importantly, piss off a large number of people is, is he almost like a musician
*  masterfully playing the emotions of the public or does he, or, or, and does he believe when he
*  looks in the mirror, I'm one of the greatest men in history. Combination of all three. Um, I do think
*  he believes it. And for the reason why is I don't think he knows that much about us history. I,
*  I really mean that like, and that's what I meant whenever I was in there and I realized he was just
*  living in the moment. I don't think he knew all that much about why, I mean, this is why
*  was elected in many ways. Right. So I'm not, I'm not saying this is an orbit, like I'm not making
*  a judgment on this. I'm just saying, I do think in his mind, he does think he was one of the best
*  presidents in American history, largely because, and I encountered this with a lot of people work
*  for him, which is that they didn't really know all that much kind of about what came before
*  and all that. And it's not necessarily to hold it against them because for in many ways, that's what
*  they were elected to do, um, or elected to be in many ways. It's an interesting question whether
*  knowing history, being a student of history is a, is productive or counterproductive. I tend to
*  assume I really respect people who are deeply like well read in history, like presidents that are
*  almost like nerd history nerds. I admire that. Uh, but maybe that gets in the way. Well, it's,
*  well governance. I don't know. It's not, it's not, you know, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate
*  to my own beliefs, but it's possible that focusing on the moment and the issues and letting history,
*  it's like first principles thinking, forget the lessons of the past and just focus on common sense
*  reasoning through the problems of today. Yeah. It's really hard question in terms of the modern era.
*  I mean, Obama was a student of history. Like he used to have presidential biographers and people
*  over in, I mean, famously like Robert de Caro, one of my favorite presidential biographers, he was
*  invited to have dinner with Obama and Obama would like pepper some of his every two. It was
*  interesting because he'd try and justify some of the things he didn't do by being like, well, if
*  you look at what they had to do and what I have to deal with, mine's much harder. So in that way,
*  I was a little pissed off because I'd be like, no, that actually like you're comparing apples to
*  oranges and all that. But if you look at Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt in particular, this was, I mean,
*  a voracious reader, not of just American history, all history. He wrote.
*  That guy's just such a bad ass. Jesus.
*  Incredible. The only president who willed himself to greatness. That's like the amazing thing about
*  him. He wasn't tested by a crisis, right? Like it wasn't, he didn't have the civil war, he didn't
*  have World War II. He didn't have to found the country literally, or like, you know, didn't have
*  to stave off that or he didn't buy, you know, Louisiana purchase like all that. He literally
*  came into a pretty, you know, static country and he could have just governed, you know, with,
*  I mean, he was the person who came before him was assassinated. Like he easily could have coasted,
*  but he literally willed the country into something more. And that is, that's always why I focus a lot
*  on him too. Cause I'm like that in many ways, I wouldn't say it's easy to be great during crisis.
*  I mean, like look at Trump, right? But like, but there, it can bring out the best within you,
*  but it's a, it's a whole other level to bring out the best within yourself just for the sake of
*  doing it. That's, I think is really interesting. The speeches were amazing. I'm also a sucker for
*  great speeches because I tend to see the role of the president as in part like,
*  inspire or in chief sort of to be able to, I mean, that's what great leaders do, like CEOs,
*  companies and so on, establish a vision, a clear vision and like, like hit that hard.
*  But the way you establish the vision isn't just like, not to dig at Joe Biden, but like,
*  like sleepy, boring statements. You have to sell those statements and you have to,
*  you know, you have to do it in a way where everybody's paying attention. Everybody's
*  excited. And that Teddy Roosevelt is definitely one of them. Obama was, I think at least early
*  on, I don't know, was incredible at that. It does feel that the modern political landscape makes it
*  more difficult to be inspirational in a sense, because everything becomes bickering and division.
*  I do want to ask you about Trump. So you're now a successful podcaster. I've talked to Joe
*  about Trump, Joe Rogan, and Joe's not interested in talking to Trump. It's just fascinating. I
*  tried to dig into like, why? What would you interview Trump on like realignment, for example?
*  And do you think it's possible to do a two, three hour conversation with him where you will get at
*  something like human or you get something like we're talking about the facade he puts forward.
*  Do you think you get past that? No, I don't. I look, I was a White House correspondent. I
*  observed this man very closely. I interviewed him. I think if that mic is hot, he knows what
*  he's doing. He just, he's, he's done this too long, Lex. He just knows. But do you think he's a
*  different human now after the election? Do you think that? Not at all. I don't, I think he's
*  been the same person since 1976. I really do. Like basically 1976. I studied Trump a lot and I think
*  he's basically been the core of who he is and elements of that. Ever since he built that,
*  sent, you know, the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention. That was it. Yeah. He's
*  a fascinating study. I still, I feel there's a hope in me that there would be a podcast like,
*  like a Joe Rogan, like a long form podcast where it's something could be, you know,
*  and you're actually a really good person to do that, where you can have a real conversation that
*  looks back at the election and reveal something on us. But perhaps he's thinking about running
*  again. And so maybe he'll never let down that guard. Yes. But like, you know, I just love it when
*  there's this switch in people where you start, start looking back at your life and wanting to
*  tell stories, like, you know, trying to extract wisdom and like realizing you're in this new phase
*  of life where like the battles have all been fought. Now you're this old, like former warrior,
*  and now you can tell the stories of that time. And it seems like Trump is still at it. Like the
*  young warrior he is, he's not in the mode of telling stories. You know what I got from Rogan?
*  He's the only president who didn't age while in office. It's true, right? Like, because,
*  and this is what I mean, because he lives in the moment, like the job actually aged Obama. I mean,
*  I mean, Bush, same thing. Even Clinton, Clinton was like fat. It looked miserable by like 2000 HW,
*  like, I mean, Reagan famous, actually, yeah, pretty much everybody I think about.
*  Um, yeah, including John F. Kennedy, who got much sicker while in office, the job like weighs on you
*  and makes you physically ill. Trump was, he's the only person who just didn't have to.
*  He almost got gotten stronger. And he was one of the most divisive, like the climate, there's so
*  many people attacking him, so much hatred, so much love and hatred. And it was just, he was, I mean,
*  it was, whatever it was, it was quite masterful and a fascinating study. I, if we, if we stick on
*  Hitler for just a minute, what lessons do you take from that time? Do you think it's a
*  unique moment in human history that World War II? I mean, both Stalin and Hitler,
*  you know, is it something that's just an outlier in all of human history in terms of the atrocities,
*  or is there, uh, lessons to be learned? You mentioned, we mentioned offline that you're
*  not just a student of the entirety of the history, but you're also fascinated by just different,
*  like policies and stuff. Like what's the immigration policy? What's the policy on science?
*  Look, Third Reich in Power, let me plug it, by Richard Evans, I think is what it was,
*  because that actually will tell you, like, what was it like to live under the Nazi regime without
*  the war? Yeah, it's a hard question in terms of the lessons that we can learn, because there's
*  a lot, and it's actually been over, it's been over-indexed almost, everything comes back to
*  Hitler in a conversation. So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin, and Hitler as, I don't want
*  to say payments for, but like, the end point payment for the sins and the problems of the
*  monarchical system that evolved within Europe, basically like 1400 and more. I basically think
*  that 1400, the wars between the state, wars between France, England, the balance of power,
*  eventually World War I, and then serfdom within Russia, the Russian Revolution, that birthed
*  Stalin, same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany, and this like incredibly crazy system
*  of balance of power in World War I. And then same thing within China in terms of the warring states,
*  and then the disintegration, the European, you know, how this is how they think of it, you know,
*  which is like the center of humiliation, and they had to have something like this. I think of it,
*  I try to think of it within the context of that. I don't want to think of, I don't want to sound
*  like an inevitableist, but I think of it as, I like to think about systems, especially here in
*  D.C., that's why I got into politics, which is that you have to understand systems of power
*  and the incentives within systems and the disincentives and the downside risk of what
*  you're creating, because that is what leads and creates the behavior within that system.
*  I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday. It's kind of funny, like,
*  I read these, I'm obsessed with these books by Robert Caro, the biographies of Lyndon Johnson.
*  He's written like 5,000 pages so far, and it's still not done. Okay, so like these are like books
*  I base my life on, and look, these are Washington and the story of the post-New Deal era and forward.
*  Not much has changed. Like the Senate is still the Senate, so many of the same problems with
*  the Senate are still there. In some cases, no, not anymore, but for a while, some of the people
*  who were there with Johnson are actually still, one of them is the President of the United States,
*  just a joke, and you think about also, same with the media relationship, right? Like there's this
*  media really, they may have come and gone, like the people who were in the media and who were cozy
*  with the administration officials, I mean, they just recreated themselves. It's like an ecosystem
*  which doesn't change, and that's why I'm like, oh, it's not that was a specific time, that's just DC,
*  like that is DC because of the way the system is architected. It's pretty much been that way since
*  1908, whenever like, you know, Teddy Roosevelt was dining with these journalists, and he would
*  yell at them, and then he would go over to the society house, and like, in many ways, that's now,
*  instead of going to Henry Adams' house, like the people are congregating in Calorama, which is the
*  richest neighborhood here, at somebody else's house. Like it's the same thing, so you have to think
*  about the system and then the incentives within that system about what the outcomes that they're
*  producing, if you actually want to think about how can I change this from the outside. That's also
*  why it's very difficult to change, because the system is designed in order to produce actually
*  pretty specific outcomes that can only be changed in extraordinary times. Yeah, it's sometimes hard
*  to predict what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive, the system that you create,
*  right? Right. In the case, because especially when it's novel kind of situations, Trump actually
*  created a pretty novel situation, and a lot of the things that we've seen in the 20th century
*  were very novel systems where people were very optimistic about the outcomes, right? And then it
*  turned out to not have the results that they predicted. In terms of like things being unchanged
*  for the past 100 years and so on, can you like Wikipedia style, or maybe like in musical form,
*  I'm only a bill, describe to me. I still sing that to my head sometimes. I'm just a bill.
*  I don't know what the rest of the song is, but let's leave that to people's imagination.
*  How does this whole thing work? How does the US political system work? The three branches.
*  How do you think about the system we have now? If you were to try to describe, if aliens showed up,
*  and asked you like they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing, should we destroy you
*  and as you plead to avoid destruction, how would you describe how this thing works?
*  I would say we come together and we pick the people who make our laws. Then we pick the guy
*  who executes those laws, and they together pick the people who determine whether they
*  or the president is breaking the law at the most basic level. That's how I would describe it.
*  The people who make the laws are Congress. The executive is charged with executing the laws
*  as passed by Congress, the branches of government, and the Supreme Court is picked by the president,
*  confirmed by the Senate, which then decides whether you or other people are breaking the law in terms
*  of interpretation of that law. That's basically it. Oh, and they decide whether those laws are
*  in, they fall within the restrictions and the want of the founders as expressed
*  by the Constitution of the United States, which is a set of principles that we came together in
*  1787, I want to make sure I get this right, 1787 and decided that we were going to live the rest of
*  our lives barring a revolution and more, and we've made it 200 and something years under that system.
*  So there's a balance of power because you have multiple branches, there's a tension and a balance
*  to it as designed by those original documents. Which is the most dysfunctional of the branches,
*  which is your favorite in terms of talking about systems and what's the greatest of concern and
*  what is the greatest source of benefit in your view? The presidency is my favorite to study,
*  obviously, because it is the one where there's most subjective variable change in terms of the
*  personality involved because of so much power imbued within the executive. The Senate is actually
*  pretty much the same. One of the things I love about reading about the Senate and histories of
*  the Senate is you're like, oh yeah, there were always like assholes in the Senate who were doing
*  their thing and, and you know, filibustering constantly based upon this or that. And then
*  the person the personalities involved with the Senate haven't mattered as much since like
*  pre-Civil War, right? Like pre-Civil War, you had like Henry Clay and then Daniel Webster and
*  John C. Calhoun, who even in their own way, they represented like larger constituencies and they
*  crafted these like compromises up until the outbreak of the Civil War, et cetera. But like
*  post since then, you don't think about like the Titans within the Senate. Most of that is because
*  a lot of the stuff that they had power over has transferred over to the executive. So I'm most
*  interested in really in like power, like where it lies. It's actually pretty, you know, throughout
*  American history, much more used to lie with Congress. Now it's obviously just so imbued
*  within the executive that understanding executive power is, I think the thing I'm probably most
*  interested in here. Do you think at this point, the amount of power that the president has is
*  corrupting to the, to their ability to lead well? Is this, you know, power corrupts, absolute power
*  corrupts? Absolutely. Are we, is there too much power in the, in the presidency?
*  There definitely is. And part of the problem, and I, one of the things I try to make come across
*  people is if you're the president, unless you have a hyper intentional view of how something
*  must be different in government, your view doesn't matter. So for example, like if you were Trump,
*  let's take Trump even, and even in with a pretty intentional view, he was like, I'm going to end
*  the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Right. And he came in and he gets these generals in, he's like,
*  I want to end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Oh, and I want to withdraw these troops from Syria.
*  And they're like, okay, we'll give you, give us like six months. He's like, okay. And this is the
*  thing about Trump. He doesn't realize that it's bullshit. So they're like, he's like, six months,
*  seems fun. Right. So then six months comes and he's like, he's like, so, and then he'll announce it.
*  He'd be like, and we're getting out of Syria. It's great. And then the generals freak out.
*  They're like, whoa, we don't have a plan for that. He's like, but you guys told me six months. He's
*  like, I don't know. Now we need another six months in order to figure this thing out. So that's how,
*  and by that time now you're midterms. So now what? Now you got to run for reelection.
*  So more, what I mean by that is if you don't have a hyper intentional view about how to change foreign
*  policy, if you don't have a hyper intentional view about how the department of commerce should do
*  its job, they are just going to go on autopilot. So there's, this is part of the problem. When you
*  ask me about the presidency, it's not the presidency itself, like the president himself,
*  which has become too powerful. It's that we have less democratic checks on the people and the
*  systems that are on autopilot. And I would say that basically since 2008, we have voted every
*  single time to disrupt that system, except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden. And there are a lot
*  of different reasons around why that happened. And in every single one of those cases, Obama and
*  Trump, they all failed in order to, in order to radically disrupt that. And that just shows you
*  how Titanic the task is. And I'm using my language precisely because I don't want to be like deep
*  state and all, but like, obviously there's deep state. Deep state, I guess has conspiratorial
*  attentions to it. But so you're, what you're saying is the true power currently lies with the
*  autopilot. Yeah. AKA deep state. Well, but see, it's not, this is the thing too. I want to make
*  it clear. Cause I think people think conspiratorially that they're all coming together to intentionally
*  do something. No, no, no, no, no. They are doing what they know, believe they are right and don't
*  have real democratic checks within that. And so now they have entire generations of cultures within
*  each of these bureaucracies where they say, this is the way that we do things around here. Yeah.
*  And that's the problem, which is that we have a culture of within many of these agencies and more.
*  I think the best example for this would be during the Ukraine, you know, gate with Trump and all
*  that, with the impeachment. I don't want to, I'm not talking about the politics here, but the most
*  revealing thing that happened was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman was like,
*  here you have the president departing from the policy of the United States. And I was like, well,
*  let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel. The president of the United States makes American
*  foreign policy, but it was a very revealing comment because he and met all the people within
*  national security bureaucracy do think that they're like, this is the policy of the United States.
*  It's we have to do this. That's where things get screwy. Well, listen for me personally,
*  but also from an engineering perspective, I just talked to Jim Keller. It's just, this is the kind
*  of bullshit that we all hate in when you're trying to innovate and design new products.
*  So that's what first principles thinking requires is like, we don't give a shit what was done before.
*  The point is what is the best way to do it? And it seems like the current government, government
*  in general, probably bureaucracies in general are just really good at being lazy about never having
*  those conversations. And just it becomes this momentum thing that nobody has the difficult
*  conversations. It's become a game within a certain set of constraints. And they never kind of do
*  revolutionary tasks. But you did say that the presidency is power, but you're saying that
*  more power than the others. And but that power has to be coupled with like focused intentionality.
*  Like you have to keep hammering the thing. If you want it done, it has to be done. I mean,
*  and you got to you got to this is the other part too, which is that it's not just that you have to
*  get it done. You have to pick the hundred people who you can trust to pick 10 people each to
*  actually do what you want. One of the most revealing quotes is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran. He was
*  the top aid to FDR. This I'm getting from the cara books too. And he said, what is a government?
*  It's not just one guy or even 10 guys. Hell, it's a thousand guys. And what FDR did is he
*  masterfully picked the right people to execute his will through the federal agencies. Johnson was the
*  same way he played these people like a fiddle. He knew exactly who to pick. He knew the system
*  and more. Part of the reason that outsiders who don't have a lot of experience in Washington
*  almost always fail is they don't know who to pick or they pick people who say one thing to their
*  face. And then when it comes time to carry out the president's policy in terms of the government,
*  they just don't do it. And the president's to think about this. I think some Rahm Emanuel said this.
*  He was like, by the time it gets to the president's desk, nobody else can solve it. It's not easy. It's
*  not like a yes or no question. It's every single thing that hits the president's desk is incredibly
*  hard to do. And Obama actually even said, and this was a very revealing quote about how he
*  thinks about the presidency, which is he's like, look, the presidency is like one of those super
*  tankers. He's like, I can come in and I can take it two degrees left and two degrees right. In a
*  hundred years, two degrees left. That's a whole different trajectory. Same thing on the right.
*  And he's like, that ultimately is really all you can do. I quibble and disagree with that in terms
*  of how he could have changed things in 2008, but there's a lot of truth to that statement.
*  Okay. That's really fast. You make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump are probably
*  playing victim here to the system. You're making me think that maybe you can correct me that,
*  because I'm thinking like Elon Musk, whose major success, despite everything is hiring the right
*  people and like creating those thousands that structure of a thousand people. So maybe a
*  president has power in that if they were exceptionally good at hiring the right people,
*  personnel is policy, man. That's, that's what it comes down to, but wouldn't you be able to
*  steer the ship way more than two degrees if you hire the right people. So like, it's almost like
*  Obama was not good at hiring the right people. Well, he hired all the Clinton people. That's
*  what happened. What happened with Trump? He hired all the Bush people. And then you sit back and say,
*  Oh, president can't, but that means you're just sucking hiring.
*  Correct. Yeah. I mean, look, I know it's funny. I'm giving you simultaneously the nationalist
*  case against Trump and the progressive case against Obama. The progressive people were like,
*  why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people in order to run the government and just
*  recreate like, why are you hiring Larry Summers? Who was one of the people who worked at all these
*  banks and didn't believe that bailouts are going to be big enough. And then to come in, in the worst
*  economic crisis in modern American history, that was 2008. And Summers actively lobbied against
*  larger bailouts, which had huge implications for working class people and pretty much hollowed out
*  America since. Okay. From Trump, same thing. You're like, I'm going to drain the swamp.
*  And by doing that, I'm going to hire Goldman Sachs is Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin and all these other
*  absolute Bush clowns in order to run my White House. Well, yeah, no shit. The only thing that
*  you accomplished in your four years in office is passing a massive tax cut for the rich and for
*  corporations. I wonder how that happened. What role does money play in all of this? Is money
*  huge influence in politics? Super PACs, all that kind of stuff. Or is this, is this more just kind
*  of a narrative that we play with? Because from the outsider's perspective, it seems to have
*  that seems to be one of the fundamental problems with modern politics.
*  So I was just having this conversation, Marshall and I, Marshall cost of my coast on the realignment.
*  And it's funny because if you do enough research, we actually live in the least corrupt age in
*  American campaign finance, as in it's never been more transparent. It's never been more up to the
*  FEC. Yeah. And all of that. If you go back and read not even 50 years ago, we're talking about
*  Lyndon B. Johnson handing people like literally as he came up in his youth, paying people for votes,
*  like the boss of the, you know, the person who like had all the Mexican votes, like the person
*  and he was like giving out briefcases for this is it like within people's lifetimes who are
*  alive in America. So that doesn't happen anymore. But I don't like to blame everything on money,
*  although I do think money is obviously a huge part of the problem. I actually look at it in terms of
*  distribution, which is that how is money distributed within our society? Because I
*  firmly believe that politics, this is going to get complicated, but I think politics is mostly
*  downstream from culture and culture. Obviously I'm using economics because there's obviously a huge
*  interplay there, but like in terms of the equitable or lack of equitable distribution of money within
*  our politics, what we're really pissed off about is we're like, our politics only seems to work
*  for the people who have money. I think that's largely true. I think that the reason why things
*  worked differently in the past is because our economy was structured in different ways.
*  And there's a reason that our politics today are very analogous to the last Gilded Age because we
*  had very similar levels of economic distribution and cultural problems too at the same time. I
*  don't want to erase that because I actually think that's what's driving all of our politics right
*  now. So that's interesting. So in that sense, representative government is doing a pretty good
*  job of representing the state of culture and the people and so on. Can I ask you in terms of
*  the deep state and conspiracy theories, there's a lot of talk about, again, from an outsider's
*  perspective, if I were just looking at Twitter, it seems that at least 90% of people in government
*  are pedophiles. 90 to 95%, I'm not sure what that number is. If I were to just look at Twitter,
*  honestly, or YouTube, I would think most of the world is a pedophile. I would almost feel like-
*  Right. And if you don't fully believe that, you're a pedophile.
*  I would start to wonder, wait, am I a pedophile too? I'm either a communist or a pedophile,
*  or both, I guess. Yeah, that's going to be clipped out. Thank you, internet.
*  I look forward to your emails. But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories that give you
*  a pause? Or sort of the flip side, the response to a lot of conspiracy theories is like,
*  no, the reason this happened is because it's a combination of just incompetence. So where do you
*  land on some of these conspiracy theories? I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.
*  Some are true, and those are spectacularly true. And if that makes sense.
*  Yeah. And we don't know which ones.
*  I don't know which ones. That's the problem.
*  I think, oh, well, I mean, look, man, I listened to your podcast. I think I was a huge non-believer
*  in UFOs, and now I've probably never believed more in UFOs. I believe in UFOs. I'm very comfortable
*  being like, not only do I believe in UFOs, I think we're probably being visited by an alien
*  civilization. And if you asked me that three years ago, I would have been like, you're out
*  of your fucking mind. What are you talking about? Well, listen to David Fravor. That's all I have
*  to say. That's it. I have the sense that the government has information that hasn't revealed,
*  but it's not like I don't think they're holding, there's a green guy sitting there in a room.
*  Right, exactly. They have seen things they don't know what to do with, so they're confused.
*  They're afraid of revealing that they don't know. That's what I think it is.
*  It's revealing exactly that they don't know. And then in the process, there's a lot of fears
*  tied up in that. First, looking incompetent in the public eye, nobody wants to be looked that way.
*  And the other is like, in revealing it, even though they don't know, maybe China will figure
*  it out. Exactly. So we don't want China to figure it out first. And so all those kinds of things
*  result in basically secrecy, then that damages the trust in institutions. One of the most fascinating
*  aspects, one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind, is there intelligent life out there
*  in the universe. So that's one of them. But there's other ones. For me, when I first came
*  across Alex Jones, it was 9-11. I remember, because I was in Chicago, I was thinking,
*  oh shit, are they going to hit Chicago too? That's what everybody was thinking.
*  Yeah, everybody was thinking, what does this mean? What scale? I mean, trying to interpret it.
*  And I remember looking for information. That's what happened. And I remember not being satisfied
*  with the quality of reporting and figuring out rigorous, here's exactly what happened.
*  And so people like Alex Jones stepped up and others that said, there's some shady shit going on.
*  And it sure as hell looked like there's shady shit going on. And I still stand behind the
*  fact that it seems like there's not enough, like it wasn't a good job of being honest and transparent
*  and all those kinds of things. Because it would implicate the Saudis, let's be honest. And see,
*  that's my conspiracy theories. I'm like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff because
*  they wanted to cover up for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And then, I mean, that was a
*  conspiracy theory not that long ago. I think it's true. I mean, I think it's 100% true.
*  Yeah. So those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting. I mean, there's other ones
*  for me personally that touched the institution that means a lot to me is the MIT and, you know,
*  Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah. I want to hear a lot more. I want to hear about that. I talk about Epstein
*  a lot. So I'm like- Oh, you do?
*  Yeah. And he, I was going to say in terms of conspiracy theory, that one changed my outlook
*  because I was like, whoa, you have this dude who convinced some of the most successful people on
*  earth that he was like some money manager. And it looks like it was totally fake. Like Leon Black.
*  I mean, this is one of the richest men on Wall Street, $9 billion net worth. Why has he given
*  him over $100 million between 2015 and 2019? What's going on here? Lex Wexner. So yeah,
*  I want to hear because you know people who met him. And the only person I know who met him was
*  Eric Weinstein. I've heard his, right? Oh boy. So I- Listen, I'm still in,
*  and Eric is fascinating and like Eric is full on saying that-
*  He was a Mossad or whatever. Yeah. There's a front for something,
*  something much, much bigger. And there's whatever his name, Robert Maxwell, all those stories.
*  Like you could dig deeper and deeper that Jeffrey's just like the tip of the iceberg. I just think he's
*  an exceptionally charismatic, listen, this isn't speaking from confidence or like
*  deep understanding of the situation, but from my speaking with people, he just seems like,
*  at least from the side of his influence and interaction with researchers, he just seems
*  like somebody that was exceptionally charismatic and actually took interest. He was unable to speak
*  about interesting scientific things, but he took interest in them. So he knew how to stroke the
*  egos of a lot of powerful people like, well, like in different kinds of ways, I suppose,
*  I don't know about this because I don't have, like if a really, okay, this is weird to say, but
*  I have an ability. Okay. I think women are beautiful. I like women, but like if like a
*  supermodel came to me or something, like, like I am able to reason. It seems like some people
*  are not able to think clearly when there's like an attractive woman in the room.
*  And I think that was one of the tools he used to manipulate people. Interesting. I don't know.
*  Listen, it's like the pedophile thing. I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts,
*  but like, it seems like we're like looking out into the world. Like there's a, like the me too
*  movement have revealed that there's a lot of like weird, like, creepy people out there. I don't know,
*  but I think it was just one of the many tools that he used to convince people and manipulate
*  people, but not in some like, um, evil way, but more just really good at the art of conversation
*  and just winning people over on the side. And then by building through that process, building a
*  network of other really powerful people and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit
*  with powerful people, like building up a kind of implied power of like, like we did some shady
*  shit together. So we're not like, you're going to help me out on this extra thing. I need to know.
*  And that builds and builds and builds to where you're able to actually control, like have quite
*  a lot of power without explicitly having like a strategy meeting. And I think a single person or
*  yeah, I think a single person can do that, can start that ball rolling and over time it becomes
*  a group thing. Like, I don't know if, uh, Julie Maxwell was involved or others and yeah, over time
*  it becomes almost like a really powerful organization that wasn't, that's not a front for something
*  much deeper and bigger, but it's almost like maybe it's cause I love cellular automata, man.
*  A system that starts out as a simple thing with simple rules can create incredible complexity.
*  And so I just think that, uh, we're now looking in retrospect, it looks like an incredibly complex
*  system that's operating. But like that's just because it's, you know, there could be a lot of
*  other Jeffrey Epstein's in my perspective that the simple thing just was successful early on and
*  builds and builds and builds and builds. And then there's a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects
*  of the system helped it get bigger and bigger and more powerful and so on. So the final result is,
*  I mean, listen, I have a pretty optimistic, I have a tendency to see the good in people.
*  And so it's been heartbreaking to me in general, just to see, you know, people I look up to
*  not have the level of integrity I thought they would or like the strength of character,
*  all those kinds of things. And it seems like you should be able to, to see the bullshit that is
*  Jeffrey Epstein, like when you meet them, we're not talking about like Eric Weinstein, like one or
*  two or three or five interactions, but like there's people that had like, like years of relationship
*  with him. And I don't know, I, I'm not sure even after he was convicted, after he was convicted,
*  that guy always gets me. Yeah, there's, there's stories. I mean, I don't need to sort of, uh,
*  uh, I honestly believe,
*  okay, here's the open question I have. I don't know how many creepy sexual people there are out
*  there. Like, I don't know if there's like, like the people I know, the faculty and so on, I don't
*  know if they have like a kink that I'm just not aware of that was being leveraged because to me,
*  it seems like if, if, if people aren't, if not everybody's the pedophile,
*  then it's just the art of conversation. That is just like the art of just like manipulating people
*  by making them feel good about like the exciting stuff they're doing. Listen, man, academics are
*  people talk about money. I don't think academics care about money as much as people think what they
*  care about is like somebody they, they want to be, uh, it's the same thing that Instagram models
*  posting their butt pictures is they want to be loved. They want attention. My parents are
*  professors. Yeah. They, they, and Jeff Epstein, like the money is another way to show attention.
*  Right. It's a proxy. It's it. My work matters. And, and, and he, for some of, he did that for some of
*  the weirdest, most brilliant people. I don't want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them.
*  It's like people that are the most interesting academics is the one he cared about. Like people
*  are thinking about the most difficult questions of an, in all of science and all of engineering. So
*  those people are, we're kind of outcasts in academia a little bit because they're doing
*  the weird shit. They're the weirdos and he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money. And that,
*  uh, you know, that's, I don't know if there's something more nefarious than that. Uh, I,
*  I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised. And in fact, the half the population of the world is
*  pedophiles. No, I think it's what you were talking about, which is that it's the, it's the implication
*  after the initial, right? Like you do some shady things together or you do something that you want
*  out of the public eye and you're a public person. And look, we probably even experienced this to a
*  limited extent, right? You're like, ah, you know, like, I don't want to, I don't know. I almost lost
*  my temper, you know, one time whenever a car hit me and I'm like, I can't freak out in public anymore.
*  You know, like what if somebody takes a photo or something? And so I think that there's an
*  extent to that times a billion, literally when you have a billion dollars or more and you take that
*  all together and you stack it up on itself. I saw a story about like Bill Clinton, like Bill Clinton
*  was with Epstein or with Ghislaine Maxwell in a private air terminal or something. And she had
*  one of their like sex, you know, one of those girls who was underage had her dressed up in a literal,
*  like pilot uniform. And she was underage in order to, you know, and she was being disguised for
*  being older. And she was a masseuse, right? Because that was one of the guises which they got in order
*  to sexually traffic these women. And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck and she's
*  like, give Bill Clinton a massage, right? So now there's a photo of an underage girl giving a massage
*  to the former president of the United States. I don't think he knew, right? But like that looks
*  bad. And so this is kind of what we're getting at, which is that you're setting it all up and
*  creating those preconditions. Or like Prince Andrew, do I think Prince Andrew knew that
*  Virginia Gouffre was underage? I don't know. Probably knew she was pretty young, which I think
*  is, you know, skeevy enough where you're a fucking prince, you probably know better. But I don't
*  think he knew she was underage or maybe he did. And if he did, then he's even more of a piece of
*  shit than I thought. But when we look at these things, the stuff I'm more interested in is like
*  what you were talking about. I'm like, Bill Gates, how do you get the richest man in the world in
*  your house? Like under what? Gates is like, he was talking about financing and all this. I'm like,
*  you don't have access to money or bankers? Like you're the richest man in the world. You can call
*  Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline. Like, why do you need? That's where I start again to
*  get more conspiratorial because I'm like, Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right? Like you
*  don't need Epstein to create some complicated financing structure. Or Leon Black, like what is
*  2015, 2009? I mean, this is very recent stuff. Or, and this is the part that really got me,
*  is I read the department, I think it's called the Department of Financial Services report
*  around Deutsche Bank with Epstein. They knew he was a criminal. They solicited his business,
*  explicitly knew that his business meant access to other high net worth individuals,
*  consistently doled money out from his account for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution
*  rings. They knew all of this within the bank. It was elevated multiple times. Here was the other
*  one. One of Epstein's associates was like, hey, how much money can we take out before we hit the
*  automatic sensor before you have to tell the IRS? And that question by their own standards is
*  supposed to result in a notification to the feds. And they never did it. And he was withdrawing
*  like $2 million of cash in five years for tips. I'm like, okay, like something's going on here.
*  Yeah. You see what I'm saying? There's a lot of signs that make you think that there is
*  a bigger thing at play than just the man. That there is some, it does look like a larger
*  organization is using this front, right? It's, again, I don't know. I truly don't know. And
*  I'm not willing to use the certainty, which I think a lot of people online are to say like,
*  it was 100%. The certainty is always the problem because that's probably why I hesitate to touch
*  conspiracy theories is because I'm allergic to certainty in all forms, in politics, any kind of
*  discourse. And people are so sure in both directions, actually, it's kind of hilarious.
*  Either they're sure that the conspiracy theory, a particular, whatever the conspiracy theories is
*  false. Like they almost dismiss it. Like, uh, like they don't even want to talk about it. It's like
*  the people, like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat. Yes. Most scientists are like,
*  they don't even want to like hear what the, what the flat earthers are saying. They don't have
*  zero patience for it, which is like, maybe in that case is deserved, but everything else,
*  you really like have empathy, like consider the, you have, okay, this is weird to say,
*  but I feel like you have to consider it that the earth might be flat for like
*  one minute. Like you have to be empathetic. You have to be open-minded.
*  I don't see a lot of that. There are cultural tastemakers and more. And that's,
*  that really is what concerns me the most. Cause it's just another manifestation of all of our
*  problems is that we have this completely bifurcating economy, bifurcating culture,
*  literally in terms of we have the middle of the country and then we have the coasts.
*  And in terms of the population, it's almost 50 50 and with, you know, increasing mega cities and
*  urban culture, like urban monoculture of LA, New York and Chicago and DC and Boston and Austin,
*  relative to how an entire other group of Americans live their lives or even the people within them,
*  who aren't rich and upwardly mobile, how they live their lives is just completely separating.
*  And all of our language and communication in mass media and more is to the top. And then everybody
*  else has forgotten. Do you think when you go, when you dig to the core, there is a big, there's a big
*  gap between left and right. Is there, is that division that that's perceived currently real
*  or are most people like center left and center right? It's so interesting because that's such
*  a loaded term center left. What does that mean? Like to you, I think the way you're thinking of
*  it is I'm not like a, well, even this, like I'm not a radical socialist, but I'm, I'm marginally left
*  on cultural issues and economic issues. This is how we've traditionally understood things.
*  And then when, when in popular discourse, like center, right, like, what does it mean to be
*  center right? Like I am marginally right on social, on conservative, on social issues
*  and marginally right on economic issues. But that's just not politics. Like if you look at
*  survey data, for example, like, uh, stimulus checks, people who are against stimulus checks
*  are conservative, right? Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check. So that means a sizable,
*  a number of Republicans are for stimulus checks. Same thing happens on like a wealth tax. Um,
*  the same thing happens on, okay, Florida voted for Trump 3.1% more than Barack Obama 2008.
*  At the same day passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%. So what's going on? So that's why I,
*  what is going on? Oh, that's my entire career.
*  But, but it seems like, uh, so that's, that's fascinating. Yeah. Conversation
*  is different than the policies. Well, it's different than reality. That's what I would say,
*  which is that the way we have to understand American politics today, it didn't always
*  used to be this way is it's almost entirely along basic. I would say the main divider
*  is because even when you talk about class, this misses it in terms of socioeconomics,
*  it's around culture, which is that it's basically, if you went to a four year degree
*  granting institution, you are part of one culture. If you didn't, you're part of another. I don't want
*  to erase the 20% or whatever of people who did go to college degree who were Republicans or vice
*  versa, et cetera. But I'm saying on average in terms of the median way that you feel we're
*  basically bifurcating along those lines. And cause people get upset, be like, oh, well, you know,
*  they're rich people who vote for Trump. And I'm like, yeah, but you know, you know who they are?
*  They're like plumbers or something like they're, they're people who make a hundred thousand dollars
*  a year, but they didn't go to a four year college degree and they might live who are in a place,
*  which is not an urban metro area. And then at the same time, you have like a Vox writer who makes
*  like 30 grand, but they have a lot more cultural power than like the plumber. So you have to think
*  about where exactly that line is. And I think in general, that's the way that we're trending.
*  So that's why when I say like, what's going on, are we divided? Yeah, like, but it's not left and
*  right. I mean, like, and that's why I hate these labels. So it's more, it's more just red and blue,
*  like teams, they're arbitrary teams. Yeah. So how arbitrary are these teams? I guess it's another
*  completely arbitrary. So you kind of imply that there's, I don't know if you're sort of in post
*  analyzing the patterns, cause it seems like there's a network effects of like, you just
*  pick the team red or blue and it might have to do with college. You might have to do all those
*  things, but like, it seems like it's more about, uh, just the people around you. Correct. So less
*  than whether you went to college or not. I mean, it's almost like, it seems like it's almost like,
*  uh, we're like a network effects that are hard. There's certain strong patterns you're identifying,
*  but I don't know. It's sad to think that it might be just teams that have nothing to do with what
*  you actually believe. Well, it is lacks. I look, I mean, I don't want to believe that,
*  but the data points me to this, which especially 2020, I'm one of the people chief among them.
*  I will own up to it here. I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016. I believed
*  and I based a lot of my public commentary belief on this. Trump was elected because of a rejection
*  of Hillary Clinton, neoliberalism on the back of a pro worker message, which was anti-immigration.
*  It was its pillar, but alongside of it was a rejection of free trade with China and generally
*  of the political correctness and globalism, which has been come in through the unit party. And same
*  thing here with the military industrial complex and endless war. He rejected all of that. What's
*  wait, what's wrong with that prediction? That's wrong, man. And the reason I know this is that
*  it sounds right. I wish it. I honestly wish it was true, but here's the truth. Trump actually
*  governed largely as a neoliberal Republican who was meaner online and who departed from orthodoxy
*  in some very important ways. Don't get me wrong. I will always support the trade war with China.
*  I will always support not expanding the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. I will support him moving
*  the Overton window on a million different things and revealing once and for all that GOP voters
*  don't care about economic orthodoxy necessarily, but here's what they do care about. Trump got
*  more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, despite not delivering largely, largely for all the Trump
*  people out there on that agenda. He wasn't more pro-union, but he won more union votes. He wasn't
*  necessarily more pro-worker, but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he did in 2016.
*  And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being all the immigration rhetoric, etc. Here's why.
*  It's about the culture, which is that the culture war is so hot that negative partisanship is at
*  such high levels, all of the vote is geared upon what the other guy might do in office. And there's
*  a poll actually just came out by Echelon Insights. Crystal and I were talking about it on Rising,
*  that number one concern amongst Democratic voters is Trump voters. Number one concern. Not issues
*  like Trump voters. And number two is white supremacy. And so like, which is basically code
*  for Trump voters. And is the same true for the other side? Well, so on the right, number one
*  concern is illegal immigration. And number, I think, three or four or whatever is Antifa,
*  which is code for Democrats. At least on the right, it's a policy kind of thing.
*  Well, yeah, it's funny. I saw Ben Shapiro talking about this. But the reason why I would
*  functionally say it's the same is because, I mean, you can believe whether it's true or not. I think
*  it actually largely is true. But a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of illegal immigration is
*  code for people who are coming in who are going to be legalized and are going to go vote Democrat.
*  I can just explain it from their point of view. So what does that actually mean, each other?
*  Like, each other, which is that the number one concern is the other person. So negative
*  partisanship has never been higher. And I think people who had my thesis in terms of why Trump
*  was elected in 2016, you have to grapple with this. Like, how did he win 10 million more votes?
*  He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency across three states. Like, I don't,
*  none of our popular discourse reflects that very stark reality. And I think so much of it is
*  people really hate liberals. Like, they just really hate them. And I was driving through
*  rural Nevada before the election. And I was like, literally in the middle of nowhere.
*  And there was this massive sign this guy had out in front of his house. It just said Trump,
*  colon, fuck your feelings. And I was like, that's it. That is why people voted for Trump. And I
*  don't want to denigrate it because they truly feel they have no cultural power in America,
*  except to raise the middle finger to the elite class by pressing the button for Trump. I get
*  that. That's actually a totally rational way to vote. It's not the way I wish I did vote,
*  but like, you know, that's not my place to say. So this is interesting. If you could just psychoanalyze
*  I'm again, probably naive about this, but I'm really bothered by the hatred of liberals.
*  It's a, it's a, this amorphous monster that's mocked. It's like the Shapiro liberal tears.
*  And I'm also really bothered by, uh, probably more of my colleagues and friends, the hatred of Trump.
*  Yeah. Uh, the, the, the Trump and, and white supremacist. So apparently 70, there's 70 million
*  white supremacists, 75 million, sorry. There's millions of white supremacists. And, uh, apparently
*  whatever liberal is, I mean, you know, you literally liberal has become equivalent to
*  white supremacist in the power of negativity. It arouses. I don't even know what those,
*  I mean, honestly, I just don't, they've become swears essentially. Uh, is that, I mean, how do we
*  get out of this? Because that, uh, that's why I just don't even say anything about politics online.
*  Cause it's like, really? Like you can't, you, here's what happens. Anything you say that's
*  like thoughtful, like, Hmm, I wonder the immigration, something like that. I wonder like why,
*  you know, uh, we have these many, we allow these many immigrants in or they could some version of
*  the, like thinking through these difficult policies and so on that they immediately tried to find like
*  a single word in something you say that can put you in a bin of liberal or white supremacist
*  and then hammer you to death by saying you're one of the two. And then everybody just piles on
*  happily that we finally nailed this white supremacist or liberal. And that is this some
*  kind of weird like feature of online communication that we've just stumbled upon? Is there a way,
*  or is it possible to argue that this is like a feature, not a bug? Like this is a good thing.
*  Yeah. Well, look, I just think it's a reflection of who we are. People like to blame social media.
*  I think we're just incredibly divided right now. I think we've been divided like this for the last
*  20 years. And I think that the reason I focus almost 99% of my public commentary on economics
*  is because you asked an important question at the top. How do we fix this? What did I say about the
*  stimulus checks? Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating. So that's the type of thing. If I was Joe
*  Biden and I wanted to actually heal this country, that's the very first thing I would have done when
*  I came into office. Same thing on, uh, when you look at anything that's going to increase wages.
*  Um, I, I said on the show, I was like, look, I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating
*  if he does two things. If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check and gives everybody who
*  wants a vaccine, a vaccine, that's it. It's pretty simple. Cause here's the thing. I don't really
*  like Greg Abbott that much. We have like very different politics. I'm from Texas, but my parents
*  got vaccinated really quickly. That means something to me. I'm like, listen, I don't really care about
*  a lot of the other stuff. He got my family vaccinated like that. Well, I will forever
*  remember that. And that's how we will remember the checks. This is a part of a reason why Trump
*  almost won the election and why, if the Republicans had been smart enough to give him a 2000, another
*  round of checks, 100% would have won, which is that people were like, look, I don't really like
*  Trump, but I got a check with his name on it. And that meant something to me and my family. I'm not
*  saying for all the libertarians out there that you should go and like endlessly spend money and buy
*  votes. What I am saying is lean into the majoritarian positions without adding your culture war
*  bullshit on top of it. So for example, what's the number one concern that AOC says after the first
*  round of checks get out? Oh, the checks didn't go to illegal immigrants. I'm like, are you out of
*  your fucking mind? Like this is the most popular policy America has probably done in 50 years,
*  you know, since like Medicare and you're going to ruin it, you're ruining it. Yeah. And then on the
*  right is the same thing, which is that they'll be like, these checks are going to like, you know,
*  low level blah, blah, you know, people who are lazy and don't work. I'm like, oh, there you go.
*  You know, like you're just playing a caricature of what you are. Like if you lean into those issues
*  and you got to do it clean, this is what everybody hates about DC, which is that Biden right now is
*  doing the $1,400 checks, but he's looping it in with his COVID relief bill and all that. That's
*  his prerogative. That's a Democrats prerogative. They won the election. That's fine. But I'll tell
*  you what I would have done if I was him. I would have come in and I would have said there's five
*  United States senators who are on the record, Republicans who said they'll vote for a $2,000
*  check. And I would put that on the floor of the United States Senate on my, you know, first or
*  so the first day possible. And I would have passed it. And I would have forced those Republican
*  senators to live up to that vote for this bill, come to the oval office for assigning so that the
*  very first thing of my presidency was to say, I'm giving you all this relief check. This night long
*  national nightmare is over. Take this money, do with it what you need. We've all suffered together.
*  The thing about Biden is he has a portrait of FDR in the oval, which kind of bothers me because he
*  thinks of himself as an FDR like figure. But this is, you have to understand the majesty of FDR.
*  We're talking about a person who passed a piece of legislation five days after he became president.
*  And he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation in the first hundred days. We're on
*  day like 3435 and nothing has passed. The reconciliation bill will eventually become law,
*  but it will become law with no Republican votes. And again, that's fine. But it's not fulfilling
*  that legacy and the urgency of the action and the mandate, which I believe that history has handed,
*  it handed it to Trump and he fucked it up, right? He totally screwed it up. He could have remade
*  America and made us into the greatest country ever coming out on the other side of this. He
*  decided not to do that. I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost. It's like all
*  you have to do. All America wants is for you to raise it up high, but he's keeping it within the
*  realm of traditional politics. I think it's a huge mistake. Why? So this is everything he's saying is
*  perfect sense. Like take, yeah, it's like, it's like, again, if the aliens showed up, it's like
*  the obvious thing to do is like, what's the popular thing? Like 80% of Americans support this.
*  Like do that clean. Also do it like with like grace where you're able to bring people together,
*  not like in a political way, but like obvious, like obvious common sense way, like just people,
*  the Republicans and Democrats is bringing them together on a policy and like bowl, just hammer
*  it without the dirt, without the mess, whatever, try to compromise, just the yell with have a good
*  Twitter account, like loud, very clear. We're going to give a $2,000 or a stimulus check.
*  Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale. What make America, let's make America
*  great again by manufacturing. Like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine
*  because we're bad motherfuckers. Yeah. And what without maybe with more eloquence than that and
*  just do that. Why haven't we seen that for many, for several presidencies? Because of
*  coalitional politics and they owe something to somebody else. For example, Biden has got a lot
*  of the democratic constituency has to satisfy within this bill. So there's going to be a lot
*  of shit that goes in there, state and local aid, all this stuff. Again, I'm not even saying this is
*  bad, but he's like, his theory is, and this isn't wrong, is like, we're going to take the really
*  popular stuff and use it as cover for the more downwardly less popular. And so the Dems could
*  face the accusation, the people who are on this side, this is their pushback to me. They're like,
*  why would we give away the most popular thing in the bill? And then we would never be able to pass
*  state and local aid, right? Why would we do that? And the Republicans do the same thing, right?
*  Mitch McConnell, because he's a fucking idiot, decided to say, we're going to pair these $2,000
*  stimulus checks with section 230 repeal. And it was like, oh, it's obviously dead, right? It's
*  not going to happen together. That's largely why I believe Trump lost the election and why those
*  races down in Georgia went the way that they did. Obviously Trump had something to do with it. But
*  the reason why is they have longstanding things that they've wanted to get done. And in the words
*  of Rahm Emanuel, never let a good crisis go to waste and try and get as much as you possibly can
*  done within a single bill. My counter would be this, things have worked this way for too long,
*  which is that the reconciliation bill is almost certainly going to be the only large signature
*  legislative accomplishment of the Biden presidency. That's just how American politics
*  works. Maybe he gets one more, maybe one, he gets a second reconciliation bill, then you're running
*  for midterms, it's over. I believe that by trying to change the paradigm of our politics,
*  leaning into exactly what I'm talking here, you could possibly transcend that to a new one.
*  And I'm not naive. I think people respond to political pressures. And the way that we found
*  this out was David Perdue, who is just a total corporate dollar general CEO guy. He was against
*  the original $1,200 stimulus checks. But then Trump came out, who's the single most popular
*  figure in the Republican party. He's like, I want $2,000 stimulus checks. And all of a sudden,
*  Perdue running in Georgia is like, yeah, I'm with President Trump. I want a $2,000 stimulus check.
*  That was, if you're an astute observer of politics to say, you can see there that you can force
*  people to do the right thing because it's the popular thing. And then if it's clean, if you
*  don't give them any other excuse, they have to do it. So this is what we've been gaslit into our
*  culture war framework of politics. And the reason it feels so broken and awful is because it is,
*  but there is a way out. It's just that nobody wants to be, it's a game of chicken, right?
*  Because maybe it is true. Maybe we would never be able to get your other democratic priorities
*  or Republican priorities. But I think that the country understands that this is fucking terrible
*  and would be willing to support somebody who does it differently. There's just a lot of
*  disincentives to not stay without, there's just a lot of incentives to not
*  stray from the traditional path. Yeah. Is it also possible that the A students are not participating?
*  Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics. So like you just said this argument
*  I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true. Like this is the obvious thing to do as a
*  student of history. You can always like tell, like if you look at great people in history,
*  this is what great leaders in history, this is what they did. It's like a clean, bold action.
*  Sometimes facing crisis, but we're facing a crisis. No, we're in a crisis.
*  We've been. So why don't we see those leaders step up? I mean, you say that's kind of like,
*  it makes sense. There's a lot of different interests to play. You don't want to risk too
*  many things on so forth, but that's what like, that sounds like the C students.
*  I don't think it's that. I think it's at the pipeline of politician creation is just totally
*  broken from beginning to end. So it's not that a students don't want to be politicians. It's
*  basically the way that our current primary system is constructed is what is the greatest threat to
*  you as a member of Congress. It's not losing your reelection. It's losing your primary. Right? So
*  that means, especially in a safe district, you're most concerned about being hit. If you're a
*  Republican from the right, and if you're a Democrat from the left for not being a good
*  enough one, that's actually what stops people, more heterodox people in particular from winning
*  primaries because the people who vote in our primaries are the party faithful. That's how
*  you get the production, the production. It's important to understand the production pipeline,
*  which is that, all right, I'm from Texas. So that's what I know best. So it's like,
*  if you think in Texas, if you're a more heterodox, like state legislature or something, who's real
*  works with the left on this and does that, you're going to get your ass beat in a Republican primary
*  because they're going to be like, he worked with the left to do this, blah, blah, take it out of
*  context and you're screwed. And then that means you never ascend up the next level of the ladder.
*  And then so on and so forth all the way. But I do think Trump changed everything. This is why I have
*  some hope, which is that he showed me that all the people I listened to were totally wrong about
*  politics. And that's the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me, which was I was like, wait,
*  I don't have to listen to these people. They don't know anything actually. You know? Yeah,
*  that's powerful, man. He did it. That's exceptionally powerful. This guy, even if he didn't
*  do anything with it, it doesn't matter. Right. He showed that it's possible. Exactly. And that,
*  that means, that means a lot. That means you're absolutely right. There's young people right now
*  that kind of look, turn around and like, huh. You're like, wait, I don't have to comb my hair
*  a certain way and go to law school and be an asshole who everybody knows is an asshole. And
*  then get elected to state legislature. I mean, look, who's the number one person in the New York
*  prime or New York City primary right now? Andrew Yang. He's polling higher than everybody else in
*  the race. I look, maybe the polls are totally fucked and maybe he'll lose because of rank
*  choice voting and all of that. But I consider Andrew, I mean, I know him a little bit and I've
*  followed his candidacy from the very beginning. I consider him an inspiration. He's the new
*  generation of politics. Like if I see who's going to be president 20 years from now,
*  it's going to be, I'm not saying it's going to be Andrew Yang. I think it's going to be somebody
*  like Andrew Yang outside the political system who talks in a totally different way. Right. Just
*  completely. One of my favorite things that he said on the debate stage, he's like, look at us,
*  we're all wearing makeup. It's crazy. You know, he like, he like brought that that he brought
*  that and he's right. Yeah. Why are they probably arguably hasn't gone far enough almost. Yes. But
*  he showed that it's possible. And then you see other like AOC is a good example of somebody.
*  At least in my opinion is doing the same kind of thing, but going too far in like, well, I don't
*  know. She's doing the Trump thing, but on the other side, so I don't know what's too far.
*  Normative judgment of it. Yeah. I will tell you the future of politics. Appreciate the art of it.
*  No, I do look, I don't, I'm not a big AOC fan, but she's a genius media genius. Once in a generation
*  talent, the way that she uses social media, Instagram, and everyone on the right is like
*  trying to copy her. Like Matt Gates, like, I want to be the conservative AOC. I'm like, it's just
*  not going to happen. Like you just don't have it. Like what she has, it's like, it's electric.
*  And Trump had that. Like I've been to a Trump rally, like to cover as a journalist,
*  there's nothing like it. And Yang is similar. It's the same way where you're like, there is
*  something going on here, which is just like, I've been to an Obama rally. I've been to a Clinton
*  rally. I've been to several normal politics. It's fine. You know, with Trump and with Yang,
*  it was, it's another world. Yeah. It's another world. Yeah. And yes, there's probably thousands
*  of people listening right now who are just like doing a slow clap. Yes. I know. I know. Yang
*  Gang forever. Okay. But yeah, I mean, my worst fear, I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free
*  improvisational idea exchange, all that versus AOC, who I think no matter what she stands for,
*  is a drama machine creates dramas. Just like Trump does. I would say my worst fear would be in 2024.
*  Is he old enough? It'd be AOC versus Trump. I don't think she's old enough. I think you'd have to be,
*  I think she's 30. So she needs five more years. So probably not. Yeah. Okay. But that kind of,
*  that's or Trump jr. Well, AOC probably wouldn't win a democratic primary. So I mean, look, Joe
*  Biden is, you know, that's pretty much showed that that's exactly what you're saying. Yes.
*  Process grooms you over time. It's you see the same thing in academia, actually, which is very
*  interesting is the process of getting tenure. There's this, it's like, you're being taught
*  without explicitly being taught. Yes. To behave in the way that everybody's behaved before.
*  I've heard this, it was funny. I've had a few conversations that were deeply disappointing,
*  which, which are, which involved statements like, this is what's good for your career. Yes.
*  This kind of conversation, almost like mentor to mentee conversation, where it's, you know, it's
*  like, there's a grooming process in the same way, I guess you're saying the primary process does the
*  same kind of thing. So I mean, that's what people have talked about with Andrew Yang, it was, it was,
*  he was being suppressed by a bunch of different forces, the mainstream media and all, just the
*  democratic, just that whole process didn't, didn't like the, the honesty that he was showing.
*  Right now. But here's my question to you. People got to see, look, Jordan Peterson is one of the
*  most famous people in America, right? Like you have a massive podcast, you're more famous than half the
*  99% of the people at MIT. So like, from that perspective, everything has changed. And
*  somewhere out there, there's a student who's taking notice. And I've noticed that with my own
*  career, everybody thought I was crazy for doing this show with Crystal the Hill. They thought it
*  was nuts. They're like, what are you doing? You're a White House correspondent. You've got a job
*  forever. The other job offer I had was being a White House correspondent. And people thought I was
*  nuts for not just sticking there and, you know, aging out within Washington, pining for appearances
*  on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC. But I hated it. I just hated doing it. And I did not want to be a
*  company man, like a Washington man, who's one of those guys who like brags to his friends about
*  how many times he's been on Fox or whatever, mostly because I just have a rebellious streak.
*  And I hate being at the subject of other people. I created something new, which a lot of people
*  watch to get their news. And I noticed that younger people who are almost all my audience,
*  they don't really look up to any of the people in traditional, right? They don't, they don't go and
*  they're not coming up and being like, how do I be like Jim Acosta? You know, they're like,
*  hey, how did you do what you do? And the way you did it is by bucking the system.
*  So I think that we are at a total split point. And look, there will always be a path for people,
*  because like, I don't want people to over learn this lesson. I have people who are like, I'm not
*  going to go to college. And I'm like, well, just wait. Yeah, like, I'm like, just like,
*  just hold on a second. But there will always be a path for the institutional there that will always
*  be there for you. But now there's something else. Now there's another game in town. And that's more
*  appealing to millions and millions and millions and millions of people who feel unserved by the
*  corporate media, CNN, and these people possibly who feel unserved in the, you know, the faculty.
*  Like, if you are an up and comer who wants to teach as many young people as possible,
*  I think you should be on YouTube, right? Like, look at the Khan Academy guy, that guy created
*  a huge business. So I just think we can be cynical and like upset about what that system is,
*  but we should also have hope. Like I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.
*  Yeah, there's a guy people should check out. So my story is a little bit different because
*  I basically stepped aside with the dream of being an entrepreneur earlier in the pipeline,
*  then like a like a legitimate like senior faculty would. There's an example, somebody
*  people should check out Andrew Huberman from Stanford who's a neuroscientist who's as world
*  class as it gets in terms of like 10 year faculty, just a really world class researcher. And now he's
*  doing YouTube. Yeah, I see him on Instagram. Yeah. And he's so he switched. So he not just does
*  Instagram. He now has a podcast and he's doing he's changing the nature of like, I believe that Andrew
*  might be the future of Stanford. And for a lot, it's funny, like he's basically Joe Rogan is an
*  inspiration to Andrew. And to me as well. And those ripple effects and Andrew is an inspiration,
*  probably just like you're saying to these young, like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty,
*  if we're just talking about academia, and the same is probably happening with with government is
*  funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring a huge number of people who are saying,
*  wait a minute, I don't have to play by the rules. And I have to I can think outside the box here.
*  And you're right. And the institutions we're seeing are just probably lagging behind.
*  So the optimistic view is the future is going to be full of exciting new ideas. So Andrew Young is
*  just kind of the beginning of this whole thing. And I hope that iceberg doesn't it's not that
*  this influencer one of the things that really bothers me. I've gotten a chance, I should be
*  careful here. I don't want to I love everybody. But, you know, these people who talk about like,
*  you know, how to make your first million or how to succeed and, and they're so I mean, yeah,
*  that that makes me a little bit cynical about I'm worried that the people that win the game of
*  politics will be ones that want to win the game of politics. And like we mentioned, AOC is I hope
*  they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right? Like, they optimize for that badass thing that
*  history will remember you as the great man or woman that did this thing, versus how do I maximize
*  engagement today and keep growing those numbers that the influencers are so I'm so allergic to
*  this man. They keep saying how many followers they have on the different accounts. And it's like,
*  I don't think they understand. Maybe I don't understand. I don't really care. I think
*  it has destructive psychological effects. One, like thinking about the number like getting excited,
*  your number went from 100 to 101. And being like, and today went out to 105. Whoa, that's a big
*  jump that maybe like thinking this way, like, I wonder what I did, I'll do that again. In this way,
*  one, it's, it creates anxiety and almost psychological effects, whatever. The the more
*  important thing is it prevents you from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history,
*  in creatively thinking outside the box doing huge actions. And I actually, my optimism is in the
*  sense that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers. Well, I don't know, Lex,
*  my cynicism comes in. So there's a guy Madison Cawthorn, the youngest member of Congress. And
*  he, I don't want to say got caught, but there was like an email where he was like,
*  my staff is only oriented around comms. Like he was basically saying he got basically
*  caught saying like, my staff is only centered on communications. And that's the right play.
*  If you do want to get the benefits of our current electoral, political, and engagement system,
*  which is that what's the best way to be known within the right as a as a right wing politician,
*  it's to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro's podcast, be one of the people on Fox News,
*  go on Sean Hannity's show, go on Tucker's show, and all that because you become a mini celebrity
*  within that world. Left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking portion of the
*  American population. And they barely they can't even win a popular vote election, let alone
*  barely win an eke out an electoral college victory in 2016. Well, but the incentives are
*  all aligned within that. And it's the same thing really on the left. But you're right, which is
*  that ultimate and look, this is this is why geniuses are geniuses because they buck the
*  short term incentives. They focus on the long term, they bet big, and they usually fail. But
*  then when they get big, they succeed spectacularly. The people I know who have done this the best are
*  like, a lot of the crypto folks that I've spoken to, like, some of the stuff they say, I'm like,
*  I don't know if that's gonna happen. But look, they're like billionaires, right? Yeah. And you're
*  like, so they were right. So it's the way I've heard it expressed is, you can be wrong a lot.
*  But when you're right, you get right big. And I mean, I've seen this in Elon Musk career. I mean,
*  he took spectacular risk, like spectacular risk, and just double down, double down, double down,
*  double down, double down. And you can kind of tell to him, I mean, you know better than I do. But
*  like, from my observation, I don't think the money matters. As right, I just like when I see him,
*  I'm like, it's nobody works as hard as you do, and builds the way that you build. If it's just about
*  the money, it just it just doesn't happen. Like, nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the
*  money. Like, it's not worth it, frankly, right? Like, he probably destroyed years of his life,
*  and like, mental sanity, money or attention or fame, none of that. Yeah, that's not the primary
*  part. Well, that's what's so appealing to me, to me in particular about him, just like, and how he
*  built, like, I read a biography of him, and just like, the way that he constructed his life, and
*  like, is able to hyper focus and meeting after meeting and drill down, and also hire all the
*  right people who execute each one of his tasks discreetly to his perfection is amazing. Like,
*  that's actually the mark of a good leader. But I mean, if you think about his career, the reason
*  he's a renegade is because probably he was told to like, put it in an index fund or whatever,
*  like whenever he made his like 29 million, and from PayPal, I don't know how much he made,
*  and then just go along that run. He's like, no, so he, you know, succeeds spectacularly. So you have
*  to have somebody who's willing to come in and buck that system. So for now, I think our politics
*  are generally frozen. I think that that model is going to be most generally appealing to the mean
*  person. But somebody will come along and we'll change everything. Yeah, I'm just surprised there's
*  not more of them. Yeah. On that topic, it's now 20, what is it 21? Yes. Let's make some predictions
*  he can be wrong about. Good. What major political people are you thinking will run in 2024,
*  including Trump, Jr. Senior, or Ivanka? I don't know. Trump. Trump. And who do you think wins?
*  I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024. And I think he will run against someone with the last
*  name Trump. I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump Jr. But I think one of those people
*  will probably be the GOP nominee in 2024. Who is it? Some prominent political figure,
*  was it Romney? Somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary if he runs again.
*  Of course. That's not even a question. Trump is the single most popular figure
*  in the Republican Party by orders of magnitude. I mean, probably more, honestly. There was a,
*  actually, I can tell you because I saw the data, which is that pre January 6, it was like 54% of
*  Republicans wanted him to run again. Then it went down eight points after January 6, two days later.
*  And then after impeachment, it went right back up to 54%. So the exact same number is in February,
*  at post impeachment vote as it was after November. Now look, yeah, again, surveys,
*  bullshit, etc. But like, that's all the data we have. That's what I can point to. If Trump runs,
*  he will be the nominee and he will be he will be the 2024 nominee. I just don't know if he wants to.
*  It really depends. Do you think he wins after the Trump vaccine heals all of us? Do you think Trump
*  wins? It depends on how popular culture functions over the next four years. And I can tell you that
*  they are because I don't think Biden has that much to do with it. Because again, Trump is not a
*  manifestation of an affirmative policy action. It is a defensive, bulwark wall against cultural
*  liberalism at its best. So it's like, this is why it doesn't matter what Biden does. If there are
*  more riots, if there is a more sense of persecution amongst people who are more leaning towards
*  conservative or like, hey, I don't know about that. That's crazy. Then he very well could win.
*  Okay, let's say Joe Biden doesn't run and they put up like Kamala Harris. I think he would beat her.
*  I don't think there's a question that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.
*  You don't think anybody else, I don't know how the process works. You don't think anybody else on the
*  Democratic side can take the- Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?
*  If Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating in the Democratic Party, if he says she is my heir,
*  I think enough people will listen to him in a competitive primary or a non-competitive primary.
*  Then there's all these things about how primary systems themselves are rigged. The DNC could make
*  it known that they'll blacklist anybody who does try and primary Kamala Harris. Look, I mean,
*  progressives aren't necessarily all that popular amongst actual Democrats. We found that out
*  during the election. There's an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden and Joe
*  Biden level politics. If he tells them to vote for Kamala, I think she would probably get it.
*  But again, there's a lot of game theory obviously happening.
*  But see, I think you're talking about everything you're saying is correct about mediocre candidates.
*  It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong, I don't want to use this term incorrectly,
*  but populist, somebody that speaks to the 80% that's is able to provide bold,
*  eloquently described solutions that are popular. I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.
*  How? How do they break through the primary system? Because the problem is the primary system is not
*  populism. It's primary. So it's like, but you don't think they can tweet their way to,
*  well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary. You basically have to be at whoever wins the GOP
*  primary, in my opinion, will be the person most hated by the left. One of the people,
*  things that people forget is, you know, who came in second to Trump, Ted Cruz. And the reason why
*  is because Ted Cruz was the second most hated guy by liberals in America, a second to Trump.
*  They have nothing in policy in common. But don't you think this kind of brilliantly
*  described system of hate being the main mechanism of our electoral choices? Don't you think that
*  just has to do with mediocre candidates? Like it's basically the field of candidates, including
*  Trump, including everybody was just like, didn't make anyone feel great. It's like, really, this
*  is what we have to choose from? Maybe a Mark Cuban or like, Mark Cuban is a Democrat, or
*  it would have to be somebody like that. Somebody who, because here's the thing about Trump. It's
*  not just that it was Trump. He was so fucking famous. Like people don't really, he was so
*  famous. Like I, even when I first met Trump, I met a couple of other presidents, but when I met Trump,
*  even I felt like kind of starstruck because I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.
*  I'm like, this is the dude. Because I'm like, my dad and I used to sit and watch The Apprentice
*  when I was in high school. And then one of the guys was from College Station where I grew up and
*  we're like, oh my God, like that guy's on The Apprentice. Like it was a phenomenon. There's like
*  that level. It's kind of like when I met Joe Rogan, I'm like, holy shit, that's Joe Rogan.
*  I don't feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney or Tom Cotton or Josh Hawley. I met all of them.
*  But there's a lot of celebrities, right? Do you think there's some celebrities we're not even
*  thinking about that could step in? The Rock? I was about to say, I think The Rock could do it,
*  but does he want to do it? I mean, it's terrible. Like it's a terrible gig. It's very hard to do.
*  I don't know if The Rock necessarily has like the formed policy agenda. Because then here's the other
*  problem. What if we set ourselves up for a system where like these people keep winning, but like
*  with Trump, they have no idea how to run a government? It's actually really hard, right?
*  And you have to have the know-how and the trust to find the right people. This is where the genius
*  element comes in is you have to understand that front and you have to understand how to execute
*  discrete tasks. Like this is the FDR. This is why it's so hard. Like FDR, Lincoln, TR. They were who
*  they were and they live in history and their name rings like for a reason. And yeah, I mean, one of
*  the most depressing lessons I got from 2020 is at almost, it seems like in my opinion, that we
*  over learn the lesson of our success and not of our failures. For example, like we have this
*  narrative in our head that we always have the right person at the right time during crisis.
*  And in some cases it was true. We didn't deserve Lincoln. We didn't deserve FDR. We didn't deserve
*  we didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis. But then you're like,
*  okay, George W. Bush, 9-11, that was terrible. Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?
*  Like we had several periods in our history where the crisis was there. They were called and they
*  did not show up. And I really, it hadn't happened in my lifetime except for 9-11. And even then you
*  could kind of see that as an opportunity for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it.
*  But then he didn't do it. And then Trump didn't do it. And you realize, I feel like our politics
*  are most analogous to like the 1910s, like all in terms of the Gilded Age in terms of that.
*  Remember this, that long period of presidents between, between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt,
*  we were like, wait, like who was president? Like, or even in, even TR was like an exception
*  where you have like Calvin Coolidge, who like Silent Cow, Grover Cleveland. That's kind of how,
*  if I think of us within history, I feel like we're in one of those times. We're just waiting.
*  It feels really important to us right now. Like this is the most important moment in history,
*  but it might be. It could just be a blip, right? 20, 30 year blip. Like when you think about who
*  was president between 1890 and 19 before, I mean, yeah, between like 1888 and 1910, like nobody
*  really thinks about that period of America, but like that was an entire lifetime for people,
*  right? Like what did they, how did they feel about the country that they were in?
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's how I kind of think about where we are.
*  Funny to think. I mean, I don't want to minimize it, but like we haven't really gone through a
*  World War II style of crisis. So like say that there is a crisis in like several decades of that
*  level, right? Existential risks to a large portion of the world. Then what will be remembered is
*  World War II, maybe a little bit about Vietnam and then whatever that crisis is. And this whole
*  period that we see as dramatic, even coronavirus, even 9-11, it's like, cause you can look at how
*  many people died and all those kinds of things, all the drama around the war on terror and all
*  those kinds of things. Maybe Obama will be remembered for being the first African-American
*  president, but then like that's, yeah, that's fascinating to think about. Oh man. Even Trump
*  will be like, Oh, okay. Cool. That guy. Yeah. Like maybe he'd be remembered as the first
*  celebrity. I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right? Yeah. So like the first
*  apolitical celebrity that was, so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,
*  they'll say that Trump was the first person to pave the way for celebrities to win. Oh man.
*  Yeah. And yeah, I still hold that this era will probably be remembered.
*  The, you know, people say I talk about Elon way too much, but, but the reality is like,
*  there's not many people that are doing the kind of things he's doing is why I talk about is
*  I think this era is not necessarily Elon and SpaceX, but this era will be remembered by
*  the new, the like of the space exploration of the commercial of companies getting into space
*  exploration of space travel and perhaps, perhaps like artificial intelligence around social media,
*  all those kinds of things. This might be remembered for that, but every, all the political
*  bickering, all that nonsense that might, we might, might be very well forgotten.
*  One way to think about it is that the internet is so young. Yeah. I think about it. So Jeff Jarvis,
*  he's a media scholar. I respect, he's not the only person to say this, but many others have,
*  which is that, look, this is kind of like the printing press. There was a whole 30 years war
*  because of the printing press. It took a long time for shit to sort out. I think that's where
*  we're at with the internet. Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything. And that's a good
*  thing. It can be very tumultuous. I never felt like I was living through history until coronavirus.
*  Like, you know, like until we were all locked down, I was like, I'm living through history.
*  Like this, there's this very overused cliche in DC where every com staffer wants you to think that
*  what their boss just did is history. And I've always been like, this isn't history. This is
*  some like stupid fucking bill, you know, whatever. But like, that was the first time I was like,
*  this is history. Like this right here. Well, I was hoping, uh, tragedy aside that this,
*  I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus so that we, because like, then we can see the,
*  so, okay, here's a bunch of people facing crisis and it's an opportunity for leaders to step up.
*  Like, I still believe the optimistic view is, uh, the game theory of like influencers
*  will always be defeated by actual great leaders. So like maybe the great leaders are rare,
*  but I think they're sufficiently out there that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis.
*  And coronavirus is, is obviously a crisis where like, you know, mass manufacture of tests,
*  uh, all, all kinds of infrastructure building that you could have done in 2020.
*  There's so many possibilities for just like bold action and, uh, none of that, even just forget
*  actually doing the action advocating for it. Just saying like this, we need, we need to do this.
*  And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made, I don't even remember a single speech that
*  Biden made because there's zero bold. I mean, their strategy was to be quiet and let Donald Trump,
*  uh, polarize the electorate, polarize the electorate and hope that results in, in, uh, them
*  winning, uh, because of the high unemployment numbers and all those kinds of things, as opposed
*  to like, let's go big. Let's go with a big speech. Like, you know that, uh, yeah, it's a lost,
*  opportunities in some sense. So we talked a bunch about politics, but one of the other interesting
*  things is they are involved with is, uh, or involved with defining the future of his journalism.
*  I suppose you can think of podcast is kind of journalism, but also just writing in general,
*  just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like, uh, is up to be defined by people
*  like you. So what do you think is broken about journalism and what do you think is the future?
*  Or journalism? I think the future of journalism looks much more like what we, you and I are doing
*  here right now. And journalism is going to be downstream from a culture that can be a good and
*  a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. We are going to look at our media. Our media is going
*  to look much more like it did pre-mass media. And the way that I mean that is that back in the 18,
*  in the 1800s in particular, especially after the invention of the telegraph, when information
*  itself was known. So for example, like you and I don't need to, let's say you and I are competing
*  journalists, you and I are no longer competing quote unquote to tell the public X event happened.
*  All journalism today is largely explaining why did X happen. And part of the problem with that
*  is that that means that it's all up for partisan interpretation. Now you can say that that's a bad
*  thing. I think it's a great thing because the highest level of literacy and news viewership
*  in America was during the time of yellow journalism was during the time of partisan
*  journalism. Not a surprise. People like to read the news from people that they agree with. You
*  could say that's bad echo chambers, et cetera. That's the downside of it. The upside is more
*  people are more educated. More people are interested in the news. So I think the proliferation
*  of mass media, I mean, sorry, of this format of long form, of, of not just long form, dude,
*  I do, I do updates on Instagram, which are five minutes. Are you considered like Instagram? Yeah.
*  Oh, even Twitter. Oh, of course, Twitter, Twitter is where I get my news from. I don't read the
*  paper. I have literally Twitter is my news aggregator. It's called my wire where I find out
*  about hard events. Like the president has departed the white house. But not only that,
*  I don't know about you, but I also looked at Twitter to the exact thing you're saying,
*  which is the response to the news. Like the thoughtful sounds ridiculous, but you can be
*  pretty thoughtful in a single tweet. If you file, if you follow the right people, you can get that.
*  And so that is the future of media, which is that the future of media is it will be much smaller
*  amount or it's much larger amounts of people, which are famous to smaller groups. So Walter
*  Cronkite is never going to happen again, at least in our, in probably within our lifetimes where
*  everybody in America knows who's this guy is that that age is over. I think that's a good thing
*  because now people are going to get the news from the people that they trust. Yes. Some of it will
*  be opinionated. I'm in my, my program. I'm well, Crystal and I are like, we are this, she's coming
*  from this like view. I'm coming from this view. That's our bias when we talk about information
*  and we're going to talk about the information that we think is important and it has garnered
*  a large audience. I think that's very much where the future is going to be. And the reason why I
*  think that's a good thing is because people will be engaged more within it rather than the current
*  system where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated, has group think, has the same
*  elite production pipeline problem of everybody knows journalists all come from the same socio
*  economic background and they all party together here in DC or in New York or in LA or wherever.
*  And there's part of the same monoculture and that affects what they, that affects what they report.
*  This will cause a total dispersion of all of that. The, the, a, the battle of our age is going to be
*  the guild versus the non-guild. So like what we see right now with the New York Times and Clubhouse
*  this is a very, very, very, very, very intentional thing that is happening, which is that the Times
*  talking about unfettered conversations that's happening on Clubhouse for people who aren't
*  aware. This is important because they need to be the fetters of conversation. They need to be the
*  inter agent. That's where they get their power. They get their power from convincing Facebook
*  that they are the ones who can fact check stuff. They are the ones who can tell you whether
*  something is right or wrong. That battle over unimpeded conversation and the explosion of a
*  format that you and I are doing really well in. And then this more consolidated one, which holds
*  cultural power and elite power, and more importantly, money, right over you and I,
*  that's the battle that we're all going to do. You think unfettered conversations have a chance to
*  win this battle? Yes, I do in the long run. In the long run, the internet is simply too powerful.
*  But here's the mistake everybody makes. The New York Times will never lose. It will just become
*  one of us. See, you think so they already are. They are the largest daily, the daily look at the
*  daily. Not even that. Think about it. Not in podcasting. The Times is not a mass media product.
*  It is a subscription product for upper middle class, largely white liberals who live the same
*  circumstances across the United States and in Europe. There's nothing wrong with that.
*  But here's the thing. You can't be the paper of record when you're actually the paper of upper
*  middle class white America. Your job is to report on the news from that angle and deliver them the
*  product that they want. There's nothing wrong with that. Their stock price is higher than ever.
*  They're making 10 times more money than they did 10 years ago. But it comes at the cost of not having
*  a mass application audience. So like when people, I think people in our space are always like,
*  New York Times is going to be destroyed. No, it's actually even better. They will just become one
*  of us. They already are. They're a subscription platform. Well, yes, in terms of the actual
*  mechanism. But, you know, New York Times is still, and I don't think I'm speaking about a particular
*  sector. I think it as a brand, it is, it does have the level of credibility assigned to it still.
*  You know, there's politicization of it. But it there's a credibility, like it has much more
*  credibility than, forgive me, but then I think you and I have, you're right. In terms of your
*  podcast, like people are not going to be like, they're going to cite the New York Times versus
*  what you said on the podcast for, for an opinion that I wonder in the sense of battles, whether on
*  federal conversations, whether Joe Rogan, whether your podcast can become the, have the same level
*  of legitimacy or the flip side, New York Times loses legitimacy to be at the same level of,
*  in terms of how we talk about it. It's going to long, it's a long battle, right? It's going to
*  take a long time. And I'm saying, this is where I think the end state is going. And look at what
*  the times is doing. They're leaning into podcasting for a reason, but not just podcasting, as in NPR,
*  level, like here's what's happening. Michael Barbaro is a fucking celebrity, right? The guy
*  who does the daily, that guy's famous amongst these people because they're like, oh my God,
*  I love Michael. Like, I love the way he does this stuff. Again, that's fine. More people are
*  listening to the news. I think that's a good thing. And then who else do they hire? Ezra Klein from
*  Vox, Kara Swisher also from Vox who does pivot, which is an amazing podcast or Jane Coaston. Same
*  thing. It's personalities who are becoming bundled together within this brand, right?
*  Here's, okay. Maybe I'm just a hater
*  because I loved podcasting from the beginning. I loved Green Day before the Recruitment,
*  but I am bothered by it. Like why doesn't Kara Swisher, she's done successfully. I think, oh no,
*  she was always a part of some kind of institution. I'm not sure, but she started her own thing. I
*  think. It would, anyway. Right. Yeah. The Recruit. I don't know if that's her own thing. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So she was very successful there. Why the hell did she join the New York Times with the new podcast?
*  Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing? Because he gets paid and because he has,
*  he wants the elite cache that you just referenced within his social circle in New York,
*  which is that I think the biggest mistake that some of the venture people make is if we give
*  everybody the tools that those people are all going to leave to like go sub stack and go
*  independent within their social circle, sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it
*  to be a part of the New York Times. That's sad to me because it propagates old thinking, like,
*  you know, it propagates old institutions and you could say that New York Times is going to evolve
*  quickly and so on, but I would love it if there was a mechanism for reestablishing, like for building
*  new New York Times in terms of public legitimacy. And I suppose that's wishful thinking because
*  it takes time to build trust in institutions and it takes time to build new institutions.
*  My main thing I would say is public legitimacy as a concept is not going to be there in mass media
*  anymore because of the balkanization of audiences. I mean, think about it, right? Like, this is like
*  Legion, you know, the classic stuff around a thousand true fans or no, sorry, like a hundred
*  true fans even now. Like you can make a living on the internet just talking to a hundred people.
*  Yeah. As long as they're all high frequency traders, some of the highest paid people on sub stack,
*  they don't have that many subs. It's just that they're Wall Street guys, right? So people pay
*  a lot of money. Again, that's great. So what you will have is an increasing balkanization of the
*  internet, of audiences, and of niches. People will become increasingly famous within us. You will
*  become astoundingly famous. I'm sure you've noticed this for your fan base. I certainly have with mine
*  99% of people have no idea who I am, but when somebody meets, they're like, oh my God, I watch
*  your show every day. Right? Like it's the only thing I watch for news, right? Like instead of
*  casually famous, if that makes sense, be like, oh yeah, that's like Alec Baldwin. You know? Yeah.
*  Oh shit. That's Alec Baldwin. But you're not like, oh shit, I love you Alec Baldwin. It's, this is a
*  Ben Smith of the New York Times actually wrote this column. He's like, the future is everybody will be
*  famous, but only to a small group of people. And I think that is true. But again, I don't decry it.
*  I think it's great because I think that the more that that happens, the more engaged people will be
*  and it empowers different voices to be able to come in. And then possibly I wouldn't say destroy,
*  but compete against, I mean, look at Joe. Joe is more powerful than CNN and MSNBC and Fox all put
*  together. That gives me like immense inspiration. Like he created the space for me to succeed. And
*  I told him that when I met him, I was like, dude, like I listened to his podcast when I was like,
*  young and like, and I remember like when I got to meet him and all that, and I told him this on this
*  pod, I was like, I didn't know people were millions were willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps
*  for three straight hours, including me. I didn't know whether I could be one of those people.
*  Yeah, me too. I learned something about myself for show. Yeah. And so by creating that space,
*  I'd be like, wait, there's a hunger here. Like he showed us all the way. And none of us will ever
*  again be as famous as Rogan because he was the first. And that's fine because he created the
*  umbrella ecosystem for us all to thrive. That is where I see like a great amount of hope
*  within that story. And the cool thing, he also supports that ecosystem. He's such a so, so
*  generous. One of the things he paved the way on for me is to show that you can just be honest,
*  publicly honest, and not jealous of other people's success, but instead of be supportive and
*  all those kinds of things, just like loving towards others. He's been an inspiration. I mean,
*  to the comics community, I think there are a bunch of, before that, I think there were all a bunch of
*  competitive haters towards each other. Yeah. And now he's like, just injected love. Yeah.
*  They're like, there's still like, many are still resistant, but they're like, they can't help it
*  because he's such a huge voice. He like forces them to be like loving towards each other. And the same,
*  I try to, one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast was to try to, I wanted to be like,
*  do what Joe Rogan did, but for the scientific community, like my little circle of scientific
*  community of like, like, let's support each other. Yeah. Well, like Avi Loeb, I would have no idea
*  who he was if it wasn't for you. I mean, I assume you put him in touch with Joe. He went on Joe's
*  show. I had him on my show. Like millions of people would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for
*  you. Just by the way, in terms of deep state shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with aliens. You
*  better believe Joe. Dude, the last thing I sent to him was the American airlines audio. Did you see
*  that? The pilots who were, oh my God, dude, this is amazing. So like,
*  this American airlines flight crew was over New Mexico, the seven, five or six days ago.
*  And they, the guy comes and he goes, Hey, do you have any targets up here? A large cylindrical
*  object just flew over me. So this happens. So this happens. Yes. Then a guy, like a radio catcher
*  records this and posts it online. American airlines confirms that this is authentic audio.
*  And they go all further questions should be referred to the FBI. So then, okay, American
*  airlines just confirmed this is a legitimate transmission. FBI, then the FAA comes out and
*  says, we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane at the time of the transmission.
*  So the only plausible explanation that online sleuths have been able to say is maybe he saw
*  a Learjet, which was, you know, using like open source data FAA rules that out. So what was it?
*  He saw a large cylindrical object while he was mid flight American airlines, but you can go online,
*  listen to the audio yourself. This is a hundred percent no shit transmission confirmed by American
*  airlines of a commercial pilot over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote, large cylindrical object
*  in the air. Like I said, when we first started talking, I've never believed in, I've never
*  believed more in UFOs and aliens. Yeah, this is awesome. Yeah. I just wish both American airlines,
*  FBI and government would be more transparent. Like there'll be voices. I know it sounds
*  ridiculous, but the kind of transparency that you see, maybe not Joe Rogan. He's like overly
*  transparent. He's just a comic really, but just a, I don't know, like a podcast from the FBI,
*  just like being honest, like excited, confused. I'm sure that they're being overly cautious about
*  the release information. I'm sure there's a lot of information that would inspire the public,
*  that it would inspire trust in institutions that will not damage national security. Like it seems
*  to me obvious. And the reason they're not sharing it is because of this momentum of bureaucracy of
*  caution and so on. But there's probably so much cool information that the government has. The way
*  I almost, I wouldn't say it confirmed it's real, but Trump didn't, didn't declassify it. Like,
*  you know that if there was ever a president that actually wanted to get to the bottom of it, it was
*  him. I mean, he didn't declassify it, man. And people begged him to, I know for a fact,
*  cause I pushed to try and make this happen, that some people did speak to him about it. And he was
*  like, no, I'm not going to do it. So he might be afraid. That's what I mean though. He's a,
*  they were probably all telling him though, like, sir, you can't do this, you know, all this like
*  Bob. And I get that. And there's this legislation written as COVID that like they have six months
*  to release it. Is that real? What does that have to do with a bunch of bullshit? I think it's bull.
*  There's so many different levels of classification that people need to understand. I mean, look,
*  I read John Podesta. He was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton. He's a big UFO guy. He, he tried
*  like him and Clinton tried to get some of this information and they could not get any of it.
*  And they were talking about the president and the white house chief of staff.
*  Well, there's a whole bureaucracy built, just like you're saying with intent, you have to be like,
*  that has to be your focus because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy for probably,
*  for a good reason. So to get through to the information, there's a whole like paperwork
*  process, all that kind of stuff. You can't just walk in and get the, unless again, with intention,
*  that becomes your thing. Like let's revolutionize this thing. And then you get only so many things.
*  It's, it's sad that the, the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky. But I think the hopeful messages from
*  earlier in our conversation, it seems like a single person can't fix it. But if you hire the right team,
*  it feels like you can, can't fix everything. I don't want to, I don't want to give people
*  unrealistic expectations. You can fix a lot, especially in crisis. You can remake America.
*  Yeah. And the reason I know that is because it's already happened twice FDR or in modern history,
*  FDR and JFK, sorry, FDR and JFK's assassination, LBJ to hyper competent men who understood
*  government, who understood personnel and coincidentally were friends. I love this.
*  I don't think actually people understand this FDR met Johnson three days after he won this
*  Congress, his election to Congress, special election. He was only 29 years old. And he left
*  that meeting and called somebody and said, this young man is going to be president of the United
*  States someday. Like even then, like what was within him to understand and to recognize that.
*  And sometimes Johnson is a young member of Congress would come and have breakfast with FDR,
*  like just to the great political minds of the 20th century, just sitting there talking,
*  like I would give anything to know what that was happening. I hope they were real with each other.
*  And there was like a genuine human connection, right? That, that seems to be Johnson wasn't a
*  genuine guy. Well, I need to read those thousands of pages. I've been way too focused on Hitler.
*  I was going to say one of my goals in coming to this is like, I got to get Lex into two things
*  because I knew he'll love it. I know he'll love LBJ. If he says it takes the time to read the
*  really 100% he's the most of all the presidents. I didn't say you'll love him, but you'll love the
*  books about him because the books are a story of America, the story of politics, the story of power.
*  This is the guy who wrote the power broker. These books are up there with decline and fall of the
*  Roman empire by Edward Gibbon in terms of how power works. Study of power. Exactly. That's no,
*  that's why Carol wrote the books. And that's why the books are not really about LBJ. They're about
*  power in Washington and about the consolidation of power post new deal, the consolidation then
*  where they using the levers of power like Johnson knew in order to change the house of representatives,
*  the Senate of the United States, and ultimately the presidency of the United States, which ended
*  in failure and disaster with Vietnam. Don't get me wrong, but he's overlooked for so many of the
*  incredible things that he did with civil rights. Nobody else could have done it. No, no one else
*  could have gotten it done. And the second thing is we got to get you into world war one.
*  We got to get you more into world war one because I think that's a rabbit hole, which I know you're
*  Dan Carlin fan. So blueprint for Armageddon guaranteed, but there's fewer evil people there.
*  Yes. But, well, but that's what actually there's a banality of that evil of the Kaiser and of
*  the Austro-Hungarians and of, see, I like world war one more because it was unresolved. It's one
*  of those periods I was talking to you about, about like sometimes you're called and you fail. Like
*  that's what happened. I mean, 50 million people were killed in the most horrific way. Like people
*  literally drowned in the mud, like, like an entire generation. One stat I love is that, you know,
*  Britain didn't need a draft till 1916. Like they went two years of throwing people into barbed wire
*  voluntarily. And because people love their country and they love the king and they thought they were
*  going against the Kaiser. It's just like that conflict to me, I just can't read enough about it.
*  Also just like births, Russian revolution, you know, yeah, I mean, Hitler, you can't talk about
*  world war two without world war one. Right. Right. And I'm obsessed with the conflict. I've read way
*  too many books about it for this reason is it's unresolved. And like the roots of so much of even
*  our current problems are happened in Versailles, right? Like Vietnam is because of the Treaty of
*  Versailles. Many ways, the Middle Eastern problems and the division of the states there, the Treaty
*  of Versailles in terms of the penalties against Germany, but also the fallout from those wars on
*  the French and the German population or the French and the British populations and their reluctance
*  for war in 1939 or 1938 when Neville Chamberlain goes, right? Like that's one of the things people
*  don't understand is the actual appetite of the British public at that time. They didn't want to
*  go to war only Churchill. He was the only one in the, you know, in the gathering storm, right? Like
*  being like, Hey, this is really bad and all of that. And then even in the United States, our streak of
*  isolationism, which swept, I mean, things were because of that conflict, we were convinced as a
*  country that we wanted nothing to do with Europe and its problems. And in many ways that contributed
*  to the proliferation of Hitler and more. So like, I'm obsessed with World War I for this reason,
*  which is that it's just like the root. Oh, it's like the culmination of the monarchies, then the
*  fall, and then just all the shit spills out from there for like a hundred years. So World War I is
*  like the most important shift in human history versus World War II is like a consequence of that.
*  Yeah, it's so I have a degree in security studies from Georgetown. And one of the things is that we
*  would focus a lot on that is like war and but also like the complexity around war. And it's funny,
*  we never spent that much time on World War II, because there's actually quite a clean war. It's
*  a very atypical war. As in the war object, which we learned from World War One is we must inflict
*  suffering on the German people and invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler,
*  like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime and Hitler. So it had a very basic begin and end
*  began liberate France, invade Germany, destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild World War One.
*  What are you fighting for? Like, are you I mean, nobody even knew you can go the German general
*  staff. They're like, even in 1917, they're like, the war was worth it, because now we have
*  Luxembourg. I'm like, really, like, you killed 2 million of your citizens for fucking Luxembourg,
*  and like half of Belgium, which is now like a pond. And same thing. The French are like, well,
*  the French more so they're defending their borders. But like, what are the British fighting for? Why
*  did hundreds of thousands of British people die in order to preserve the balance of power in Europe
*  and prevent the Kaiser from having a port on the English Channel? Like, really, that's why
*  that's more what wars are, as they become these like, atypical set, they become these protracted
*  conflicts with a necessary diplomatic resolution. It's not clean. It's very dirty. It usually leads
*  in the outbreak of another war and another war and another war and a slow burn of ethnic conflict,
*  which bubbles up. So that's why I look at that one, even because it's more typical of warfare.
*  Yeah, how it works.
*  Exactly. It's kind of interesting. You're making me realize that World War II is one of the rare
*  wars where you can make a strong case for it's a fight of good versus evil.
*  Just war theory, obviously, like, they're literally slaughtering Jews. Like, you know,
*  we have to kill them.
*  And there's one person doing it. I mean, there's one person at the core. There's, it's, yeah,
*  that's fascinating. And it's short and there's a clear aggression.
*  And it's interesting that Dan Carlin has been avoiding Hitler as well.
*  Yeah. Probably for this reason.
*  Probably for this reason. I mean, but it's complicated too, because there's a pressure
*  that guy has his demons. I love Dan so much. This is the, I don't know if you feel this pressure,
*  but as a creative, he feels the pressure of being maybe not necessarily correct.
*  But maybe correct in the sense that his understanding, he gets to the bottom of
*  why something happened, of what really happened. Get to the bottom of it before he can say
*  something publicly about it. And he is tortured by that burden.
*  I know. You know, he takes so much shit from the historical community for no reason. I think he's
*  the greatest popularizer, quote unquote, of history. And I wish more people in history
*  understood it that way. He was an inspiration to me. I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my
*  Instagram now where I'll do like a book tour. I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents.
*  And like, here's what I learned from this book and this book and this. And that was very much like a
*  skill I learned from him of being like, as you know, as the historian writes, you know, I just
*  love the way he talks. He's like in the mud. I mean, you know, he'll be like, quote,
*  he inspires me, man. He really does to like learn more. And I've read, I bought a lot of books
*  because of Dan Carlin. He'll be, you know, because of this guy, because of that guy in terms of,
*  you know, another thing he does, which nobody else, and I'm probably guilty of this,
*  he focuses on the actual people involved. Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers
*  in world war one. And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too. We over-focus on
*  what was happening in the German general staff, what was happening in the British general staff.
*  And he doesn't make that mistake. That's why he tells real history.
*  Yeah. And, and maybe it gives it a feeling. The result is that there's a feeling you get the
*  feeling of what it was like to be there. Exactly. You know, you're becoming quickly becoming more
*  and more popular, speaking about political issues in part. Do you feel a burden, like almost like
*  the prison of your prior convictions of having to being popular with a certain kind of audience
*  and thereby unable to really think outside the box?
*  I had, I've really struggled with this. I came up in right-wing media. I came up a much more
*  doctrinaire conservative in my professional life. I wasn't always conservative. We can get to that
*  later if you want. And I did feel an immense pressure after Jan, after the election by people
*  to say, wanted me to say the election was stolen. And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience,
*  but well, here's the benefit. Most people know me from rising, which is with crystal and me,
*  that is inherently a left right program. So it's a large audience. So I felt comfortable. And I knew
*  that I could still be fine in terms of my numbers, whatever, because a lot, many people knew me who
*  were on the left. And if you know, my right listeners abandoned me, so be it. I was had the
*  luxury of able to take that choice, but I still felt an immense amount of pressure to say the
*  election was stolen, to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing, to downplay January
*  6th, to downplay many of the Republican senators or justify many of the Republican senators, some of
*  whom I know who objected to the electoral college certification and who stoked some of the flames
*  that have eaten the Republican base. And I just wouldn't do it. And that was hard, man. Like,
*  I feel more politically homeless right now than I ever have. But I have realized
*  in the last couple of months, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
*  It's freedom.
*  It's true freedom. I now say I say exactly what I think. And it's not that I wasn't doing that
*  before. It's maybe I would avoid certain topics or like, I would think about things more from a
*  team perspective of like, am I making sure that it's it's I'm not saying I didn't fight it. And I
*  still I criticize the right plenty and Trump plenty before the election and more. It's more
*  just like, I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion of a stake within the game. I'm like,
*  I only look at myself as an outside observer, and I will only call it as I see it, truly. And I was
*  aspiring to that before. But I had to have in a way, Trump stopped the steel thing, it like took
*  my shackles off 100%. Because I was like, No, this is bullshit. And I'm gonna say it's bullshit.
*  And I think it's bad. And I think it's bad for the Republican Party. And if people in the Republican
*  Party don't agree with me on that, that's fine. I'm just not going to be necessarily like associated
*  with you anymore. This is probably one of the first political, liberal politics related conversations
*  we've had. I mean, unless you count Michael Malice, who he was great. He's the funny guy is he's not
*  so much political as he is like, burning down, man. He leans too far in anarchy for me. Yeah,
*  I think he's a place for that. It's almost, oh, first of all, he's, he's working on a new book,
*  which I really appreciate outside of the he's working on like a big book for a while, which is
*  White Pill. He's also working on this like short little thing, which is like anarchist handbook or
*  something like that. Yeah. It's like anarchy for idiots or something like that. Which I think is
*  really, yeah. Well, me being an idiot and being curious about anarchy seems useful. So I like
*  those kinds of books. That's Russian heritage, man. Yeah. Anarchist 101. Yeah. I, I find those
*  kinds of things useful thought experiment because that's why I didn't, it's frustrating to me when
*  people talk about communism, socialism, or even capitalism, where they can't enjoy the thought
*  experiment of like, why did communism fail? And maybe ask the question of like, are there,
*  is it possible to make communism succeed? Or are there good ideas in communism? Like I enjoy the
*  thought experiment, like the discourse of it, like the reasoning and like devil's advocate and all
*  that people have like, seem to not have patience for that. They're like communism, bad, red.
*  I was obsessed with the question and still am. I will never be, I will never quench my thirst
*  for Russian history. I love that period of 1890 to 1925. It's just like, it's so fucking crazy,
*  like the autocracy embodied in czar Alexander. And then you get this like weird fail son,
*  Nicholas, who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible. And also Russian autocracy itself is
*  terrible. And then I just became obsessed with the question of like, why did the Bolshevik revolution
*  succeed? Because like people in Russia didn't necessarily want Bolshevism. People suffered a
*  lot under Bolshevism and it led to Stalinism. How did Vladimir Lenin do it? Right? Like, and I became
*  obsessed with that question. And it's still, I find it so interesting, which is that series of
*  accidents of history, incredible boldness by Lenin, incredible real politic, smart, unpopular
*  decisions made by Trotsky and Stalin. And just like the arrogance of the czars and of the Russian
*  like autocracy and just, but at the same time, there's all these like cultural implications of
*  this, right? In terms of like how it became hollowed out post Catherine the great and all that.
*  I was obsessed with our talk because Russia was an actual autocracy and like actually, and I'm like,
*  it was there, like they didn't even remove serfdom to like the civil war in America. Like that's
*  crazy. Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it. And I just became, yeah, I was like,
*  was Bolshevism a natural reaction to the excesses of czarism? There is a convenient explanation
*  where that is true, but there were also a series of decisions made by Lenin and Stalin to kill many
*  of the people in the center left and marginalize them to, and also not to associate with the more
*  quote unquote, like amenable communists in order to make sure that their pure strain of Bolshevism
*  was the only thing. And the reason I like that is because it comes back to a point I made earlier.
*  It's all about intentionality, which is that you actually can will something into existence.
*  Yes. Even if people don't want it. That was the craziest thing. Like nobody wanted this,
*  but it's still ruled for half a century or more actually. I mean, almost, you know,
*  that's seven years to think that there could have been a history of the Soviet union that was
*  dramatically different than Leninism, Stalinism that was completely different. Like almost
*  would be the American story. Yeah, it was easily. I mean, there's a world where, and I don't have
*  all the characters, there's like Kerensky, and then there was like, whoever Lenin's number two,
*  Stalin's chief rival, and even, I mean, look, even a Soviet union led by Trotsky, that's a whole other
*  world, right? Like literally a whole other world. And yeah, it's just, I don't know, I find it so
*  interesting. I will never not be fascinated by Russia. I always will. It's funny that I get to
*  talk to you because it's like, I read this book, I forget what it's called. It won, I think it won
*  a Pulitzer Prize. And it was like the story of, I tried to understand Russia post-Crimea, because I
*  came up amongst people who are much more like neo-conservative and they're like, fuck Russia,
*  Russia, bad, but I was like, okay, like what do these people think? And we have this narrative of
*  like the fall of the Soviet Union. And then I read this book from the perspective of Russians
*  who lived through the fall. And they were like, this, I was like, this is terrible. Like actually
*  the introduction of capitalism was awful. And like the rise of all these crazy oligarchs,
*  that's why Putin was, came to power to like restore, restore order to the oligarchy.
*  And he still talks to this day. Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like, do you want
*  to return to the nineties? Right. Do you want to return to Yeltsin? Yeah. And like, but the thing
*  is in the West, we have this like our own propaganda of like, no, Yeltsin was great. That was the golden
*  age. What could have been with Russia? And I was like, well, what do actual Russians think? And so
*  that, yeah, I'll always be fascinated by it. And then just like to understand the idea of feeling
*  encircled by NATO and all of that, you have to understand like Russian defense theory all the way
*  going back to the czars has always been defense in depth in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania,
*  and more is like protection of the heartland. I'm not justifying in this. So NATO shills,
*  like, please don't come after me. But look, Estonian, Estonians like NATO. They want to be
*  in NATO. So I don't want to minimize that. I'm more just saying like, I understand him and Russia
*  much better having done that. And we are very incapable in America. I think this is probably
*  because my parents are immigrants. I've traveled a lot of Jack, putting yourself in the mind of
*  people who aren't Western and haven't lived a history, especially our lives of America's
*  fucking awesome. We're the number one country in the world. Like, we're literally better than you
*  like in many ways. And they, they can't empathize with people who have suffered so much. And I just,
*  yeah, it's just so interesting to me. What about if we could talk for just a brief moment about
*  the human of Putin and power, you are clearly fascinated by power. Do you think power changed
*  Putin? Do you think power changes leaders? If you look at the great leaders in history,
*  whether it's LBJ, FDR, do you think power really changes people? Like, is there a truth to that
*  kind of old proverb? It reveals, I think that's what it is. It reveals. So Putin was a much more
*  deft politician, much more amenable to the West. If you think back to 2001 and more, right, when
*  he came, because he was still, because at that time his biggest problem was intra-Russian politics,
*  right? Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy. Once he did that by around like
*  2007, there's that famous time when he spoke out against the West at the Munich security conference.
*  I forget when it was. And that's when everybody in the audience was like, whoa. And he was talking
*  about like NATO encirclement and like, we will not be beaten back by the West. Very shortly afterwards,
*  like the Georgia invasion happens. And that was like a big wake up call of like, we will not be
*  pushed around anymore. I mean, he said before publicly, like the worst thing that ever happened
*  was the fall. Or what did he say? It was like the fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy, right?
*  Yeah. Of course, people in the West were like, what? I'm like, I get it. Like they were a super
*  power. Now their population is declining. Like it's like a petro state. It sucks. Like I understand.
*  I understand like how somebody could feel about that. I think it revealed his character,
*  which is that he, I think he thinks of himself probably as he always has since 2001, as like
*  this benevolent, almost as a benevolent dictator. He's like, without me, the whole system would
*  collapse. I'm the only guy's keeping these people in. I'm the only guy keeping all these people in
*  check. Most Russians probably do support Putin because they feel like they support some form of
*  functional government. And they view it as like a check against that, which is a long, you know,
*  has a long history within Russia too. So I don't know if it changed him. I think it just revealed
*  him because it's not like he, I mean, he has a bill, you know, Navalny has put that like
*  billion dollar palace and all that. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show.
*  He doesn't seem like somebody who indulges in all that stuff, or maybe we just don't see it.
*  Like, I don't know. Well, I don't. Yeah. I, it's very difficult for me to understand. I've been
*  hanging out. Thanks to clubhouse. A lot of, I've gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks and
*  it's been very educational. Made me ask a lot of important questions about what, um, you know,
*  question a lot of my assumptions about what I do and don't know. But I'll just say that I do believe,
*  you know, there's a lot of the Navalny folks say that Putin is incompetent and is a, is a bad,
*  uh, executive, like is bad at basically running government. But to me,
*  well, why do Russians not think that, right? Is it, well, they, they probably say
*  propaganda. Yeah, they would say the control there. There is a strong either control or pressure on
*  the press, but I think there is a legitimate support and love of Putin in Russia that is not
*  grounded in just misinformation and propaganda. There's, there's legitimacy there. Mostly I tried
*  to remain apolitical and actually genuinely remain apolitical. I am legitimately not interested
*  in the politics of Russia of today. I feel I have some responsibility and I'll take it
*  that responsibility on as I need to. But my fascination as it is perhaps with you in part
*  is in the historical figure of Putin. I know he's currently president, but I'm almost looking like
*  as if I was a kid in 30 years from now reading about him, studying the, the human being,
*  the, the games of power that are played that got him to gain power, to maintain power,
*  what that says about his human nature, the, the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him,
*  the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things, as opposed to the politics
*  and the manipulation and the corruption and the control of the media that results in misinformation.
*  Misinformation. You know, those are, those are the bickering of the day, just like we're saying,
*  what will actually be remembered about this moment in history? Totally. He's a transformational
*  figure in Russian history, really like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union and the chaos
*  of Yeltsin. That will be how he's remembered. The only question is what comes next and what he wants
*  to come next. That's I'm always fat. I'm like, he's getting up. How old are you? 60 something?
*  Yeah, 60. So he would be, I think he would be 80. So with a, with a change of the constitution,
*  he cannot be president until, uh, six, uh, 2034, I think it is. So he would be like 80 something
*  and he would be in power for over 30 years, which is longer than Stalin.
*  So, but he's still, he still seems to be, he seems fit. I think he's going to be around for
*  a long time. But this is a fascinating question that you ask, which is like, what does he want?
*  I don't know. Yeah, that's the question. I don't, I, and this is where I think given all of his
*  behavior and more, I don't know if it's about money. I don't know if it's about enriching
*  himself. Obviously he did to the tune of billions and billions and billions of dollars, but I think
*  he probably, he says close to like an actual Russian nationalist, like at the top who really
*  does believe in Russia as its rightful superpower. Everything he does seems to stem from that
*  opposition to NATO intro to Syria, like wanting to play a large role in affairs, deeply distrustful,
*  and yet coveting of the European powers. Like, look, I could describe every czar, you know,
*  in those same language, like every czar falls into the exact same category.
*  Yeah. And I mean, it makes me wonder what looking at some of the biggest leaders in human
*  history to ask the question of what was the motivation? What was the motivation for even
*  just the revolutionaries like Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin? What was the motivation? Because it sure
*  as hell seems like the motivation was at least in part the driven by the idea, by ideas, not self
*  interest of like power. For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer and an actual narcissist
*  who thought he was the only one who could do it. Stalin, I do think just wanted power and realized,
*  well, I don't know. Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.
*  He really believed in communism.
*  In the beginning he did. I'm always fascinated as I'm like around 1920, what happened, right?
*  Post-revolution, you crush the whites. Now it's all about consolidation. That's where the games
*  really began. And I'm like, I don't think that was about communism.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it became a useful propaganda tool, but it still seemed like he
*  believed in it. Whether it was, of course this is the question. I mean, this is a problem with
*  conspiracy theories for me. And this is legitimate criticism towards me about conspiracy theories,
*  which is, you know, just because you're not like this doesn't mean others are like this. So like,
*  I can't believe that somebody be like deeply two-faced.
*  Oh, I've met them. You're welcome to Washington.
*  But like, I think that I would be able to detect.
*  Like, no. Well, this, my question is, well, so there's differences, this two-face, like,
*  there's different levels of two-face. Like what I mean is to be killing people. And it's like
*  house of cards style, right? And, and still present a front like you're, like you're not
*  killing people. I don't know if it's, I guess it's possible, but I just don't see that at scale.
*  Like there's a lot of people like that and I don't, I have trouble imagining
*  some, you know, that's such a compelling narrative that people like to say, like people,
*  but that's the conspiratorial mindset. I think that skepticism is really powerful and important
*  to have because it's true. A lot of powerful people abuse their power, but saying that about,
*  I feel like people over assume that it's like, I see that with a use of steroids often in sports,
*  people seem to make that claim about like everybody who's successful. And I want to be very,
*  I don't know, something about me wants to be cautious because
*  I want to give people a chance. Being purely cynical isn't helpful. People say this about me.
*  He's always saying this to do this. Yeah. But at the same time, being naively optimistic about
*  everything is also kind of pedantic, just keep people are going to fuck you over. And more
*  importantly, that doesn't bother me. More importantly, you're not going to be able to reason about
*  how to create systems. They're going to be robust to corruption, to malevolent, like parties. So
*  in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance of both, I suppose,
*  especially if you want to actually engineer things that work in this world that has evil in it.
*  I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on the desk. We've mentioned a lot of books throughout
*  this conversation. I wonder, and this makes me really curious to explore in a lot of depth,
*  the kind of books that you're interested in. I think you mentioned in your show
*  that you provide recommendations. Yes, I do.
*  In the form of spoken word, can you be on what we've already recommended, mention books,
*  whether it is historical, nonfiction, or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction that
*  had a big impact on your life? Is there a few that you can mention? Sure. I already talked about the
*  Johnson book, so I'll leave that alone. Robert A. Caro, he's still alive, thank God. He's finishing
*  the last book. I hope he makes it. So those Johnson books. Second- Can I ask you a question
*  about those books? Yes. What the hell do you fit into so many pages? Everything, man.
*  Let me tell you this. I'll just give you an anecdote. This is why I love these books.
*  The beginning, the first book, is about Lyndon Johnson. His life to when he gets elected to
*  Congress. The book begins with a history of Texas and its weather patterns and then of his great,
*  great-grandfather moving to Texas. Then the story of that, about 100 or so pages in,
*  you get to Lyndon Johnson. That's how you do it. It's like a Tolstoy-style retelling.
*  This is the thing. It's not a biography. It's a story of the times. That's a great biography.
*  So another one- This isn't part of my list, so don't do it. It's Grant Ron Chernow. Ron
*  Chernow's Grant. It's a thousand pages. The reason I tell everybody to read it is it's not just the
*  story of Grant. It is the story of pre-Civil War America, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War,
*  and Reconstruction, all told in the life of one person who was involved in all three. Most people
*  don't know anything about the Mexican-American War. It's fascinating. Most people don't know
*  anything about Reconstruction. Now more so because people are talking- It's a hot topic now.
*  I've been reading about it for years. That is another thing people need to learn a lot more
*  about. In terms of non-history books, the book that probably had the most impact on me, which is also
*  a historical nonfiction, is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration. It all began with a book
*  called Shackleton's Incredible Journey, which is the collection of diaries of everybody who was on
*  Shackleton's Journey. For those who don't know, Shackleton was the last explorer of the heroic
*  age of Antarctic exploration. He led a ship called the Endurance, which froze in the ice off the coast
*  of Antarctica in 1914. They didn't have radios over the last exploration, the last one without
*  the age of radio. He happens to freeze in the ice. Then the ship collapses after a year frozen in the
*  ice. This man leads his entire crew from that ship onto the ice with a team of dogs, survives out on
*  the ice for another year with three little lifeboats and is able to get all of his men,
*  every single one of them alive, to an island hundreds of miles away called Elephant Island.
*  When they got there, he had to leave everybody behind except for six people. Him and two other
*  guys, I'm forgetting their names, navigated by the stars 800 miles through the Drake Passage with
*  seas of hundreds of feet to Prince, I think it's called Prince George's Island. Then when they got
*  to Prince George's Island, they landed on the wrong side and they had to hike from one side
*  to the other to go and meet the whalers. Every single one of those things was supposed to be
*  impossible. Nobody was ever supposed to hike that island. It wasn't done again until the 1980s
*  with professional equipment. He did it after two years of starvation. Nobody was ever supposed to
*  make it from Elephant Island to Prince George's Island. The guy, they had to hold him steady,
*  his legs, so that he could chart the stars. If they miss this island, they're into open sea.
*  They're dead. Then before that, how do you survive for a year on the ice, on seals? Before that,
*  he kept his crew from depression, frozen one year in the ice. It's just an amazing story.
*  It made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration, so I've read like 15 books on it.
*  What the hell is it about the human spirit?
*  It's amazing. That's the thing about Antarctica is it brings it out of you. For example,
*  I read another one recently called Mawson's Will. Douglas Mawson, he was an Australian.
*  He was on one of the first Robert Frost expeditions. He leads an expedition down to
*  the south. Him and a partner, they're leading explorations, 1908, something like that.
*  They're going around Antarctica with dog teams. What happens is they keep going over these snow
*  bridges where there's a crevice, but it's covered in snow. One of the lead driver, the dogs go over
*  and they plummet. That sled takes with it. The guy survives, but that sled takes all their food,
*  half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent, the tent specifically designed for the snow,
*  everything. They're hundreds of miles away from base camp. He and this guy have to make it back
*  there in time before the ship comes to come get them on an agreed upon date. He makes it,
*  but the guy he was with, he dies. It's a crazy story. First of all, they have to eat the dogs.
*  A really creepy part of Antarctic exploration is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points.
*  Part of the theory, which is so crazy, is that the guy he was with was dying because they were
*  eating dog liver. Dog liver has a lot of vitamin E, which if you eat too much of it, can give you
*  a poisoning. Mawson, by trying to help his friend, was giving him more liver.
*  Of all the things that kills you.
*  I know, his dog liver. His friend ends up dying, have a horrific heart attack, all of that. Mawson
*  crawls back hundreds of miles away, makes it back to base camp hours after the ship leaves.
*  Two guys or a couple of guys stayed behind for him, and he basically has to recuperate for
*  six months before he can even walk again. But it's like you were saying about the human spirit.
*  It's like Antarctica brings that out of people. Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,
*  Robert Amundsen, oh my God, this guy trained his whole life in the ice from Norway
*  to make it to the South Pole. And he beat Robert Frost, the British guy with all this money
*  and all these ... I could go on this forever. I'm obsessed with it.
*  Well, first of all, I'm going to take this part of the podcast. I'm going to set it to music.
*  I'm going to listen to it because I've been whining and bitching about running 48 miles
*  with Goggins this next weekend. And this is going to be so easy. I'm just going to listen
*  to this over and over in my head. You're going to be ...
*  Elon's obsessed with Shackleton. He talks about him all the time.
*  He uses ... I was going to ask you about the use as an example of ... that is an example of what
*  Mars colonization would be like. He's right. No, Antarctica is as close to ... you can simulate
*  that. Antarctica is as close to what you could simulate what it would get. That Nat Geo series
*  on Mars, I'm not sure if you watched it. It's incredible. Elon's actually in it.
*  And it's like they get there, everything goes wrong, somebody dies, it's horrible,
*  they can't find any water, it's not working. So what is it? Is it like simulating the
*  experience of what it would be like to colonize? Yeah. So it's like a docu-series where the
*  fictionalized part is the astronauts on Mars, but then they're interviewing people like Elon
*  Musk and others who are the ones who paved the way to get to Mars. So it's a really interesting
*  concept. I think it's on Netflix. And yeah, I agree with him 100%, which is that the first guys to
*  make ... for example, Robert Frost who went to Australia ... sorry, to Antarctica, the British
*  explorer who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks by Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back.
*  And the reason why is because he wasn't well prepared, he was arrogant, he didn't have the
*  proper amounts of supplies, his team had terrible morale. Antarctica is a brutal place. If you fuck
*  up one time, you die. And this is what you read a lot about, which is the reason why such heroic
*  characters like Shackleton Shine is a lot of people died. There were some people who got frozen in the
*  eye. I mean, man, this again also came to the North exploration. So I read a lot about the
*  exploration of the North Pole. And same thing, these un-extraordinary men take people out into
*  the ice and get frozen out there for years and shit goes so bad. They end up eating each other,
*  they all die. There's the famous ... I'm forgetting his name, the British Franklin Expedition,
*  where they went searching for them for like 20 years. And they eventually came across a group
*  of Inuit who were like, oh yeah, we saw some weird white men here like 15 years ago. And they find
*  their bones and there's like saw marks which show that they were eating each other. So history
*  remembers the ones who didn't eat each other. Yeah. Well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it,
*  but there are- And that would be the story of Mars as well. That will be the story of Mars.
*  But nevertheless, that's the interesting thing about Antarctica. Nevertheless, something about
*  human nature drives us to explore it. And that seems to be like, a lot of people have this kind
*  of, to me, frustrating conversations like, well, Earth is great, man. Why do we need to colonize
*  Mars? You just don't get it. I don't know. It's the same people that say like, why are you running
*  a marathon? What are you running from, man? I don't know. It's pushing the limits of the
*  of the human mind of the, of what's possible. It's George Mallory because it's there.
*  Yeah. Simple. And that somehow actually the result of that, if you want to be pragmatic about it,
*  there's something about pushing that limit that has side effects that you don't expect that will
*  create a better world back home for the people, not necessarily on Earth, but like just in general,
*  it raises the quality of life for everybody. Even though the initial endeavor doesn't make
*  any sense, the very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible then has side effects of
*  benefiting everybody. And it's difficult to predict ahead of time or what those benefits will be.
*  Say with colonizing Mars, it's unclear what the benefits will be for Earth or in general.
*  Struggling from the moon. What did we get from Apollo, right? Technically. And there were a lot
*  of socialists at the time making this argument. They're like, oh, this money going, you know what?
*  We went to the moon in 1969. That was amazing. The greatest feat in human history, period. What
*  did we learn from it? We learned and learned about interstellar or interplanetary travel.
*  We learned that we could do something off of a device less powerful than the computer in my
*  pocket. Like the amount of potential locked within my pocket and your pocket. I mean,
*  this is if you were to define my policies in one way, it's greatness, like national quest
*  for national greatness. There is no greatness without fulfilling the ultimate calling of the
*  human spirit, which is more. It's not enough. And why should it be? It wasn't enough. You know,
*  our ancestors could have been content to sit. Well, actually many of them were, were content to sit
*  and say, these berries will be here for a long time. And they got eaten and they died. And it's
*  the ones who got out and went to the next place and the next place and went across the Siberian
*  land bridge and went across more. And it just did extraordinary things. The craziest ones,
*  we are their offspring and we fail them. If we don't go into space, that's how I would put it.
*  You should run for president. I'm just pro space, man. I love space.
*  No, you're pro doing difficult things and pushing, uh, exploring the world and all of its forms.
*  I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too. That same kind of, uh, can, can I, well,
*  it can. And I hope so. I don't know if you want to stay on it, but I think that was book number one
*  or two. Yeah. All right. Um, is there, well, this one is second, this actually is a corollary to
*  that, which is sapiens. And I know that's a very normal normie answer. Um, one of the best selling,
*  but I think there's a reason for that. You've all know Harari. Okay. Okay. Look, yes. He didn't do
*  any new research. I get that. All he did was aggregate. I'm sure he's very controversial in
*  the scientific community, but guess what? He wrote a great book. It's a very easy to read
*  general explanation of the rise of human history. And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions.
*  Are we special? Are we an accident? Are we more like a parasite? Are we not? What is there a
*  destiny to all of us? I don't know. You know, if anything, it's like what I just described,
*  which is more move, move out, um, the evolution of money. Like I know he gets a lot of hate,
*  but I think that he writes it so clearly and well that for your average person to be able to read
*  that you will come away with a more clear understanding of the human race than before.
*  And I think that that's why it's worth it. I agree with you a hundred percent. I, uh, I'm ashamed to,
*  I usually don't bring up sapiens because it's like, yeah, it's like, his uncle has read it,
*  but that's a good thing. It's one of the, I think it'll be remembered as one of the great books of
*  this particular era. Yeah. Because it's, it's so clearly it's like the selfish gene with doc is,
*  I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together and puts language to it. That's
*  makes it very useful to talk about. So it is one of the great books.
*  100%. Um, another one is definitely born to run for the same reason by Christopher McDougall,
*  which is that I was going to listen to this whole podcast next week. You got to,
*  well, you should, because it, you are inheriting our most basic skill, which is running and
*  re-imagining human history, uh, or re-imagining like what we were as opposed to what we are is
*  very useful because it helps you understand how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,
*  which just drive you. And the reason I love McDougall's writing is because I love anybody
*  who writes like this, Malcolm Gladwell, um, who else? Michael Lewis, people who find characters
*  to tell a bigger story. Michael Lewis finds characters to tell us the story of the financial
*  crisis. Um, you know, Malcolm Gladwell writes, finds characters to tell us the story of learning
*  new skills and outliers and different, you know, and whatever his latest book is, uh,
*  forget what it's called. And, but McDougall tells the vignettes and a tiny story of a single person
*  in the history of running and like how it's baked into your DNA. And I think there was just something
*  very useful to that for me, for being like, I don't need to go to the gym or like, I'm not saying you
*  should still go to the gym. I'll be clear. I'm saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are,
*  you can actually tap into something that's the most basic. Um, I don't know if I'm sure you've
*  listened to the David Cho episode with Joe Rogan. Um, you know, oh, where he's the animal. Yeah.
*  With the baboon. Yeah. When he goes, and there's something to that, man. There's something to that,
*  which is like, they are living the way that we were supposed to. Yeah. Not supposed. Well,
*  I don't want to put a normative judgment on it. They're living in the way that we used to. Yeah.
*  There's something very honest somehow to, to, to our true nature. There's a guy I follow on Instagram,
*  I've come from Paul Saladino, carnivore MD. He just went over there to the Hadza, um, to live with
*  them. And I was watching his stuff. Just like, I was like, man, there's, there's something in you
*  that wants to go. Yeah. Like I'm like, I want to do that. Yeah. I wouldn't be very good at it,
*  but like, I want to. Yeah. I'm so glad that somebody that thinks deeply about politics
*  is so fascinated with exploration and with the very basic nature, like human nature, nature of
*  our existence. I love that. There's something in you and still you're stuck in DC for now, for now.
*  Speaking of which, uh, the, you are from Texas. Yes. What do you make of the future of Texas
*  politically, culturally, uh, economically? I am in part moving. Well, I'm moving to Austin grass,
*  but I'm also doing the Eric Weinstein advice, which is like, dude, you're not married. You
*  don't have kids. There's no such thing as moving. What, what, what are you moving? You're like,
*  you're like, like your three suits and some shirts and underwear. What exactly is the move in tail?
*  So I have nothing. So I'm basically, you know, it's very just remain mobile, but
*  there's a promise. There's a hope to, uh, Austin outside of, I mean, my, uh, outside of just like
*  friendships, I have no, it's a very different culture that Joe Rogan is creating. I'm mostly
*  interested in the, what the next Silicon Valley will be, what the next hub of technological
*  innovation. And there's a promise, uh, maybe a dream for Austin being that next place that
*  doesn't have the baggage of, um, some of the political things, maybe some of the sort of, um,
*  things that hold back the beauty of that makes capitalism that makes innovation so powerful,
*  which is like a meritocracy, which is excellence. Uh, diversity is exceptionally important, but not,
*  uh, it should not be the only priority. It has to be something that, uh, it coexists with a, like
*  insatiable drive towards excellence. And, uh, it seems like Texas is a nice place, like having a
*  Austin, which is like a kind of, uh, this weird, I hope it stays weird, man. I love weird people.
*  I don't know about that, but we can get it.
*  But it's, there's this, uh, hope is it remains this weird place of brilliant innovation
*  amidst the, uh, a state that's like more conservative. So like, there's a nice balance
*  of everything. What are your thoughts about the future of Texas? I think it's so fascinating to
*  me because I never thought I would want to move back, but now I'm beginning to be convinced.
*  So I'm going to say this. I am, I'm being honest and many Texas will hate me for this.
*  Texas was not a place that was kind to me, quote unquote. And this is because of my
*  own parent. Like I was raised in college station, Texas, which is a town of 50,000. It's a university
*  town. It exists only for the university. So it was a very strong, I did not get the full Texas
*  experience is purely speaking from a college station experience, but growing up first,
*  you know, first generation or I forget what it is, but I'm the first American I was born and raised
*  in college station. My parents are from India being raised in a town where the dominant culture was
*  predominantly like white evangelical Christian was hard. Like he was just difficult. And I think
*  of it there in the beginning, I would say like ages, like zero to like eight, it was like cultural
*  ignorance, as in like, they just don't know how to interact with you. And there was a level of
*  always, there was like the evangelical kind of antipathy towards like you being not Christian.
*  You know, my parents are Hindu, like that's how I was raised. And so like there was that,
*  but 9-11 was very difficult. Like 9-11 happened when I was in third or fourth grade.
*  And that changed everything, man. Like, I mean, our temple had to like print out t shirts.
*  And I'm not saying this is a sob story, to be clear. I'm still actually largely for my adult
*  life identified on the political right. So don't take this as some like, you know, race manifesto.
*  I'm just telling it like this is what happened, which is that like we had, it was just hard to be
*  proud, frankly, and to have some of the fallout from 9-11 and during Iraq. And the reason I am
*  political is because I realize in myself, I have a strong rebellious nature against systems and
*  structures of power. And the first people I ever rebelled against were all the people telling me
*  to shut up and not question the Iraq war. So the reason I am in politics is because I hated
*  George W. Bush with the passion and I hated the war. And I was so, again, my entire background
*  is largely in national security for this reason, which is I was obsessed with the idea of like,
*  how do we get people who are not going to get us into these quagmire situations in positions of
*  power? That's how I became fascinated by power in the first place was all a question of how
*  do this happen? Like, how did this catastrophe happen? I realize it's not as bad as like,
*  you know, previous conflicts, but this was most mine. And to see how it changed our domestic
*  politics forever. And so that was my rebellion. But it's funny because I identified as a left on
*  the left when I was growing up, up until I was 18. I had also a funny two year stint. This is where
*  everything kind of changed for me when I was 16. Actually, I moved to Qatar to Doha, Qatar,
*  because my dad was a dean or associate dean of Texas A&M University at Doha. So my last two years
*  of high school were at this, I went from this small town in Texas, and I love my parents because
*  they could recognize that I had within me that I was not a small town kid. So they took me out of
*  this country, every chance they got, I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go. And so I was,
*  I went from school in College Station to like this ritzy private school, American school.
*  Best thing that ever happened to me, because first of all, it got me out of College Station.
*  Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of, I wouldn't call it being anti-America, but you
*  don't appreciate America. Let me tell everybody out there listening, leave for a while, you will
*  miss it so much. You do not know what it is like to not have freedom of speech until you don't have
*  it. And I was going to high school with these guys in the Qatari Royal family, and all I wanted to
*  do was speak out about how they were pieces of shit for the way that they treated Indian citizens
*  in that country who are basically used as slave labor. And I could not say one word because I knew
*  I would be deported and I knew my dad would lose his job and my mom would lose her job and we would
*  be forced out of the country. You don't know what it's like to live like that or to be in a society
*  where you have a high school girlfriend or something and you can't even touch in public
*  or you're lectured for public decency. Listen, I've lived under a Gulf monarchy now and that
*  turned me into the most pro-America guy ever. I came back so like America, and I still am,
*  frankly, because of that experience. Living abroad, that will do it to you. Live in a non-democracy.
*  You have, even in Europe, I would say you guys aren't living as free as we are here. It's awesome.
*  And I love it. You're ultimately another human being than the one who left Texas.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, have you actually considered moving to Texas and broadly, just outside of your
*  own story, what do you think is the future of Texas? What is the future of Austin? There's so
*  much transformation seemingly happening now related to Silicon Valley, to California.
*  That's the fascinating part to me, which is that since I left, it's changed dramatically,
*  which is that it used to be like this conservative state where the main money to be made was oil,
*  and everybody knew that. Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that. Austin was always
*  weird, but it was more of a music town and a university town. It was not a tech town.
*  But in the 10 years or so since I left, I have begun to realize, I'm like, well, the Texas I
*  grew up in is over. It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term. The number one U-Haul
*  route in the country pre-pandemic already was San Francisco to Austin. Okay? So like you have
*  this massive influx of people from California and New York, and the state, the composition of it is
*  changed dramatically. The intra-composition and the out-truck, yeah. So the intra-composition,
*  it's become way more urban. It's from when I grew up. Texas was a much more rural state. Its politics
*  were much more static. It looked much more like Rick Perry. He was a very accurate representation
*  of who we were. Now, I don't think that that's the case. Texas is now a dynamic economy,
*  not just 100% reliant on oil because of its kind of like, I would call it like regulatory arbitrage
*  relative to California and New York offers a large incentive to people who are more,
*  I wouldn't say culturally liberal, but they're not necessarily like culturally conservative,
*  like the people who I grew up with. That's changed the whole state's politics.
*  Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz. I'm not saying the state's going to go blue. I
*  think the Republican party will just change and we'll have to readjust, but the re-urbanization
*  of Texas has made it, I'll put it in this way, much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up.
*  And then from my perspective, well, first of all, I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands
*  for, but more practically from my perspective, the injection of the tech innovation that's moving
*  to Texas has made it very exciting to me. It seems like outside of all that, maybe you can speak to
*  the weird in Austin. It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich sort of almost like mainstream
*  at this point, but he's also attracting a lot of weirdos. And so is Elon and a lot of those weirdos
*  are my friends and they're like Michael Malice, like those weirdos. And it's like, I have a hope
*  for Austin that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos will get injected.
*  It's possible. I actually think the most significant thing that happened were Tesla moving there.
*  The reason why is I love Joe, obviously, but he can only attract X amount of people.
*  Elon actually employs thousands of people. And then you will also Oracle. Oracle's decision to
*  move to Austin is just as important because those two men, Larry, was it Alison? Right?
*  Alison and Elon, they actually employ tens of thousands of people collectively.
*  That can change the nature of the city. So you combine that with Joe bringing this entire new
*  entertainment complex with the bodies of people who will appreciate said entertainment complex.
*  Spend money on the entertainment.
*  Exactly. You just remade the entire city. And that's why I'm fascinated. And obviously there's
*  network effects, which is now that all those people are down there. I mean, if I were Elon Musk,
*  I would donate a shit ton of money to the University of Texas and I would turn it into my
*  Stanford for Silicon Valley. Let's introduce some competition and let UT Austin hire the best
*  software developers, engineers, professors and more and turn Texas into a true like Austin
*  revolving door hub where people come to UT Austin to get an internship at Tesla and then become an
*  executive there and then create their own company in their own garage in Austin, which is the next
*  Facebook, Twitter. That's how it happens. This is why I'm much more skeptical of Miami. There's a
*  whole like tech Miami crew. I'm like, yeah, like there's no university. It's very inorganic.
*  Look, I think Miami is awesome. I just like, I don't know if the same building blocks are there
*  and also no multi-billion dollar companies, which employ thousands of people are coming there. That's
*  the ingredient. It's not just Joe Rogan. It's not just even Elon Musk. If he still operated in
*  California, it's all the people he employs. I think that is where I think Texas is going to
*  dramatically change within the next 10 years alternative to our, it's already become a more
*  urbanized state that's moved away from oil and gas in terms of like its emphasis, not necessarily
*  in terms of his real economics. And 10 years from now, I don't think it will be necessarily the name
*  prop like of the, of the town. The only question to me is how that manifests politically because
*  it's very possible though, because a lot of these workers themselves are California culturally
*  liberal. You could see a Gavin Newsom type person getting elected governor of Texas or like the
*  mayor of Austin. I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat, right? Like, I mean,
*  Joe has his own problems with Austin. It's funny. I remember him leaving LA and I'm like,
*  have you been to Austin? It ain't, you know, it's not everything it's cracked up to be,
*  you know, necessarily. But no matter what, you know, a new place allows the possibility for new
*  ideas. Even if they're somehow left leaning and all those kinds of things. I do think the only two
*  things missing from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit that sometimes have a podcast,
*  talk a bunch of nonsense and a mic. So let's, let's bring the best suit game to Texas. I hope you do
*  make it to Texas at some point. Thanks so much for talking to me. Thanks for listening to this
*  conversation with Sagar and Jetty. And thank you to our sponsors, Jordan Harmadjee Show, Grammarly

*  Martin Luther King Jr. about the idea that what is just and what is legal are not always the same
*  thing. He said, never forget that what Hitler did in Germany was legal. Thank you for listening and
*  hope to see you next time.
