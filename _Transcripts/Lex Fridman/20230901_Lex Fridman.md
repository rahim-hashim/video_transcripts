# Neri Oxman: Biology, Art, and Science of Design & Engineering with Nature | Lex Fridman Podcast #394
**Lex Fridman:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbPHojL_61U)
*  Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients of simultaneous complexity.
*  It has to be novel in terms of the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering.
*  All of these elements that are discipline-based or rooted must be novel.
*  If you can combine novelty in synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics,
*  with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design,
*  you are bound to create something novel.
*  The following is a conversation with Neri Oxman, an engineer, scientist, designer, architect,
*  artist, and one of the kindest, most thoughtful, and brilliant human beings I've gotten to know.
*  For a long time, she led the Mediated Matter Group at MIT that did research and built incredible
*  stuff at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, material science,
*  and synthetic biology. Doing so at all scales, from the microscale to the building scale.
*  Now, she's continuing this work at a very new company for now called Oxman,
*  looking to revolutionize how humans design and build products, working with nature, not against it.
*  On a personal note, let me say that Neri has for a long time been a friend, and someone who,
*  in my darker moments, has always been there with a note of kindness and support.
*  I am forever grateful to her. She's a brilliant and a beautiful human being.
*  Oh, and she also brought me a present, War and Peace by Tolstoy and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.
*  It doesn't get better than that. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neri Oxman.
*  Let's start with the universe. Do you ever think of the universe as a kind of machine
*  that designs beautiful things at multiple scales?
*  I do. And I think of nature in that way, in general, in the context of design, specifically.
*  I think of nature as everything that isn't anthropomast, everything that is not produced
*  by humankind. The birds and the rocks and everything in between, fungi, elephants, whales.
*  Do you think there's an intricate way in which there's a connection between humans and nature?
*  Yes. And we're looking for it. I think that from, let's say, from the beginning of mankind,
*  going back 200,000 years, the products that we have designed have separated us from nature.
*  And it's ironic that the things that we designed and produced as humankind, those are exactly the
*  things that separated us. Before that, we were totally and completely connected. And I want to
*  return to that world. But bring the tools of engineering and computation to it.
*  Yes. Yes. I absolutely believe that there is so much to nature that we still have not leveraged
*  and we still have not understood and we still haven't. And so much of our work is design,
*  but a lot of it is science, is unveiling and finding new truths about the natural world that
*  we were not aware of before. Everybody talks about intelligence these days, but I like to think that
*  nature has a kind of wisdom that exists beyond intelligence or above intelligence. And it's that
*  wisdom that we're trying to tap into through technology. If you think about humans versus
*  nature, at least in the realm, at least in the context of definition of nature as everything but
*  anthropomast, and I'm using Grone-Milo, who is an incredible professor from the Weizmann Institute,
*  who came up with this definition of anthropomast in 2020, when he identified that 2020 was the
*  crossover year when anthropomast exceeded biomass on the planet. So all of the design goods that we
*  have created and brought into the world now outweigh all of the biomass, including, of course,
*  all plastics and wearables building cities, but also asphalt and concrete all outweigh the scale
*  of the biomass. And actually that was a moment. You know how in life there are moments that,
*  there can be a handful of moments that get you to course correct. And it was a Zoom conversation
*  with Grone, and that was a moment for me when I realized that imbalance, now we've superseded
*  the biomass on the planet, where do we go from here? And you've heard the expression more
*  phones than bones and the anthropomast and the anthropocene and the technosphere sort of outweighing
*  the biosphere. But now we are really trying to look at is there a way in which all things
*  technosphere are designed as if they are part of the biosphere, meaning if you could today
*  grow instead of build everything and anything, if you could grow an iPhone, if you could grow a car,
*  what would that world look like? Where the Turing test for sort of this kind of,
*  I call this material ecology approach, but this notion that everything material,
*  everything that you design in the physical universe can be read and written to as or thought of or
*  perceived of as nature grown. That's sort of the Turing test for the company, or at least that's
*  how I started. I thought, well, grow everything. That's sort of the slogan. Let's grow everything.
*  And if we grow everything, is there a world in which driving a car is better for nature than a
*  world in which there are no cars? Is it possible that a world in which you build buildings in cities,
*  that those buildings and cities actually augment and heal nature as opposed to their absence? Is
*  there a world in which we now go back to that kind of synergy between nature and humans where
*  you cannot separate between grown and made, and it doesn't even matter? Is there a good term for the
*  intersection between biomass and anthropomass, like things that are grown? Yes. In 2005, I called this
*  material ecology. I thought, what if all things materials would be considered part of the ecology
*  and would have a positive impact on the ecology where we work together to help each other, all
*  things nature, all things human? And again, you can say that that wisdom in nature exists in fungi.
*  Many mushroom lovers always contest my thesis here saying, well, we have the mushroom network
*  and we have the mother trees and they're all connected. And why don't we just simply hack
*  into mushrooms? Well, first of all, yes, they're connected, but that network stops when there is a
*  physical gap. That network does not necessarily enable the whales in the Dominican to connect
*  with an olive tree in Israel, to connect with a weeping willow in Montana. And that's sort of a
*  world that I'm dreaming about. What does it mean for nature to have access to the cloud?
*  The kind of bandwidth that we're talking about, sort of think Neuralink for nature,
*  since the first computer, and you know this by heart probably better than I do, but we're both
*  MIT lifers. We today have computational power that is one trillion times the power that we had
*  in those times. We have 26.5 trillion times the bandwidth and 11.5 quintillion times the memory,
*  which is incredible. So humankind since the first computer has approached and accessed such
*  incredible bandwidth. And we're asking, well, what if nature had that bandwidth? So beyond genes
*  and evolution, if there was a way to augment nature and allow it access to the world of bits,
*  what does nature look like now? And can nature make decisions for herself as opposed to being
*  guided and guarded and abused by humankind? So nature has this inherent wisdom that you spoke to,
*  but you're also referring to augmenting that inherent wisdom with something like a large
*  language model. So compress human knowledge, but also maintain whatever is that intricate
*  wisdom that allows plants, bacteria, fungi to grow incredible things at arbitrary scales,
*  adapting to whatever environment and just surviving and thriving no matter where, no matter how.
*  Exactly. So I think of it as large molecule models. And those large molecule models,
*  of course, large language models are based on Google and search engines and so on and so forth.
*  And we don't have this data currently. And part of our mission is to do just that,
*  trying to quantify and understand the language that exists across all kingdoms of life, across
*  all five kingdoms of life. And if we can understand that language, is there a way for us to,
*  first, make sense of it, find logic in it, and then generate certain computational tools
*  that empower nature to build better crops, to increase the level of biodiversity?
*  In the company, we're constantly asking, what does nature want? What does nature want from a compute
*  view? If it knew it, what could aid it in whatever the heck it's wanting to do?
*  Yeah. So we keep coming back to this answer of nature wants to increase information,
*  but decrease entropy. So find order, but constantly increase the information scale.
*  And this is true for what our work also tries to do, because we're constantly trying to fight
*  against the dimensional mismatch between things made and things grown. And as designers, we
*  are educated to think in X, Y, and Z. And that's pretty much where architectural education ends
*  and biological education begins. So in reducing that dimensional mismatch, we're missing out on
*  opportunities to create things made as if grown. But in the natural environment, we're asking,
*  can we provide nature with these extra dimensions? And again, I'm not sure what nature wants,
*  but I'm curious as to what happens when you provide these tools to the natural environments,
*  obviously with responsibility, obviously with control, obviously with ethics and moral code.
*  But is there a world in which nature can help fix itself using those tools?
*  And by the way, we're talking about a company called Oxman.
*  Yeah. Just a few words about the team.
*  Yeah. What kind of humans work at a place like this? They're trying to figure out what nature
*  wants. You know, I think they're first like you. They're humanists first. They come from different
*  disciplines and different disciplinary backgrounds. And just as an example, we have a brilliant
*  designer who is just a mathematical genius and a computer scientist and a mechanical engineer who
*  is trained as a synthetic biologist. And now we're hiring a microbiologist and a chemist,
*  architects, of course, and designers, roboticists. So it's really, it's Noah's Ark, right? Two of
*  each. And always dancing between this line of the artificial, the synthetic and the real.
*  What's the term for it? And the natural. Yeah. The built and the grown, nature and culture,
*  technology and biology. But we're constantly seeking to ask how can we build, design,
*  and deploy products in three scales. The molecular scale, which I briefly hinted to,
*  and there in the molecular scale, we're really looking to understand whether there's a universal
*  language to nature and what that language is. And then build a tool that I think and dream
*  of it is the iPhone for nature. If nature had an iPhone, what would that iPhone look like?
*  Does that mean creating an interface between nature and the computational tools we have?
*  Exactly. It goes back to that 11.5 quintillion times the bandwidth that humans have now arrived
*  at and giving that to nature and seeing what happens there. Can animals actually use this
*  interface to know that they need to run away from fire? Can plants use this interface to
*  increase the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of a smoke cloud? Can they do this
*  quote unquote automatically without a kind of a top down brute force policy based method that's
*  authored and deployed by humans? And so this work really relates to that interface with the natural
*  world. And then there's a second area in the company which focuses on growing products.
*  And here we're focusing on a single product that starts from CO2. It becomes a product,
*  it's consumed, it's used, it's worn by a human, and then it goes back to the soil and it grows
*  an edible fruit plant. So we're talking about from CO2 to fruit. Yeah, it starts from CO2 and it ends
*  with something that you can literally eat. So the world's first entirely biodegradable,
*  biocompatible, biorenewable product. That's grown. Yes, either using plant matter or using
*  bacteria. But we are really looking at carbon recycling technologies that start with methane
*  or wastewater and end with this wonderful reincarnation of a thing that doesn't need
*  to end up in a composting site but can just be thrown into the ground and grow olive and find
*  peace. And there's a lot of textile based work out there that is focused on one single element
*  in this long chain like, oh, let's create leather out of mycelium or let's create textile out of
*  cellulose. But then it stops there and you get to assembling the shoe or the wearable and you need
*  a little bit of glue and you need a little bit of this material and a little bit of that material to
*  make it water resistant and then it's over. So that's one thing that we're trying to solve for
*  is how to create a product that is materially, computationally, robotically novel and goes
*  through all of these phases from the creation, from this carbon recycling technology to the product,
*  to literally how do you think about reinventing an industry that is focused on assembly and
*  putting things together and using humans to do that. Can that happen just using robots and microbes
*  and that's it? And doing it end to end. I would love to see what this factory looks like. And the
*  factory is great too. I'm very, very excited. In October we'll share first renditions of some of
*  this work and in February we'll invite you to the lab. I'm there. I've already applied. I haven't
*  heard back. I don't understand. Okay. Just before we get to number three, it'd be amazing to just
*  talk about what it takes with robotic arms or in general the whole process of how to build the life
*  form. Stuff you've done in the past, maybe stuff you're doing now. How to use bacteria. It's kind
*  of synthetic biology. How to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria. Is there examples from the past?
*  Yes. And just take a step back over the 10 years of the mediated matter group, which was my group
*  at MIT, has sort of dedicated itself to, biobased design would be a suitcase word, but sort of
*  thinking about that synergy between nature and culture, biology and technology. And we attempted
*  to build a suite of embodiments, let's say, that they ended up in amazing museums and amazing shows
*  and we wrote patents and papers on them, but they were still N of ones. Again, the challenge,
*  as you say, was to grow them. And we classified them into fibers, cellular solids, biopolymers,
*  pigments. And in each of the examples, although the material was different, sometimes we used fibers,
*  sometimes we used silk with silkworms and honey with bees or comb as the structural material.
*  With Vespers, we used synthetically engineered bacteria to produce pigments. Although the
*  materials were different and the hero organisms were different, the philosophy was always the
*  same. The approach was really an approach of computational templating. That templating
*  allowed us to create templates for the natural environment where nature and technology could
*  do it, could dance together to create these products. So just a few examples with silk
*  pavilion. We've had a couple of pavilions made of silk and the second one, which was the bigger one,
*  which ended up at the Museum of Modern Art with my friend and incredible mentor, Paul Antonelli.
*  That pavilion was six meter tall and it was produced by silkworms. And there we had different
*  types of templates. There were physical templates that were basically just these water-soluble
*  meshes upon which the silkworms were spinning. And then there were environmental templates,
*  which was a robot basically applying a variation of environmental conditions such as heat and light
*  to guide the movement of the silkworm. You're saying so many amazing things and I'm trying
*  not to interrupt you, but one of the things you've learned by observing, by doing science on these is
*  that the environment defines the shape that they create or contributes or integrally plays with
*  the shape they create. And that's one of the ways you can get to guide their work is by defining
*  the environment. By the way, you said hero organism, which is an epic term. That means
*  like it's whatever is the biological living system that's doing the creation.
*  And that's what's happening in pharma and biomaterials and by the way, precision ag and
*  new food design technologies as people are betting on a hero organism is the sort of how I think of
*  it. And the hero organism is sometimes it's the palm oil or it's the mycelium. There's a lot of
*  mushrooms around for good and bad and it's cellulose or it's fake bananas or the workhorse
*  E. coli. But these hero organisms are being betted on as like the, what's the one answer that solves
*  everything? The Tiker's guide? 42. 42. These are sort of the 42s of the enchanted new universe. And
*  back at MIT, we said instead of betting on all of these organisms, let's approach them as almost
*  like movement in a symphony. And let's kind of lean into what we can learn from each of these
*  organisms in the context of building a project in an architectural scale. And those usually were
*  pavilions. And then the computational templating is the way you guide the work of this. How many
*  did you say? 17,000? 17,532. So each of these silkworms threads are about one mile in distance
*  and they're beautiful. And just thinking about the amount of material, it's a bit like thinking
*  about the length of capillary vessels that grow in your belly when you're pregnant to feed that
*  incredible new life form. It's just nature is amazing. But back to the silkworms, I think I had
*  three months to build this incredible pavilion, but we couldn't figure out how, we were thinking
*  of emulating the process of how a silkworm goes about building its incredible architecture, this
*  cocoon over the period of 24 to 72 hours. And it builds a cocoon basically to protect itself.
*  It's a beautiful form of architecture and it uses pretty much just two materials, two chemical
*  compounds, sericin and fibrin. The sericin is sort of the glue of the cocoon, the fibrin is the
*  fiber-based material of the cocoon and through fibers and glue, and that's true for so many
*  systems in nature, lots of fiber and glue, and that architecture allows them to metamorphosize.
*  And in the process, they vary the properties of that silk thread, so it's stiffer or softer
*  depending on where it is in the section of the cocoon. And so we were trying to emulate this
*  robotically with a 3D printer that was a six-axis kooka arm, one of these baby kookas, and we're
*  trying to emulate that process computationally and build something very large. When one of my
*  students now, a brilliant industrial engineer, a roboticist on my team, Marcus, said, well,
*  we were just playing with those silkworms and enjoying their presence when we realized that
*  if they're placed on a desk or a horizontal surface, they will go about creating their cocoon,
*  only the cocoon would be flat because they're constantly looking for a vertical post in order
*  to use that post as an anchor to spin the cocoon. But in the absence of that post, on surfaces that
*  are less than 21 millimeters and flat, they will spin flat patches and we'll say, aha,
*  let's work with them to produce this dome as a set of flat patches. And a silkworm, mind you,
*  is quite an egocentric creature. And actually, the further you go, you move forward in evolution,
*  by natural selection, the more egoism you find in creatures. So when you think about termites,
*  right, their material sophistication is actually very primitive, but they have incredible ability
*  to communicate and connect with each other. So if you think about the entire, all of nature,
*  let's say all of living systems as like a matrix that runs across two axes, one is material
*  sophistication, which is terribly relevant for designers, and the other is communication.
*  The termites ace on communication, but their material sophistication is crap, right? It's just
*  saliva and feces and some soil particles that are built to create these incredible termite
*  mounds at the scale that when compared to human skyscrapers transcend all of buildable scales,
*  at least in terms of what we have today in architectural practice, just in relative to
*  the size of the termite. But when you look at the silkworm, the silkworm has zero connection
*  and communication across silkworms. They were not designed to connect and communicate with each
*  other. They're sort of a human design species because the domesticated silk moth creates the
*  cocoon. We then produce the silk of it and then it dies. So it has dysfunctional wings. It cannot
*  fly. And that's another problem that the sericulture industry has is why did we in the
*  first place author this organism 4,000 years ago that is unable to fly and is just there
*  to basically live as, to serve a human need, which is textiles. And so here we were fascinated by the
*  computational kind of biology dimension of silkworms. But along the way, by the way,
*  this is great. I never get to tell the full story. I'm so great. I'm always like people say,
*  I always speak in Nietzschean paragraphs. They're way too long. And this is wonderful. This is like
*  heaven. But really those silkworms are not, yes, they're not designed to be like humans, right?
*  They're not designed to connect, communicate and build things that are
*  bigger than themselves through connection and communication. So what happens when you
*  had 17,000 of them communicating? That's a really great question. What happens is that at some point
*  the templating strategies, and as you said correctly, there were geometrical templating,
*  material templating, environmental templating, chemical templating. If you're using pheromones
*  to guide the movement of bees in the absence of a queen where you have a robotic queen,
*  robotic queen. But whenever you have these templating strategies, you have sort of control
*  over nature, right? But the question is, is there a world in which we can move from templating,
*  from providing these computational material and immaterial physical and molecular platforms that
*  guide nature, almost guiding a product, almost like a gardener to a problem or an opportunity
*  of emergence where that biological organism assumes agency by virtue of accessing the
*  robotic code and saying, now I own the code, I get to do what I want with this code. Let me show
*  you what this pavilion may look like or this product may look like. And I think one of the
*  exciting moments for us is when we realized that these robotic platforms that were designed
*  initially as templates actually inspired, if I may, a kind of collaboration and cooperation
*  between silkworms that are not a swarm-based organism. They're not like the bees and the
*  termites. They don't work together and they don't have social orders amongst them, the queen and
*  the drones, et cetera. They're all the same in a way, right? And here what was so exciting for us
*  is that these computational and fabrication technologies enable the silkworm to hop from
*  the branch in ecology of worms to the branch in ecology of maybe human-like intelligence where
*  they could connect and communicate by virtue of feeling or rubbing against each other in an area
*  that was hotter or colder. So the product that we got at the end, the variation of density of
*  fiber and the distribution of the fiber and the transparency, the product at the end seems like
*  it was produced by a swarm silk community. But of course it wasn't. It's a bunch of biological
*  agents working together to assemble this thing. That's really, really fascinating to us. How can
*  technology augment or enable a swarm-like behavior in creatures that have not been designed
*  to work as swarms? So how do you construct a computational template from which
*  a certain kind of thing emerges? How can you predict what emerges, I suppose?
*  So if you can predict it, it doesn't count as emergence. Actually,
*  that's a deeply poetic line. We can talk about it. It's a bit like if you measure it, it doesn't count.
*  That's right.
*  Speaking of emergence, an empowerment, because we're constantly moving between those as if they're
*  equals on the team. One of them, Christoph, shared with me a mathematical equation for
*  what does it mean to empower nature and what does empowerment in nature look like?
*  And that relates to emergence. And we can go back to emergence in a few moments, but I want to say
*  it so that I know that I've learned it. And if I've learned it, I can use it later.
*  And maybe you'll figure something out as you say it also.
*  Of course, Christoph is the master here. But really, we were thinking, again, what does nature want?
*  Nature wants to increase the information dimension and reduce entropy. What do we want? We kind of
*  want the same thing. We want more, but we want order. And this goes back to your conversation
*  with Josje about stochastic versus deterministic languages or processes. His definition or the
*  definition he found was that an agent is empowered if the entropy of the distribution of all of its
*  states is high, while the entropy of the distribution of a single state given a choice,
*  given an action, is low. Meaning it's that kind of duality between opportunity, like starting like
*  this and going like this, opening and closing. And this really, I think, is analogous to human
*  empowerment. Given an infinite wide array of choices, what is the choice that you make
*  to enable, to empower, to provide you with the agency that you need?
*  And how much does making that choice actually control the trajectory of the system? That's
*  really nice. So this applies to all the kinds of systems you're talking about.
*  Yeah. And the cool thing is it can apply to a human on an individual basis, but or a silkworm
*  or a bee or a microbe, a microbe that has agency or by virtue of a template. But it also applies
*  to a community of organisms like the bees. And so we've done a lot of work sort of moving from,
*  you've asked how to grow things. So we've grown things using co-fabrication where we're
*  digitally fabricating with other organisms that live across the various kingdoms of life. And
*  those were silkworms and bees. And with bees, which we've sent to outer space and returned
*  healthily and they were reproductive. Okay, you're going to have to tell that story.
*  You're going to have to talk about the robotic queen and the pheromones. Come on.
*  So we've built what we call a synthetic apiary. And the synthetic apiary was designed as an
*  environment that was a perpetual spring environment for the bees of Massachusetts.
*  They go on hibernation, of course, during the winter season. And then we lose 80% of them or
*  more during that period. We're thinking, okay, what if we created this environment where
*  before you template, right, before you can design with, you have to design for, right? You have to
*  create this space of mutualism, space of sort of shared connection between you and the organism.
*  And with bees, it started as the synthetic apiary. And we have proven that that curated
*  environment where we designed the space with high levels of control of temperature, humidity,
*  and light. And we've proven that they were reproductive and alive. And we realized, wow,
*  this environment that we created can help augment bees in the winter season in any
*  city around the world where bees survive and thrive in the summer and spring seasons.
*  And could this be a kind of a new urban typology, an architectural typology of symbiosis of mutualism
*  between organisms and humans? Where these are, by the way, the synthetic apiary was in a co-op
*  in nearby Somerville. We had robots, our team schlepped there every day with our
*  tools and machines and we made it happen. And the neighbors were very happy and they got to get a
*  ton of honey at the end of the winter. And those bees, of course, were released into the wild at
*  the end of the winter alive and kicking. So then in order to actually experiment with the robotic
*  queen and idea or concept, we had to prove obviously that we can create this space for
*  bees. And then after that, we had this amazing opportunity to send the bees to space on Blue
*  Shepherd mission that is part of Blue Origin. And we, of course, said, yes, we'll take a slot.
*  We said, okay, can we outdo NASA? So NASA in 1982 had an experiment where they sent bees to
*  outer space. The bees returned, they were not reproductive. And some of them died and we
*  thought, well, is there a way in which we can create a life support system almost like a small
*  mini bio lab of a queen and her retinue that would be sent in this Blue Origin, New Shepherd mission
*  in this one cell? And so if the synthetic apiary was an architectural project,
*  in this case, the second synthetic apiary was a product. It was right. So from an architectural
*  controlled environment to a product scale control environment. And this bio lab, this life support
*  system for bees was designed to provide the bees with all the conditions that they needed. And
*  we looked at that time at the Nassanove pheromone that the queen uses to guide the other bees. And
*  we looked at pheromones that are associated with a bee and thinking of those pheromones being
*  released inside the capsule that goes to outer space. They returned back to the Media Lab roof.
*  And those bees were alive and kicking and reproductive. And they continued to create
*  comb. And it ended with a beautiful nature paper that the team and I published together.
*  We gave them gold nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles because we were interested if
*  bees recycle wax. It was known forever that bees do not recycle the wax. And by feeding them these
*  gold nanoparticles, we were able to prove that the bees actually do recycle the wax.
*  The reason I'm bringing this forward is because we don't view ourselves as designers of consumable
*  products and architectural environments only. But we love that moment where these technologies,
*  and by the way, every one of these projects that we created involved the creation of a new
*  technology, whether it be a glass printer or the spinning robot or the life support system for the
*  bee colony. They all involved a technology that was associated with the project. And I never,
*  ever, ever, ever want to let that part go because I love technology so much.
*  But also another element of this is that always these projects, if they're great,
*  they reveal new knowledge about or new science about the topic that you're investigating,
*  be it silkworms or bees or glass. That's why I say I always tell my team it should be at MoMA and
*  the cover of Nature or Science at the same time. We don't separate between the art and the science.
*  It's one of the same. So as you're creating the art, you're going to learn something about
*  these organisms or something about these materials. I mean, is there something that stands out to you
*  about these hero organisms like bees, silkworms? You mentioned E. coli has its pros and cons,
*  its bacteria. What have you learned that small or big that's interesting about these organisms?
*  Yeah, that's a beautiful question. What have I learned? I've learned that
*  we also worked with shrimp shells with Aguaja. We built this tower on the roof of Asif MoMA,
*  which by a couple of months ago, until it was on the roof, we've shown the structure completely
*  biodegrade into the, well, not completely, but almost completely biodegrade to the soil. And
*  this notion that a product or an organism or part of that organism can reincarnate is a very,
*  very moving thought to me because I want to believe that I believe in reincarnation.
*  I want to believe that I believe.
*  Yeah, that's my relationship with God. I like to believe in believing.
*  Most great things in life are second derivatives of things, but that's part of another conversation.
*  I feel like that's a quote that's going to take weeks to really internalize.
*  That notion of I want you to want, or I need you to need, or that there's always something,
*  a deeper truth behind what is on the surface. And so I like to go to the second and tertiary
*  derivative of things and discover new truths about them through that. But what have I learned about
*  organisms? And why don't you like E. coli?
*  I like E. coli. And a lot of the work that we've done was not possible without our working on E.
*  coli or other workhorse organisms like cyanobacteria. How are bacteria used?
*  Death masks, the death masks. So what are death masks?
*  So we did this project called Vespers, and those were basically death masks that was
*  set as a process for designing a living product. What happens, and we looked at,
*  I looked at, I remember looking at Beethoven's death masks and Agamemnon's death masks and
*  just studying how they were created. And really, they were sort of geometrically attuned to the
*  face of the dead. And what we wanted to do is create a death mask that was not based in,
*  was not based on the shape of the wearer, but rather was based on their legacy and their biology.
*  And maybe we could harness a few stem cells there for future generations or contain the last breath.
*  Lazarus, which preceded Vespers, was a project where we designed a mask to
*  contain a single breath, the last breath of the wearer. And again, if I had access to these
*  technologies today, I would totally reincorporate my grandmother's last breath in a product. So it
*  was like an air memento. So with Vespers, we actually used E. coli to create pigmented masks,
*  masks whose pigments would be recreated at the surface of the mask. And I'm skipping over a lot
*  of content, but basically there were 15 masks and they were created as three sets, the masks of the
*  past, the mask of the present, and the mask of the future. The masks, there were five, five and five,
*  and the masks of the past were based on ornaments and they were embedded with natural minerals like
*  gold. Yes, yes, yes. And we're looking at pictures of these and they're gorgeous.
*  Yes. Extremely delicate and interesting fractal patterns that are symmetrical.
*  They look symmetrical, but they're not. We intended for you to be tricked and think that
*  they're all symmetrical. But there's imperfections. There are imperfections by design. All of these
*  forms and shapes and distribution of matter that you're looking at was entirely designed using a
*  computational program. So none of it is manual. But long story short, the first collection is about
*  the surface of the mask and the second collection, which you're looking at, is about the volume of
*  the mask and what happens to the mask when all the colors from the surface, yes, enter the volume
*  of the mask inside, create pockets and channels to guide life through them. They were incorporated
*  with pigment producing living organisms and then those organisms were templated to recreate the
*  patterns of the original death masks. And so life recycles and rebegins and so on and so forth. The
*  past meets the future, the future meets the past. From the surface to the volume, from death to life
*  to death to life to death to life. And that again is a recurring theme in the projects that we take
*  on. But from a technological perspective, what was interesting is that we embedded chemical signals
*  in the jet, in the printer, and those chemical signals basically interacted with the pigment
*  producing bacteria, in this case E. coli, that were introduced on the surface of the mask. And
*  those interactions between the chemical signals inside the resins and the bacteria at the surface
*  of the mask at the resolution that is native to the printer, in this case 20 microns per voxel,
*  allowed us to compute the exact patterns that we wanted to achieve. And we thought, well, if we can
*  do this with pigments, can we do this with antibiotics? If we can do this with antibiotics,
*  could we do it with melanin? And what are the implications? Again, this is a platform technology.
*  Now that we have it, what are the actual real world implications and potential applications
*  for this technology? And we started a new area. One of my students, Rachel, her PhD thesis
*  was titled after this new class of materials that we created through this project Vespers,
*  Hybrid Living Materials, HLMs. And these hybrid living materials really paved the way
*  towards a whole other set of products that we've designed, like the work that we did with melanin
*  for the Mandela Pavilion that we presented at SFMOMA, where again we're using the same principles
*  of templating, in this case not silkworms and not bees, but we're templating bacteria at a much,
*  much more finer resolution. And now instead of templating using a robot, we're templating
*  using a printer. But compute is very, very much part of it. And what's nice about bacteria,
*  of course, is that from an ethical perspective, I think there's a range, right? So at the end of
*  the silk pavilion, I got an email from a professor in Japan who has been working on transgenic silk
*  and said, well, if you did this amazing silk pavilion, why don't we create glow-in-the-light
*  silk dresses? And in order to create this glow-in-the-light silk, we need to apply
*  genes that are taken from a spider to a silkworm. And this is what is known as a transgenic
*  operation. And we said no. And that was for us a clear decision that no, we will work with these
*  organisms as long as we know that what we are doing with them is not only better for humans,
*  but it's also better for them. And again, just to remind you, I forget the exact number,
*  but it's around a thousand cocoons per single shirt that are exterminated in India and China
*  in those sericulture industries that are being abused. Now, yes, this organism was designed
*  to serve the human species. And maybe it's time to retire that conception
*  of organisms that are designed for a human-centric world or human-centric set of applications.
*  I don't feel the same way about E. coli. Not that I'm agnostic, organism agnostic, but still,
*  I believe there's so much for us to do on this planet with bacteria.
*  And so in general, your design principle is to grow cool stuff as a byproduct of the organism
*  flourishing. So not using the organism. The win-win, the synergy, the whole that's
*  bigger than the sum of its parts. It's interesting. I mean, it just feels like a gray area where genetic
*  modification of an organism, it just feels like, I don't know, if you genetically modified me
*  to make me glow in the light, I kind of like it. I think you have enough of an aura.
*  Thank you. I was just fishing for compliments. Thank you. I appreciate it.
*  You're absolutely right. And by the way, the gray area is where some of us like to live and
*  like to thrive. And that's okay. And thank goodness that there are so many of us that
*  like the black and white and that thrive in the black and white. My husband is a good example for
*  that. Well, but just to clarify, in this case, you're also trying to thrive in the black and white
*  in that you're saying like the silkworm is a beautiful, wonderful creature. Let us not modify
*  it. Is that the idea or is it okay to modify a little bit as long as we can see that it benefits
*  the organism as well as the final creation? So with silkworms, absolutely. Let's not modify
*  genetically. Let's not modify genetically. And then some, because why did we get there to begin
*  with 4,000 years ago in the Silk Road? And we should never get to a point where we evolve life
*  for the service of mankind at the risk of these wonderful creatures across the kingdom of life.
*  I don't think about the same kind of ethical range when I think about bacteria.
*  Nevertheless, bacteria are pretty wonderful organisms.
*  I'm moving to my second cup here. Take two. Things are getting serious now.
*  Bacteria are, yeah, for sure. Let's give bacteria all the love they deserve. We wouldn't be here
*  without them. They were here for, I don't know what it is, like a billion years before anything
*  else showed up. But in a way, if you think about it, they create the matter that we consume and then
*  we reincarnate or dissolved into the soil and then creates a tree and then that tree creates
*  more bacteria. And then that bacteria could, I mean, again, that's why I like to think about
*  not recycling, but reincarnating because that assumes a kind of imparting upon nature
*  that dimension of agency and maybe awareness. But yeah, lots of really interesting work happening
*  with bacteria. Directed evolution is one of them. We're looking at directed evolution. So high
*  throughput directed evolution of bacteria for the production of products. And again, those products
*  can be a shoe, wearables, biomaterials, therapeutics. And doing that direction computationally.
*  Totally computationally, obviously in the lab with the hero organism, the hero bacteria.
*  And what's happening today in ecromicrobial synthetic biology, synthetic biology that
*  lends itself to ecology. And again, all of these fields are coming together. It's such
*  a wonderful time to be a designer. I can't think of a better time to be a designer in this world.
*  But with high throughput directed evolution, and I should say that the physical space in our
*  new lab will have these capsules which we have designed that are designed like growth chambers
*  or grow rooms. And in those grow rooms, we can basically program top down environmental templating,
*  top down environmental control of lights, humidity, light, etc. So light, humidity and temperature
*  while doing bottom up genetic regulation. So it is a wet lab, but in that wet lab,
*  you could do at the same time, genetic modulation, regulation and environmental templating.
*  And then again, the idea is that in one of those capsules, maybe we grow transparent wood and in
*  another capsule, we, you know, we can transparent wood for architectural application, another capsule,
*  we grow a shoe. And in another capsule, we look at that language, you know, large language model
*  that we talked about. And there's a particular technology associated with that, which we're
*  hoping to reveal to the world in February. And in each of those capsules is basically a high
*  throughput computational environment, like a breadboard that has think of sort of physical
*  breadboard environment that has access to oxygen and nitrogen and CO2 and nutritional dispensing.
*  And these little capsules could be stressed, they're sort of an ecology in a box. And they
*  could be stressed to produce the food of the future or the products of the future or the
*  construction materials of the future. Food is a very interesting one, obviously because of food
*  insecurity and the issues that we have around both in terms of food insecurity, but also in
*  terms of the future of food and what will remain after we can't eat plants and animals anymore and
*  all we can eat is these false bananas and, you know, and insects as our protein source. So there,
*  we're thinking, you know, can we design these capsules to stress an environment and see how
*  that environment behaves? Think about a kind of an ecological, a biodiversity chamber, right? A
*  kind of a time capsule that is designed as a biodiversity chamber where you can program
*  the exact temperature, humidity and light combination to emulate the environment from the
*  past. So Ohio, 1981, December 31st at 5 a.m. in the morning, what did tomatoes taste like?
*  To all the way in the future, 200 years ago, these are the environmental inputs, these are
*  some genetic regulations that I'm testing and what might be the food of the future or the products
*  of the future or the construction materials of the future feel like, test like, behave like,
*  etc. And so these capsules are designed as part of a lab. That's why it's been taking us such a long
*  time to get to this point because we started designing them in 2019 and they're currently,
*  literally as I speak to you, under construction. How well is it understood how to do this dance
*  of controlling these different variables in order for various kinds of growth to happen?
*  It's not. It's never been done before and these capsules have never been designed before. So,
*  you know, when we first decided these are going to be environmental capsules, people thought we're
*  crazy. What are you building? What are you making? So the answer is that we don't know,
*  but we know that there has never been a space like this where you have basically a wet lab
*  and a grow room at that resolution, at that granularity of control over organisms.
*  There is a reason why there is this incredible evolution of products in the software space.
*  And the hardware space, that's a more limiting space that because of the physical infrastructure
*  that we have to test and experiment with things. So we really wanted to push on creating a wet lab
*  that is novel in every possible way. What could you create in it? You could create the future.
*  You could create an environment of plants talking to each other with a robotic referee.
*  And the robotic referee, you know, and you could set an objective function. And let's say
*  for the transaction driven individuals in the world, let's say their objective function is
*  carbon sequestration. And all of those plants are implemented with a gaming engine and they have
*  this reward system, right? And they're constantly needing to optimize the way in which they carbon
*  sequest. We weed out the bad guys, we leave the good guys and we end up with this like ideal
*  ecology of carbon sequestering heroes that connect and communicate with each other. And once we have
*  that model, this biodiversity chamber, we send it out into the field and we see what happens in
*  nature. And that's sort of what I'm talking about, augmenting plants with that extra dimension of
*  bandwidth that they do not have. Just last week I came across a paper that discusses the in vivo
*  neurons that are augmented with a pong game and in a dish they basically present sentience
*  and the beginning of awareness, which is wonderful. Like that you could actually take these neurons
*  from a mouse brain and you have the electrical circuits and the physiological circuits that
*  enable these cells to connect and communicate and together arrive at sort of swarm situation
*  that allows them to act as a system that is not only perceived to be sentient but is actually
*  sentience. Michael Levine calls this agential material, material that has agency, right? So
*  this is of interest to us because this is sort of, again, this is emergence post-templating.
*  You template until you don't need to template anymore because the system has its own rules,
*  right? What we don't want to happen with AGI, we want to happen with synthetic biology. What we
*  don't want to happen online and software with language. We want for it to happen with
*  bio-based materials because that will get us closer to growing things as opposed to assembly and
*  mechanically putting them together with toxic materials and compounds. If I can ask a pothead
*  question for a second. So you mentioned just like the silkworms, the individual silkworms got to
*  actually learn how to collaborate or actually to collaborate in a swarm-like way. You're talking
*  about getting plants to communicate in some interesting way based on an objective function.
*  Is it possible to have some kind of interface between another kind of organisms, humans,
*  and nature? So like a human to have a conversation with a plant?
*  There already is. You know that when we cut freshly cut grass, I love the smell,
*  but it's a smell of actually it's a smell of distress that the leaves of grass are communicating
*  to each other. So the grass when it's cut emits green leaf, volatiles, GLVs. And those GLVs are
*  basically one leaf of grass communicating to another leaf of grass. Be careful, mind you,
*  you're about to be cut. These incredible life forms are communicating using a different
*  language than ours. We use language models, they use molecular models. At the moment where
*  we can parse, we can decode these molecular moments is when we can start having a conversation with
*  plants. Now, of course, there is a lot of work around plant neurobiology. It's a real thing.
*  Plants do not have a nervous system, but they have something akin to a nervous system. It has a kind
*  of an ecological intelligence that is focused on a particular time scale. And the time scale is very,
*  very slow, slow, slow, slow time scale. So it is when we can melt these time scales and connect
*  with these plants in terms of the content of the language, in this case, molecules, the duration
*  of the language, and we can start having a conversation, if not simply to understand what
*  is happening in the plant kingdom. Precision agriculture, I promise to you, will look very,
*  very different. Because right now we're using drones to take photos of crops of corn that look
*  bad. And when we take that photo, it's already too late. But if we understand these molecular
*  footprints and things that they are trying to say, distress that they are trying to communicate,
*  then we could, of course, predict the physiological, biological behavior of these crops,
*  both for their own self-perpetuation, but also for the foods and the pharma and the type of
*  molecules that we're seeking to grow for the benefit of humanity. And so these languages
*  that we are attempting now to quantify and qualify will really help us not only better nature and
*  help nature in its striving to surviving, but also help us design better wines and better foods and
*  better medicine and better products, again, across all scales, across all application domains.
*  Is there intricacies to understanding the time scales, like you mentioned, at which
*  these communications, these languages operate? Is there something different between the way
*  humans communicate and the way plants communicate in terms of time?
*  Remember when we started the conversation talking about
*  sort of definitions in the context of design and then in the context of being?
*  That question requires, I think, a kind of a shift, a humility. That requires a kind of a humility
*  towards nature, understanding that it operates on different scales. We recently discovered that
*  you know that the molecular footprint of a rose or of a plant in general during nighttime is
*  different than its molecular footprint during daytime. So these are circadian rhythms that
*  are associated with what kind of molecules these plants emit given stress, stresses and given,
*  you know, there's a reason why the jasmine, a jasmine field smells so, so delicious and
*  4 a.m. in the morning and then there's like, there's peace and rest amongst, you know,
*  amongst the plants and you have to sort of tune into that time dimension of the plant kingdom and
*  that of course requires all this humility where in a single capsule to design a biodiversity chamber
*  will take years, not months and definitely not days and to see these products and also that
*  humility in design comes from simply, you know, looking at how we are today as a civilization,
*  how we use and abuse nature. Like just think of all these Christmas trees, right? These Christmas
*  trees, they take years to grow. We use them for one night, the holiest night of the year
*  and then we let them go and think about in nature to design a quote unquote product, an organism
*  spends energy and time and thoughtfulness and many, many, many years and I'm thinking about
*  the redwoods to grow these channels, these, you know, the cellulose layers and channels and reach
*  these incredible heights takes sometimes hundreds of years, sometimes thousands of years. Am I afraid
*  of building a company that designs products in the scale of thousands of years? No, I'm not and the
*  way of being in the physical world today is really not in tune with the time dimension of the natural
*  world at all and that needs to change and that's obviously very, very hard to do in a community
*  of human beings that is at least in the western world that is based on capitalism and so here
*  the wonderful challenge that we have ahead of us is how do we impart upon the capitalist movement?
*  We know that we need to produce now products that will enter the real world and be, you know, shared
*  and used by others and still benefit the natural world while benefiting humans and that's a wonderful
*  challenge to have. So integrate technology with nature and that's a really difficult problem.
*  I see Parallels here with another company of Neuralink which is basically like you,
*  I think you mentioned Neuralink for nature that there are short-term products you can come up with
*  but it's ultimately a long-term challenge of how do you integrate the machine with this creation
*  of nature, this intricate complex creation of nature which is the human brain and then you're
*  speaking more generally nature. You know how every company has an image, like this one single image
*  that embodies the spirit of the company and I think for Neuralink it was to me that
*  chimpanzee playing a video game, it was just unbelievable but with plants there potentially
*  a set of molecules that impacts or inspires, I like that word, the plant to
*  behave or act in a certain way and allows still the plant the possibility of deciding where it
*  or she or he wants to go which is why our first product for this molecular space is going to be
*  a functionalized fragrance. So here we're thinking about the future of fragrances and the future
*  fragrances and flavors. These products are in the industry as we know it today are designed
*  totally for a human-centric use and enjoyment and indulgence and luxury. They're used on the body
*  for the sake of attraction and feeling good and smelling good and we were asking ourselves is there
*  a world in which a fragrance can be not a functional fragrance because you could claim
*  that all fragrances are functional but is there a world in which the fragrance becomes functionalized
*  is again imparted upon or given agency to connect with another organism. Is there a world in which
*  you and I can go down to your garden and use a perfume that will interact with the rose garden
*  downstairs. I've just been enamored with the statements that are being made in the media
*  around oh this is completely biologically derived fragrance and it's bio-based and but when you look
*  into the fragrance and you understand that in order to get to this bio-derived fragrance you
*  went through you blew through you know 10,000 bushes of rose to create five milliliters of a
*  rose fragrance and all these 10,000 bushes of rose they take space they take you know water
*  management and so much waste. Is this really what we want the future of our agriculture and
*  molecular goods to look like and so when we did the Aguajaja pavilion on the roof of Asif Moma
*  we calculated that for that pavilion we had 40,000 calories embedded into this pavilion that was made
*  of shrimp shells and chitosan and apple skins and cellulose from tree pulp and we calculated that
*  overall the structure had 40,000 calories interesting way to think about a structure right
*  from the from the point of view of calories but as you left the gallery you saw these three clocks
*  that were so beautifully designed by Felix on our team and these clocks measured temperature and
*  humidity and we connected them to a weather channel so that we could directly look at how
*  the pavilion was biodegrading in real time and in our calculations I say this long-winded
*  description of the pavilion to say that in the calculation we incorporated you know
*  how much electricity we used for our computers for the 3D printers that printed the pavilion
*  and you know and these were called energy calculations right energy and materials
*  and when you think about a product and you think about you know a shoe or a chair or a perfume or
*  a building you don't stop at the object you want to go all the way to the system again instead of
*  designing objects or singular embodiments of a the will of the designer you're really tabbing into
*  an entire system that is interconnected and if you look at the energy budget that characterized
*  the project agrocha it traverses the entire planet right some of these shrimp shells were
*  brought from places in the world we haven't thought of in terms of the apples and the shrimp shells
*  and the tree pulp and so going back to you know going back to to fragrances it's really really
*  important to understand the product in the context of the ecological system from which
*  it's sourced and and how it's designed and that is the kind of thinking that is not only desired
*  but is required if we are to achieve synergy between humanity and nature and since you think
*  is the system level thinking is almost always going to take you to the entire earth to consider
*  in the entire earth ecosystem which is why it's important to have a left brain and a right brain
*  competing for attention and intimacy yes you mentioned a fragrance that kind of sends out a
*  message to the environment essentially a message in a bottle yeah a message in a bottle so like
*  so you can go to a rose garden and trick the rose garden to think it's 4 a.m.
*  essentially you could if you wanted to but maybe that is not trick trick is a bad word right
*  inspire but inspire i like i like the idea of providing nature with a choice which is why i
*  love that elegant mathematical equation of empowerment and agency empower the the rose
*  garden to to create a romantic moment for the for the wearer of the fragrance but now again you're
*  you're again all of this to go back to back to that human-centric notion of romance but maybe
*  there's another way to do romance right that that we haven't yet you know that we haven't yet
*  explored and and maybe you know there is a way to tap into what happens to the rose when it's
*  dreaming assuming that plants are sentient and assuming that we can tap into that sentience
*  what can we discover about what does the rose want like what does what does it actually want
*  and and and what does it need and what are what what are the roses um you know dreams but do you
*  think there's some correlation in terms of romance in terms of the word you sometimes use magic
*  is there some similarities in what humans want and what roses want and what nature wants i think so
*  i think there is and if i did not think so oh my goodness this would not be a nice world to live
*  and i think we all want love i recently read this beautiful letter that was written by einstein to
*  his daughter um and was discovered einstein asked his daughter to wait 20 years until she reveals
*  these letters and so she did it's just one of the most beautiful letters i've ever read from a father
*  to his daughter and the letter overall is imbued with a kind of a sense of remorse or maybe even
*  feelings of sadness and there is some kind of melancholy note in the letter where einstein
*  regrets not having spent enough time with his daughter having focused on you know the fear of
*  general relativity and changing the world and then he goes on to talk about this beautiful and elegant
*  equation of e equals mc square and he tells his daughter that he believes that love is actually
*  the force that shapes the universe because it is like gravity right it attracts people it is like
*  light it brings people together and connect connects between people um and it's all empowering and
*  and so if you multiply it by the the speed of light you could really change the world for the
*  better and i i call me a romanticist i know you are too um which is why i so love being here i i
*  believe in this i i totally and utterly um believe in in love by the way let me just excerpts from
*  einstein's letter there's an extremely powerful force that so far science has not found a formal
*  explanation to it is a force that includes and governs all others and is even behind any
*  phenomena operating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us this universal force
*  is love he also the last paragraph in the letter as you've mentioned i deeply regret not having
*  been able to express what is in my heart which has quietly beaten for you all my life maybe it's too
*  late to apologize but his time is relative that jokes through einstein i need to tell you that i
*  love you and uh thanks to you i've reached the ultimate answer your father albert einstein
*  yeah but that regret i deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart
*  maybe that's the universal regret filling your days with busyness
*  and silly pursuits and not sitting down and uh expressing that but it is everything it is everything
*  it is why i love that expression and i forget who said this but i i love my daughter more than um
*  evolution required right and um i feel the same way towards my other half and and i feel that when
*  you find that connection um everything and anything is possible um and it's a very very very magical
*  um a magical moment so i i i believe in love and i believe in the one
*  it might be the same thing it might be a different thing but let me ask you a ridiculously big
*  philosophical uh question about beauty dostoevsky said beauty will save the world in the idiot one
*  of my favorite books of his uh what is beauty to you you've created through this intersection of
*  engineering and nature you've created some incredibly beautiful things what do you think is beauty
*  beauty that's a beautiful question maybe it is connected to the love question it is connected
*  to the love question of course everything is connected to the love question um to me beauty
*  is agency to me something that has agency it is beautiful there is this special quote from
*  buckminster fuller which i cannot remember word for word but i remember the concept
*  which goes something like this um when i work on a problem i never think about beauty
*  but when i'm done solving the problem and i look at what i've created and it's not beautiful i know
*  that i was wrong okay yeah it's kind of a an agency that speaks to quote unquote the objective
*  function of the creation right whether for bucky it's useless or useful so this idea of empowerment
*  that you talked about yes they connected to it comes back to that yeah what's the difference
*  that you hinted at between empowerment and emergence is uh emergence completely lacks control
*  is it and empowerment is more uh is more controlled there's an agent making decisions
*  is there an interesting distinction there yes i think empowerment is a force with direction
*  it has directionality to it emergence is i believe multi-directional again that depends on the
*  application emergence is perhaps in terms of sort of a material definition is the isotropic spirit
*  when um empowerment is the anisotropic counterpart um i think uh they overlap because i think that
*  um
*  empowerment is a way of um inspiring emergence i think emergence does not happen without
*  empowerment but empowerment can happen without emergence do you think of emergence as the loss
*  of control like when you're thinking about these capsules and then the things they create
*  is emergence the thing that is uh not a desirable conclusion i love that question because
*  to some of us the loss of control is control in design we're used to like extreme levels of
*  control over form and the shape of a thing and how it behaves and how it functions and that's
*  something we've inherited from the industrial revolution but with nature there is this um
*  there's this diversity that happens without necessarily having a reward function right this
*  is good or bad things just happen and some of them happen to have wings and some of them happen to
*  have scales and you know you end up with this incredible potential um for diversity so i think
*  the future of of design is in that soft control is in the ability to design highly controlled
*  systems that enable and that enable the loss of control and creativity is very much part of this
*  because creativity is all about letting go and beginning again and beginning again beginning
*  again and when you cannot let go you cannot be creative and you can't you can't you can't
*  find novelty but i think that letting go is a moment that enables empowerment agency creativity
*  emergence and they're all connected they are sort of associate themselves with definition of
*  destiny or the inevitable a good friend of mine shared with me elegant definition of
*  which is the ratio of of who you are and and who you want to be
*  ratio of who you are who you want to be exactly and that sort of ends up defining you yeah and
*  those tools i think when when when when you let go you sort of find you you give peace to your will
*  right to a sense of will and and and so i think that's very very important in design but also
*  in life she said this fate is the ratio of who you are you want to be who you want to be do
*  do you think there's something to this whole manifestation thing like focusing on a vision
*  of what you want the world to become and in in that focusing you manifest it like paula
*  koelow said in the alchemist when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to
*  achieve it is there something to that i think so yes and i always think of you know what i do as
*  this the culmination of energy information and matter and how to direct energy information and
*  matter in the design of a thing or in the design of a life i think living is very much a process of
*  channeling these energies to where they need to go i think that the manifestation or part of that
*  manifestation is the pointing to the moon in order to get to the moon and and and that's why
*  manifestation is also directional it has that vector quality to it that that i think of agency
*  as have you uh in your own life has there been things you've done where you kind of direct
*  that energy information and matter in a way that opens up new possibilities yeah i mean you've also
*  said somewhere i'm probably misquoting that uh you're you're you're many things you and
*  erie are many things and you become new things every 10 years or so oh i did say that somewhere
*  somewhere that every decade you've sort of switched that was an old that was a previous
*  scenario that said that yeah i i did say some time ago that you have to sort of reboot reboot
*  every 10 years um to to keep creative and keep inventive and and keep fresh is there are things
*  you've done in your life were just kind of uh doors opened i think everything everything
*  uh everything good i've found in my life has been found in that way of um
*  letting go and suspending my sense of disbelief and often you will find me say to the team
*  suspend your disbelief i don't care that this is impossible let's assume it is where does it take
*  us and that suspension of disbelief is absolutely part and parcel of the creative act
*  um you know i did so when um i was in medical school i was in hadassah and in the hebrew university
*  and um i remember i left medical school for architecture the day my grandmother passed away
*  and that was a moment of relief and that was a moment a door that was closing that opened other
*  opportunities um but that of course required letting go of the great vision of becoming a
*  doctor and letting go of the dream of you know being surrounded by wonderful patients and the
*  science of medicine and the research associated with that science and letting go of that dream
*  to accomplish another um and and and it has happened throughout my life in in different ways
*  MIT was another experience like that where people pointed at me as you know the designer
*  for whom the academic currency is not necessarily the citation index and of course in order to get
*  tenure at MIT you have to look at the citation index but for me it was not that it was manifesting
*  our work in shows and writing papers and writing patents and creating a celebration around the work
*  and i never saw a distinction and you know between those ways of being i also think that another um
*  kind of way of being or a modality of being that i found helpful is and victor frankl wrote this
*  incredible book man's search for meaning after the holocaust and he writes different people
*  pursue life for for different reasons according to freud the the goal of life is to find pleasure
*  and and according to adler it's you know to find power and um and for victor frankl it was about
*  finding meaning and when you let go of the titles and the discipline and the discipline of the
*  titles and the disciplines and the boundaries and the expectations and the perception you you are
*  elevated to this really special yeah spiritual but definitely very very creative plane where you you
*  can sort of start anew and look at the world through the lens of a bacterium or a robot or
*  or you know or look at ecology through the lens of chemistry and look at chemistry through the
*  lens of robotics and look at robotics through the lens of you know microbial ecologies and so on and
*  so forth and and i feel that kind of rebooting um not every 10 years but every minute every breath
*  is very very important for a creative life and for for just maintaining this fresh mind
*  to reboot reboot to begin again with every breath begin again and and that can be confusing for some
*  right for my team members you know i i like to change my mind it's who i am it's how i think
*  it's how i operate you know and and and they'll come and and we found another technique or another
*  technology that's interesting and we thought that you know that we were working on this
*  functionalized fragrance but now there's another opportunity and let's go there and to me
*  i would much rather you know live life like if i had to pick sort of my favorite broadway show
*  to enter and live through it would be into the woods it's not a specific fairy tale it's not
*  you know the sleeping beauty or or or little red riding hood or rapunzel it's all of them it's
*  sort of moving into the forest and seeing this wonder and getting close and learning about that
*  and then moving to another wonder and life is really about tying all of these
*  little fairy tales together uh in work and and also in life unafraid to leap into the unknown
*  unafraid to leap into the unknown speaking of mit you got a tenure at mit and then you leaped
*  to new york and started a new company that with a vision that doesn't span a couple of years but
*  centuries i did it was my destiny to start a company and and do i have mornings when i wake
*  up and i ask myself what the hell am i doing yes i i have those mornings what do you do with those
*  mornings by the way i embrace them and i i find gratitude and i say to myself thank goodness i
*  i'm so lucky to you know to have the the the ability to be frustrated in this way
*  so i really really embrace these frustrations and i and i i take them i wrap them in a bubble
*  and i look at it you know on the outside of my my uh uh aware mind um and and i laugh at them i
*  smile at them if i could return actually to the question of beauty for a second i forgot to ask
*  you something you mentioned imperfection in the death masks what role does imperfection play in
*  our conception of beauty what role does imperfection play in um in nature there's a
*  there's this japanese aesthetics concept of wabi-sabi which basically uh embraces imperfection
*  nothing lasts nothing is finished and nothing is perfect what do you think of that i totally
*  agree that change is the only permanence that imperfection is there if only to to signal
*  that we are part of a bigger thing than ourselves that that we are on a journey that that were
*  that things are in movement um and if they were perfect of course when things are perfect it is
*  just so boring we end up with stereotypes and as humans but i think just in general as living
*  beings we're here to find meaning and that meaning cannot be found without struggle and without
*  seeking to not to perfect but to build to work to build towards something better
*  um when i was a child my mother who who i love so much always explained to me how important it is
*  to fall and to fail and to fight and to argue and um and that there is a way that there is a culture
*  to to to to failing and and and to imperfection um so i i think it is it is uh
*  necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect and it is a sign that it is a sign of nature
*  because nothing in nature is perfect what about human relations you mentioned finding love
*  are the flaws in humans the imperfection in humans a component of love like what
*  role do you think the the flaws play it's a that's a really profound question i think
*  the flaws are there uh to
*  to
*  the flaws are there to present a vulnerability and those flaws are um are
*  um a sign of those vulnerabilities and i think love is very very gentle right love
*  um with bill we often talk about between the two of us about what drives all human behavior and for
*  him it's incentive as you might expect and he will repeat this sentence to me oh incentive drives all
*  human behavior but i i would say to me it's love love very much so um and and i think flaws are
*  part of that because flaws are a sign of that vulnerability whether physical whether emotional
*  vulnerability and those vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities they either tear us apart or
*  they bring us together and the vulnerability is what is the glue i think i think that the
*  vulnerability enables connection the connection is the glue and that connection enables accessing
*  higher ground as a community as opposed to as an individual so if there is a society over the mind
*  or if there are higher levels of awareness that can be accessed um in community as opposed to
*  again going to the silkworm as opposed to on the individual level i think that those occur through
*  the flaws and the vulnerabilities and without them we we cannot find connection community
*  and without community we can't build what we have built as a civilization you know for the
*  past hundreds of thousands of years so i think not only are they beautiful but they have a functional
*  role in in building civilizations yeah there's a sense in which love requires vulnerability and
*  maybe love is the leap into that vulnerability and i think yes i think a flaw think about it like
*  physically i'm thinking about a brick that's flawed but in a way the the i think of a flaw
*  is it is an increased surface area that's a good line that's a good line a surface area that like
*  physically or emotionally right it sort of introduces this whole new dimension to a human
*  or a brick and because you have more surface area you can you know use mortar and build a home and
*  and yeah i think of it as accessing this additional dimension of surface area that could be used for
*  good or bad right to to to connect to communicate to collaborate it makes me think of that quote
*  from this incredible movie i've watched years ago
*  particle fever i think it was called documentary about the large hydrant collider an incredible
*  film where they talk about the things that are least important for our survival are the things
*  that make us human like the pure romantic act or you know the the notion of and and victor
*  frankel talks about that too he talks about feeling the sun on his arms as he's as he is
*  working the soil in two degrees fahrenheit with without clothes and
*  the officer berates him and says what have you done have you been a businessman before you came
*  here to the camp and he says i was a doctor and he said you you must have made a lot of money as
*  a doctor and he said i all all my work i've done for free i've been helping the poor but he keeps
*  his he keeps his humility and he keeps his modesty and he keeps his preservation of the spirit
*  and he says the things that actually make him able to or made him able to outlive the the terrible
*  experience in the holocaust was the the really cherishing this moment when the sun hits his
*  skin or when he can eat a a grain of rice a single grain of rice so i think
*  i think cherishing is a very important part of um living a meaningful life being able to
*  cherish those simple things like to notice them and to to notice them to pay attention to them
*  in the moment and i i do this now more than ever i mean there is some the bukowski has this poem i
*  like called nirvana where it tells a story of a young man on a bus going through like north
*  carolina or something like this and they stop off in a cafe and he has this there's a waitress and
*  just he talks about that he notices the magic something indescribable just knows it's the magic
*  of it and he gets back on the bus with the rest of the passengers and none of them seem to have
*  noticed the magic and i think if you just allow yourself to pause and just to feel whatever that
*  is maybe maybe ultimately it's a kind of gratitude yes for i don't know what it is it's just that
*  i'm sure it's just chemicals in the brain but it's just so incredible to be alive yes and
*  noticing that yes appreciating that and being one in that with others yes yes and and that goes back
*  to you know to the fireplace right to the first technology what was the first technology it was
*  fire first technology to have built community and it emerged out of a vulnerability of wanting to
*  stay away from the cold and be warm together and of course that fire is associated with not only
*  with comfort and the ability to form you know biorelevant nutrients in our food and
*  and provide heat and comfort but also spirits and a kind of a way to enter
*  you know to enter a spiritual moment to enter a moment that can only be experienced
*  as as in a community as a as a form of a meditative moment there is a lot to be said about light
*  light is i think an important part of these moments of i think i think it's a real thing
*  i i really truly believe that we're born with an with a with an aura surface area
*  that is measurable i think we're we're born into the world with that you know with a
*  with an aura and um and how do we channel that is really is sort of ends i mean
*  and ends up sort of defining you know defining the light in our lives do you think we're all
*  do you think we're all lonely do you think there's loneliness in us humans oh yes yes loneliness is
*  part yes i think we all have that loneliness whether we're willing to access that loneliness
*  and look at it in the eye or completely um you know completely avoid it or deny it it's like
*  it feels like it's a some kind of foundation for longing and longing leads to this this combination
*  of vulnerability and connection with others yes it feels like that's a really important part of
*  being human is being lonely very it's very we are born into this world alone again being alone and
*  being lonely are two different things right and you can be together but be lonely and you can be
*  alone but not be lonely at all we often joke bill and i that um he he cannot be lonely he cannot
*  deal with being by himself he always needs people around him and i strive long must have creative
*  solitude must find pockets of solitude and loneliness in order to find creativity and
*  reconnect with myself so loneliness is a recipe for um for community in my opinion and i think
*  those things complement each other and they're synergetic absolutely the yin and yang of of
*  of of togetherness and they allow you i think to yeah to reset and to tune in to
*  to that ratio we talked about of who you are and who you want to be if you if you go to this place
*  of creative solitude what's your what's your creative process is there something you've noticed
*  about what you do that leads to your to good work i love to be able not only to lose focus but kind
*  of to focus on the peripheral view and to allow um different things to occur at once so i will
*  often in my loneliness journeys i will often uh listen to like lennard bernstein anything i can
*  find online by lennie bernstein it's reading a nature paper it's war and peace it's really
*  revisiting all the texts that are so timeless for me with opportunities that are very very timely
*  and i think for me the creative process is really about bringing timeless problems or concepts
*  together with timely technologies to observe them i remember when we did the mandela pavilion we read
*  moby dick the whiteness of the whale the albino the different the other and that got us to work
*  on melanin and and melanin also is sort of an output from the death mass so it's lots of things
*  happening at the same time and really allowing them allowing them to come together to form this
*  view about the world through the lens of a spirit being or a living being or a material
*  and then focus on the world through the lens of that material the glass work was another project
*  like that where we were fascinated by glass because obviously it's superb material for
*  architecture but we created this new glass printing technology for the first time that
*  was shedding light on the biomechanics of fluid glass with the math and the physics of which was
*  never done before which was so exciting to us but revealing new knowledge about the world through
*  technology that's one theme the reincarnation between things material and immaterial that's
*  another theme lennie bernstein war and peace tolstoy you've uh you tweeted a tolstoy quote
*  from war and peace as of course you would everything i know i know because of love yeah i
*  love this quote so you use these kind of inspirations uh to focus you and then find the
*  actual idea in the periphery yes and then connect them with whatever it is that we're working on
*  whether it's you know high throughput directed evolution of bacteria
*  you know whether it's you know recreating that garden of eden in the capsule and what it looks
*  like the food of the future it is a little bit like directing a film creating a new
*  project is a bit like creating a film and you have these heroes you have these characters and
*  you put them together and there is a narrative and there is a story whenever we start a new project
*  it has to have these these ingredients of simultaneous complexity it has to be novel
*  in terms of the synthetic biology material science robotics engineering all of these elements that are
*  discipline based or rooted must be novel if you can combine novelty in synthetic biology with a
*  novelty in robotics with a novelty in material science with a novelty in computational design
*  and you are bound to create something novel period and that's how i run the company and that's how i
*  pick the people and so that's another very very important ingredient of the cutting edge across
*  multiple disciplines that come together and then in the background in the periphery there's all
*  these messages the whispers of the ancient foldies right the bethovans and the picasso's
*  and beithoven's always whispering to you yeah how could one not include bethovan and the whispers
*  i'm gonna ask you about beithoven and the afghani kiss and you've mentioned because i'm
*  i've played piano my whole life i've obviously know a lot of beithoven um and it's one of the
*  private things for me i suppose because i don't think i've ever publicly played piano by the way
*  me too i mean i play in private only yeah yeah people sometimes even with guitar people ask me
*  well can you play something and it just feels like certain things are meant to be done privately
*  yeah it's weird i mean it's a it's a difficult and some of the times i have performed publicly
*  uh it is an ultimate leap in vulnerability it's very very very difficult for me and i'm sure it's
*  i know it's not for a lot of people but it is for me anyway we'll return to that but
*  since you've mentioned combination of novelty across multiple disciplines and that's what you seek
*  when you when you build teams or pick people you work with i just wanted to kind of linger on this
*  idea of what kind of humans are you looking for in this endeavor that you're taking on this
*  fascinating thing that you've been talking about one of the things somewhere else a previous version
*  version 5.7 of nary said somewhere that there's four fields that are combined to create this
*  intersection of biology and engineering work in is computational design additive manufacturing
*  material engineering synthetic biology i'm sure there's others but how do you how do you find these
*  humans machine learning is in the mix i manifest and they come um yeah there are a few approaches
*  they show up okay um you know send your message upon the water i mean those job descriptions that
*  you saw the first ones i wrote by myself and you find interesting people and brilliant people when
*  you look we talked about second derivative when you look under and under and under and if you
*  look deep enough and specialized enough and if you allow yourself to look at the cracks at the flaws
*  at the the cracks between disciplines and between scales you find really really interesting
*  diamonds in the rough and so i i i like for the those job descriptions to
*  yeah to be those messages in a bottle that bring those really interesting people our way
*  um i mean they have to have humility they have to have a shine in their eye they have to be hungry
*  and foolish this job so famously said a friend of mine um who's a dean of a well-known architectural
*  school said you know today architects don't want to be architects architects don't look up to the
*  star architects as role models star architects are no longer role models architects want to
*  build by virtue of not building right architects want she said we're back in the 60s when we think
*  about architecture back in the hippie movement i think i think that in a way um they have to be
*  somewhat of a hippie somewhat of a kind of a jack of all trades master of all
*  and yet with humility and yet with humility now that is hard to find and that is why
*  you know when i start an interview i talk about childhood memories and i asked about music and i
*  ask about connection and through these interviews you can learn a lot about a person's future
*  by spending time hearing them talk about their past do you find that educational back like uh
*  phd's versus like what's the life trajectory yours is an interesting life trajectory too
*  like uh what's the life trajectory that leads to the kind of person that would work with you
*  um it's you know people who have um ideally had industry experience and know what it's like to be
*  in the quote-unquote real world they're dreamers that are addicted to reality as opposed to realists
*  that are addicted to dreams meaning they have that innocence in them they have the hunger
*  they have the idealism without um being entitled and with understanding the systems that govern
*  our world and understanding how to utilize these systems as torches and horses to bring those
*  values into the world there are individuals who are feel comfortable in this friction between
*  um between you know highly wondrous and dreamy and incredible
*  fantasy renditions of what the world could be with extremely um and extremely brilliant
*  skills in terms of their disciplinary background so phd with industrial experience in a certain
*  field or a double major and two fields that make no sense whatsoever in their combination
*  are things that really really attract me and especially that span this the technology biology
*  yes technology biology nature culture i mean the secret to one thing is through the lens of another
*  and i always believe in that kind of translational design ability to be able to see something through
*  the lens of another and always allows you to think again begin again reestablish redefine
*  suspend your disbelief revisit um and when you revisit enough times like a hundred times or
*  like 200 times and you revisit the same question through the lens of any possible discipline and
*  any possible scenario you you find you get eventually you get to the truth i have to ask you
*  because you work at the interplay of uh the machine and the natural world
*  is there a good definition for you of what is life what is a living organism
*  i think like 440 million years ago there were all these plants that um
*  um the cyanobacteria i believe actually that that god that that was like the first extinction
*  right there were six five extinctions we are apparently the sixth that we are in the eye of
*  the storm we are in the sixth extinction we are going to be extinct as we speak i mean death is
*  upon us whether we want to admit it or not and actually they found in argentina and in in you
*  know various places around the world they found these spores of the first plants that existed on
*  the planet and they emerged out of these cyanobacteria were the first of course and then
*  they found these spore-based plants and because they didn't have seeds or only spores the spores
*  became sort of the fossils by which we've come to known of their existence and because of these
*  spores we know that this first extinction existed but this extinction is actually what enabled
*  plants to resurrect right so the death of these first plants because they clinked to the rocks and
*  they they generated a ton of phosphorus that went into the ocean by clinging to the rocks like 60
*  times more phosphorus than without them and then all this phosphorus basically choked the oceans
*  and made them super cold and a without oxygen aoxic and then and then we lost the plant kingdom
*  and then because of the death of these first plants they actually enriched the soil and created
*  nutrients for these new plants to come to the planet and those planets had like more sophisticated
*  vein systems and they were moving beyond spores to seeded plants etc and flowering plants and so in a
*  way you one mass extinction sort of led in in the the ordovician period sort of led to life as we
*  know it and where would we be without plants in a way so i i think that death is very much part of
*  life and through that definition that kind of planetary wide definition in the context of
*  hundreds of millions of years life gains a completely new sort of a new light and that's
*  where that's when the particles become a wave right where humans are we are not alone and we
*  are here because of those plants right so i think death is is very much part of life so in the
*  context of you know the redwood tree perhaps you know life is defined as
*  10 generations and through the lens of a bacteria perhaps life is defined as
*  a millisecond and perhaps through the lens of of an aegi life is defined as all of human
*  civilization and so i think it really is a question of um this time scale again the time scale and
*  the organism the life form that's asking the question through which we can answer what is
*  life what do you think about this since you're if we think of ourselves as in the eye of the storm
*  of another extinction the the natural question to ask here is you have all all of nature and
*  then you have this new human creation that is currently being termed artificial intelligence
*  how does your work play with the possibility of of a future super intelligent ecosystem
*  and aegi that either joins or supersedes humans yeah um so i'm glad you asked this question
*  and are you hopeful or terrified both i'm hopeful and terrified i did watch your interview
*  your interview with ellie azari udkowski and i loved it because you were scared or because
*  you were excited or because there was first of all i was both i i was i totally scared
*  shamed excited and totally also inspired because he's just such an incredible thinker
*  and and i can agree or disagree with what he says but i just found his way of thinking about aegi
*  um and the perils of humanity as a result there's an inevitability to what he's saying his advice
*  to young people is that prepare for a short life yeah he thinks it's very almost simple
*  it's almost common sense that aegi would get rid of humans that he can't imagine a trajectory
*  eventually that leads to a place that doesn't have aegi kill all humans there's just too many
*  trajectories where a super intelligent systems gets rid of humans and in the near term and so
*  that clarity of thinking is very sobering to me it's maybe it is to you as well it's super
*  inspiring because i think he's wrong but it's like you you almost want to prove him wrong
*  it's like no we humans are clever bunch we're gonna find a way it is a bit like jumping into
*  super cold water it's sort of a kind of a fist in your face it wakes you up and i like these moments
*  so much um and and he was able to bring that moment to life even though i think a mother can
*  never think that way ever um and and it's a little bit like that that notion of i i love her more than
*  evolution requires on your question about aegi and nature look i i think we've been through a lot
*  in terms of to to to get here we sort of moved from data right the ability to collect information
*  to knowledge the ability to use this information for utility from knowledge to intelligence and
*  what is intelligence is the ability to problem solve and adapt and translate so that sort of
*  from from data to information to knowledge i think the next frontier is wisdom
*  and what is wisdom wisdom is the ability to have or find insight about the world and from wisdom
*  to spiritual awareness which is sort of transcends wisdom and is able to chart the world into new
*  territory but i think what is interesting about aegi is that it is sort of almost like a self
*  recursive thing right because it's like a washing machine of like a third derivative wikipedia it
*  uses kind of like language to create language to create language to create language it feels like
*  novelty is being constantly created i don't i don't it doesn't feel like it's regurgitating
*  and that's so fascinating because you know these are not the stochastic parrots this is sort of a
*  new form of emergence perhaps of uh of of novelty as you say that exists by virtue of
*  using old things to create new things um um but it's not as if the aegi has self-awareness right
*  it's not as if it has maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe it has but as far as i can tell it's not
*  as if aegi has approached consciousness or sentience just yet it it's it's probably getting
*  there but the language appears to present itself as if as if there is sentience there but it doesn't
*  but i think that's the problem at the point where this aegi sounds like me and speaks like me and
*  behaves like me and feels like me and breathes like me and my daughter knows the aegi to be me
*  is sort of the end of and the end of everything right is the end of human agency but what is the
*  end of human agency to humans i think is the beginning of agency to nature because if you
*  take all of this agency if you take all of these language models that can summarize all of human
*  civilization and consciousness and then upload that to nature and have nature now deal with that
*  world of consciousness that it never had access to so maybe through eliezer's lens the sort of
*  short-lived human becomes sort of a very long-lived human like sentient weeping willow maybe maybe
*  that's the end and the beginning and and and and maybe um on the more optimistic side uh for us
*  humans um it's a different form of existence where everything we create and everything we
*  consume and everything we process is all made out of six uh you know six elements and that's it and
*  there's only those six elements and not 118 elements and um and and it's all the stuff of
*  biology plus some you know fair amount of bits bits genes and atoms well i think the idea a lot
*  of beithoven a lot of beithoven i think the idea of connecting aegi to nature through your work is
*  really fascinating sort of uh unlocking this incredible machinery of intelligence that is aegi
*  and connecting it to the incredible machinery of wisdom that is nature has evolved through
*  billions of years a pretty crazy intense evolution exactly and unlike sort of again i'm going back to
*  directed evolution unlike um this sort of high throughput brute force approach if there is a
*  way to utilize this synergy for diversity and diversification like like yeah how like what
*  happens if you ask a chat gpt question but it takes 10 000 years to answer that question like
*  what does that look like right when you like completely switch the time scale um and you
*  can afford the time to answer the question and again i i don't know but but that world to me is
*  possibly amazing do you think there's uh because when you start to think about time scales like
*  this just looking at earth all the possible trajectories in my take of this living organism
*  that is earth do you think there's others like it do you think there's other planets with life
*  forms on them that are just doing their thing in this kind of way because you're in what you're
*  doing you're you're directly playing with what's possible with life life-like things that kind of
*  maps the question of well what kind of other things are possible elsewhere do you think um
*  there's other worlds full of life full of alien life out there i've studied the calculations
*  that point you know towards the um verdict that the possibility of life in you know in in around
*  us is is very very low we are a chosen planet in a way right there's water and there's love what else
*  do you need um and and and that sort of very peculiar juxtaposition of conditions the oxygen
*  the water the carbon um again is is is in a way a miracle given the um massive extinctions that we've
*  been through um as life forms and that said i cannot believe that there is no other life form i i want
*  to believe um more than i know that that yes that there are life forms in you know in the white
*  fountain that is the black hole right that that there are these life forms that are um you know
*  light years away from us and that are that are forming other forms of life forces
*  i'm much more worried about probably the thing that you're working on which is that there's all
*  kinds of life out around us that we're not communicating with yes so there's aliens
*  in a sense all around us that we're not seeing they were not talking to they were not communicating
*  yeah because that to me just seems the more likely situation that they're here that they're here
*  they're all around us in different forms that that there is a connection like there's a thing
*  that connects all of us all of living beings across the universe and like we're not we're
*  just beginning to understand any of it and i feel like that's the important problem is i feel like
*  you can get there with the tools of science today by just studying life on earth unlock some really
*  fundamental things that maybe you can start to answer questions about what is consciousness
*  maybe this thing that we've been saying about love but in this honestly in a serious way
*  and then you'll start to understand that that there is alien life all out there and it's much
*  more complicated and interesting than we kind of realize as we still look into human like
*  exactly human like things it's the variety of life that's possible it's just almost endless
*  i totally agree with you i i think again define alien right yeah define intelligence define life
*  right and marvin minsky used to say intelligence is a suitcase word right it's a word so big it's
*  a word like sustainability and it's a word like you know rock and roll and suitcase words are
*  always very very dangerous speaking of rock and roll you've mentioned music and you mentioned
*  baithoven a bunch of times you've also tweeted about you getting kissed and performance and so on
*  what what can you say about the role of music in your life i love music i always wondered why is
*  it that plastic arts meaning architecture and sculpture and painting can't get us to cry and
*  music gets us to cry so quickly and connect so quickly there is something about music that it is
*  and no wonder that plants also respond to music but that that is the top of the creative pyramid
*  in in my opinion and it's a weird mystery that we're so connected to music well by the way to
*  push back a good bridge will make me cry a good arch it's true and i i i will say uh when i visited
*  the sagrada familia i had that kind of spiritual reverence towards that spatial experience and
*  being in that space and feeling the the intention in the space and appreciating every little gesture
*  so it's true this is the universal language it's it's the language of waves right it's the language
*  of the waves not the language of the particles it is the universal language i believe and and that
*  is definitely one of my one of my loves and you said that if you weren't doing what you were doing
*  now perhaps you would be a film director so i have to ask what uh what do you think is the best film
*  of all time maybe top uh top three yeah maybe the godfather godfather okay the godfather is
*  is definitely up there francis coppola is one of my heroes have you met him i have met him yes yes
*  yes i i was very very lucky we were very lucky uh to work with him on his new film megalopolis
*  which is coming out i hope in 2024 and think about the cities of the future in in the context of new
*  materials and the unity between nature and culture godfather is definitely up there
*  2001 is up there i would watch that film again and again and again it's incredible
*  the last scene in odyssey 2001 that's um just watch the last scene of 2001 then listen to
*  udakovsky and then sort of and then go to the garden and that's pretty much you know the end
*  in the beginning but that scene that last scene from 2001 is everything it says so much with so
*  little and it leaves it's sort of the embodiment i believe of ambivalence and
*  there's opportunity to believe in the beginning of humankind the end of humankind the planet
*  child star or star child of the future was there a death was there an reincarnation
*  um you know that that final scene to me is something that i go back to and and study and
*  every time there is a different reading of that scene that inspires me so that that scene it's
*  just and then the first scene in the godfather still one of the best scenes of all times sort
*  of a portrait of america the ideals and values that are brought from italy and a family of loyalty
*  of uh of values of how different values are constructed yes loyalty and and and the human
*  spirit and how copula celebrates the human spirit through the most simple gestures in language and
*  acting and i think in in kubrick you see this highly curated and controlled and manicured
*  um vision of creating a film and with with francis it's it's like an italian feast it's like
*  anything anything can happen at any moment in time and just being on the set with him is um
*  is an experience i'll take with me to my grave it's it's very very very special and you said
*  music is also part of that of creating a feeling in the movies yeah actually the the godfather
*  um that tune that makes me like emotional every time on some weird level yeah it's one of these
*  tunes i'm sure that has um you know if you play it to to a jasmine you'll get the best scent of all
*  times i think like there's but i think with that particular tune i learned staccato that that that
*  something very very happy and joyous and then made into this stretched in time and became
*  kind of the refrain of nostalgia and melancholy and loyalty and all of these values that ride
*  on top of this one single tune you can play in all kinds of different ways i've played on guitar in
*  all kinds of different ways and i think in godfather three the son plays it on guitar to the
*  father i think this happens in movies but sometimes a melody and that's a simple melody can just like
*  and the strouse melody in 2001 and when you juxtapose these um these melodies with the scene
*  you get this again whole that's bigger than some of its parts where you get this moment that is i
*  think like these are the moments i would send you know with the next voyager to outer space
*  i definitely sent the godfather and in 2001 would definitely be beyond that um golden record you are
*  an incredibly successful scientist engineer architect artist designer you've mentored a
*  lot of successful people can you give advice to young people listening to this how to have a
*  successful career and how to have a successful life look i i think there's this beautiful line
*  in sheltering sky how many times have you seen a full moon and um in your life and actually took
*  the time to ingest and explore and reflect upon the full moon probably 20 i believe he says um i
*  i spend time with a full moon i take my time with a full moon and i pay attention to a full moon
*  and i think paying attention to the seasons and taking time to appreciate
*  um the little things the simple things is what makes a meaningful life
*  uh i i was very lucky to have had you know to have grown up in a home that um
*  taught me this way of being my my parents my grandmother who played a very important role
*  in in my growing up um and and that ability to pay attention and to be present is so so so so i
*  could not emphasize it enough is so crucial um and be grateful and be grateful yeah i think
*  gratitude and presence um appreciation are really um the the the most important things in life
*  if you could take a short tangent about your grandmother
*  who's played a big role in your life what uh what do you remember what what lessons have you learned
*  from her she had this blanket that she would give me every time i came back from school and say
*  you know do your homework here and and meet with your friends here and it was always in her garden
*  and her garden in my mind was ginormous but when i you know last i went there uh and saw the site
*  which has now become the site for another tall building it was a tiny tiny little garden um
*  that that to me seemed so large when when i was um growing up because it it had everything it had
*  um it had fig trees it had olive trees it had mushrooms it had the blanket i would do my homework
*  there it was everything and i needed nothing nothing else and um and and that was my garden
*  of eden that was my childhood being and she taught me you know you know we would lie on the
*  blanket and look at the clouds and reflect upon the shapes of the clouds and study the shapes of
*  the plants and there was a lot of wonder in that childhood um with her and and she taught me the
*  the importance of wonder uh in in sort of in an eternal childhood and and living uh adulthood as
*  as a child and and so i i'm very very grateful for that i think it is the sense of wonder
*  um the uh um speaking up was always something that she adhered to to speak up your truth
*  to be straightforward um to be positive that these are things that i also got from my mom um
*  and for my mom the sense of humor she she had the best sense of humor of uh that that i could think
*  of and and was just um just a joy to be around and and and my father taught me everything my
*  father taught me everything i know my mom taught me everything i feel that's a good way to put it
*  my grandma taught me everything i insight well i i see the sense of wonder that just carries
*  through everything you do so i i think you would you make your grandmother proud uh well what about
*  advice for how to have a career so you've had a very interesting career
*  and a successful career but not not an easy one you took you took a few leaps i did take a few
*  leaps and they were uncomfortable my father and i'll never um forget i think we were like listening
*  to a rolling stone song in the kitchen and my dad was actually born in boston he's american
*  he said uh i i started to have sort of these second thoughts about continuing my education
*  in israel and i wanted to you know go i i was on my way to london to the architectural association
*  to do my diploma studies there and he looked at me and he said get out of here kiddo you got to
*  get out of here and you know you've outgrown where where you're at you need to you need to move
*  forward another thing he had taught me um the feeling of discomfort as you as you say the
*  feeling of loneliness and discomfort is is is imperative to growth growth is painful period
*  any form of growth is difficult and painful birth is difficult and painful um and and it is really
*  really important to place yourself in situations of discomfort i like to be in a room where everyone
*  in the room is more intelligent than me i like to be in those in that kind of state where the
*  people that i surround myself with are orders of magnitude more intelligent than i am and i can
*  say that that is true of all of my team members and that's the intellectual discomfort that i feed
*  off of the same is true for for physical exertion um you got to put yourself in these uncomfortable
*  um situations in order to grow in order to find comfort um and then on the other hand
*  is is love is finding finding love and finding that um you know that human this other human that
*  complements you and that makes you a better version of the one you are and even of the one
*  you want to be but with gratitude and and attention and love you can go so so far to the
*  younger generation i don't speak of a career i never thought of um my work as my career ever
*  and there was this constant entanglement between life and work and love and longing and being and
*  mothering it's all the same and uh i appreciate that to some people that doesn't work in their
*  you know in in their arrangement of of will versus um comfort uh versus the reality but for me it
*  has always worked so i i think to the younger generation i i say don't think of your career
*  a career is something that is imposed upon you think of your calling that's something that's
*  innately and directionally um moves you and it's something that transcends a career similarly
*  you can think about the difference between you know learning versus being educated being educated
*  something that's given to you that's external that's being imposed that's top down imposed
*  this learning is something that comes from within also the difference between joy and happiness
*  many times i'm sad and i'm still joyous and it's very very important to understand the difference
*  between these externally perceived success uh paths and internally driven value-based
*  you know ways of being in the world and we together when when we combine all of these
*  you know all of these uh uh the broken puzzle let's say of of of substance and um vulnerability
*  we get this bigger this wondrous world of a future that is is is peaceful that is uh um
*  that you know that is wholesome and that that you know that proposes or you know advocates for that
*  kind of synergy that we've been talking about throughout but it's all fun uh well thank you
