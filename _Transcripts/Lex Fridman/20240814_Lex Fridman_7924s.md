# Craig Jones Jiu Jitsu, $2 Million Prize, CJI, ADCC, Ukraine & Trolling  Lex Fridman Podcast #439
**Lex Fridman:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7aiEwp1x9k)
*  So I like to, to, uh, match looks from time to time in an homage.
*  You look sexy.
*  How many legs did you break in Eastern Europe?
*  Three or four.
*  To send a message or just for your own personal enjoyment?
*  If she wins, I'll personally give her a million dollars.
*  If I can footlock her, we're going to collaborate together in an OnlyFans sex tape.
*  Did she agree to this?
*  She shook on it.
*  You do have an OnlyFans channel.
*  Is that still up?
*  After August 17th, it's going to be fire.
*  It's going to be on fire.
*  Honestly, when we talk about secret investor, I think that could fund the entire tournament.
*  I missed all that.
*  What gives you hope?
*  That you can still make fun of anything as long as it's funny.
*  The following is a conversation with Craig Jones, martial artist, world traveler, and
*  one of the funniest people in the sport of submission grappling.
*  While he does make fun of himself a lot, he is legitimately one of the greatest
*  submission grapplers in the world.
*  And underneath the veil of nonstop sexualized Aussie humor and incessant online
*  trolling, he is truly a kindhearted human being who's trying to do good in the world.
*  Sometimes he does so through a bit of controversy and chaos, like with the new CJI
*  tournament that has over $2 million in prize money.
*  And it's coming up this Friday and Saturday.
*  Yes, the same weekend as the prestigious ADCC tournament.
*  The goal of CJI tournament is to grow the sport.
*  So you'll be able to watch it for free online, live on YouTube and other places.
*  All ticket profits go to charity, mainly to cancer research.
*  So I encourage you to support the mission of this tournament by buying tickets and
*  going to see the event in person.
*  Craig gave me a special link that gives you a 50% discount on the tickets.
*  Go to lexfreeman.com slash CJI and it should forward you to the right place.
*  They're trying to sell the last few tickets now.
*  It's a good cause.
*  Go buy some.
*  And also let me say as a fan of the sport, I highly encourage you to watch both CJI
*  and ADCC and to celebrate athletes competing in both from CJI with Nikki Ryan,
*  Nikki Rod, Rotola Brothers, Fionn Davis, Mackenzie Dern and more to ADCC with
*  Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Margoli, Giancarlo Bodoni, Rafael Lovato Jr., Mika Galvao
*  and more.
*  I have a lot of respect for everyone involved.
*  I train with many of them regularly and consider many of them friends, including
*  Craig, Gordon, and of course, John Donoher, who I will talk to many, many more
*  times on this podcast.
*  This is a Lex Freeman podcast.
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now dear friends, I invite you all to come to the pool with Craig Jones and me.
*  When you brought the $1 million in cash on Rogan's podcast, did you have security
*  with you?
*  We had security, but only by Joe Rogan's request, because he said, you're really
*  going to bring it.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have security?
*  I said, no.
*  He's like, don't worry about it.
*  I'll send my security.
*  So you were going to do without security.
*  Yeah.
*  We're going to win.
*  I thought, I mean, I was told not to tell anyone, but I sent pictures of it to
*  everyone I know.
*  Yeah.
*  So that was probably a security risk.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's just you in a car with a bag of cash.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a company that sponsors me, shuffle.com.
*  It was their friend, a friend of theirs.
*  So a guy that's never met me before just took the risk to show up to a stranger's
*  house with a million dollars in cash and bring to Joe Rogan.
*  It was a big risk of him.
*  And you just put it in the car and drove it.
*  Drove it over there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, no security except Joe.
*  Except Joe.
*  That's common sense.
*  And then Joe said he'd never seen a million dollars before.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't know if I believe him.
*  That's what everyone says.
*  That's what Pablo Escobar probably says also.
*  What's your relationship with risk, especially with the risk of death?
*  I would say I'm very risk averse.
*  You are.
*  No, you're not.
*  That's a lie.
*  Um, my relationship with risk.
*  I like a bit of excitement.
*  I like a bit of adventure.
*  I'm more about the adventure, but I will not let, um, the risk get in the way of it.
*  And also, obviously just got back from Ukraine.
*  I'm happy to take a few risks if it's part of what the locals want me to do.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like in Kazakhstan, we did some things that were dangerous.
*  Like if the locals are like, come along, join in on this activity, I feel
*  personally obligated to go with them.
*  So it's not about the risk.
*  Like you're not attracted to risk.
*  You're attracted to adventure and the risk is a thing, you know, give a damn
*  about if it comes along with it.
*  Sometimes the best adventures involve the most risk, unfortunately.
*  Speaking of which, you went to Ukraine, like you said, twice recently.
*  Twice really pushed the limit there.
*  Including to the front.
*  To the front.
*  Tell me the, uh, the full story of that from the beginning.
*  How did you end up in Ukraine?
*  So we're in Kazakhstan.
*  We're doing some filming in Kazakhstan and obviously Borat's do a very
*  traumatic memory for them.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of my jokes felt like they don't go as well in that neck of the woods.
*  So we had some difficulty filming out there.
*  So we filmed this horse game.
*  Have you ever heard of Cockbar?
*  Thanks to you.
*  Yes.
*  It's a game, a very, very old game.
*  They cut a, a goat or a sheep.
*  I didn't get too close to look at it, but they cut its head and legs off and they
*  use it as some form of bull.
*  And then they'll have like up to a thousand guys on horses.
*  Violently trying to pick this up and drop it in the other end's goals.
*  Basically the goals used to be concrete.
*  Now it's just a tarp, but local business owners will throw down huge amounts of
*  money for the winners and these horses have been trained from a very young age.
*  The riders have been trained.
*  I've never ridden a horse before.
*  We wanted to film something that made it look like I was going to go into the
*  horse pit, into the Cockbar pit.
*  However, the drunk stunt man that we used just decided that when he took my horse
*  reins, he would take me straight into the pit instead of ending the shot there.
*  So I was in there amongst, I guess the horse riders, the Cockbar riders,
*  and we weren't leaving.
*  We just were in there for quite a while and he was just, he could talk a little,
*  he could talk English pretty well actually.
*  And he's like, Oh, I thought you'd want to check it out from the inside.
*  And then while we're in there, someone picked up the sort of carcass and a wave
*  of horse riders came at me.
*  I was quite concerned at that point because they're bashing into each other.
*  And obviously they're angry.
*  They're seeing a foreigner in there.
*  I was wearing like basically biggie smalls, coogee, gecky looking sweater.
*  So I stood out.
*  They definitely didn't like that.
*  I was participating in a game that they probably trained their whole life for.
*  And that amount of money they could win is very, very significant.
*  And there's me in there.
*  They're also pointing out, bore out, bore out thinking I was making bore out jokes,
*  which again, very traumatic memory for the people of Kazakhstan.
*  Were you making bore out jokes?
*  No, but I guess it's the same type of humor, but just, I guess I'm not pretending
*  to be Kazakh, I'm just there being an idiot and enjoying the local culture.
*  But we're over there in Kazakhstan.
*  We did that.
*  That was obviously a bit risky.
*  Did they learn to love you?
*  I think they learned to love me and then to hate me again.
*  So it was like a bit of a all encompassing relationship for the Kazakh people.
*  But we, we basically abandoned ship.
*  It was proven too difficult to film some things, some sensitive subjects over there.
*  And I said, where should we go next?
*  And I just looked at the map and I was like, when you Ukraine, Ukraine was a place that
*  I've been offered a to teach a jujitsu seminar prior to, I guess, the war
*  commencing, the full scale war commencing.
*  And we're looking for a bit of adventure, something interesting to film.
*  So I'm following the news.
*  Obviously very controversial in the news.
*  People have very strong opinions.
*  And I was like, let's go over there.
*  Let's throw a charity event.
*  Let's do something.
*  Let's train with the people and really experience of ourselves.
*  So we set up a seminar turned out to be the biggest seminar for
*  jujitsu in Ukraine history, which is wild considering obviously they are at war.
*  But everyone came together to support it.
*  And one of the soldiers there, one of my friends, that good friend now
*  who's on the front line, he made a comment on there and he said, hey, like,
*  this is a seminar to donate profits to the soldiers, but we're on the front line.
*  And I was like, you know what?
*  I'll come to you.
*  And he's like, listen, I can't promise you'll survive, but I'll promise you
*  have a good time.
*  And I said, that's all I needed to hear.
*  So we connected and my friend, Roman, we went really, really close.
*  I think we were at the closest point, seven kilometers from the front line.
*  Obviously, very surreal experience to be over there, seeing basically how the
*  battles fought with all drones.
*  How long ago was this?
*  I think it would have been March or April.
*  So we went there.
*  We went, basically spent two nights up on the front line.
*  Went back to Kyiv and that was it for that trip in terms of crazy stuff
*  that happened, obviously, just the people living like you download
*  the air defense tracker.
*  So at any time there could be an air siren going off, an air alert on your phone
*  could be like drones heading your way.
*  Planes are in the air, missiles flying and then those missiles will change
*  direction and stuff.
*  So the air alert, you don't know if it's heading a different direction,
*  but they just sort of warn everyone.
*  So you live under a constant state of fear, basically.
*  And then on that first trip, the heaviest moment was I was going downstairs
*  in the hotel to work out, which is honestly a rare thing these days.
*  Something healthy with myself, you're working out, getting the gym,
*  pump some iron.
*  And this was divine intervention that a hypersonic missile was shot down
*  by the Patriot defense system just like five minutes from the hotel.
*  So the whole hotel and the attached gym just shook like crazy.
*  And people start some people started freaking out.
*  Most people went to leave to go outside, which I don't think is recommended.
*  But you want to see what's going on out there.
*  This was in Kyiv. This was in Kyiv.
*  So it got shot down.
*  And then some of the local troops actually took me to the site
*  of where just part of the missile had landed in the ground
*  and left this huge sort of indentation that already cleared up most of the,
*  I guess, shrapnel from the missile.
*  I don't know if I should or if I was legally allowed to do this,
*  but I took some of that missile back home with me.
*  I don't know where I left it, actually.
*  But I thought maybe that would raise some alarm bells and airport scans.
*  But I took I took it regardless.
*  And that was basically the craziest thing that happened on that first trip.
*  The Patriot defense system is incredible.
*  It's an incredible piece of technology that's from the United States.
*  It's expensive, but it's incredible.
*  And so that's protecting Kyiv.
*  That's protecting Kyiv. Yeah.
*  That was at the time where US hadn't voted to, I guess,
*  keep funding the weapons over there.
*  So it was kind of a tense moment because I think I don't know.
*  Everyone was thinking, like, when do those air defense missiles run out?
*  So that was a heavy moment for me thinking, look at what it shot out the sky.
*  Like, imagine if that didn't they didn't have that.
*  But we yeah, that was probably the most surreal moment.
*  But Kyiv, largely life goes on most of the time, as per normal.
*  I was faced with crazy messages and comments, even just posting that video
*  like I'm getting paid by Ukraine and stuff.
*  And it's just like.
*  People just don't understand that, like, life has to go on like Kyiv's here.
*  The front lines far away, like the cities have to largely try to operate as normal.
*  Or just life, life will not go on in those villages and cities.
*  Well, it's human nature as well.
*  It's not just Kyiv, it's Kharkiv, it's even Donbass,
*  Herson, people
*  get accustomed to work quickly as it's impossible to suffer for prolonged periods of time.
*  So you get you adjust and you appreciate the things you still have.
*  Yeah, some ball of moves out there.
*  I love seeing like people that just crazy stuff's going on from the war
*  and they don't even react to it.
*  They don't go to the bomb shelter.
*  It's like a ball of moves like I'm not going to change my lifestyle.
*  Actually, on that first trip as well, something else that I probably
*  shouldn't have been allowed to do was go to Chernobyl.
*  Yeah. So Chernobyl, I believe troops came through Belarus
*  and there was some fighting going on in Chernobyl.
*  I think the whole world got concerned at that point.
*  If any sort of radiation leaked.
*  But Chernobyl, as it stands, the troops back down
*  and it's completely covered in mines.
*  Very, very difficult to go to Chernobyl.
*  Basically, as a tourist or as like, I guess, an idiot like myself
*  should really probably not be allowed in a place like that.
*  But we were able to get there.
*  We passed like four security checkpoints.
*  It took two attempts.
*  First time we tried to go in there was with the special forces guy.
*  We cleared two security gates.
*  Then they stopped us and basically threatened us with arrest.
*  Rightfully so.
*  Really have no business going to Chernobyl.
*  We made a connection.
*  I won't say this connection was, but he had heard about what I had done
*  sort of with a charity event and open some doors for us
*  to be able to go to Chernobyl.
*  So we got to see, you know, we had some filming restrictions there
*  just because it was a crazy military sort of conflict at one point.
*  And we got to actually see Chernobyl.
*  Chernobyl has always been a dream of mine to see
*  because it's just such an interesting place.
*  And to see under these conditions, very, very strange.
*  Yeah, what was that like?
*  So there's no civilians there now.
*  It's just completely empty.
*  I guess it's kind of like the fantasy you have.
*  I imagine people going to Chernobyl back in the tourist days
*  when it was a tourist spot and it would be busy full of tourists.
*  We got basically a private tour, so we got to really feel
*  that abandoned sort of vibes.
*  I guess I was interested in it from Blank Hall of Duty
*  and then Chernobyl series, all the documentaries and stuff.
*  But very, very strange place to go visit.
*  And it is now a minefield, like a lot of parts of Ukraine.
*  That's one of the.
*  Dark, terrifying aspects of.
*  Wars, how many mines are left even when the war ends
*  for decades after this mines everywhere, because demining is extremely difficult.
*  And that is that could continually kill people.
*  I don't think it'll be a tourist spot for a very long time,
*  because if you were thinking about areas to de-mine when the conflict ends,
*  an area where if you accidentally trigger a mine could cause a radiation leak,
*  it's probably going to be very low on the list.
*  So tourism for Chernobyl, who knows how long until that returns?
*  What do you think you were able to to get to Chernobyl?
*  Is there's why?
*  Why don't you think
*  the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian soldiers don't see you as a threat?
*  Maybe they were hoping I did step on a mine.
*  Maybe my jokes didn't go too well there.
*  So your connection was actually Putin.
*  He was trying to get rid of you.
*  Yeah. Now, I don't know.
*  I mean, we felt pretty safe when we were there.
*  There was an air alert went off.
*  They were kind of more concerned with me dying just for the PR side of things.
*  It's like Australian tourists.
*  In one of your videos, actually, you know, her Ukrainian
*  language, they're talking about, we don't want to lose an athlete.
*  That's what they're saying.
*  As you're loading the rocket launcher.
*  Oh, yeah, the rocket launcher.
*  I shot a rocket launcher with the troops on the first trip.
*  But the second trip I went back to, which was only maybe
*  four to five weeks ago.
*  This time we went to some crazier spots.
*  So we went to Odessa, which has been hit a ton.
*  I really enjoyed the video of Old Man stretching.
*  And like exercising on the local custom.
*  Well, Odessa people are known historically to be wild.
*  That was wild.
*  It was abrasive to the eyes, but I appreciated it.
*  Especially a middle aged man in underwear with a beer
*  belly doing a Sundance at dusk.
*  That would frighten many people.
*  Yeah, the battleship would turn around.
*  Yeah. So where else?
*  We went. Yeah. So we went Odessa.
*  We briefly went back to Kiev.
*  We so I made a connection with the police chief
*  of basically the entire country last time.
*  And he had said to me that if I wanted to go somewhere
*  sort of really heavy in terms of action, we could go to curse on.
*  And he's like, oh, personally, escort you to curse on.
*  And I was just like, well, here we have an invitation for adventure.
*  I think it's a great idea to go.
*  And I thought, you know what?
*  I'll completely lie to my cameraman
*  and tell him it's a safe trip to go on so that he can pass that information
*  onto his fiancee and she won't have any concerns.
*  Yes. So we basically take this huge journey all the way down to curse on.
*  We switch at a city outside.
*  I can't remember the name, but we had to switch a sort of armored vehicles.
*  And I remember the guy that picked us up there said, hey, give me a phone number
*  for someone to call to recover your bodies.
*  Yeah. And he said that in a joking way, but I think it was serious.
*  But I said, just leave it, you know?
*  I'm not. I don't think they need.
*  I don't think we much left, probably if we get hit over there.
*  But we go basically into curse on.
*  I think curse on population used to be like 250,000.
*  Now it's like basically all military down to 50,000.
*  So we went into the police basically stationed in the bunker underneath.
*  The top of the building was destroyed.
*  And then one of the local guys just took us on a city tour,
*  which again, we had some filming restrictions because obviously
*  anytime something's hit, I guess the other side wants to be able to see
*  what damage has been done.
*  So if you take any footage of recently destroyed buildings,
*  that's going to help them recalibrate and target the next shot.
*  So curse on being so heavily hit.
*  It's basically within range of every single thing Russia has,
*  every form of weapon drones.
*  Before we took the tour, he put some drone blocking things on top of the car,
*  which didn't look reassuring.
*  He also took a helmet out the back of the car,
*  which I thought he was going to give to me,
*  but he just threw it in the back of the pickup truck and said,
*  Oh, you won't need this to be dead anyway.
*  And I was like, Oh, I've made a great life decision with this little curse on tour.
*  But then we took a tour of the city and curse on used to be kind of like a beautiful
*  beach city by the Nebo River.
*  But basically, it's just the river that separates Russia from,
*  whether I guess the Russian land they've taken from curse on.
*  So curse on split across that river.
*  And this is Russians on the other side of the river and Ukrainians on this side.
*  So very, very dangerous.
*  But Kharkiv makes a lot of press because of the long range missiles that hit.
*  But curse on is just being hit all the time.
*  So we took this tour. We went along the river.
*  We went to within one kilometer of the front line.
*  So that was the closest we got.
*  After this point, we heard artillery strike.
*  And because you're in an armored vehicle, it sounds further away than it is.
*  Obviously, the sound doesn't get in.
*  So I thought it sounded far away.
*  We could see some smoke that actually appear close in the distance.
*  The guy driving us took us to a point where a large building was blocking us
*  from, I guess, the angle at which the missile would have came from.
*  And I thought I thought everything was cool.
*  But it was that what must have been off in the distance.
*  And then we heard two more strikes hit very, very close.
*  They sounded really loud.
*  And then I think he's ready to see if everything's safe,
*  if we can leave this point.
*  And then we basically race back.
*  But we started to realize we're in danger at any point where he really sped the car up
*  or sort of took sort of evasive movements in the car.
*  But we got out of there and I think I had someone translate it later.
*  And basically, yeah, he was checking to see if the roads were clear for us to leave.
*  Ultimately, it ended up being someone died and a few people injured from that blast,
*  which was less than half a kilometer from us.
*  And basically they were ratings radioing saying, end the tour,
*  come back to the police station.
*  Artillery is terrifying because there's just shelling
*  and it's the destructive power of artillery is insane.
*  Yeah, and it's constant all the time.
*  Yeah. And you hear that noise.
*  You're like, is that coming or going?
*  Very, very concerning. Right.
*  You don't know. Yeah, I'm like, I don't know.
*  And just like that, it could be you.
*  Well, I'm going last on the village we went to.
*  Basically. It was the day we left, so we stayed there overnight.
*  The day we left, it just started getting extremely shelled.
*  And the soldier we just took a selfie video of us and basically in the location
*  we were in, just hearing just artillery strike after artillery strike,
*  just being like, oh, you guys left and the fun began.
*  So they they take it in good spirit.
*  I was trying to use their energy to reassure myself.
*  But I guess when they see it every day, it's they're kind of more adjusted to it.
*  They're not like they're not freaking out every time something crazy like that goes on.
*  Well, they have to, right?
*  They have to be in good spirit.
*  You have to be joking and laughing.
*  And yeah, the guys are always laughing and joking.
*  They were laughing and joking at me quite a bit, holding weapons,
*  trying to shoot weapons and stuff.
*  They got a lot of enjoyment out of me shooting the RPG.
*  Yeah, they're probably still telling stories
*  that crazy Australian American that rolled in.
*  They helped me out, though, in my marketing campaign for the tournament.
*  We're able to secure a Lada classic Soviet Union car.
*  We towed it. We painted it with the logos of the other event, the ADCC.
*  Yeah. And we got to shoot some RPGs at it.
*  Yeah. Great experience. Great fun.
*  Yeah. It's a very creative marketing campaign.
*  Very dangerous one.
*  I don't think like Coke or Pepsi are going to do that one.
*  So it's very, very innovative.
*  It's a bold move.
*  Luckily, they let me get away with posting it.
*  But when we were there, it was at a shooting range and we cleared them out for a while.
*  So we'd blown up the car.
*  We set it on fire. We've done all this sort of stuff.
*  I remember we were trying to blow it up.
*  It wasn't quite hitting.
*  One of the missiles was lodged in under the car.
*  So it's kind of risky. That could have gone off at any moment.
*  But we needed to get it to ignite.
*  We needed to get a shot where it was on fire.
*  The logo of the enemy tournament was basically on fire.
*  So we poured gasoline on it.
*  We shot the gasoline tank.
*  That didn't work. That must be a movie trick or something.
*  And then we decided we had light on fire, a rag and just throw it
*  into the blown out back window.
*  So I'm with this guy, Special Forces guy, and we throw the rag in the back.
*  Like soaked in gasoline rag.
*  Yeah. And we start running.
*  And he's like, stop, stop.
*  He's like, it didn't go off.
*  So we're sitting there quite close to the car, lighting it, trying to light more
*  as we walk back to the car.
*  And then we just hear the car ignite.
*  And he's like, run, run, run.
*  So we came quite close to death already at that point.
*  But we wanted to get the shot with some photos in front of the burning logos.
*  But we told the guys at the shooting range to basically
*  give us 10 minutes or so.
*  So we could take the photos.
*  I don't know if they didn't wait the full 10 minutes or if we took too long,
*  but they started firing at the targets anyway.
*  And then the ricochets were flying very, very close to us over our head.
*  One landed right by my leg.
*  We're like, shit, we better get out of here.
*  Obviously, not much safety concerns at that point.
*  But we survived basically artillery strikes.
*  We survived a bit of friendly fire with the bullets coming our way.
*  But again, I was strangely calm because the other guys were calm.
*  But then afterwards, they were they said to me, they were like,
*  Oh, if you got shot, we just have to dump your body at a hospital.
*  We wouldn't be able to explain why you're here blowing up cars.
*  Right. Right.
*  And you're American and athlete, international celebrity.
*  They'd be like, what is what is he doing on the front line?
*  There's no real good explanation for it.
*  But I mean, even through the jokes and stuff, it's good to like highlight
*  what's actually kind of happening over there.
*  You know, it's obviously very, very bad.
*  What's the morale of the soldiers like?
*  Is there still an optimism? Is there still a hope?
*  I mean, this sort of the battle fatigue, you know, and as they say, like
*  all the heroes die early, you know, the guys that the real heroes
*  that are willing to sacrifice themselves, they're the ones
*  that are going to get taken out quick.
*  Unfortunately, that's the reality from over there.
*  But their thoughts are mostly that it's going to be a prolonged war.
*  Like when I ask them about how fast the frontline moves, they're like, oh,
*  could take six months to move one, 200 meters.
*  So it just feels like it's going to go on forever.
*  And from the Ukrainian side's perspective,
*  those guys talk to me about how when they hear radio intercepts
*  of Russian soldiers marching to the same frontline spot, is that basically
*  they're marching into certain death at certain locations.
*  And based on the radio transmissions, they know they're going to die,
*  but they head forth anyway, straightforward
*  into a Ukrainian position, which is just wild to me.
*  I guess I will. What do they just keep throwing troops at it?
*  And you see a ton of footage they take themselves.
*  Just mind blowing.
*  I'll see some of this footage doesn't make it to the Internet
*  because it's got important sort of details in those conflicts.
*  But like they're showing first person perspectives of trench warfare.
*  It's just crazy to see what some of these guys have have gone through.
*  So I went to a lot of the same places as well, including Hursan.
*  What was your sense of the place?
*  Kursom was like it was just so destroyed.
*  I think at this point, most of the civilians are gone.
*  I saw a lot of just elderly people left behind, especially a lot of old men.
*  And I just think they're just like, hey, I've lived in my whole life.
*  I'm just never leaving.
*  So no matter the level of danger, those guys just remain.
*  And then it's largely just, I guess, military in Kurson.
*  But that place felt very, very dangerous.
*  I didn't realize until we got there just quite how destroyed it is.
*  How did that experience change you?
*  Just seeing war head on.
*  How to change me, I guess, just realizing a lot of these soldiers are just like
*  you kind of distance yourself from them, thinking that they're something separate.
*  But really speaking to a lot of the Ukrainian soldiers, like my friend Roman,
*  he hadn't lived in Ukraine for eight years.
*  He lived in France. He had a life.
*  He's got a wife over there. He's got a daughter.
*  He basically volunteered to come back to protect his mom
*  and brother who still lived there.
*  So it's like you sort of I used to view them military guys
*  because in Australia and I guess in the US, they don't have this
*  conscription ongoing right now.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, whereas obviously these guys like Roman who volunteered.
*  But then there's a lot of Ukrainian soldiers that were conscripted
*  into the war.
*  So it's like you just realize how a lot of these guys, everyday people,
*  they're just in this crazy situation, like where Roman felt obligated
*  to return to Ukraine, like from my perspective, anyone in it from Australia or US.
*  Just it's just a different perspective on like those.
*  They feel different to the regular people fighting in Ukraine.
*  From my perspective, he is defending the land that is your home.
*  Yeah, like Japan was coming for Australia,
*  I guess in World War Two, they attacked the north.
*  But really, there was no foot battle and there was no soldiers on the ground
*  within Australia, I guess, US too during World War Two.
*  So it's like a completely different perspective
*  from our recent histories compared to like if you were Ukrainian
*  and there's Russians within the defined border,
*  their responsibility to protect their homeland and their family.
*  It's just something you can't imagine.
*  But also after having spent time with them, you can see why
*  they feel such a strong sense of obligation to protect,
*  to protect Ukraine, protect their family and friends.
*  And in a lot of cases,
*  the soldiers are using their own funds to buy equipment,
*  whether it's bullets, whether it's guns, whether it's armor.
*  Is that still what you saw?
*  Yeah, I mean, in terms of the weapons, America provides weapons.
*  So we saw a wide selection of weapons.
*  Some of those would be old Soviet weapons,
*  like obviously the RPG we shot and what we shot out of it is all Soviet.
*  It's very old weaponry.
*  And then you've got US weapons that have been given as well.
*  But in terms of the basic soldiers equipment,
*  like if they want good quality stuff, that might be the difference
*  between them surviving the winter or the summer, just an extreme temperature range.
*  Like they have to pay for that all themselves.
*  So they always joke about when foreign soldiers come over to train them
*  or they a lot of foreign soldiers come to learn about sort of the drone
*  technology they've developed on a budget is they always joke with them about how,
*  like everything from most countries is basically supplied.
*  All the good quality standard equipment they'd need is just supplied by the government.
*  But in Ukraine, obviously funding is very stretched.
*  So these guys to have the best equipment, they have to basically
*  find money to pay for themselves and they'll do that by seeking donations.
*  Best way to get donations would be to go social media profiles.
*  So that's when you see a lot of sort of social media warfare
*  from a perspective of gaining fame to secure donations for the battalion
*  to be able to fight better or protect themselves.
*  And also some of the social media warfare, I guess, is
*  psychological warfare against the enemy.
*  You'll see like private telegram groups where they're showing
*  what they've done to the enemy, what the enemy's done to them.
*  It's just crazy. It's just crazy.
*  Yeah, there's telegram groups on both sides.
*  And it's basically some of it is propaganda.
*  Some of it is psychological warfare.
*  Some of it is just the human nature of being like
*  of increasing your own morale and the morale of the people around you
*  by showing off successfully killing other human beings,
*  which are made other in war.
*  And the nature of this war has evolved.
*  So drones have become more and more prevalent.
*  They're consumer level cheap drones.
*  Can you speak to that? Have you seen have you seen the use of FBE drones?
*  Yes. So I mean, basically like a three to five hundred dollar drone.
*  I think it's like carbon fiber, 3D printed.
*  They can address attached different forms of weaponry to it,
*  whether it's just dropping a frag, they could drop a mine out of it.
*  I know they were talking about how they had a liquid
*  that could basically burn through sort of a lot of cars and tanks.
*  So the person inside would basically melt alive, which sounds horrible.
*  But what's mind blowing to me is you could have like a three million dollar
*  Russian tank that could be destroyed by a three hundred dollar drone,
*  which is just crazy how fast the war changes.
*  I think they're kind of the world leaders in budget drone technology.
*  They didn't obviously don't have the budget for these crazy, elaborate
*  massive drones. I did see some higher budget, bigger drones over there.
*  But for the most part, those FPV drones is really how most of the battles are fought.
*  And you're seeing the
*  you're seeing the cameras on them.
*  So you can see like basic kamikaze drone will chase someone down.
*  And they have that footage.
*  And that's what the police chief said to me when he he gifted me
*  one of the drones they used.
*  And he basically said he's like, artillery is scary,
*  but a drone will follow you into a building.
*  It's like kind of a haunting thing to think about.
*  Like they'll see the drone, they'll hear the drone.
*  They might try to shoot it down or they might try to run.
*  But if it's a kamikaze one, those guys are pretty good at flying them.
*  It's going to chase the soldiers down.
*  A lot of soldiers like pretending to be dead.
*  It's really crazy.
*  Some of the footage out there, those FPV drones.
*  So it's a terrifying tool of war and tool of psychological war
*  and used by both sides increasingly.
*  Yeah, both sides use it.
*  I remember I was with Roman in Marseille and he had his break period.
*  He was allowed to leave the country because he's
*  volunteer, basically volunteered to join the army.
*  Ukrainian men can't really leave Ukraine right now.
*  But Roman, I was in Marseille and this was a surreal experience for him.
*  We went to the beach and there was some tourists there flying a drone.
*  And you just saw his instinctual reaction to that drone sound in the sky.
*  Flashback to that.
*  Currently, they're all.
*  As far as I know, all human controlled, so FPV.
*  But to me, increasingly terrifying notion is of them becoming autonomous.
*  It's the best way to defend against the drone that's FPV
*  controlled is for AI to be controlling that drone.
*  Just have swarms of drones that are $500 controlled by AI systems.
*  And that's a terrifying possibility that the future warfare is
*  essentially swarms of drones on both sides and then maybe swarms of drones,
*  say between US and China over Taiwan.
*  That'll be wild.
*  Cause I mean, they do those crazy drone light shows where they do those
*  performances with the lights and stuff.
*  So they're already pretty sophisticated with sort of pre-programming.
*  Those are pre-programmed.
*  So the low level control flight control of those is done autonomously, but
*  there's a interface for doing the choreography that's hard coded in.
*  Adding increasing levels of intelligence to a drone where you can detect another
*  drone, follow it and defend yourself.
*  The, in terms of the military on both sides as the Ukraine war, that's,
*  that's a, that's a technology that's like the most wanted technology is drone
*  defense, like how do you defending as drones on both sides and anybody that
*  comes up with an autonomous drone technology is going to help whichever
*  side uses that technology to gain a military advantage.
*  And so there's a huge incentive to do that.
*  But then of course, once both sides started using that technology, then
*  there's swarms of autonomous drones who don't give a shit about humans, just
*  killing everything in sight on both sides.
*  And that's, that's, that's terrifying.
*  There's a civilian deaths that are possible.
*  They're terrifying, especially when you look 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, it's surreal.
*  I went into curse on, he was like, uh, the entire sky is covered in
*  the entire sky is just full of, full of drones at any given time.
*  They could decide to come and attack.
*  So like just the, they could just sit there forever waiting, waiting for
*  you to come out of that building.
*  They'll wait a long time when someone goes and hides inside or potentially if
*  it's open window, fly straight through the open window to get it, to get people.
*  Yes.
*  You're not even safe indoors.
*  Yeah.
*  There's nowhere to hide and they can wait for a very, very long time.
*  And as far as I know, even politicians, like you're in danger everywhere.
*  In Ukraine.
*  So if you want to do a public speaking thing and doing outside, you're in
*  danger because it's very difficult to detect those drones.
*  It could be anywhere.
*  So it's a terrifying life where you don't know if you're safe at
*  any moment, anywhere in Ukraine.
*  Well, sure.
*  I mean, it's crazy.
*  We were having a Trump.
*  I thought maybe at the next attack on a public figure might come in the form of
*  drone technology, some sort of something along those lines.
*  I wonder how they protect against that here.
*  If that happens, just imagine the insanity that would ensue.
*  Cause we understand the idea of a gunman with a rifle shooting somebody,
*  but just like a drone, just imagine the conspiracy theories who controlled that
*  drone where to come from.
*  Yeah.
*  And now everybody, I mean, that will just cause chaos.
*  And the range is ever increasing.
*  One of the battalions in Ukraine, cause those FPV drones have short range,
*  pretty short range, but they were able to attach it to one of the larger drones
*  with a signal booster so they could potentially go up to 30, 40 kilometers
*  into the distance.
*  So the drone that hits you could be flown by someone so far away from you.
*  And if they did that domestically, that would be very frightening to think of the
*  sphere of where it could have come from.
*  Do they, when you talk to the soldiers there, do they have a hope or a vision
*  how the war will end?
*  No, really.
*  It just seems, I guess it just seems to everyone that it's sort of, there's
*  going to be no middle ground.
*  When I was there, there's a kind of optimism that there would be
*  victorious, like definitively.
*  And so is there still that optimism and also are they ready for a prolonged war?
*  I mean, I think it would be a soldier by soldier basis.
*  I know like, each of them had a different perspective.
*  I remember I would ask him about like, in terms of US politics and their fears,
*  because the first trip I went there, US hadn't agreed to resupply weapons.
*  So it was a very different feeling in the air there of concern over what was
*  going to happen, but they still remained quite optimistic that no matter who got
*  in, they felt would do the right thing.
*  But in terms of prolonged war, most people think it's going to go for a very
*  long time, like the Children's Hospital that just was bombed in Kiev.
*  Anytime there's a moment like that, that reignites everything.
*  And I think it happens on both sides.
*  So I know that there was an attack in Crimea.
*  It was an attack on a beach, I guess.
*  And I don't know if that attack in the hospital was retribution for that, but
*  that's sort of the energy that is felt like they might have battle fatigue.
*  But when something happens to civilians, especially kids on your side, kind of
*  reinvigorates the energy to fight for as long as necessary.
*  And in terms of a case by case basis, one of my friends, Demetri over there, who
*  transitioned to owns a gym, he was very passionate about it just because of the
*  history, like he brought out documents of his grandfather being executed by the
*  USSR.
*  So I know that when the war started, he basically, he took a bicycle helmet and
*  he's AK-47 and went out into the streets.
*  And he's like, I'd rather be dead than live under Russian rule again.
*  So I mean, very case by case basis, sort of personal history for them, I think.
*  Did they comment on US politics, whether they hope for Trump or for in that
*  situation, Biden, now Harris to win the presidential election?
*  I think most of the guys tried to keep it pretty positive.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like some people did think that maybe if Trump was elected, he wouldn't continue
*  to fund it, but they really try to stay optimistic.
*  Most of the people I spoke to really tried to remain optimistic that they would
*  be protected if, if it comes down to it.
*  Like, but obviously there was a nine month period where they weren't refunded.
*  So as that stretched, obviously they refunded now, but it takes a lot of time
*  to get that equipment back to the points at which they need it.
*  So I mean, if ammunition had ran out, Patriot defense system had ran out,
*  really, really sort of scary prospect there.
*  I don't know what's all, I guess no one knows what's going to happen there, but.
*  Did you lie to people and say you were close to the president so they can be nice
*  to you, like, so they can convince you to continue the funding?
*  I'm an Australian diplomat.
*  That could be a nice way in.
*  Yeah, that would have been a nice way to the top.
*  Like, luckily for me, most of the place I traveled to, Jiu-Jitsu gives me access
*  to so many different individuals.
*  It's super bizarre.
*  Like oligarchs, royalty, I guess tech wizards.
*  It's just, it's a strange group of people, like a code around the world of just,
*  I get strange access just for being good at wrestling, wrestling dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  Martial arts.
*  There's a, there's like a code and there's a respect to meet your respect.
*  Even if you don't know anything about the other person, if you both have done
*  martial arts, I mean, there's similar things with judo.
*  Would you just say with grappling all that?
*  I don't know what that is.
*  It's like an inner circle.
*  That's kind of like, cause this film project we're working on, it's kind of
*  focused on that is, uh, because of the history of having Jiu-Jitsu and traveling
*  and doing seminars and just getting access to strange experiences from the local
*  strange in a positive way and participating in those experiences.
*  That's what I sort of wanted to focus this travel show on was the community of
*  Jiu-Jitsu people around the world kind of really has no sort of ethnic
*  background, religious background, even level of wealth.
*  I could say as cheesy as it sounds, kind of a good equalizer on the mats and
*  that community camaraderie sort of knows no limits there.
*  Including like mats, the shittiest mats and some small town in the middle of nowhere.
*  100% even like Shake Tarnoon who started ADCC.
*  I know when he went to the U S and he studied there, he would train at a very
*  simple gym, he wouldn't declare who he was.
*  Like I watched a documentary produced about sort of the story of Shake Tarnoon
*  and how he studied in America, basically in anonymity.
*  The people at his gym didn't know who he was in his country and he trained there.
*  He trained with them for years, cleaned the mats like anyone else.
*  And then they didn't realize who he was until he said, Hey, I want to invite you
*  to my country, but he actually meant basically as royalty come and then they
*  realized who this guy was and the significance of him.
*  That's gangster.
*  That's great.
*  One of the things I love about no geek Jiu-Jitsu is like, you don't see rank.
*  So on a small scale, there's no hierarchy that's that emerges when you have the
*  different color belts, everybody's kind of the same.
*  It's nice.
*  You get to like see the skill, the skill speaks, but there's just like a mutual
*  respect and whatever, you can quickly find out who I actually wonder if I would
*  be able to figure out the rank of a person.
*  You think you can, can you usually figure out how long a person has been doing
*  Jiu-Jitsu?
*  I like to think with some of the aggressive clothing choices I've made and
*  sold in the sport that that should be a beacon that that person has hopefully
*  some talent because they're fearlessly provoking the other party there.
*  Oh, it's, it's like in the jungle, whenever there's like a insect that's red,
*  that is like really flamboyant looking.
*  That means they're dangerous.
*  It's a target.
*  Yeah.
*  The being flamboyant.
*  If you come on the mats with something pink, pink, or something, people are
*  circling in fast, especially in Eastern Europe.
*  Okay.
*  So, uh, yeah, you mentioned the project.
*  Can you talk about that?
*  I saw there's a preview that you showed Craig Jones gone walkabout.
*  Gone walkabout.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, so you showed a preview in Indonesia where you're both kind of
*  celebrating and maybe poking a bit of fun at Hicks and Gracie.
*  Hicks and Gracie.
*  Yeah.
*  So I liked it to, uh, match looks from time to time in an homage.
*  You look sexy.
*  It's comfortable actually.
*  I enjoy it.
*  Yeah.
*  You should keep it.
*  Oh, why don't we wear this now?
*  I'll wear this for the Gabby match.
*  Um, I mean, yeah, we're trying to do a documentary series because the way I see
*  it is I want to grow the sport of Jiu-Jitsu and every, this sounds funny to
*  say now, cause I'm doing a tournament, but everyone tries to do it through
*  competition, but as we know, most Jiu-Jitsu gyms we visit, a very small
*  percentage of people compete, let alone compete regularly.
*  You go to gyms that could be Brown or Black Bells that don't know
*  many of the big name competitors.
*  So my thoughts were, we're never going to grow this sport by competition.
*  We're going to grow up by appealing to the large majority of people that do it,
*  which are just people that enjoy it for the benefits it provides to them, whether
*  health or psychological, and obviously many people inspired by Anthony Bourdain.
*  Basically he's looking at what he did with food by showing the very interesting
*  characters in the food culture and the food industries, especially with street
*  food and building around that.
*  So I'm trying to look at Jiu-Jitsu like a giant cult.
*  Scientology isn't starting with planet Xenu, it's starting with John
*  Travolta and Tom Cruise.
*  So we can create a documentary travel series, highlighting the diverse,
*  interesting people that participate in the sport in that sense.
*  I hope we can grow up, but also doing some charity work along the way.
*  Like as we'll really see Indonesia Bali episode pretty soon, but as an
*  Australian, I do do a lot of damage culturally around the world.
*  So I'd like to do some good as well.
*  We've done a lot of damage to Bali, so give back to local communities.
*  We have an Australian there that runs an academy, Academy Christos.
*  He's one of the guys we're donating a portion of the ticket sales to from our
*  event, but he basically went straight into a Balinese slum, started teaching
*  Jiu-Jitsu on a mat under a tree and then slowly through donations has built a gym.
*  And his real focus is not just taking money from people and gifting it to them
*  to help the community, but to teach them skills.
*  So he'll take a lot of the disadvantaged kids and he'll teach them things like
*  photo editing so they can get that work from the internet, really incredible guy.
*  It's good to know that you see yourself as the John Travolta of Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Many masseuses have accused me of the same thing, unfortunately, all lies.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of similarities between the two of you.
*  So you mentioned Anthony Bourdain.
*  What do you like about the guy?
*  What do you find inspiring and instructive about the way he was able to,
*  as you said, scratch beneath the surface of a place?
*  I just felt like he's very authentic.
*  Wasn't afraid.
*  Like this is something I had trouble with when we first started doing the travel
*  show, it's easy to do a travel show if you only say positive things about a place.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, but he would find a very creative way to show what's good and bad, a
*  very honest reflection of the place.
*  So that's something I would strive to do.
*  However, in some places it's very difficult.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like for example, Kazakhstan, if I were to say something negative about
*  Kazakhstan, they'd be like, who's this foreign idiot talking about our culture?
*  And I think that was what was incredible about Bourdain is he could talk about
*  both the good and bad of places and he would do it in such a way that it was
*  tasteful and was respected by the locals.
*  Yeah, that's actually a skill that you're incredibly good at.
*  You make fun of a lot of people, but there's something, maybe there's an
*  underlying respect, maybe it's the accent, maybe, I don't know what it is.
*  There's, there's a love underneath your trolling.
*  Hopefully.
*  Yeah.
*  Gabby Garcia is a deep, a deep passionate love underneath the trolling.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of which, let's talk about CGI.
*  You're putting on the CGI tournament.
*  It's in about a week, same weekend as ADCC, $3 million budget, two divisions,
*  two super fights, winner of each division gets $1 million.
*  Everyone gets $10,000.
*  How do you even say that?
*  Plus one, 10,000 plus one, plus one, uh, just to compete.
*  So it's August 16th and 17th.
*  Everybody should get tickets same weekend as ADCC, which is August 17th.
*  Okay.
*  So what's the mission of what you're doing there?
*  The mission has always been first and foremost, increase athlete pay.
*  So ADCC has invested a ton into the sport.
*  Obviously I mentioned Shake Tarnoon, Shake Tarnoon has done so much
*  for the sport of grappling, particularly no-gig grappling.
*  So he's grown it.
*  He has funded this for a very, very long time, but we've kind of hit a point
*  since 2017 where the audience, the crowd watching live and at home behind
*  a paywall has grown considerably.
*  We had things like Meta Morris, we had the Eddie Bravo Invitational, Polaris,
*  all these sort of professional events that have also contributed to growing
*  the sport and obviously people like Gordon Ryan have definitely increased
*  the popularity of the sport, but the payment for ADCC has never gone up.
*  Despite again, the growth of it.
*  So what I did, a lot of fans were asking me earlier in the year, they said,
*  you're going to do ADCC.
*  And I said, that is a big commitment of time, energy, expenses on steroids
*  to get my body ready for a tournament that I'll probably lose.
*  And if I lose on day one, I make $0.
*  If I lose on, if I lose in the final, which I have done a couple of times,
*  I only get $6,000.
*  I think third place is 3000, fourth place is 1000.
*  So if you make day two, you get paid.
*  But for me personally, seeing ADCC in 2022, you're looking out to a
*  sold out crowd of like 10,000 people.
*  It's on flow grappling, which you know, pay quite a bit of money for the streaming rights.
*  I can't comment on what that number would be.
*  And then you go home, despite having put in all that effort with only 6000.
*  And they're basically the argument is you're paid an exposure.
*  But again, there's many ways to expose yourself.
*  You know, I mean, that's just one of the platforms.
*  To do so.
*  Yeah.
*  My problem was that they announced that they were going to go from Thomas and
*  Mack to T-Mobile, which is a jump in quality of stadium, but not a
*  significant jump in sort of seating.
*  So we've gone from like 11,000 seat arena to I think a 15, 16,000 seat arena.
*  And I knew that flow grappling would have had to pay more money because now the
*  sport's growing so much and I can personally kind of track the growth of the
*  sport through selling instructional DVDs.
*  Instructional online products.
*  Cause that keeps growing and we're targeting those white and blue belts
*  vulnerable to internet marketing.
*  Yeah.
*  And that audience continues to grow.
*  And those will be the people that largely watch ADCC events like this.
*  So I simply said in response to a lot of fans asking me, why are you going to do
*  ADCC and I just simply made a video saying, no, probably not, probably not.
*  Be nice to make some more money.
*  And then I listed a bunch of sports such as cock bar that you get paid more to
*  win cock bar in the villages of Kazakhstan, the payment structure is higher.
*  And I received a very aggressive response, not from any of Shake Tarnoon's people,
*  but from Basie who runs the event today.
*  One of those guys amongst giving me death threats said, Hey, T-Mobile
*  costs $2 million.
*  You don't know what you're talking about in terms of business and production.
*  And he's probably right.
*  But to me, $2 million is a waste of money for a Jiu-Jitsu event.
*  I don't think we're at that level yet.
*  Like that's where the UFC host events, you know, $2 million.
*  That's expensive, expensive venue.
*  So we argued a bit on the internet and he said, Hey, if you don't like it, why
*  don't you go get $2 million and put on your own tournament?
*  And I said, I might just do that.
*  And one of my anonymous friends kindly donated a $3 million budget and actually
*  messaged him before the show to say, Hey, we won't reveal your identity.
*  Cause obviously anyone that has money is going to get asked for more money
*  for, or ask for money from others.
*  So he wants to remain anonymous, but he basically just said to enjoy the
*  trolling aspect of it and also contribute to the sport of Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Well, it's good to know that the anonymous funder appreciates you
*  for who you are, Craig Jones.
*  He sees my true identity and he wants to provoke.
*  It's, it's, it's trolling for a good cause.
*  Yeah.
*  But basically we were able to find Thomas and Mac event center, which was
*  their original venue and it just so happened to be available that same
*  weekend, which we're very happy about.
*  So we booked that out.
*  We decided to, ADCC pays 10,000 to the winner.
*  We were like, you know what?
*  We'll pay $10,000 plus one to show up.
*  So to show up in our event, you're going to get paid more than to win ADCC.
*  And not only that, we're going to broadcast it for free.
*  So on Meta, X and YouTube, you'd be able to watch this event for free.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's very considerate to the flow grappling streaming platform.
*  I believe to have also a free alternative on the same weekend.
*  And the brilliance of this whole thing is I was largely criticized for not
*  knowing anything about business, but the people criticizing me decided to host
*  a tournament at 15,000 seat arena.
*  They decided to take sponsors.
*  They decided to use a stream platforms with self subscriptions based on the
*  athletes that would enter it, but not give any of the talent, the athlete to
*  contract, which gave me this beautiful position to basically say, Hey, what do
*  you prefer the prestige of an ADCC gold medal or money?
*  And that's the fuse so far.
*  And we put that, we put that out into the world.
*  I didn't chase too many athletes down.
*  Obviously a lot of these guys really need money.
*  So you throw a million dollars out there.
*  People are jumping on board.
*  So initially we started getting, we got two local guys here in Austin, the
*  Tackett brothers, they jumped in first and they're great kids.
*  They really legitimize the whole thing.
*  Cause if, if we pick certain athletes, I just beat him guys straight away.
*  It's already looking a bit dodgy, but we've got some legitimate athletes,
*  especially the under 80 kilo divisions full of minus two or three guys.
*  That's the best people in the world in that weight division.
*  And as we started to grow our roster here, what happened, I'm going to say
*  this allegedly for legal reasons is that the first move ADCC did was they matched
*  the female pay to the men's base.
*  So the women always traditionally got paid less, I think $6,000 for first place.
*  As soon as we had Fion Davies, the reigning champion come across to do a super
*  fight with us, bang, ADCC raised the prize money, the women's division to equal the
*  men's so me being a feminist activist throughout many of my years on this earth,
*  immediately got women's pay raised in the sport of jujitsu equalized basically,
*  which went counter to everything.
*  The promoter had said, cause he said it was out of his control to raise money.
*  He said only the, only the ADCC, I guess, coming directly from the sheik or the
*  sheik's sort of guys could raise the prize money.
*  He got it raised.
*  And then what happened was once we started getting some of these big names here,
*  so some of the best guys from ADCC would be in this division.
*  We've got a bunch of champions or medalists or really the top betting
*  favorites for their divisions there.
*  They started again, I can't emphasize this enough, allegedly paying show money,
*  which has never historically been done before to keep athletes in their show.
*  So you're saying allegedly there were some under the table payments by ADCC.
*  Do you have secret documents proving this?
*  I do have the documents.
*  No, some of the guys obviously told me, you know how it is.
*  He's slapping million dollars on the table.
*  It looks great.
*  That was me proving I had the money, which wasn't even my money to begin with, but
*  it was basically me saying, Hey, the money's real.
*  No, I don't know why, but strangely a lot of people don't believe me
*  when I'm telling the truth.
*  I don't know why they wouldn't.
*  But what logically happens is they're like, Oh, look at how much money he has.
*  We're going to give like, give us more show money.
*  So they're negotiating with me.
*  There was one particular Brazilian businessman manager.
*  I won't say his name, but he looks like the thing from fantastic four.
*  And he was a manager for some of these athletes and he would take a massive 20%
*  cup.
*  So what he, and I got to, I got to pay respect to this, uh, respect to this.
*  Cause it actually caused trauma to the other team as well, but he would, uh, I
*  would invite an athlete to CJI.
*  He would go to the other organization and he would say to them, Hey, what sort
*  of deal could you give me to keep this guy?
*  You want to keep him in your event?
*  And he would use CJI to leverage more show money for his guys of which he gets
*  to grease the wheels with 20% for himself.
*  However, at CJI, everyone gets $10,001 across the board and a million dollars
*  prize money.
*  So there's no room for really negotiation for the tournament aspect of us.
*  So he has a vested interest in putting these guys in ADCC cause he can negotiate
*  show money and he can basically take 20% of that for himself.
*  But really for the sport of grappling, this is incredible across the board
*  because by us stealing or at least borrowing a bunch of athletes from ADCC,
*  ADCC had to fill their divisions.
*  So they filled their divisions with many other competitors that wouldn't have
*  ordinarily had the chance to do ADCC.
*  And really, although we've scheduled it the same weekend, ours is actually Friday,
*  Saturday, ADCC being Saturday, Sunday, our day starts pretty late.
*  So we start 5pm Saturday.
*  So really ultimately it was a big marketing ploy to go head to head pretending
*  like we're making the fans choose, but the fans will be able to watch both events.
*  You'd be able to go all day Friday for us.
*  You'll sadly miss the ADCC hall of fame ceremony where you'll see many of great
*  speakers, public speakers, philosophers, tell their stories about hardship.
*  Just like at the end of any jujitsu seminar or beginning, if you're blessed
*  like that, you might have a 45 minute monologue about how they more
*  knowledgeable than doctors, lawyers, classic black belt technique,
*  but you will miss that.
*  With great metaphors about lions and about lions.
*  Yes.
*  About being a humble lion, most importantly, but you can watch all that Friday.
*  You could watch most of ADCC Saturday and then Saturday night.
*  In Las Vegas, I'll be doing what many men have done before.
*  And that is wrestling a giant woman.
*  Can you speak to that?
*  How are you preparing for this moment of violence on a Saturday
*  night with Gabby Garcia?
*  So Gabby Garcia is the legend of sort of women's grappling.
*  I think she's won more than anyone else.
*  So between me and her, we would at least have 15 to 20 world
*  championships, I'd imagine.
*  Yeah.
*  She's huge.
*  I say that in an endearing way.
*  She might be six foot four, six foot three, and her weight varies depending
*  on what time of the day it is between 220 and 275 pounds, but she's going
*  to be coming in quite big and strong.
*  Me, I am about 179 pounds right now.
*  And a five foot 11.
*  So I've got a significant size disadvantage.
*  She has the credentials, but we're going to, we're going to scrap it out,
*  scrap it out and see who's best, the greatest woman's competitor of all
*  time or a guy that's never won anything.
*  Has it added some complexity to the picture that, you know, there's some
*  sexual tension in the room whenever you, the two of you are together.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe I'm being romantic, but it seems like there's, you've slowly started
*  to fall in love with each other.
*  It's been three years of seduction.
*  It's been a long time.
*  It's inspiring for, for many young men that follow you and look up to you.
*  Just the, the, the romantic journey that you've been on.
*  It's truly inspiring.
*  Yeah.
*  I would say it's a motivational message to the guy that keeps sending
*  DMs to a girl on Instagram for years.
*  That maybe after three years, it could also happen for you to, no matter, no
*  matter her, her high and weight, I think persistence is the key here.
*  Uh, yeah.
*  And we do have a wager on the line.
*  What's the wager?
*  This might be the first wager of its kind.
*  I would hope in combat sports history, if she wins, I'll personally give her
*  a million dollars if I can footlock her.
*  We're going to collaborate together in an only fans sex tape.
*  Did she agree to this?
*  She shook on it.
*  You do have an only fans channel.
*  Is that still up?
*  After August 17th, it's going to be fire.
*  It's going to be on fire.
*  Wow.
*  I think that, and honestly, when we talk about senior investor, I think that
*  could fund the entire tournament.
*  That'll be the only paywalled thing about this tournament is your only
*  family.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it, I mean, it's going to be a spiritual experience for me.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  I'm distracted now.
*  Can you talk about the rule set?
*  So we're using the angled walls inspired by karate combat.
*  Karate combat did those angled walls.
*  Those are awesome.
*  You're calling it the alley.
*  That's really, really interesting.
*  So the, it's like in a pit, I guess.
*  And the angled walls are.
*  Yes.
*  A karate combat have a square pit.
*  We have a rectangular alley.
*  We like the visual of just you're in the alley with somebody.
*  We both know what goes on an alley.
*  Yeah.
*  Only a couple of things that could go on back there.
*  What's the second thing?
*  Nevermind.
*  I got it.
*  But why this is brilliant, why the angled walls are brilliant for grappling is
*  because any grappling tournament this goes without question goes IBGF, ADCC.
*  The reset is one of the most annoying aspects of the sport.
*  And one of the aspects of the sport that these, some of the sneakier
*  guys take advantage of is the reset.
*  There's guys out there that are brilliant at playing the edge open.
*  The ref will reset them or they'll shoot a take down near the edge.
*  And you might watch, and again, I'm picking on ADCC here, but you might
*  watch an ADCC match where 90 seconds of a 10 minute match is the referee
*  grabbing them, bringing them back to the center or trying to recreate
*  something of a position that landed outside.
*  Not only is that sort of boring to me, it, and it sort of could be
*  bias, you know, like again, it's happened to me in events where like, I've,
*  the ref's gone, stop, I've stopped.
*  He's moved a little bit more and then there's an adjustment in the reset.
*  I mean, it's cheating to a certain extent, it's just more of an annoyance.
*  They bring it back, they reset it to the best of their ability in the center.
*  The angled wall mitigates that and it mitigates it in such a way that is a
*  disadvantage to be pushed up against the angle wall.
*  You're very close to the center.
*  You could use a cage like the UFC does or any sort of MMA organization.
*  However, cage wrestling can be slow.
*  You obviously at the vertical and it can stagnate there.
*  Guys are very good at using split squats to really defend that position.
*  So we, and for me personally, I don't love the cage for grappling.
*  I'd like to differentiate it for grappling.
*  What holds people back from using the alley or a pit like that,
*  because if obviously, if you're one of the VIPs or you pay for expensive seat,
*  that angled walls above you, a cage you can see into an elevated platform
*  sort of stage you can see clearly into because yeah, because it's basically flat,
*  but the athletes could fall off an injured themselves.
*  So something happens, UFC fire passes, the elevated flat stage,
*  but the athletes could fall off and injure themselves.
*  So it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad.
*  It's like, yeah, I'm a, I'm a very, very, very bad person.
*  I'm just very, very bad at this stage.
*  It's kind of scary to be near the edge.
*  You go, you go off, you're going to land on concrete.
*  You might want to do that to the other guy.
*  If you that way inclined, but the alley, the angle will solves all those problems.
*  Very minimal referee interference.
*  Again, the only thing that holds back is the expense of building it.
*  on the alley and we've really gone out of our way to create an experience that
*  around the alley we've elevated everything so that the people watching
*  were better see down into it.
*  Cause that had an, your instinctual thought is, Oh, it sounds great, but
*  how am I going to see in it?
*  Unless I'm far up.
*  Like you'd need like a Coliseum like structure, which is basically what we've
*  attempted to create so that you get both a perfect place to, to wrestle, to grapple
*  in, as well as a perfect viewing angle for the fans.
*  Well, I think it's an amazing idea.
*  What about the Jiu-Jitsu on a slant?
*  You've triangle.
*  Yes.
*  Somebody on a slant.
*  Is there like some interesting aspects about the actual detailed techniques
*  of how to be effective using a slant?
*  I'll be honest.
*  I competed for karate combat twice.
*  Never once did I ever step foot into the pit.
*  Just again, like you said before the podcast, if there's a right way of doing
*  things, I'm probably doing them the opposite.
*  The wrong way.
*  I actually no idea why you people take advice from you, but they do.
*  I'm mostly an inspirational speaker at this point.
*  Yeah.
*  You and Tony Robbins are like this.
*  Same size at least, but in terms of the training for obviously the athletes, very
*  difficult, some of these guys are going out there and built their own angled walls.
*  Yeah, I saw that.
*  That's a cool video that they're getting into that.
*  That's a smart thing to do.
*  There's a million dollars on the line.
*  You should probably invest in that, but I also like a new surface that no one's
*  competed on.
*  No one's gamed it yet.
*  No one's like, we're going to see it unfold.
*  Like, like when UFC, when people started figuring out how to use the cage, we're
*  going to see this unfold in front of our very eyes, how the strategies work for
*  this.
*  The other thing we've done too, is we're doing rounds.
*  So qualifying rounds would be three, five minute rounds.
*  The final would be five fives.
*  Why I want to do that is to incentivize action.
*  We're going to incentivize action through penalizing people, but we really want, I
*  love a short burst, a break, and the guys can go hard again.
*  I don't like a jujitsu match where the guy takes the back early and he's like,
*  Oh, if I keep this position, I've won.
*  And that's something that people that don't compete don't realize is if you take
*  something, if you get a good position early, get up on the points, you just sit
*  there and go, Oh, let's ride this to the end.
*  That's why I want rounds so that you might take guys back.
*  You really incentivize to get that finish.
*  And the way we're trying to grow the sport is to steal the MMA scoring structure,
*  which a lot of people criticize because they think it's overly complicated.
*  They don't understand it, but to the mass audience, they understand a 10 point
*  must understand a decision in that sense.
*  They understand it being scored round by round.
*  So we're trying to appeal to a broader audience here, but we think based on the
*  structure, based on how hard we'll call stalling penalties based on you wanting
*  to finish your opponent quick to have a better chance at a million dollars,
*  because it's 10,001 to show up and a million to win.
*  If you ain't first, you're last.
*  There's no reward for second place.
*  So I'm punishing the one position I've only ever been out of achieve in
*  tournaments.
*  Are you worried that because of how much money is on the line, people play careful?
*  A very generous friend of mine has provided this money.
*  I'm like, unless you guys go out there and try to kill each other and put it all on
*  the line, I just won't do it again.
*  Like I'm giving you guys a massive platform.
*  We've turned down offers from streaming platforms that wanted to buy the rights
*  to this event because the marketing is going very well.
*  We're turning down money to grow the sport.
*  The ADCC promoter said he wanted to grow the sport.
*  So what he did is he put it behind a paywall and he used the money from the
*  paywall to buy a more expensive arena.
*  I don't think that's how you grow the sport.
*  I think you grow the sport like comedians do these days, like guys like Mark
*  Norman will release a special for free.
*  Andrew Schultz did it first, released a special for free and it grew his
*  audience massively.
*  I think that's what Jiu Jitsu needs.
*  We need an exciting show that's not behind a paywall that'll grow the sport,
*  grow the audience and really then ultimately we can get to a level where it
*  could be behind a paywall.
*  But I just don't think where they are.
*  Yeah, I think million dollars is a lot of money, but the opportunity here,
*  because it's open and freely accessible by everyone is to put on a show.
*  And then you get a million every year.
*  If this is a crazy exciting event, the funding is going to be so easy year
*  after year.
*  And the other aspect we're doing to it is unfortunately I'm not going to make
*  any money off this thing.
*  It's a nonprofit and the money from charity.
*  Except the only fans, but whatever.
*  That's the real cash cow.
*  But that's the real work too.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's not for charity.
*  That's for your personal bank account.
*  The only fans.
*  Or you also.
*  Oh, that'll be for the follow-up therapy, but that'll be expensive gig for
*  whoever takes that on board.
*  Love hurts.
*  That physically will.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it proceeds to charity.
*  So like, obviously we've got the $2 million budget.
*  We've got production expenses.
*  We've got the team of staff to hire.
*  But if we could sell this thing out, we could potentially donate a ton of money
*  to charity.
*  One of those charities is tap cancer out.
*  And what's great about this is Richburn is a black belt from New York.
*  Who's in the banking world.
*  He used to run an event called Kasai Grappling.
*  He went through cancer.
*  He basically had a very aggressive cancer.
*  He had it treated.
*  And now he basically has said to us that whatever we donate from the profits of
*  the event, he's going to match dollar for dollar.
*  And we've also had another guy who wants to remain anonymous, agree to match
*  dollar for dollar as well.
*  So the more ticket sales revenue we can create here, the more we can actually
*  give back to charity.
*  So it's really all round.
*  It's going to be a great event.
*  Yeah.
*  Tap cancer.
*  I was great.
*  And all the charities that the athletes have been selecting are great.
*  What's been the hardest?
*  You are wearing a suit, so you figured out how to do that.
*  But the tie was difficult.
*  For sure.
*  I was difficult, but you figured it out.
*  And congratulations on that.
*  But you've never run a tournament.
*  No, I've never wrestled a big woman either.
*  Well, I have, but not in this form, not in a competitive environment for only fans.
*  What's been the hardest aspects of actually bringing this to life?
*  The first one was people believing it was real.
*  That was quite difficult.
*  And then communicating with the athletes.
*  That's basically my responsibility is securing these guys, getting these
*  guys to commit to things.
*  They're very, it's very difficult.
*  There's a reason a few athletes in every sport really stand out and it's kind of
*  professionalism and kind of the way they market themselves.
*  And I think those two things do go hand in hand.
*  So we're in a sport where there's enough money where a lot of these guys do have
*  managers, I think in MMA things would be a lot easier for the promoter because
*  you're not talking directly to the athlete.
*  You're talking to a guy who might, who's obviously taking a cut, but like he's
*  there's a middleman.
*  So in a situation where you're talking directly to the athlete can be very
*  difficult, can be very annoying, can be very hard to reach these guys.
*  They can be very non-committal.
*  That for me has been one of the biggest challenges.
*  The guys that I speak to that are like, I'm in, and they're like, I'm out.
*  I'm in like navigating this area.
*  One other aspect is because we did this basically from idea to event will be
*  less than three months, three and a half months.
*  So it's like, we're having to do so much in such a short period of time, little
*  things like of the show money we've given them, they're expected to basically
*  secure their own flight and hotel to the event with cutting down on staff.
*  Cause that would be one of the, if I had to coordinate getting these guys'
*  flights, I would just jump off a building.
*  Like it's, it's hard enough to get them to agree to the event, let alone
*  coordinate, Hey, what date do you want to come in?
*  It's like herding cats.
*  So really just the interpersonal stuff's been difficult.
*  Obviously going up against ADCC, the legacy of M has been pretty damn difficult
*  as well.
*  Well established, huge history.
*  They've been selling tickets for two years.
*  Everyone's known it's been coming for two years.
*  That thing was largely sold out before we even announced the event.
*  So we're going head to head with this event.
*  So from a ticket sales perspective, very difficult.
*  What's been a Reddit question?
*  What's been the most surprising people who turned down your invite?
*  Ooh, I mean, we can, we can name names.
*  I mean, obviously Kynan, he was a semi in semi out.
*  His suggestion was actually to do a second and third place prize rather than a million.
*  And I'm like, no, we want an all or nothing.
*  It's all or nothing here.
*  Well, that's a better spectacle, better entertainment.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably more injuries, but it's all or nothing.
*  Miki Galvao, the one that got away.
*  Yeah.
*  That's sad.
*  But we got the Rotolo's.
*  The Rotolo's props to these kids because Cade's the reigning champion.
*  These are two of the best guys in the sport.
*  Allegedly were offered pretty significant show money to stay, but they hit me up and they said,
*  hey, promise us one thing.
*  We're on opposite sides of the brackets and we'll fight to the death in the final for the million.
*  And we know everyone knows that we've seen him compete against each other multiple times.
*  So that was not a surprise because I know they're good kids, but to basically turn down
*  allegedly show money to do this event, to support the event to me is incredible.
*  Miki Galvao, things would be more complicated there.
*  Like obviously Miki officially joined ADCC before he secured the Rotolo's.
*  Cade beat him in the final.
*  Miki is personally motivated to face off against Cade.
*  So he didn't know Cade was in our event before he agreed to ADCC.
*  There's more to that story too, in terms of Miki doing ADCC because a bunch of the kids in his team,
*  I think they're being flown out to the ADCC kids event.
*  So there's like his two teammates, well, at least one of his teammates will be doing the ADCC 66
*  kilo division.
*  So his dad, his coach doesn't really want to split time between two events.
*  That's a difficulty for athletes there, but obviously disappointing.
*  We couldn't secure Miki.
*  Miki said he was about the legacy.
*  So he wanted to be the youngest guy ever to double grand slam, which is basically win all the
*  GEE events and win the ADCC that same year.
*  My thoughts were, if I was in his position and I never was obviously a prodigy, a talent like that,
*  is I thought he had a position to make a statement in the sport to kind of as cheesy as it sounds, be on
*  the right side of history to have turned down a double grand slam to be in an event that supports
*  athlete pay.
*  Again, I don't overly criticize him, but I think in terms of your legacy and reputation to be at a
*  point and choose to do that is much more memorable than him getting that double grand slam, which I'm
*  sure he will win the ADCC 77 kilo division this year, but it'll be somewhat tarnished anyway.
*  So I do feel bad for some of the athletes that win this year and potentially people will be like,
*  oh yeah, but that was half the people weren't in the division.
*  I feel bad for those guys.
*  But at the end of the day, most of these guys had an opportunity to be a part of an event that really
*  there's no downside to.
*  You'll have a chance to be paid more money than you've ever been paid in your life.
*  You're selling tickets that are going to go to charity and it's not behind a paywall.
*  So anyone anywhere in the world can stream this event, watch it, and there's no barrier to entry
*  in terms of finances.
*  Was there ever any chance that Gordon Ryan would enter?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't think so.
*  Is that something you tried?
*  Me and Gordon don't text each other too often.
*  I tag him on Instagram and things, but he doesn't respond.
*  Tell me about your history with Nicholas Marigold.
*  My history with Nicholas Marigold.
*  Actually, it dates back to a time where probably he does not even remember back when I used to
*  wear a kimono.
*  So I went to Abu Dhabi world probes chasing my gi dreams.
*  I lost in, I can't even remember again, probably the final, no me.
*  I probably lost in the final against Tommy Langlacker in the weight division.
*  This was the last year they did the absolute.
*  I went into the absolute.
*  I made it all the way to the semis.
*  Nicholas Marigold destroyed me in the gi.
*  I did hit a nice little reversal on him though.
*  He passed my guard and I somehow reversed him from side control.
*  That's the only part of the match I share after which he swept me, submitted me.
*  You reversed them from side control.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So that could be like an instructional.
*  That could, yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  But the right place, right time though.
*  But then years later, I left the team.
*  Marigold replaced me.
*  So they brought in a more credentialed, handsome, doesn't speak as well, but
*  they brought him in, he's my replacement.
*  He's coming to the team.
*  We face off at ADCC.
*  I'm, I do a heavier division thinking, I looked at the names and I was like, that
*  looks like an easy division.
*  And I had two teammates at the time that were in my 88 and I was like, those guys
*  will have to face off first round.
*  I'll have to face one of them second round, the way they do the seeding and
*  the structure of the bracket.
*  So I was like, I'll do 99.
*  I'll leave 88 for the boys.
*  They both lost my division first round, unfortunately.
*  So I faced off against Marigold beginning a day to lot of pressure because
*  Dana has used to corner me, used to be my coach.
*  Now he's cornering the Brazilians.
*  So we used to complain about as the enemy.
*  And I'm like, what's going on over here?
*  It's like karate kid stuff.
*  I face up against Marigold.
*  I go hard early because I think he can't defend leg locks.
*  For the first three minutes, I'm just attacking legs, legs, legs.
*  I ended up sweeping him, getting on top, no points before the points period.
*  But I'm very, I'm very tired at this point.
*  Marigold is big.
*  Like there's some guys that get juiced up to hit a certain weight.
*  That's what I did to enter this division.
*  You can't keep your gas tank.
*  Marigold is just a big dude.
*  I don't know who knows if he's on the juice or not, but he's just naturally
*  sits around 230 pounds or even 225.
*  When you're naturally that big, your gas tank's a bit better.
*  Again, if you balloon yourself up on every substance possible, gas
*  tank's surprisingly not too good.
*  So we have a bit of a close one.
*  Decision goes my way.
*  Ultimately finals next, I lose that.
*  But that is sort of our competitive history.
*  We were meant to have a match that had been pre-booked immediately after ADCC.
*  So we agreed to this before ADCC.
*  I was like, the price is right.
*  I'm in.
*  So I signed up for it and I'm thinking ADCC that we're going to face off soon after.
*  Marigold chose instead to have some vacation time.
*  He wanted to go on vacation.
*  He wanted to relax, put a relaxation down in Brazil.
*  So the match is scrapped.
*  Flo hit me up and they say, can you do February?
*  And this was about the time that Valks fought Islam in Perth.
*  I was like, no, I can't do February because I'll be helping Volkanovsky.
*  That's going to take precedence over this match.
*  Flo goes, you know what we'll do?
*  We'll announce it anyway.
*  We'll sell those tickets anyway.
*  We'll get the people hyped and then we'll just have you pull out.
*  And I'm like, all right, do it.
*  Do it.
*  I'm like, do whatever you want.
*  That's fucking probably not a good idea, but they do that.
*  And then people keep trying to rebook this match, but now I barely even train anymore.
*  I'm busy being a promoter, traveling around.
*  So now instead of facing him in competition again, which I would do if the price was
*  right, that have to pay me very well.
*  Two of the shows have offered me the match, but the money, terrible.
*  What do you think is a number that would, uh, would convince you?
*  It would have to be, I would think half a million dollars.
*  Otherwise I just can't be bothered.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It has to be worth it because to put a price on a guy that takes himself as serious as
*  Mary Garley, Mary Garley is a very serious man.
*  He's talking about authenticity.
*  He's talking about words he doesn't even understand.
*  For me to give him the opportunity to live in a world where he had won the last
*  match against me, it's hard to put a price on that.
*  It's, you know, when people say it's not about the money, it's not about the money.
*  It's about me waking up every day, knowing that he knows he lost to me.
*  So you think you've gotten it in his head?
*  Yes.
*  How do you think you would do if you were to face him for the, for the said 500,000?
*  For the 500?
*  Yeah.
*  I think over five minutes, I beat anyone in the world.
*  You still think you got it?
*  I still think I got it.
*  Gabby about to find out too.
*  All right.
*  You see, you're going to make a statement with Gabby like that.
*  It'll be a match.
*  It'll be a match she remembers.
*  Yeah.
*  She, yeah, she for sure.
*  I think the fans will remember it as well.
*  I'm open to it.
*  Like, if we do this match, I'm taking it very serious, but we'd be open to rematches.
*  I've always said I would have a MMA fight with her.
*  I wouldn't be afraid to hit a big woman.
*  So unlike with Marigold, if you win, you're not going to ride off to the
*  sunset with Gabby.
*  I'm a bit of a romantic.
*  I think she deserves a few finishes, you know, not one and hit the bed that night.
*  So you think, you think you can actually beat Nicholas Marigold?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, I mean, you could throw a riddle at him before the match.
*  That'd fucking complicate things for him for the next hour.
*  Will you and Gordon ever get along again?
*  I think so.
*  I think we need the origins of MDMA was couples therapy in the seventies in
*  Houston, I believe.
*  I believe something like that for us could resolve these underlying issues.
*  You're a man of Reddit because they suggested that you should consider
*  ketamine therapy sessions.
*  Just imagine a therapist sitting down with him.
*  They would, they'd be like clear the schedule for the next couple of weeks.
*  With all due respect, Craig, I can't imagine a therapist sitting down with you.
*  That would be a terrifying.
*  I do have a therapist actually.
*  They prescribed me Vyvanse.
*  He's, he's quite confident in my,
*  Is this the madam in Bali or what did you?
*  It's a Russian, Russian website.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the old Sean Connery thing.
*  It's, it's not a therapist.
*  It's just something that's spelled the same.
*  Uh,
*  Me and Gordon, a debate of some thought would be awesome.
*  Like a political debate.
*  Yeah.
*  Me representing Kamala Harris and him representing Donald Trump.
*  So intellectual sparring.
*  An intellectual battle, a battle of wits.
*  Can you just speak to your trolling?
*  Is there like underneath it all?
*  Is there just a respect the human beings you go after?
*  For sure.
*  They have to be worthy of being attacked.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, um, if someone attacks, that's the thing.
*  It's like you want to, a worthy adversary, not in a sense of, I don't want to battle
*  someone that has better banter than me because I'm going to lose, but I want to battle
*  someone with a profile large enough that it doesn't look like it just.
*  Who do you think is the biggest troll or a shit talker in martial arts?
*  Pernata Larrunga.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you can't, you can't even put him in the, he's another class of human being.
*  He's overqualified.
*  Chael Solon comes to mind.
*  Chael is good.
*  You versus Chael.
*  Who, who's a better shit talker?
*  If you look at the entirety of the career.
*  Chael is better.
*  I mean, I think if you can shit talk in MMA, cause there's, there's far
*  worst consequences for you.
*  If you're still willing to do it when really violent things can happen to you.
*  I mean, I'm getting death threats, but like he, he has a certainty of violence
*  against his opponents in MMA.
*  So on Reddit, somebody said you are a coral belt level troll and just
*  happened to be good at Jiu-Jitsu.
*  So what did it take for you to rise to the ranks of trolling from
*  white belt to the black belt?
*  To coral belt.
*  What's your journey?
*  We're talking shit.
*  That's a good question.
*  Hey, I think it would have happened after I moved to America.
*  Cause in Australia, like we just on a daily basis, say some of the worst
*  things you could ever imagine.
*  Like in private life.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, we just trying to ruin each other's day in a way that's so
*  blas√© you're going back and forth.
*  And the guy that actually gets upset and says some real shit.
*  That's your victory.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, you're like, oh, we gotcha.
*  You're actually, that actually bothers you.
*  All right.
*  We'll take that as a victory.
*  All right.
*  So when you come to America and everybody takes themselves a little too
*  seriously, those are just a bunch of victims you can take advantage of.
*  An Australian entering American banter is like Neo getting his matrix skills.
*  You're just like, whoa, I see everything coming.
*  Do you ever look in the mirror and like regret how hard you went in the paint?
*  At somebody?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't think so.
*  You see, you're proud of yourself.
*  I think what I offer is some balance.
*  It's like I'm bringing some justice ultimately to probably come back in spades to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know as a fan of yours, as a fan of Gordon's also, but as a fan of yours,
*  I, um, I see the love behind it.
*  I don't know.
*  It's always, it seems always just fun.
*  The shit talking seems fun.
*  I wish you'd buy it back.
*  It does.
*  It doesn't buy it back anymore though.
*  What's your relationship like with Mo, the organizer of ADCC?
*  I mean, it's been a love hate relationship.
*  I guess it was Gabby.
*  So like any good relationship, if you don't get blocked at the end of it, were you
*  really in love to begin with?
*  That's my thoughts anyway.
*  But so in terms of my friendship with Mo, me and Mo were really close friends
*  for a long time, we'd talk a lot.
*  He was instrumental in us moving down to her death squad to Puerto Rico.
*  He lives in Puerto Rico, spends most of his time in Puerto Rico.
*  Uh, I've spent time with him in Florida, California, but in terms of our
*  relationship, I'm trying to think of an exact time where it went south.
*  But I guess in my, him being the ADCC organizer in my attack of athlete
*  compensation was taken personally, which is obviously going to ruin whatever
*  friendship you had.
*  And that started around the time you weren't thinking about CJA.
*  I mean, to be honest, CJI was a result of the response of my discussion of
*  athlete compensation.
*  So me and Mo had been close friends, even after the down to her team broke up.
*  We were still close friends for quite a while after that, but it does
*  complicate things when someone is for all intents and purposes, he as an
*  ADCC competitor and he runs ADCC the event, he's in control of it now.
*  He is your boss.
*  So that does complicate our friendship.
*  Have you had a conversation since you announced CJI?
*  Have we had a conversation?
*  When did you get blocked?
*  I don't see you getting blocked.
*  I was just joking.
*  Honestly, we had a disagreement about athlete compensation.
*  I said, let's do a podcast and talk about it because I'm a big fan of
*  transparency.
*  If you think I'm an idiot for thinking athletes should get paid more, tell me
*  it, show it to me.
*  And I've made public statements.
*  Other people have asked why we don't get paid more money.
*  You can both tell me and the world at the same time, the, the gravity of
*  the same time, the grappling world at the same time, but was not interested
*  in doing the podcast.
*  Again, maybe he thought I was going to hit him with some gotcha questions or
*  something, but really at the end of the day, I personally believe you've got
*  nothing to hide.
*  If you are confident in the business decisions you've made, then there's no
*  gotcha moment that I could actually do.
*  I could easily, I would have done the podcast if I looked like a complete
*  idiot would have released it anyway, because it would be a good message to
*  where we are in the sport.
*  But again, considering what I know about Thomas and Max Price, which I believe
*  we're paying $200,000 for and T-Mobile's $2 million, how do you justify no
*  increase in athlete pay while we have a 1.8 million increase in venue cost?
*  So you're saying that there could potentially be poor business decisions,
*  poor allocation of money that could be reallocated better to support the
*  athletes.
*  I've never once thought this was some organization where Moe's like stealing
*  money for himself.
*  I'm just saying that, and again, the road to hell is paved with good intention.
*  So he might fully think that what he's doing is going to grow the sport.
*  I'm going about it in a completely different way.
*  I don't think we need T-Mobile.
*  I don't think we need a behind the paywall.
*  I think we need cheap venue, still maintain good quality production,
*  release it for free.
*  If you want something to grow, present it for free.
*  Is there a future where the two of you talk?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  He keeps insisting on talking face to face.
*  I don't have a problem with that, but my argument is this is a public feud.
*  The public, like this is, this is a, we're having a disagreement.
*  Let's settle the disagreement in a way that answers the question to the fans.
*  Because if one of us is a complete idiot, then I believe the world of people
*  following this story are entitled to know which one of us is an idiot.
*  If you talk to them, would you be good faith?
*  Like would you turn off the, or turn the troll down from 11 to like a three?
*  I don't even think I need a troll.
*  It might just say, Hey, why, like, like show us the books.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like honestly, when our events done, we're going to be pretty transparent.
*  Obviously we are ran as a nonprofit.
*  We're going to be pretty transparent about everything.
*  And I mean, obviously ultimately all the views we get when flow graph, when an
*  event on flow grappling or fight pass or any other streaming provider, unless
*  it's a paper view, you're not going to know how many people watched.
*  So that's one aspect of what we're doing is we're going to have a visual sort
*  of guide to how many people are fans of grappling.
*  Yeah.
*  Transparency in all of its forms.
*  That's what bothers me about the ILC with the Olympics is that there's this
*  organization that puts on an incredible event, but there is, it's completely
*  opaque, it's not transparent and the athletes don't get paid almost at all.
*  So it's usually from sponsorships and they, they sell distribution, broadcast
*  distribution, and so like it's mostly pay walled after, after the fact, it's very,
*  unless you're a super famous athlete or a famous event, it's hard to watch.
*  I don't know the, the, uh, the early rounds of the weightlifting or the
*  judo or the, all of the competitions where most of those athletes get paid almost
*  nothing and they've dedicated their whole life, like they've sacrificed
*  everything to be there and we don't get to watch them openly.
*  You can't, in many cases, you can't even pay for it with, with ILC.
*  I've got to experience this because I'll have like podcast conversations with
*  like Judoca for example, and I put like a little clip in a podcast and, uh, the
*  Olympics channel takes it down immediately.
*  So they have all the videos uploaded private, they're private.
*  Oh, the flag, the copyright.
*  They just flag the copyright automatically from the private videos.
*  They could release, they could release somewhere, even if it's pay walled,
*  which I'm against, but pay wallet, but make it super easy accessible.
*  So the flow grappling model is still okay.
*  I'm against it.
*  Uh, but if you do a really good job of it, okay, I can kind of understand
*  a membership fee, but like, it should be super easy to use.
*  But in the case of the Olympics, first of all, in the case of the Olympics,
*  the whole point of the Olympics is for it to be accessible to everybody.
*  So paywalling goes against the spirit of the Olympic games.
*  And I will say the same is probably true for many sports like grappling,
*  especially from major events like ADCC that I feel like they should be openly
*  accessible to everybody, like on every platform, but you, what was the decision
*  like for you to, to make it accessible on YouTube and X?
*  And well, I mean, just because basically it's going to grow the sport.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's, if you have to subscribe to a platform to watch something, you
*  have a mild interest in a mild curiosity.
*  And there's a financial barrier there.
*  So I want to open it up because again, we have an investor who's contributing
*  and is happy for it to be spent this way.
*  Happy for us not to be held hostage by these sort of streaming providers.
*  And really like, again, I'm not making accusations, it's flow grappling
*  or UFC fight pass.
*  They are making the right business decision by not providing streamer
*  numbers, because that's leverage that those people can use against the
*  streaming provider.
*  But for me as an individual athlete, they really want us to understand the
*  metrics of how many people actually watch this sport to leverage that in my
*  own sponsorship negotiations.
*  Then if I'm in a position to have this out free and also give every athlete
*  involved the same metrics and information, like you will literally be able to see
*  the spikes when you compete and you'll be able to take that and present it for
*  opportunities for sponsorships, for businesses to say, look, look how many
*  views this got, I was one of the most viewed moments of this event.
*  So I want to put the power back in the athlete and take it away from the host.
*  And it creates a lot of incentive for the athlete to make it exciting.
*  Yeah.
*  This is your time.
*  It might never happen again.
*  I fully intend to run this every year.
*  That's the goal.
*  But again, it might never happen again.
*  Is there a possible future where the 2026 ADCC is run by Craig Jones?
*  Could I take over ADCC?
*  I think from an ADCC perspective, it would make a lot of sense.
*  I think it would make a lot of sense to wait to see if this event turns into
*  Fire Festival first before you commit to something like that.
*  But I think a more modern approach to the promotion of the event.
*  Again, I keep going back to the comedians.
*  You know, I mean, if you want to grow your brand, whatever that may be,
*  provide content for free and you can pay well, eventually you can grow the
*  audience, create the audience free.
*  You know, I think the, again, if your goal is to create a huge sport here, then
*  it's like, if we're already a niche sport and competition aspect of that, is it
*  even smaller niche, then we need to grow that, providing this content for free.
*  Well, having just chatted with, uh, with Elon Musk, who fundamentally believes
*  that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely that to me, if the
*  universe has a sense of humor, you would certainly, Craig Jones would
*  certainly be running ADCC, which would be, I mean, it would just be like
*  beautifully hilarious.
*  It would be a poetic ending.
*  It would be a underdog story from a man that could never win the event to run
*  in the event on behalf of the shake time.
*  Uh, so I saw a B team videos of, uh, the CGI camp, people training super hard.
*  So you aside who don't seem to do things in a standard way, uh, what does it
*  take to sort of, uh, put yourself in a peak shape, peak performance for, for a
*  huge event like the CGI or the ADCC?
*  I mean, it's psychologically, it's really, really brutal.
*  Like for me, anytime I'm leading up to any event of any meaningful significance,
*  it's, it's horrible on a psychological level because you're always thinking
*  about, are you training enough?
*  Are you doing enough?
*  If you feel any signs of sickness, injury, the stress that was increased,
*  your sleep quality decreases.
*  It's all those little subtle things.
*  They're so hard to mitigate.
*  So like, whether you feel like you're training hard enough, you're over
*  training, those to me are the most difficult aspects.
*  And I think really those are an individual thing.
*  And that's really something where a coach can provide what he thinks to you is
*  the right amount of work, you know?
*  And I think that's different for different people.
*  I think Nikki Rod could do eight hours a day.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think Nikki Ryan, eight minutes.
*  I saw a video of Nikki Ryan, like with the trash can throwing up and the top
*  comment is like, that's him doing the warmup.
*  That is satisfying to watch.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah.
*  So you're supposed to train hard enough to where you have this
*  confidence that you're prepared.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's an impossible thing to grasp.
*  It's like, um, some of the best performances I've had, I've been
*  called up last minute or I've been sick or my camp's been horrible.
*  And for me personally, I've gone in there and thought, relaxed, almost
*  like, oh, well, you know, like you got caught up a week ago, you're injured.
*  You miss four weeks of your camp.
*  And I went in there super relaxed and accepting of the result and performed much better.
*  Sometimes when I know three months out, I've got an event coming up and that
*  event only happens every two years.
*  It just, the stress of that alone.
*  Like I personally, on an individual level, more of a, I'd rather wing it.
*  I'd rather be in the stands and just roll down like Gunnar Nelson.
*  I remember he had a brilliant performance in an ADCC absolute.
*  And he was out drinking the night before.
*  He had no idea he was competing the next day.
*  He was in the stands eating ice cream and they called his name out for the absolute.
*  And he went out there and I believe he got bronze.
*  I believe he beat Jeff Munson.
*  So it's like, it's different for different people.
*  Obviously you don't want that to be the standard.
*  You've got to be putting in the work at all times.
*  But even now in my crazy travel schedule where I don't train
*  anywhere near like I used to.
*  As long as your game is technical and as long as your body's in good condition,
*  I believe you can still train well against world class guys.
*  You might not be able to do an hour straight, but if you're technique
*  orientated, you're just losing fitness.
*  So is it possible to out cardio Craig Jones?
*  Like is your game fundamentally technique based game?
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never wanted to win anything bad enough to train properly for it.
*  Right.
*  But isn't that the secret to your success being lazy?
*  I think so.
*  I think that's the, can I, can I be the only logical explanation, you know?
*  And I also use it as mind games too.
*  Like I, again, no one knows whether what I'm saying is true or not.
*  Right.
*  And I'm not saying this story to say anything bad about my opponent at the time, but
*  I booked two matches and two consecutive weekends and I've been traveling.
*  I think I just got back from one of my trips.
*  I've been over international snow.
*  I didn't even know where the fuck I was, but you're in Texas right now, by the way,
*  just in case you forgot Texas just for you.
*  Thank you, man.
*  This is an honor, but I hadn't really even trained.
*  I couldn't train.
*  Like I was traveling, just had no ability to train.
*  I trained for like a week, had the full road match.
*  And I said to myself, I was down in Mexico city and I said, you know what?
*  If you win this match, you got to face Lovato next week.
*  Don't go out and party.
*  Don't celebrate the victory.
*  But as a 32 year old man at the time, hitting a flying triangle submission, I
*  thought that deemed a worthy after party.
*  And we got out of control that night.
*  And it wasn't until the next day I woke up, I was like, Oh, I have Lovato next weekend.
*  But I'm also, people don't know whether I'm telling the truth or not, but it's
*  also, I'm almost too honest because I'll be like doing interviews saying, yeah, I
*  was out partying and I barely trained.
*  The opponent looks into that and they question it.
*  Is he telling the truth?
*  Is he baiting me?
*  Is he really that unconcerned?
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's almost a psychological battle in and of itself, but for the most part, it's true.
*  So to you being psychologically relaxed is extremely important.
*  Just not giving a damn.
*  I wonder what that is.
*  Not too much pressure.
*  I don't want pressure.
*  I don't like the pressure.
*  But you like the pressure when it comes to the internet.
*  Shit talking.
*  Well, I mean, you get to silently sit back and think about a good response, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  How important is it to just go crazy, hard rounds leading up to the
*  competitions like that?
*  You said sort of Nicky Rod, but like on average for like athletes at the world
*  class level, do you have to put in the hard rounds?
*  Yeah, I think you have to put in the hard rounds.
*  It depends at what point in your career you are, you know, like I think like
*  someone like Nicky Ryan might almost train too technically too often.
*  And when he comes to competition, it's a confronting experience when someone
*  hits him hard and he feels that pressure.
*  So I think different people require different things.
*  When Nicky Rod is breaking the spine of a 37 year old father of three bus driver,
*  it might be time for him to train in a more technical manner.
*  So it's like you got to cater to what they need.
*  And again, depending on the opponent, it's a game of strategy, you know, like for
*  me, when I was more active, I look at an opponent that I want that I could steal
*  some clout from off of which the cloud you can make money.
*  And I think to myself, what's the best rule set I can beat them in.
*  That's the strategy.
*  And then how would I beat him in that rule set?
*  So there's so many strategic layers to it.
*  They go above and beyond just the training for me, but nowadays I like to, if I
*  train short duration, high intensity, that's the best of me.
*  I don't like this six or like 10, six minute rounds, whatever.
*  Like I don't like this long training.
*  I don't like it's it's for me, it's too much toll on the body.
*  I think I go to the gym, we bang, maybe the first round, slightly line, and then
*  just bang it out two hard rounds, tops, a little bit of problem solving, get out of
*  that because you want to feel the, a little bit of the competition intensity.
*  That feels the best on my body.
*  When you're traveling, you're doing seminars and just doing Jiu Jitsu with folks.
*  Are you training with them?
*  I'm sure there's like, from everything I see, people would love to train with you.
*  Yeah, they want to, they want to, I mean, I don't know what it is.
*  Obviously you, I guess you, it's like, it's like people want to play basketball
*  with like a basketball star or something.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But I guess you played one-on-one with a basketball.
*  There's no great risk of injury.
*  You know, that's, that's, that's the real problem is like, if you don't roll
*  at your seminar, the seminar participants don't feel like they got the full
*  experience, but there's snipers at these seminars, there's these sharks that
*  circling wanting to attack you and you have to look at it, you look at it from
*  both perspectives, I think you should provide excellent technique, excellent
*  question and answer time, and I think you should roll a little bit for the most
*  part of these days, I'll just roll 30 minutes straight.
*  I'll just do 10 guys, three minutes, no break, 30 minutes straight.
*  I might even get the guy to pick.
*  Cause again, if you, some of these guys come in hot.
*  Yeah, it's terrifying, man.
*  Because the thing is like with Anthony Bourdain sort of analogy here, like
*  you're exploring all parts of the world.
*  You just want to be there in the culture, teach good techniques and just socialize.
*  You don't want to like, there's just a bunch of killers
*  that are trying to like murder you.
*  Yeah.
*  They, they, to them, they're like, I get to test myself against a world-class
*  athlete today and to you, you're like, oh, I'm in Odessa.
*  I'd like to get to know the people, try some food, have a couple of drinks
*  and enjoy the place, but to them, it's time, it's time to go.
*  You got to rope it open a bit, you know, like if I, if I meet pressure
*  with pressure, I get tired.
*  But if I don't provide resistance where they think there should be resistance
*  now it slows their pace down.
*  They get shocked a bit, but 100%.
*  If I'm at a seminar and someone's rolling too hard with me, if I feel
*  like I might get hurt, I will 100% rip a submission on them.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's like where you're confronted with a threat.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to meet it with a threat.
*  It's like, uh, I've spoken about this with Ryan Hall, Ryan Hall, give
*  them a warning and then gone.
*  And I think it's perfectly acceptable.
*  Like I won't endanger them for no reason, but if you're coming hot,
*  you better tap fast.
*  If I feel a threat, you better tap.
*  I'm not going to break, break it for the sake of breaking it.
*  But if you're, if you do some crazy shit and that might potentially
*  hurt me and I'll get a submission and I'm tired.
*  If you're fresh, you can catch a heel hook, hold it tight.
*  The guy tries to wiggle out.
*  You got it.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're tired and you've been nice with a heel hook and then they slip
*  out and club you in the head, then next time is going to be the last time.
*  Well, last time, see you're another level, you and Ryan Hall just world
*  class, but like for me, I'm trying to find navigate through this.
*  Cause I'd like to be able to roll, you know, like 10 rounds for fun, for
*  cultural, like they're coming for you.
*  And, uh, unfortunately, ripping submissions or like, you know, neon
*  belly, some kind of dominant position.
*  People don't like hear the message at all.
*  Or if I let them submit me a bunch of times, they don't calm down either.
*  So it's, I've been trying to figure out, uh, how to solve that puzzle.
*  Cause I'd like to keep rolling with people across the world for like, for
*  many more years to come, but it's tough.
*  You got to do it.
*  If you, if you've reached any level of notoriety, whether it's in the sport or
*  just as a celebrity, you're better off to just have three, four trusted training
*  partners and train privately.
*  That's the sad situation.
*  People used to say, Oh, you could be such as such a good anti-gym.
*  Not those days are over now.
*  Now, if you show up and you have any sort of name, they're coming to kill.
*  You better honestly, you better off.
*  It's so much safer.
*  Tre training is about trusting.
*  Trust is built from safe rounds.
*  Yeah.
*  Strangers.
*  Uh, scary.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm trying to develop a radar.
*  When I look at a person trying to like figure out, are they, are they from Eastern Europe?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good one.
*  You know what?
*  Anyone that wears a pitbull sports rash guard or anyone from the country of
*  Poland, be ready.
*  Oh, Polish people go hard.
*  People go hard.
*  I've never had a flow roll with a Polish person.
*  Uh, somebody on Reddit asked, how many legs did you break in Eastern Europe?
*  Three or four.
*  To send a message or just for your own personal enjoyment.
*  I don't enjoy it.
*  You know, they don't enjoy the violence.
*  It is humorous after the fact though, but I mean, it's just like, Hey, like,
*  bro, I'm jet lagged, I'm tired.
*  I'm here for you guys.
*  Why are you trying to hurt me?
*  You know, like if I get a submission tap, don't hesitate at all.
*  Don't hesitate.
*  You know, like it's like, it's, I mean, you just use dangerous.
*  It's a dangerous thing.
*  And when strangers going crazy, it's that show they think they're getting
*  the invites to CJI if they tap me.
*  It's just wild.
*  Uh, so speaking of which just for the hobbyist, for a person just starting out,
*  what wisdom can you provide?
*  Like say you, you were tasked with coaching a beginner, a hobbyist beginner.
*  How would you help them, uh, become good in a year?
*  What would be the training regimen?
*  What would be their approach, mental, physical, in terms of practice?
*  I mean, honestly, picking safe training partners and trying to understand the
*  positions and not just freaking out.
*  Like, uh, you might escape if you freak out, but you also might be stuck in
*  something and you injure yourself.
*  So it's like, I think if you can, it's, it's just about longevity.
*  You know, like, uh, if you can train, find a pace to train at and, uh, like sort
*  of intensity and the right people, you could potentially train five years
*  without injury, it's really about how you move if you are always moving in an
*  explosive way, eventually you're going to do that from a position in which.
*  You can't move and then someone's going to tear.
*  And you also want to be able to trust training partners to not go too
*  crazy and flip too much pain.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, uh, yeah, I think I've managed to avoid a lot of injuries
*  because I just never roll too athletically explosively.
*  I think I'm probably incapable of moving at that rate of speed.
*  So that's part of it is you, the way you move, but I guess you also don't allow
*  anybody to put you in a really bad position in terms of hurting you.
*  I let them put me in bad position, but I started to stay relaxed at all times.
*  You know, that's the, that's the key here is like, uh, I mean, yeah, obviously
*  you got the cheesy, keep it playful, but it's like, if you really keep, if you
*  can remain calm in bad positions, that is a skill that's your confidence, not
*  in yourself, but that the other guy's incapable of submitting you.
*  That's the ultimate confidence.
*  You can give them whatever you want.
*  So the thing you want as a beginner is to focus on minimizing injury by, by
*  relaxing, by not going, by not freaking out.
*  Yes.
*  Keeping it at a pace so you can understand what just happened.
*  The thing is like, how do you know if you're freaking out or not as a beginner?
*  It feels like a, if you're panicking.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're, that's a good, if you're, I mean, I see a lot of beginners kind of
*  breathing, starting to breathe hard.
*  There's a tense up that's probably underneath that is panic.
*  Yeah.
*  If you can make someone panic, you fatigue them.
*  It's the same.
*  It's like, if you're, even if you're a higher level and you're worried
*  about getting your guard passed, it's the panic that leads to fatigue
*  and your guard retention.
*  But if you're, if you're so flexible, you remain calm.
*  I think it's cause you're not panicked.
*  Fear is the mind killer, but also you have one of the more innovative
*  games in Jiu-Jitsu history.
*  How'd you develop that?
*  How do you, how do you continue throughout your career?
*  How, how are you innovating?
*  What was your approach to learning and figuring positions out,
*  figuring submissions out?
*  I mean, financial motivation, if you can hit moves and no one else knows how to
*  do, you can sell those instructionals.
*  But also it keeps it interesting.
*  Cause it's like, I mean, it can get stagnant and boring, you know, like a
*  lot of people get to blue belt, they're good at one thing, they only do that one
*  thing.
*  I think it's finding creative ways to beat people and sometimes creativity
*  is in how they respond to it.
*  So if you can find a humiliating move to do to someone, we're not even necessarily
*  humiliating, but a move that is unexpected.
*  When you get hit with something you don't expect, I think that is sort of really
*  one of the most fun aspects of it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like you train to stay better than the people you're better than.
*  That's what keeps you in the game and finding creative ways to beat those
*  people is some of the most entertainment.
*  So that's just something that brings you joy.
*  Uh, is by doing the unexpected.
*  Yeah.
*  Trying to, if you get swept with something that you don't think should work, I
*  think that's fulfillment.
*  So your, your game is even a bit trolley.
*  Interesting.
*  So like, but what's the actual process of like, like with the Z-Guard, all the
*  innovative stuff you've done there, how you come up with ideas there?
*  I mean, you just studying tape, just study, study tape and try to reverse engineer.
*  Like if I see a, if I see something or I train with someone and it feels, you
*  know, when you have those moments where you're like, Oh, I don't even know what
*  they're doing here.
*  And if you can put someone in a position, they don't understand.
*  That's also where they panic.
*  So it's like creating different ways to make people panic.
*  But also, I mean, just innovation, like having fun with it, you know, like I
*  guess the artistic aspect of it is fun.
*  You can be creative in how you can beat people.
*  Did you say artistic or artistic?
*  Both.
*  Okay.
*  Just checking.
*  Uh, what's like the most innovative thing you've come up with?
*  What's like some of the cooler ideas you've come up with on the mat?
*  I don't think I've come up with anything, but I've popularized things, you know,
*  like certain styles of leg entry.
*  I definitely didn't invent them, but I popularized them.
*  Octopus Guard playing more from turtle, sort of the pinning style of game.
*  Like you get like as a, because of my jokes online, put me in a position of
*  power in the sport so that when I post content, it can popularize a move or
*  at least an instructional popularize a game.
*  But it's still, I'm not trying to sell inauthentic products.
*  I'm still, I want the technique to work.
*  Be functional.
*  But put some humor on top of it.
*  Like power bottom, your instructional names are pretty good.
*  And be changed that one.
*  I saw the name of that.
*  I mean, unfortunately, meta, the ads, we're not appreciating some of that humor.
*  So we had to soften, soften the titles a bit.
*  You got a, you got a phone call from the man said, change this.
*  I didn't.
*  Allegedly the company hosting it.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  What do you think about Zuck in general?
*  Like the fact that he trains Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Have you got a chance to train with him?
*  Cause you train with Volk.
*  I haven't trained with him.
*  I met him when Volk's fought Ilya.
*  We've spoken briefly.
*  Interesting guy for sure.
*  Loves Jiu-Jitsu, loves MMA.
*  He's really intending to compete in something.
*  I think.
*  Competing in Jiu-Jitsu intends to compete in MMA.
*  Has a beginner's mind.
*  He's humble about it.
*  It's interesting.
*  Was he ever in consideration for CJI?
*  Oh, I mean, we would love to have him.
*  I would love to have him, but he is coming off of ACL.
*  I think he's returned to sport.
*  He's August.
*  So I think he'll be back training again soon.
*  Yeah.
*  What's your relationship has been like with, with, with Volkowski?
*  Like what, what have you learned about martial arts, about grappling and
*  different domains, just training with him?
*  I mean, for me personally, what's so interesting about Volkowski is his,
*  I guess where he came from, you know, like it's like, uh, you have pre-existing
*  ideas of what a UFC champion is.
*  Again, I would say it's similar to when I started training Jiu-Jitsu and I
*  first traveled to America and got to train with some really famous people.
*  You realize how relatable they are in some aspects.
*  Volkowski trains a freestyle and it is humble beginnings, humble origins.
*  Like it's like, uh, it's a small gym in a small sort of beach side city.
*  They run in puzzle mats.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You think UFC champion, you don't think puzzle mat gym.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like he's not training at a American top team.
*  He's not at one of these big gyms.
*  So to me, it just shows what you're capable of through hard work and sort of
*  self-educating in such an isolated place.
*  It's insane to me that he's still considered probably the pound for pound
*  best featherweight ever in my opinion.
*  And he's basically come across and started late from a rugby background.
*  But also in terms of what I've learned on a technical level, I've picked up a lot
*  of stuff from him and sort of grappling exchanges, how to get back up, obviously
*  wall wrestling, um, in terms of how hard he trains, how hard he works.
*  The cardio aspect is insane.
*  His cardio workouts are absolutely insane.
*  So he's the opposite of you.
*  It's complete opposite of me, probably publicly and privately as an athlete.
*  Yeah.
*  The amount of work he puts in and just his, uh, sheer sort of mental willpower.
*  I remember there's been a couple of times where I've watched him do weight cuts
*  where like, that's horrible.
*  You watching your, your friend, you know, obviously we started as like, basically
*  I would help him in certain jujitsu aspects and then becomes a close friend of
*  yours, but the whole process of the MMA fight is horrible, especially when you
*  care about the person fighting, because some of those weight cuts you see at
*  awful, like you basically seeing guys eyes rolled back in their head, like him
*  just powering through a five kilo, 10 pound cut and just constantly talking
*  about how easy it is, but while clearly, I mean, these guys look like they're
*  dying, you know, like to push through that and then to push through some of the
*  moments in his, in his fight, to watch him be completely relaxed until like five
*  minutes before the fight.
*  And then he starts talking about, you're never going to take this belt away from
*  my family.
*  Like he's singing about his family before he fights his kids.
*  You know, you see the character change.
*  It's just absolutely insane to watch.
*  On the other side of that is obviously watching the ups and downs.
*  There's been so many ups.
*  The last two have been downs.
*  So you see in the full spectrum of the highest highs and the lowest lows.
*  How's he able to deal psychologically with loss?
*  I don't know.
*  Obviously still hungry, still motivated.
*  Obviously I thrive in a losing environment, but him, him on the other
*  hand, I'm not sure we don't talk too much on that level.
*  Obviously we check in his friends, see what he's up to, see what he's planning.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, we were trying to get him a grappling match at CJR.
*  I won't say the reasons it fell through, but we were setting one up with
*  Mikey Musumichi, but we couldn't get it done.
*  And you can't say the reasons why.
*  I'll say the reason, but it would have been, would have been awesome.
*  You think you could have set that up if you had more time, like set something
*  like, like part of the challenge here is for some of these gigantic matchups.
*  I feel like it takes time.
*  Yeah.
*  That being the promoter tournament, not as bad, the superfights really, really difficult.
*  I don't think we could have set it up with more time that particular match,
*  but that was the dream.
*  That's what we're hoping to do.
*  There's a lot of other interesting matchups you could have possibly gotten
*  through if there's more time.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd love to see, I mean, personally, I really want to see folks and Ortega
*  have an actual grappling match.
*  Cause we saw him get out of those deep submissions and apply a ton of ground
*  and power.
*  I'd love to see him just have a grappling match.
*  I'd love to see more of the UFC stars have grappling matches, especially if
*  they've had any head trauma in a fight.
*  It's like, Hey, let's keep them busy.
*  Cause as you see, some of those guys go crazy if they can't train.
*  What about the fights against Makachev?
*  You think Volk can beat him?
*  I think the first fight showed he could beat him for sure.
*  Showed it's possible.
*  Even in the second fight, when he reversed the grappling exchange, I wish
*  he'd tried to take Makachev down.
*  I really think he has a huge strength advantage against Makachev and I
*  personally believe he has a fence wrestling advantage.
*  You might not see it in a sense of the technical hip tosses and things like
*  that, like really, but I do believe Volk's one of the best, if not the best
*  cage wrestler in the world.
*  What do you think wins in a grappling match?
*  That would be interesting.
*  Right.
*  Be interesting.
*  The problem is to almost to, while you, while you are champion like Islam is,
*  you could just never book them.
*  You could never get it.
*  What do you think makes the Dagestani wrestlers and fighters so good?
*  I mean, I think personally, those guys are just like, they just love it.
*  It's just about like, it's how they train.
*  Like it's a fight to the death.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's just built in them.
*  They don't want to concede an inch ever.
*  I think for MMA and wrestling, that can be very, very good.
*  I think sometimes when those guys come over to Jiu-Jitsu specific events, they
*  get leg locked, they fall into traps, overly aggressive or overly evasive.
*  But I think the way they train just is perfect for a fight, a fight.
*  They can just forward pressure, eat some shots, grind a guy against the wall.
*  Fence wrestling is technical.
*  Jiu-Jitsu is far more technical.
*  There's way more things you can do in a grappling scenario.
*  From top and bottom than I think against the wall.
*  So a grinding nature of how they train works really good to walk a guy down
*  and take him down against the wall.
*  And then obviously with ground and pound, very good to hold a guy down.
*  So I think just never conceding an inch in training is just, they've done
*  that since they were born, basically.
*  So you learn how to grind somebody down.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they're just trying to break each other at all times, trying to have some
*  dominance over their friends and they train with.
*  But you think in the grappling context that will not always translate?
*  No, not when you can pull guard and submit from your back.
*  I think that sort of negates some of that grinding pressure.
*  I think that has to be met with more slow, technical, lateral movement.
*  I think that's the way you would.
*  Like that would be the dream for me is a guy just comes straight forward into my guard.
*  So that grinding approach works well if he's taken me down and got already close to me.
*  But if I'm laying flat on my back and he's standing and he has to engage, he has all
*  that danger at range.
*  But if he can connect to my body before we go down, now we're in his world again, I think.
*  I wonder if it's like, you know, Edd's prime could be versus you, for example.
*  Who do you think wins there?
*  Buggy choke for sure.
*  Buggy choke?
*  No way.
*  I know you're joking.
*  Are we getting with the buggy, I reckon?
*  Really?
*  So you can get the buggy choke at the highest level.
*  Can you educate me on that?
*  Like if that legitimately can work at the highest level?
*  Buggy choke for sure, yeah.
*  Really?
*  You can catch anyone.
*  Really?
*  Okay.
*  You're not a buggy believer.
*  I'm not a buggy hater either.
*  I'm just, I'm agnostic on the buggy choke.
*  Khabib would go to sleep for sure.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  There's no way he would tap to a buggy choke.
*  I try, who was it I faced recently?
*  I faced the Russian guy from Tatar.
*  I couldn't buggy him.
*  I was trying to close Gawain though.
*  Sort of like a, it is harder to pull off, but he, I had to put him to sleep twice at
*  the end of the match with a triangle, but he was just willing.
*  Like, I don't know, Eastern European guys, it's like, what, like they're fine.
*  They treating it like a real fight, you know?
*  Have you ever like gone hard with a Dagestani person?
*  Like grappling wrestling?
*  Any of the fighters, any of them are may guys?
*  Have I, have I, have I, I mean, they do train hard.
*  They do train hard.
*  When I did the seminar in Odessa, it was at a school, but another school in the
*  city brought like 10 Dagestani guys.
*  All of them went insanely hard.
*  I was like, guys, it's a small sample size, but they all wanted to be broken.
*  What do you think you as the wise sage of Jiu-Jitsu, if you look 10, 20 years out,
*  how do you think the game is going to evolve the art of it?
*  The art of it?
*  I mean, I think obviously people are going to keep innovating, perfecting
*  certain things, throwing out information, bad sort of techniques, bad sort of, but
*  I mean, it's so hard to predict.
*  It's like, that's the game of making money off the instructionals is
*  predicting where we go next.
*  It's so, so difficult.
*  What do you think is going to be the most popular submissions, CGI, ADCC this year?
*  Is it going to be footlocks or are we are naked?
*  I think, uh, actually CJI, I think there's going to be a lot of guys that don't
*  tap, that take injuries.
*  A small concern is that a guy wins the match, but he's so injured.
*  He's can barely go onto the next match.
*  Yeah.
*  But when the battle lose the war.
*  We are going to see that, aren't we?
*  People refusing to tap.
*  We're actually, we did the walkthrough yesterday and we were like one
*  ambulance is not enough.
*  Get a second one here.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause if they take one guy injured to hospital, we can't continue
*  until an ambulance comes back.
*  So these guys are going to go, everyone will be dagestanding for a day.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I think this tournament will achieve, but progression, it'll just be
*  the integration of wrestling into Jiu-Jitsu.
*  You know, I think that would be the most exciting way the sport could progress.
*  It's basically folk style wrestling, but an integration of submissions
*  from the standing position to, if you just follow the rules of, you should
*  always be fighting to get on top, whether that's a submission that leads to a
*  sweep or a sweep and you should be trying to avoid being pinned.
*  And as long as the game revolves around that and guys engage each other
*  offensively on the feet, that would be the most exciting, best way to watch
*  the sport.
*  Yeah.
*  When I show the sport as Jiu-Jitsu, the most exciting stuff is whenever both
*  people want to be wrestling, scrambling wrestling, they want to both want to
*  get on top.
*  Yeah.
*  That looks like fighting versus guard stuff.
*  I'm a guy that totally agrees with you, but if I think the guys are better
*  wrestler, I'll concede, you know, like it's like, that's the, that's the hard
*  part, but then the whole, the whole crowd will then mock you ceaselessly as
*  they should for conceding.
*  That's what the millions should be.
*  We should have a tournament or around Robin thing where it's like the
*  million goes to the most exciting man.
*  Yeah.
*  Who took the most risks.
*  I mean, in a way that's what's going to happen because this is quite open.
*  So the benefit of being exciting is you're going to be glorified on social
*  media and if you're going to be boring and stall, you're going to be
*  endlessly sort of willified.
*  And forget about medals.
*  Social media glory is all that matters.
*  Well, in a sense, on a basic human level.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, not what all that matters, but it's, you're not going to, if you're
*  going to stall, you're going to become a meme.
*  I feel like, especially with CGI.
*  And so is there, are the refs going to try to stop stalling?
*  Yeah, we're going to penalize them hard, hit them hard, get that boring shit out of there.
*  So what percentage of athletes would you say are on stairways?
*  Is it a hundred percent?
*  Anyone that's ever beaten me.
*  I take it more steroids than me.
*  I don't know.
*  I wanted to test them, but not to do anything bad, but just in the name of
*  science to see what people are running.
*  You know, it's so hard to say, cause you like, you train with people and they
*  don't even tell you what they're on.
*  I tell the world what I'm on and they go, look at you.
*  You're not taking any steroids.
*  That's like, it's like such a secret secret thing.
*  I personally think it's almost impossible to say, but occasionally you look at a guy
*  and you're pretty certain, you know, you're going to be a good athlete.
*  Yeah.
*  Looks, but you could also go the other way.
*  Certain people are just genetic built it and they look like they are.
*  And then there's probably others like yourself.
*  It's a, it's a self-defense mechanism.
*  Cause you'd rather assume that that guy was on steroids than his genetics
*  is so far superior to yours.
*  You're like, nah, it must be steroids.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the part of accusations of people being on steroids that I hate.
*  It's like without data, people are just like, it's, it's a way they can say
*  that somebody's cheating without, cause I like celebrating people.
*  And sometimes people aren't on steroids and they aren't cheating
*  and they're just fucking good.
*  What about Gabby Garcia?
*  Um, I think she's beautiful, strong, uh, and you're a lucky man to
*  share the mat with her.
*  I should be honored.
*  And I have, I'm betting a huge amount of money on her.
*  So
*  either way, you're going to get paid.
*  She's paying 11 to one.
*  I bet on love as well.
*  So we are aligned in that way.
*  Love will prevail.
*  Okay.
*  You put Alex Jones to sleep.
*  Uh, just to reflect back on that.
*  What was, he was too woke.
*  He needed it.
*  So that's you fighting the woke mind virus or whatever.
*  I think it was on the post too much.
*  What was that like?
*  I didn't, I didn't see the full video.
*  I just saw a little clip.
*  I thought he was dead for a second, but I, for some strange reason,
*  couldn't stop laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I was like, please wake up.
*  There's something, there's something funny about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, his blood pressure is higher than mine.
*  I hope that didn't cook him.
*  Yeah.
*  That would be quite sad.
*  It's so crazy.
*  He's murder somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  He's probably the most just entertaining human being ever.
*  Oh, just, just, he just says the crate like off air.
*  He's always on.
*  It's like, that's just, he's always ready to, to say some wild shit.
*  The craziest shit possible.
*  What's it like going to sleep?
*  I somehow I've never gone to sleep.
*  I went to sleep one time.
*  Lachlan jobs was demonstrating a technique on me, but I woke up straight away.
*  But for 10 seconds, I didn't know who I was, where I was, what I was doing.
*  But that's it.
*  That's the only time I went out.
*  Didn't feel good though.
*  Some people say it feels good.
*  Did not feel good.
*  Cause you were like, what panicked lost?
*  Yeah.
*  I was just, I just didn't know what was going on.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you load it.
*  And that's a cool, that must be a cool feeling to load it all back in.
*  Like realize where am I?
*  I feel like that's sometimes in a hotel when I'm like traveling.
*  It's like, where the fuck am I again?
*  And when you wake up, maybe that's what it's like.
*  Some people push it too far.
*  David Carradine.
*  What?
*  What?
*  I'm too, I'm too dumb to get that joke.
*  What a erotic asphyxiation.
*  Oh, good.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Now I know.
*  Uh, so given all the places you've gone, all the people you've seen recently,
*  what gives you hope about this whole thing we've got going on about humanity,
*  about this world, we start war sometimes, we do horrible things to each other.
*  Sometimes.
*  Wow.
*  I missed all that.
*  What gives you hope?
*  That you can still make fun of anything as long as it's funny.
*  That's what I'm, that's what I'm fighting for.
*  People talk about cancel culture.
*  I just think the joke wasn't funny enough.
*  Had poor delivery.
*  Well, thank you for being at the forefront of making fun of everything and anything.
*  And thank you for talking to me, brother.
*  Thank you, Brian.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Craig Jones to support this
*  podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Anthony Bourdain.
*  Travel changes you as you move through this life and this world.
*  You change things slightly.
*  You leave marks behind, however small and in return life.
*  And travel leaves marks on you.
*  Thank you for listening.
*  I hope to see you next time.
