# Israel-Palestine Debate: Finkelstein, Destiny, M. Rabbani & Benny Morris | Lex Fridman Podcast #418
**Lex Fridman:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs)
*  That's a good point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=0.0s)]
*  No, no, it's a good point. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1.0s)]
*  Now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised on YouTube to turn [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2.44s)]
*  up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8.82s)]
*  One of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13.18s)]
*  Normals say this all over and over and over again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  I only deal in facts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=22.54s)]
*  I don't deal in hypotheticals. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=23.54s)]
*  I only deal in facts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=24.54s)]
*  I only deal in facts. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=25.54s)]
*  And that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=27.38s)]
*  to the particular point you're trying to push. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  The idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=32.6s)]
*  always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition plan. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=37.68s)]
*  I don't think you understand politics. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=41.3s)]
*  They forced the British to prevent emigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe shores [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=43.64s)]
*  in Palestine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=48.32s)]
*  That's what they did. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=49.32s)]
*  And they knew that the Jews were being persecuted in Europe. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=50.32s)]
*  Was Palestine the only spot of land on earth? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=53.34s)]
*  Yes, basically that was the problem. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=56.9s)]
*  The Jews couldn't emigrate in Europe. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=58.46s)]
*  What about your great friends in Britain, the architects of the Balfour Declaration? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=59.94s)]
*  By the late 1930s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=64.34s)]
*  What about the United States? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=65.54s)]
*  They weren't happy to take in Jews and the Americans weren't happy to take in Jews. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=66.54s)]
*  And why are Palestinians who were not Europeans, who had zero role in the rise of Nazism, who [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=69.98s)]
*  had no relation to any of this, why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=76.62s)]
*  in Europe and uniquely culpable? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=82.22s)]
*  Because they were helping to close the only safe haven for Jews. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=83.22s)]
*  Professor Morris, because of your logic, and I'm not disputing it, that's why October [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=85.74s)]
*  7 happened. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=92.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=93.3s)]
*  Because there was no options left for those people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=94.3s)]
*  The Hamas guys who attacked the Kibbutzim, apart from the attacks on the military sites, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  when they attacked the Kibbutzim, were out to kill civilians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  And they killed family after family, house after house. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=107.78s)]
*  Talk fast, so people think that you're coherent. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=111.22s)]
*  I'm just reading from the UN. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=113.34s)]
*  Yeah, but you see- [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=114.34s)]
*  You like them sometimes, only when they agree with you though. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=115.94s)]
*  You've lied about this particular instance in the past. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=117.94s)]
*  Those kids weren't just on the beaches as often stated in articles. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=120.34s)]
*  Those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=122.86s)]
*  they have operated from. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  They literally- [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Borrelli, Mr. Borrelli, with all due respect, you're such a fantastic moron. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=128.3s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  The following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=138.5s)]
*  With Norman Filkenstein, Benny Morris, Muayen Rabbani, and Stephen Bennell, also known online [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=142.26s)]
*  as Destiny. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=147.82s)]
*  Norm and Benny are historians, Muayen is a Middle East analyst, and Stephen is a political [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=149.62s)]
*  commentator and streamer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  All four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=157.22s)]
*  The goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=161.42s)]
*  It wasn't to get views or likes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  I never care about those. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=169.34s)]
*  I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=171.34s)]
*  The goal was to explore, together, the history, present, and future of Israel and Palestine [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=177.06s)]
*  in a free-flowing conversation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=182.06s)]
*  No time limits, no rules. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning, and it only got more intense [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=187.94000000000003s)]
*  as we went along. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  And I quickly realized that this very conversation, in a very real human way, was a microcosm [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of Israel and Palestine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  For some debates, I will step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=208.26s)]
*  For this, I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges, because [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=213.18s)]
*  that emotion in itself spoke volumes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=218.1s)]
*  We did talk about the history and the future, but the anger, the frustration, the biting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=222.34s)]
*  wit, and, at times, respect and camaraderie were all there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=227.98s)]
*  Like I said, we did it in an, perhaps, all too human way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=233.82s)]
*  I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics, and I will continue [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=239.66s)]
*  to search for hope in the midst of death and destruction, to search for our common humanity [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=244.06s)]
*  in the midst of division and hate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  This thing we have going on, human civilization, the whole of it, is beautiful. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=254.06s)]
*  And it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=261.5s)]
*  I love you all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=271.06s)]
*  And now, dear friends, here's Norman Ficklestein, Benny Morris, Muin Rabbani, and Stephen Bonnell. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=273.9s)]
*  First question is about 1948. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=282.94s)]
*  For Israelis, 1948 is the establishment of the State of Israel and the War of Independence. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=286.06s)]
*  For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba, which means catastrophe, or the displacement of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=291.7s)]
*  700,000 Palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=297.26s)]
*  What to you is important to understand about the events of 1948 and the period around there, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=302.2s)]
*  1947, 1949, that helps us understand what's going on today and maybe helps us understand [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  the roots of all of this that started even before 1948. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=314.2s)]
*  I was hoping that Norm could speak first, and Benny, then Muin, and then Stephen. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=318.48s)]
*  Norm? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=324.0s)]
*  After World War II, the British decided that they didn't want to deal with the Palestine [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=325.32s)]
*  question anymore, and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=333.04s)]
*  Now, as I read the record, the UN was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate rights [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=339.52s)]
*  and wrongs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=348.76s)]
*  It was confronting a very practical problem. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=350.7s)]
*  There were two national communities in Palestine, and there were irreconcilable differences [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=355.16s)]
*  on fundamental questions, most importantly looking at the historic record on the question [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=364.04s)]
*  of immigration and associated with the question of immigration, the question of land. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  The UN Special Committee on Palestine, which came into being before the UN 181 Partition [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=379.36s)]
*  Resolution, the UN Special Committee recommended two states in Palestine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  There was a minority position represented by Iran, India, Yugoslavia. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=396.68s)]
*  They supported one state, but they believed that if forced to, the two communities would [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=405.82s)]
*  figure out some sort of modus vivendi and live together. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=416.9s)]
*  The United Nations General Assembly supported partition between what it called a Jewish [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=422.34s)]
*  state and an Arab state. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=429.86s)]
*  Now, in my reading of the record, and I understand there's new scholarship on the subject, which [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=433.54s)]
*  I've not read, but so far as I've read the record, there's no clarity on what the United [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=439.02000000000004s)]
*  Nations General Assembly meant by a Jewish state and an Arab state, except for the fact [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=446.94s)]
*  The UNSCOP, the UN Special Committee on Palestine, it was very clear, and it was reiterated many [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=457.5s)]
*  times, that in recommending two states, each state, the Arab state and the Jewish state, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=478.18s)]
*  would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens with regard to political, civil, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=489.1s)]
*  and religious matters. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=497.5s)]
*  Now, that does raise the question if there is absolute full equality of all citizens [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=499.26s)]
*  both in the Jewish state and the Arab state with regard to political rights, civil rights, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=507.62s)]
*  and religious rights, apart from the demographic majority, it's very unclear what it meant [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=515.38s)]
*  to call a state Jewish or call a state Arab. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  In my view, the partition resolution was the correct decision. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities could, at that point, be made [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  to live together. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  I disagree with the minority position of India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, and that not being a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=546.1s)]
*  practical option to states was the only other option. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  In this regard, I would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=560.94s)]
*  at the UN General Assembly proceedings by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Gromyko. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=568.7800000000001s)]
*  I was very tempted to quote it at length, but I recognized that would be taking too [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  much time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  So I asked a young friend, Jamie Sternweiner, to edit it and just get the essence of what [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=588.78s)]
*  Foreign Minister Gromyko had to say. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  During the last war, Gromyko said, the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=601.54s)]
*  Without any exaggeration, this sorrow and suffering are indescribable. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=613.06s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about in various countries of Europe in search [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=622.18s)]
*  of means of existence and in search of shelter. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  The United Nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=633.5799999999999s)]
*  This experience, particularly during the Second World War, shows that no Western European [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=642.98s)]
*  state was able to provide adequate assistance for the Jewish people in defending its rights [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=651.46s)]
*  and its very existence from the violence of the Hitlerites and their allies. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=660.54s)]
*  This is an unpleasant fact, but unfortunately, like all other facts, it must be admitted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=668.26s)]
*  Gromyko went on to say, in principle, he supports one state, or the Soviet Union supports one [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  state, but he said, if relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine proved [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=687.5s)]
*  to be so bad that it would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the peaceful [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=696.88s)]
*  coexistence of the Arabs and the Jews, the Soviet Union would support two states. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=703.86s)]
*  I personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable in the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=713.24s)]
*  long term if, and this is a big if, the Zionist movement had been faithful to the position [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=721.52s)]
*  it proclaimed during the unscrupulous public hearings. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=731.52s)]
*  At the time, Ben-Gurion testified, quote, I want to express what we mean by a Jewish [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=736.88s)]
*  state. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=747.74s)]
*  We mean by a Jewish state simply a state where the majority of the people are Jews, not a [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=749.64s)]
*  state where a Jew has in any way any privilege more than anyone else. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=757.16s)]
*  A Jewish state means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on democracy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=765.72s)]
*  Alas, this was not to be. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=777.64s)]
*  As Professor Morris has written, quote, Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=782.12s)]
*  elementally expansionist. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=792.48s)]
*  And then he wrote in another book, Transfer, the euphemism for expulsion. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=796.72s)]
*  Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism because it sought to transform a land which [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=805.32s)]
*  was Arab into a Jewish state. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  And a Jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of Arab population. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=820.22s)]
*  And because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs, which in turn [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=829.02s)]
*  persuaded the yeshuvs leaders, the yeshuv being the Jewish community, the yeshuvs leaders [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=836.9399999999999s)]
*  that a hostile Arab majority or a large minority could not remain in place if a Jewish state [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=843.5s)]
*  was to arise or safely endure. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=852.22s)]
*  Or as Professor Morris retrospectively put it, quote, a removing of a population was [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=856.66s)]
*  needed. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=865.98s)]
*  Without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=868.4599999999999s)]
*  Unquote. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=877.18s)]
*  The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=879.2199999999999s)]
*  I won't play games with that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=884.86s)]
*  I know a lot of people try to prove it's not true. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=886.62s)]
*  It clearly, in my view, is true. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=889.82s)]
*  The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=892.94s)]
*  While Israeli leaders acting on the compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism found the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=898.54s)]
*  pretext in the course of the first Arab-Israeli war to expel the indigenous population and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=911.5s)]
*  expand its borders. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=919.54s)]
*  I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=922.58s)]
*  and both sides aborted it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=932.1s)]
*  Thank you, Norm. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=935.3s)]
*  Norm asked that you make a lengthy statement in the beginning. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=936.3s)]
*  Benny, I hope it's OK to call everybody by their first name in the name of camaraderie. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=939.54s)]
*  Norm has quoted several things you said. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  Perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of 1948 and maybe respond to the things that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=947.6999999999999s)]
*  Norm said. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=952.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=953.18s)]
*  UNSCOP, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, recommended partition, the majority [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=954.18s)]
*  of UNSCOP recommended partition, which was accepted by the UN General Assembly in November [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=961.98s)]
*  1947, essentially looking back to the Peel Commission in 1937. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=966.58s)]
*  Ten years earlier, a British commission had looked at the problem of Palestine, the two [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=973.38s)]
*  warring national groups who refused to live together, if you like, or consolidate a unitary [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=977.58s)]
*  state between them. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=986.9000000000001s)]
*  And Peel said there should be two states. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=989.34s)]
*  That's the principle. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=991.98s)]
*  The country must be partitioned into two states. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=993.26s)]
*  This would give a modicum of justice to both sides, if not all their demands, of course. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=995.58s)]
*  And the United Nations followed suit. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  The United Nations, UNSCOP, and then the UN General Assembly, representing the will of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1004.9000000000001s)]
*  the international community, said two states is the just solution in this complex situation. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1008.6600000000001s)]
*  The problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution, the Arab states [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1015.86s)]
*  and the Arabs of Palestine said no, as Norman Finkelstein said. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1022.1s)]
*  They said no. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1026.94s)]
*  They rejected the partition idea, the principle of partition, not just the idea of what percentage [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1027.94s)]
*  which side should get, but the principle of partition they said no to. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1033.9s)]
*  The Jews should not have any part of Palestine for their sovereign territory. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1037.9s)]
*  Maybe Jews could live as a minority in Palestine. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1043.34s)]
*  That also was problematic in the eyes of the Palestinian Arab leadership. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1045.86s)]
*  Hosseini had said only Jews who were there before 1917 could actually get citizenship [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1049.7s)]
*  and continue to live there. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1055.26s)]
*  But the Arabs rejected partition, and the Arabs of Palestine launched in a very disorganized [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1057.46s)]
*  fashion, war against the resolution, against the implementation of the resolution, against [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1062.98s)]
*  the Jewish community in Palestine. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1067.6200000000001s)]
*  And this was their defeat in that civil war between the two communities while the British [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1071.22s)]
*  were withdrawing from Palestine, led to the Arab invasion, the invasion by the Arab states [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  in May 1948 of the country. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1082.98s)]
*  Again, basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1086.86s)]
*  in line with the United Nations decision and the will of the international community. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1092.26s)]
*  Hosseini said that the Zionist enterprise, and he quoted me, meant from the beginning [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1099.1s)]
*  to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine or some of the Arabs of Palestine. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1105.6599999999999s)]
*  And I think he's sort of quoting out of context. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1112.34s)]
*  The context in which the statements were made that the Jewish state could only emerge if [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1115.3799999999999s)]
*  there was a transfer of Arab population was preceded in the way I wrote it and the way [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1122.3s)]
*  it actually happened by Arab resistance and hostilities towards the Jewish community. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1127.74s)]
*  Had the Arabs accepted partition, there would have been a large Arab minority in the Jewish [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1133.66s)]
*  state which emerged in 1947. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1138.38s)]
*  And in fact, Jewish economists and state builders took into account that there would be a large [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1141.3000000000002s)]
*  Arab minority and its needs would be cared for, et cetera. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1147.8200000000002s)]
*  But this was not to be because the Arabs attacked. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1153.82s)]
*  And had they not attacked, perhaps a Jewish state with a large Arab minority could have [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1156.58s)]
*  emerged, but this didn't happen. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1162.18s)]
*  They went to war. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1164.66s)]
*  The Jews resisted. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1165.66s)]
*  And in the course of that war, Arab populations were driven out. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1166.74s)]
*  Some were expelled, some left because Arab leaders advised them to leave or ordered them [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1171.78s)]
*  to leave. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1177.2s)]
*  And at the end of the war, Israel said they can't return because they just tried to destroy [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1178.2s)]
*  the Jewish state. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1182.5s)]
*  And that's the basic reality of what happened in 1948. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1185.42s)]
*  The Jews created a state. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1189.42s)]
*  The Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to create a state before 1948 and in the [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1190.7s)]
*  course of the 1948 war. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1196.14s)]
*  And for that reason, they have no state to this day. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1198.24s)]
*  The Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state, fought for it, and established [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1201.54s)]
*  it hopefully, lastingly. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1208.02s)]
*  When you say hostility, in case people are not familiar, there was a full-on war where [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1211.62s)]
*  Arab states invaded and Israel won that war. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1218.06s)]
*  Let me just add to clarify. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1224.2199999999998s)]
*  The war had two parts to it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1226.26s)]
*  The first part was the Arab community in Palestine, its militiamen, attacked the Jews from November [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1228.76s)]
*  1947. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1236.78s)]
*  In other words, from the day after the UN Partition Resolution was passed, Arab gunmen [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1237.78s)]
*  were busy shooting up Jews. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1242.7s)]
*  And that snowballed into a full-scale civil war between the two communities in Palestine. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1244.42s)]
*  In May 1948, a second stage began in the war in which the Arab states invaded the new state, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1249.98s)]
*  attacked the new state, and they too were defeated. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1256.94s)]
*  And thus, a state of Israel emerged. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1260.74s)]
*  In the course of this two-stage war, a vast Palestinian refugee problem occurred. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1263.1s)]
*  And so after that, the transfer, the expulsion, the thing that people call the Nakba happened. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1271.82s)]
*  Muin, could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1279.1399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1284.1799999999998s)]
*  There's a lot to unpack here. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1285.1799999999998s)]
*  I'll try to limit myself to just a few points regarding Zionism and transfer. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1287.46s)]
*  I think Heim Weizmann, the head of the World Zionist Organization, had it exactly right [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1296.42s)]
*  when he said that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine as Jewish as England [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1303.3s)]
*  is English, or France is French. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1309.82s)]
*  In other words, as Norman explained, a Jewish state requires Jewish political, demographic, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1313.9s)]
*  and territorial supremacy. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1328.8200000000002s)]
*  Without those three elements, a state would be Jewish in name only. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1331.7800000000002s)]
*  distinguishes Zionism is its insistence, supremacy, and exclusivity. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1338.18s)]
*  That would be my first point. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1345.22s)]
*  The second point is I think what the Soviet foreign minister at the time, Andrei Gromyko, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1346.94s)]
*  said is exactly right with one reservation. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1354.26s)]
*  Gromyko was describing a European savagery unleashed against Europe's Jews. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1359.8600000000001s)]
*  At the time, it wasn't Palestinians or Arabs. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1366.78s)]
*  The savages and the barbarians were European to the core. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1371.02s)]
*  Had nothing to do with developments in Palestine or the Middle East. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1376.34s)]
*  Secondly, at the time that Gromyko was speaking, those Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1383.82s)]
*  others who were in need of safe haven were still overwhelmingly on the European continent [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1392.78s)]
*  and not in Palestine. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1400.86s)]
*  I think given the scale of the savagery, I don't think that any one state or country [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1404.98s)]
*  should have borne the responsibility for addressing this crisis. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1415.62s)]
*  I think it should have been an international responsibility. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1420.58s)]
*  The Soviet Union could have contributed. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1426.34s)]
*  Germany certainly could and should have contributed. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1428.5s)]
*  The United Kingdom and the United States, which slammed their doors shut to the persecuted [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1432.8999999999999s)]
*  Jews of Europe as the Nazis were rising to power, they certainly should have played a [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1440.46s)]
*  role. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1445.1799999999998s)]
*  But instead, what passed for the international community at the time decided to partition [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1446.42s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1452.98s)]
*  Here I think we need to judge the partition resolution against the realities that obtained [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1455.22s)]
*  at the time. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1460.66s)]
*  Two-thirds of the population of Palestine was Arab. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1463.9s)]
*  The Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, constituted about one-third of the total population [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1468.42s)]
*  and controlled even less of the land within Palestine. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1476.06s)]
*  As a preeminent Palestinian historian, Walid Al Khalidi has pointed out the partition resolution [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1483.22s)]
*  in giving roughly 55% of Palestine to the Jewish community and I think 41-42% to the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1491.26s)]
*  Arab community, to the Palestinians, did not preserve the position of each community [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1502.82s)]
*  or even favor one community at the expense of the others. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1509.5s)]
*  Rather, it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized the relationship between the two communities. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1515.22s)]
*  As many have written, the Nakba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1526.78s)]
*  of Zionism, given the territorial disposition, given the weakness of the Palestinian community [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1535.58s)]
*  whose leadership had been largely decimated during a major revolt at the end of the 1930s, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1542.54s)]
*  given that the Arab states were still very much under French and British influence. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1550.18s)]
*  The Nakba was the inevitable product of the partition resolution. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1557.38s)]
*  One last point also about the UN's partition resolution is, yes, formally that is what [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1565.98s)]
*  the international community decided on the 29th of November 1947. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1574.5800000000002s)]
*  It's not a resolution that could ever have gotten through the UN General Assembly today [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1580.06s)]
*  for a very simple reason. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1584.1s)]
*  It was a very different General Assembly. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1586.1799999999998s)]
*  Most African, most Asian states were not yet independent. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1588.78s)]
*  Were the resolution to be placed before the international community today and I find it [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1594.78s)]
*  telling that the minority opinion was led by India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, I think they [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1600.62s)]
*  would have represented the clear majority. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1607.98s)]
*  Partition given what we know about Zionism, given that it was entirely predictable what [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1613.78s)]
*  would happen, given the realities on the ground in Palestine was deeply unjust. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1620.46s)]
*  The idea that either the Palestinians or the Arab states could have accepted such a resolution [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1628.94s)]
*  is, I think, an illusion. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  That was in 1947. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1641.6200000000001s)]
*  We saw what happened in 48 and 49. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1643.5800000000002s)]
*  Palestinian society was essentially destroyed. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1646.98s)]
*  Over 80%, I believe, of Palestinians resident in the territory that became the state of [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1650.98s)]
*  Israel were either expelled or fled and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because ethnic cleansing [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1656.46s)]
*  consists of two components. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1663.98s)]
*  It's not just forcing people into refuge or expelling them. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1665.7s)]
*  It's just as importantly preventing their return. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1669.74s)]
*  Here and Benyamor has written, I think, an article about Yosef Leitz and the transfer [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1673.5s)]
*  committees. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1679.46s)]
*  There was a very detailed initiative to prevent the return and it consisted of raising hundreds [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1680.54s)]
*  of Palestinian villages to the ground, which was systematically implemented and so on. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1686.46s)]
*  Palestinians became a stateless people. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1692.6200000000001s)]
*  What is the most important reason that no Arab state was established in Palestine? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1696.14s)]
*  Well, since the 1930s, the Zionist leadership and the Hashemite leadership of Jordan, as [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1702.38s)]
*  it's been thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli-British historian Avi [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1712.9s)]
*  Shleim, essentially colluded to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab state [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1718.62s)]
*  in Palestine in the late 1940s. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1727.8999999999999s)]
*  There's much more here, but I think those are the key points I would make about 1948. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1733.02s)]
*  We may talk about Zionism, Britain, UN assemblies and all the things you mentioned. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1740.06s)]
*  There's a lot to dig into. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1745.1799999999998s)]
*  Again, if we can keep it to just one statement moving forward after Stephen, if you want [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1747.02s)]
*  to go a little longer. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1752.7s)]
*  Also, we should acknowledge the fact that the speaking speeds of people here are different. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1754.1799999999998s)]
*  Stephen speaks about 10 times faster than me. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1759.02s)]
*  Stephen, do you want to comment on 1948? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1762.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's interesting where people choose to start the history. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1765.06s)]
*  I notice a lot of people like to start at either 47 or 48 because it's the first time [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1769.7s)]
*  where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side that they want [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1774.26s)]
*  to ascribe 100% of the blame to the newly emergent Israeli state to. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1778.5s)]
*  But I feel like when you have this type of reading of history, it feels like the goal [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1784.9s)]
*  is to moralize everything first and then to pick and choose facts that kind of support [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1788.5800000000002s)]
*  the statements of your initial moral statement afterwards. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1792.66s)]
*  Whenever people are talking about 48 or the establishment of the Arab state, I never hear [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1796.98s)]
*  about the fact that a civil war started in 47. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1801.5s)]
*  It was largely instigated because of the Arab rejectionism of the 47 partition plan. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1805.14s)]
*  I never hear about the fact that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1810.54s)]
*  purchases from Jewish organizations of Palestinian Arabs of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1814.46s)]
*  period in 1920 even started. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1821.7s)]
*  Funnily enough, King Abdullah of Jordan was quoted as saying, the Arabs are as prodigal [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1824.42s)]
*  in selling their land as they are in weeping about it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1828.46s)]
*  I never hear about the multiple times that Arabs rejected partition, rejected living [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1831.14s)]
*  with Jews, rejected any sort of state that would have even had any sort of Jewish exclusivity. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1837.7800000000002s)]
*  It's funny because it was brought up before that the partition plan was unfair and that's [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1843.8600000000001s)]
*  why the Arabs rejected it as though they rejected it because it was unfair, because of the amount [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1848.38s)]
*  of land that Jews were given and not just due to the fact that Jews were given land [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1852.38s)]
*  at all as though a 30% partition or a 25% partition would have been accepted when I [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1855.38s)]
*  don't think that was the reality of the circumstances. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1860.5800000000002s)]
*  I feel like most of the other stuff has been said, but I noticed that whenever people talk [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1863.3400000000001s)]
*  about 48 or the years preceding 48, I think the worst thing that happens is there's a [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1866.9s)]
*  cherry picking of the facts where basically all of the blame is ascribed to this built-in [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1872.14s)]
*  idea of Zionism that because of a handful of quotes or because of an ideology, we can [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1877.42s)]
*  say that transfer or population expulsion or basically the mandate of all of these Arabs [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1881.9399999999998s)]
*  being kicked off the land was always going to happen when I think there's a refusal sometimes [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1887.4599999999998s)]
*  as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the Zionist leaders, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1891.26s)]
*  there is a political, social and military reality on the ground that they're forced [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1894.8999999999999s)]
*  to contend with. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1898.3799999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, the Arabs, because of their inability to engage in diplomacy and only [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1899.74s)]
*  to use tools of war to try to negotiate everything going on in mandatory Palestine, basically [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1904.62s)]
*  always gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1908.94s)]
*  because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else, whether it was the partition plan in [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1913.5400000000002s)]
*  47, whether it was the the Lusanne Peace Conference afterwards where Israel even offered to annex [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1917.3400000000001s)]
*  Gaza in 51, where they offered to take in 100,000 refugees. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1922.18s)]
*  Every single deal is just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don't want a Jewish [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1926.3000000000002s)]
*  state anywhere in this region of the world. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1929.9s)]
*  I would like to engage Professor Morris. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1932.02s)]
*  If you don't mind, I'm not with the first name. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1934.82s)]
*  It's just not my way of relating. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1936.6599999999999s)]
*  You can just call me Morris. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1939.58s)]
*  You don't need the professor. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1940.58s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1941.58s)]
*  There's a real problem here. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1942.58s)]
*  It's been a problem I've had over many years of reading your work, apart perhaps from as [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1946.02s)]
*  grandchild, I suspect nobody knows your work better than I do. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1952.74s)]
*  I've read it many times, not once, not twice, at least three times, everything you've written. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1956.54s)]
*  And the problem is it's a kind of Quicksilver. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1964.1s)]
*  It's very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1967.1399999999999s)]
*  So we're going to try here to see whether we can hold you to a point. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1975.3799999999999s)]
*  And then you argue with me the point. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1980.4599999999998s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1982.5s)]
*  Your name, please? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1987.6599999999999s)]
*  Stephen Bonnell. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1988.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1989.82s)]
*  Bonnell referred to cherry picking and handful of quotes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1990.82s)]
*  Now it's true that when you wrote your first book on the Palestinian refugee question, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=1996.62s)]
*  you only had a few lines on this issue of transfer. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2005.54s)]
*  Four pages. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2009.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2010.02s)]
*  In the first book. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2011.02s)]
*  In the first book, four pages. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2012.02s)]
*  Maybe four. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2013.02s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to quarrel. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2014.02s)]
*  My memory is not clear. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2015.02s)]
*  We're talking about 40 years ago. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2016.02s)]
*  I read it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2017.22s)]
*  I read it. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2018.22s)]
*  But then I read other things by you. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2019.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2021.06s)]
*  And you were taken to task, if my memory is correct, that you hadn't adequately documented [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2022.06s)]
*  the claims of transfer. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2029.34s)]
*  Let me allow me to finish. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2031.54s)]
*  And I thought that was a reasonable challenge because it was an unusual claim from mainstream [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  Israeli historian to say, as you did in that first book, that from the very beginning, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2040.7s)]
*  transfer figured prominently in Zionist thinking. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2048.74s)]
*  That was an unusual—if you read Anita Shapira, you read Shabtai Tevitt—that was an unusual [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2052.62s)]
*  acknowledgement by you. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2059.4599999999996s)]
*  And then I found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book, you [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2062.18s)]
*  devoted 25 pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer in Zionist thinking. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2072.54s)]
*  And in fact, you used a very provocative and resonant phrase. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2087.9s)]
*  You said that transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2095.54s)]
*  We're not talking about circumstantial factors, a war, Arab hostility. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2106.86s)]
*  You said it's inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2114.14s)]
*  Now, as I said, so we won't be accused of cherry picking, those were 25 very densely [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2121.82s)]
*  argued pages. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2132.3s)]
*  And then in an interview—and I could cite several quotes, but I'll choose one—you [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2136.06s)]
*  said, removing a population was needed. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2143.3s)]
*  Just look at the words. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2149.54s)]
*  Without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2152.02s)]
*  Now, you were the one—again, I was very surprised when I read your book. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2161.06s)]
*  Here I'm referring to Righteous Victims. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2169.66s)]
*  I was very surprised when I came to that page 37 where you wrote that territorial displacement [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2172.54s)]
*  and dispossession was the chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2182.94s)]
*  Territorial displacement and dispossession were the chief motor of Arab resistance to [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2192.1s)]
*  Zionism. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2198.26s)]
*  So you then went on to say, because the Arab population rationally feared territorial [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2200.18s)]
*  displacement and dispossession, it of course opposed Zionism. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  That's as normal as Native Americans opposing the Euro-American manifest destiny in the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2217.06s)]
*  history of our own country, because they understood it would be at their expense. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2225.38s)]
*  It was inbuilt and inevitable. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2232.1800000000003s)]
*  And so now, for you to come along and say that it all happened just because of the war, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2236.38s)]
*  that otherwise the Zionists made all these plans for a happy minority to live there, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2245.1000000000004s)]
*  that simply does not gel, it does not cohere, it is not reconcilable with what you yourself [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2252.54s)]
*  have written. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2261.58s)]
*  It was inevitable and inbuilt. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2262.82s)]
*  Now in other situations you've said, that's true, but I think it was a greater good to [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2265.82s)]
*  establish a Jewish state at the expense of the indigenous population. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2273.9s)]
*  That's another kind of argument. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2280.34s)]
*  That was Theodore Roosevelt's argument in our own country. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2281.8s)]
*  He said, we don't want the whole of North America to remain a squalid refuge for these [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2285.32s)]
*  wigwams and teepees. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2292.84s)]
*  We have to get rid of them and make this a great country. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2295.0800000000004s)]
*  But he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2298.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you've made your point. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2305.1200000000003s)]
*  First I'll take up something that Muin said. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2307.4s)]
*  He said that the Nakba was inevitable. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2309.88s)]
*  As have you. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2313.28s)]
*  And predictable. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2314.28s)]
*  No, no, no, I've never said that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2315.28s)]
*  It was inevitable and predictable only because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2316.28s)]
*  and state in 1947-48. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2322.88s)]
*  Had there been no assault, there probably wouldn't have been a refugee problem. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2325.96s)]
*  There's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred, expulsions to have occurred, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2329.44s)]
*  dispossession, massive dispossession to occur. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2334.6800000000003s)]
*  These occurred as a result of war. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2337.72s)]
*  Now Norman has said that I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism in one way or another. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2339.8799999999997s)]
*  And this is certainly true. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2347.9599999999996s)]
*  In order to buy land, the Jews bought tracts of land on which some Arabs sometimes lived. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2349.3799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes they bought tracts of land on which there weren't Arab villages. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2357.12s)]
*  But sometimes they bought land on which there were Arabs. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2360.16s)]
*  And according to Ottoman law and the British, at least in the initial years of the British [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2363.08s)]
*  mandate, the law said that the people who bought the land could do what they liked with [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2368.72s)]
*  the people who didn't own the land, who were basically squatting on the land, which is [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  the Arab tenant farmers. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  Which is we're talking about a very small number actually of Arabs who were displaced [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2379.9s)]
*  as a result of land purchases in the Ottoman period or the mandate period. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2383.6s)]
*  But there was dispossession in one way. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2388.92s)]
*  They didn't possess the land. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2391.04s)]
*  They didn't own it, but they were removed from the land. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2392.48s)]
*  And this did happen in Zionism. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2395.0800000000004s)]
*  And there's, if you like, an inevitability in Zionist ideology of buying tracts of land [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2396.92s)]
*  and starting to work it yourself and settle it with your own people and so on. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  That made sense. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2409.0800000000004s)]
*  But what we're really talking about is what happened in 47-48. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2410.1600000000003s)]
*  And in 47-48, the Arabs started a war. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2414.28s)]
*  And actually people pay for their mistakes. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2418.1200000000003s)]
*  And the Palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2420.84s)]
*  They make mistakes. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2424.6000000000004s)]
*  They attack. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2425.6000000000004s)]
*  They suffer as a result. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  And we see something similar going on today in the Gaza Strip. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2427.88s)]
*  They do something terrible. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2431.6400000000003s)]
*  They kill 1,200 Jews. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2433.0800000000004s)]
*  They abduct 250 women and children and babies and old people and whatever. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2434.8s)]
*  And then they start screaming, please save us from what we did because the Jews are counterattacking. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2440.4s)]
*  And this is what happened then. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2446.6400000000003s)]
*  And this is what's happening now. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2448.0800000000004s)]
*  There's something fairly similar in the situation here. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2450.2000000000003s)]
*  Expulsion, and this is important, Norman, you should pay attention to this. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2453.1600000000003s)]
*  You didn't raise that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2456.96s)]
*  Expulsion transfer, whenever policy of the Zionist movement before 47, it doesn't exist [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2458.2400000000002s)]
*  in Zionist platforms of the various political parties, of the Zionist organization, of the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2464.92s)]
*  Israeli state, of the Jewish agency. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2472.08s)]
*  Nobody would have actually made it into policy because there was always a large minority. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2474.44s)]
*  If there were people who wanted it, always a large minority of Jewish politicians and [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2479.04s)]
*  leaders would have said, no, this is immoral. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2483.48s)]
*  We cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2485.96s)]
*  So it was never adopted and actually was never adopted as policy even in 48, even though [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2489.92s)]
*  Ben-Gurion wanted his few Arabs in the course of the war staying in the Jewish state after [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2494.6s)]
*  they attacked it. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2499.8s)]
*  He didn't want this loyal citizen staying there because they wouldn't have been loyal [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2500.92s)]
*  citizens. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2504.96s)]
*  But this made sense in the war itself. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2505.96s)]
*  But the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2508.84s)]
*  It's true that in 1937, when the British as part of the proposal by the Peel Commission [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2513.52s)]
*  to divide the country into two states, one Arab, one Jewish, which the Arabs of course [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2521.08s)]
*  rejected, Peel also recommended the Arabs, most of the Arabs in the Jewish state to be [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2525.7200000000003s)]
*  should be transferred because otherwise if they stayed and were disloyal to the emergent [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2532.6800000000003s)]
*  Jewish state, this would cause endless disturbances, warfare, killing and so on. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2537.64s)]
*  So Ben-Gurion and Weizmann latched on to this proposal by the most famous American [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2544.16s)]
*  democracy in the world, the British democracy, when they proposed the idea of transfer side [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2550.24s)]
*  by side with the idea of partition, because it made sense. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2556.2s)]
*  And they said, well, if the British say so, we should also advocate it. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2560.16s)]
*  But they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2563.8s)]
*  And they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2567.7200000000003s)]
*  So just to clarify, you're saying is that 47 was an offensive war, not a defensive war [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2572.28s)]
*  by the Arabs, by the Arabs. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2581.32s)]
*  And you're also saying that there was never a top down policy of expulsion. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2583.44s)]
*  Yes. Just to clarify the point. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2589.48s)]
*  If I understood you correctly, you're making the claim that transfer, expulsion and so [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2591.3999999999996s)]
*  on was in fact a very localized phenomenon, resulting from individual land purchases. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2600.4799999999996s)]
*  And that if I understand you correctly, you're also making the claim that the idea that a [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2609.8399999999997s)]
*  Jewish state requires a removal or overwhelming reduction of the non-Jewish population was... [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2618.28s)]
*  If the Arabs are attacking you, yes. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2629.7200000000003s)]
*  But let's say prior to 1947, it would be your claim that the idea that a significant [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2631.44s)]
*  reduction or wholesale removal of the Arab population was not part of Zionist thinking. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2641.44s)]
*  Well, I think there's two problems with that. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2647.96s)]
*  I think what you're saying about localized disputes is correct. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2651.32s)]
*  But I also think that there is a whole literature that demonstrates that transfer was [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2657.08s)]
*  envisioned by Zionist leaders on a much broader scale than simply individual land [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2668.0s)]
*  purchases. In other words, it went way beyond... [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2674.76s)]
*  We need to remove these tenants so that we can farm this land. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2678.08s)]
*  The idea was we can't have a state where all these Arabs remain and we have to get rid of them. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2681.88s)]
*  And the second, I think, impediment to that view is that long before the UN General Assembly [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2688.28s)]
*  convened to address the question of Palestine, Palestinian and Arab and other leaders as [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2695.6s)]
*  well had been warning ad infinitum that the purpose of the Zionist movement is not just to [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2703.0s)]
*  establish a Jewish state, but to establish an exclusivist Jewish state. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2709.68s)]
*  And that transfer, forced displacement, was fundamental to that project. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2715.7200000000003s)]
*  And just responding to... [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2725.76s)]
*  Sorry, was it... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2728.44s)]
*  Yeah, Steven. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2729.16s)]
*  Bonnell or Donnell? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2730.16s)]
*  Bonnell, yeah. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2731.16s)]
*  With a B. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2732.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2732.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2732.88s)]
*  You made the point that the problem here is that people don't recognize is that the first and [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2735.2s)]
*  last result for the Arabs is always war. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2743.84s)]
*  I think there is a problem with that. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2746.84s)]
*  I think you might do well to recall the 1936 general strike conducted by Palestinians at the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2748.28s)]
*  beginning of the revolt, which at the time was the longest recorded general strike in history. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2758.24s)]
*  You may want to consult the book published last year by Lori Allen, A History of False Hope, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2765.7599999999998s)]
*  which discusses in great detail the consistent engagement by Palestinians, their leaders, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2772.96s)]
*  their elites, their diplomats and so on, with all these international committees. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  If we look at today, the Palestinians are once again going to the International Court of Justice. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2785.52s)]
*  They're consistently trying to persuade the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2793.1200000000003s)]
*  do his job. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2801.52s)]
*  They have launched widespread boycott campaigns. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2803.2000000000003s)]
*  So of course, the Palestinians have engaged in military resistance. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2806.48s)]
*  But I think the suggestion that this has always been their first and last resort [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2813.12s)]
*  and that they have somehow spurned civic action, spurned diplomacy, I think really has no basis [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2818.0s)]
*  in reality. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2826.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll respond to that and then a question for Norm to take into account, I think, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2827.44s)]
*  when he answers Benny, because I am curious. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2830.0s)]
*  Obviously, I have fresher eyes on this and I'm a newcomer to this arena versus the three of you [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2831.52s)]
*  guys for sure. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2836.48s)]
*  A claim that gets brought up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2838.16s)]
*  in Zionism or the idea that as soon as the Jews envisioned a state in Palestine, they knew that [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2842.4s)]
*  it would involve some mass transfer of population, perhaps a mass expulsion. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2848.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm sure we'll talk about Plan D at some point. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2852.8s)]
*  The issue that I run into is, while you can find quotes from leaders, while you can find maybe [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2855.92s)]
*  desires expressed in diaries, I feel like it's hard to truly ever know if there would have been [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2860.88s)]
*  mass transfer in the face of Arab peace because I feel like every time there was a huge deal on [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2866.48s)]
*  the table that would have had a sizable Jewish and Arab population living together, the Arabs [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2871.44s)]
*  would reject it out of hand. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2876.8s)]
*  For instance, when we say that transfer was inevitable, when we say that Zionists would have [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2878.64s)]
*  never accepted a sizable Arab population, how do you explain the acceptance of the 47 [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2881.68s)]
*  Partition Plan that would have had a huge Arab population living in the Jewish state? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2887.2000000000003s)]
*  Is your contention that after the acceptance of that, after the establishment of that state, that [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2891.28s)]
*  Jews would have slowly started to expel all of these Arab citizens from their country? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2895.36s)]
*  Or how do you explain that in Lusanne a couple years later that Israel was willing to formally [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2900.16s)]
*  annex the Gaza Strip and make 200,000 or so people those citizens? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2904.88s)]
*  I'm just curious, how do we get this idea of Zionism always means mass transfer when there were [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2910.56s)]
*  times, at least early on in the history of Israel and a little bit before it, where Israel would [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2917.2s)]
*  have accepted a state that would have had a massive Arab population in it? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2921.76s)]
*  Is your idea that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2925.84s)]
*  Is that question to me or Norm? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2928.64s)]
*  To either one. I'm just curious for the incorporation of the answer. Yeah. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2930.08s)]
*  There's some misunderstandings here, so let's try to clarify that. Number one, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2933.68s)]
*  it was the old historians who would point to the fact, in Professor Morris's terminology, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2941.52s)]
*  the old historians, what he called not real historians, he called them chroniclers, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2948.3199999999997s)]
*  not real historians. It was the old Israeli historians who denied the centrality of transfer [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2953.12s)]
*  in Zionist thinking. It was then Professor Morris who, contrary to Israel's historian [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2963.12s)]
*  establishment, who said, now you remind me it's four pages, but it came at the end of the book. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2973.6s)]
*  No, no, it's at the beginning of the book. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2980.0s)]
*  Transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the Palestinian [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  refugee problem. It's a fault of my memory, but the point still stands. It was Professor Morris [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2987.92s)]
*  who introduced this idea in what you might call a big way. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2993.6s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't say it was central to the Zionist experimental experience. You're saying [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=2997.2s)]
*  centrality. I never said it was central. I said it was there, the idea. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3003.92s)]
*  By the way, it's okay to respond back and forth. This is great. Also, just a quick question. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3007.8399999999997s)]
*  If I may, you're using quotes from Benny, from Professor Morris. It's also okay to say those [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3012.24s)]
*  quotes do not reflect the full context. That would be fine. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3019.3599999999997s)]
*  If we go back to quotes we've said in the past, and you both here have written, the three of you [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3022.56s)]
*  have written on this topic a lot, we should be careful and just admit, well, yeah, that's fine. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3029.44s)]
*  Real quick, just to be clear, the contention is that Norm is quoting a part and saying that this [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3035.52s)]
*  was the entire reason for this whereas Benny's saying it's a part. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3039.6s)]
*  I'm not quoting a part. I'm quoting 25 pages where Professor Morris was at great pains [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3042.4s)]
*  to document the claim that appeared in those early four pages of his book. Now, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3054.24s)]
*  you say it never became part of the official Zionist platform. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3062.56s)]
*  It never became part of the policy. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3069.36s)]
*  Fine. Fine, fine, fine. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3071.8399999999997s)]
*  But it wasn't policy. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3073.04s)]
*  We're also asked, well, this is true. Why did that happen? Why did that happen? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3074.7999999999997s)]
*  It's because it's a very simple fact which everybody understands. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3079.44s)]
*  Ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum. There are real world practical problems. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3084.3199999999997s)]
*  You can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3092.0s)]
*  and turn it into a fact. It was the British mandate. There was significant Arab resistance [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3098.8s)]
*  to Zionism. And that resistance was based on the fact, as you said, the fear of [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3109.04s)]
*  territorial displacement and dispossession. So you couldn't very well expect the Zionist movement [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3116.96s)]
*  to come out in neon lights and announce, hey, we're going to be expelling you the first chance [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3124.96s)]
*  we get. That's not realistic. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3132.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3134.88s)]
*  Now, let me respond. Look, you've said it a number of times that the Arabs, from fairly early on [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3135.28s)]
*  in the conflict from the 1890s or the early 1900s, said the Jews intend to expel us. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3144.32s)]
*  This doesn't mean that it's true. It means that some Arabs said this, maybe believing it was true, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3151.2000000000003s)]
*  maybe using it as a political instrument to gain support to mobilize Arabs against the Zionist [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3156.6400000000003s)]
*  experiment. But the fact is transfer did not occur before 1947. And Arabs later said, and since then, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  have said that the Jews want to build a third temple on the Temple Mount, as if that's what [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3172.4s)]
*  really the mainstream of Zionism has always wanted and always strived for. But this is nonsense. It's [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3178.1600000000003s)]
*  something that Husseini used to use as a way to mobilize masses for the cause, using religion [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3184.0s)]
*  as the way to get them to join him. The fact that Arabs said that the Zionists want to [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3191.28s)]
*  dispossess us doesn't mean it's true. It just means that some Arabs thought that, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3199.92s)]
*  maybe said it sincerely and maybe insincerely. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3205.2000000000003s)]
*  Professor Morris. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3208.08s)]
*  Later it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is true. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3209.52s)]
*  Professor Morris. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3212.4s)]

*  Professor Morris, I read through your stuff. Even yesterday, I was looking through Righteous [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3214.32s)]
*  Victim. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3220.4s)]
*  You should read other things. You're wasting your time. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3220.7200000000003s)]
*  No, actually, no. I do read other things, but I don't consider it a waste of time to read you. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3223.6s)]
*  Not at all. You say that this wasn't inherent in Zionism. Now, would you agree that [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3228.88s)]
*  David Ben-Gurion was a Zionist? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3241.28s)]
*  A major Zionist leader. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3242.96s)]
*  Right. Would you agree Chaim Weitzman was a Zionist? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3245.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3249.6s)]
*  Okay. I believe they were. I believe they took their ideology seriously. It was the first [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3249.6800000000003s)]
*  generation. Just like with the Bolsheviks, the first generation was committed to an idea. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3255.76s)]
*  By the 1930s, it was just pure geopolitique. The ideology went out the window. The first generation, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3261.76s)]
*  I have no doubt about their convictions. Okay. They were Zionists. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3269.6000000000004s)]
*  Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt in Zionism. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3275.6800000000003s)]
*  You keep repeating the same thing. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3278.96s)]
*  As I said, Mr. Morris, I have a problem reconciling what you're saying. It either was [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3281.92s)]
*  incidental or it was deeply entrenched. Here I read it's deeply entrenched. Two very resonant [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3289.68s)]
*  words, inevitable and inbuilt. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3300.08s)]
*  Deeply entrenched. I never wrote that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3303.12s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3305.2799999999997s)]
*  It's something you just invented. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3306.16s)]
*  Okay. Inevitable and inbuilt. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3307.52s)]
*  Let me concede something. The idea of transfer was there. Israel, Zangville, a British Zionist [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3313.12s)]
*  talked about it early on in the century. Even Herzl in some way talked about transferring [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3320.32s)]
*  population. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3326.16s)]
*  According to your 25 pages, everybody talked about it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3326.96s)]
*  We keep bringing up this line, the 25 pages and the four pages. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3330.48s)]
*  We're lucky to have Benny in front of us right now. We don't need to go to the quotes. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3334.4s)]
*  We can legitimately ask how central is expulsion to Zionism in its early version of Zionism [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3340.16s)]
*  and whatever Zionism is today and how much power influence does Zionism and ideology [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3349.36s)]
*  have in Israel? The Zionist movement up to 1948, Zionist ideology was central to the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3358.64s)]
*  whole Zionist experience, the whole enterprise up to 1948. I think Zionist ideology was also [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3372.7999999999997s)]
*  important in the first decades of Israel's existence. Slowly the hold of Zionism, like [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3379.44s)]
*  Bolshevism held the Soviet Union, gradually faded. A lot of Israelis today think in terms of [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3390.88s)]
*  individual success and then capitalism and all sorts of things which are nothing to do [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3397.52s)]
*  with Zionism. Zionism was very important. What I'm saying is that the idea of transfer [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3402.8s)]
*  wasn't the core of Zionism. The idea of Zionism was to save the Jews who had been vastly [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3408.88s)]
*  persecuted in Eastern Europe and incidentally in the Arab world, the Muslim world for centuries [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3414.8s)]
*  and eventually ending up with the Holocaust. The idea of Zionism was to save the Jewish people [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3423.12s)]
*  by establishing a state or reestablishing a Jewish state on the ancient Jewish homeland, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3428.08s)]
*  which is something the Arabs today even deny, that there were Jews in Palestine or the land [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3434.1600000000003s)]
*  of Israel 2,000 years ago. Arafat famously said what temple was there on Temple Mount? Maybe [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3438.64s)]
*  it was in Nablus, which of course is nonsense. But they had a strong connection for thousands [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3445.2s)]
*  of years to the land to which they wanted to return and returned there. They found that on [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3451.68s)]
*  the land lived hundreds of thousands of Arabs and the question was how to accommodate the vision of [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3456.8799999999997s)]
*  a Jewish state in Palestine alongside the existence of these Arab masses living on, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3462.32s)]
*  who were indigenous in fact to the land by that stage. And the idea of partition, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3469.28s)]
*  because they couldn't live together because the Arabs didn't want to live together with the Jews, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  and I think the Jews also didn't want to live together in one state with Arabs in general. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3479.92s)]
*  The idea of partition was the thing which the Zionists accepted. Okay, we can only get a small [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  part of Palestine. The Arabs will get in 37, most of Palestine. In 1947 the ratios were changed, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3491.44s)]
*  but we can live side by side with each other in a partitioned Palestine. And this was the essence [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3499.36s)]
*  of it. The idea of transfer was there, but it was never adopted as policy. But in 1947, 48, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3505.76s)]
*  the Arabs attacked trying to destroy essentially the Jewish, the Zionist enterprise and the [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3513.92s)]
*  emergent Jewish state. And the reaction was transfer in some way, not as policy, but this [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3519.12s)]
*  is what happened on the battlefield. And this is also what Ben-Gurion at some point began to want [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3526.72s)]
*  as well. Well, one of the first books on this issue I read when I was still in high school, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3532.08s)]
*  because my late father had it, was the Diaries of Theodor Herzl. And I think Theodor Herzl, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3541.12s)]
*  of course, was the founder of the contemporary Zionist movement. And I think if you read that, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3549.2s)]
*  it's very clear for Herzl, the model upon which the Zionist movement would proceed, his model was [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3556.0s)]
*  Cecil Rhodes. I think Rhodes, from what I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, has quite a prominent [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3565.52s)]
*  place in Herzl's diaries. I think Herzl was also corresponding with him and seeking his support. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3573.68s)]
*  Cecil Rhodes, of course, was the British colonialist after whom the former white minority [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3580.88s)]
*  regime in Rhodesia was named. And Herzl also says explicitly in his diaries that it is essential [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3590.32s)]
*  to remove the existing population from Palestine. Can I respond to this? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3601.1200000000003s)]
*  In a moment, please. He says, we shall have to spirit the penniless population across the borders [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3607.92s)]
*  and procure employment for them elsewhere or something. And Israel's Anguil, who you mentioned, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3612.56s)]
*  a land without a people for a people without a land. They knew damn well it wasn't a people, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3618.0s)]
*  a land without a people. I'll continue, but please go ahead. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3623.36s)]
*  Just to this, there is one small diary entry in Herzl's vast- [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3627.12s)]
*  It's five volumes. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3633.36s)]
*  Yeah, five volumes. There's one paragraph which actually mentions the idea of transfer. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3634.48s)]
*  There are people who I think that Herzl was actually pointing to South America when he was [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3639.2s)]
*  talking about that. The Jews were going to move to Argentina, and then they would try and buy out [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3643.84s)]
*  or buy off or spirit the penniless natives to make way for Jewish settlement. Maybe he wasn't even [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3649.84s)]
*  talking about the Arabs in that particular passage. That's the argument of some people. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3657.6000000000004s)]
*  Maybe he was. But the point is it has only a one-hundredth of a one percent of the diary, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3661.84s)]
*  which is devoted to this subject. It's not a central idea in Herzl's thinking. What Herzl wanted, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3670.16s)]
*  and this is what's important, not Rhodes, I don't think he was the model. Herzl wanted to create [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3677.04s)]
*  a liberal, democratic, Western state in Palestine for the Jews. That was the idea. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3682.7999999999997s)]
*  Not some imperial enterprise serving some imperial master, which is what Rhodes was about, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3690.08s)]
*  but to have a Jewish state which was modeled on the Western democracies in Palestine. This, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3696.48s)]
*  incidentally, was more or less what Weizmann and Ben-Gurion wanted. Ben-Gurion was more of a [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3702.16s)]
*  socialist. Weizmann was more of a liberal Westerner, but they wanted to establish a social, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3708.0s)]
*  democratic, or liberal state in Palestine. They both envisioned through most of the years of their [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3714.2400000000002s)]
*  activity that there would be an Arab minority in that Jewish state. It's true that Ben-Gurion strived [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3721.52s)]
*  to have as small as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish state because he knew that if you want [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3726.8s)]
*  a Jewish majority state, that would be necessary. But it's not something which they were willing to [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3732.48s)]
*  translate into actual policy. Just a quick pause to mention that for people who are not familiar, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3738.2400000000002s)]
*  the other Herzl we're talking about over a century ago, and everything we've been talking about has [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3744.16s)]
*  been mostly 1948 and before. Yes. Just one clarification on Herzl's diaries. The other [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3748.8s)]
*  thing that I recall from those diaries is he was very preoccupied with, in fact, getting [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3754.96s)]
*  great power patronage, seeing Palestine, the Jewish state in Palestine, I think his words, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3761.92s)]
*  an outpost of civilization against barbarism. In other words, very much seeing his project [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3768.1600000000003s)]
*  as a proxy for Western imperialism in the Middle East. Not proxy. He wanted to establish a Jewish [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3776.88s)]
*  state which would be independent. To get that, he hoped that he would be able to garner support from [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3782.64s)]
*  major imperial power. Including the Ottoman Sultan who he tried to cultivate. I just want to respond [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3788.64s)]
*  to a point you made earlier, which was that people express their rejection of the partition [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3796.08s)]
*  resolution on the grounds that it gave the majority of Palestine to the Jewish community, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3803.44s)]
*  which formed only a third. Whereas in fact, if I understood you correctly, you're saying [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3810.2400000000002s)]
*  the Palestinians and the Arabs would have rejected any partition resolution. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3817.04s)]
*  Yeah. I think- A couple of things. One, they would have rejected any. Two, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3821.44s)]
*  a lot of that land given was in the Negev. It was pretty terrible land at the time. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3825.04s)]
*  Three, the land that would have been partitioned to Jews, I think would have been, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3829.3599999999997s)]
*  I think I saw it was like 500,000 Jews, 400,000 Arabs, and I think like 80,000 Bedouins would [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3833.6s)]
*  have been there. The state would have been divided pretty closely. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3839.3599999999997s)]
*  I think you raise a valid point because I think the Palestinians did reject the partition of their [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3841.52s)]
*  homeland in principle. I think the fact that the United Nations General Assembly then awarded [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3848.48s)]
*  the majority of their homeland to the Zionist movement only added insult to injury. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3857.6s)]
*  One doesn't have to sympathize with the Palestinians to recognize that they have [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3866.32s)]
*  now been a stateless people for 75 years. Can you name any country, yours for example, or yours, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3872.48s)]
*  that would be prepared to give 55%, 25%, 10% of your country to the Palestinians? Of course not. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3882.16s)]
*  The issue was not the existence of Jews in Palestine. They had been there for centuries. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3893.52s)]
*  Of course, they had ties to Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem and other places, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3900.24s)]
*  going back centuries if not millennia. But the idea of establishing an exclusively [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3906.8s)]
*  Jewish state at the expense of those who were already living there, I think it was right to [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3915.6000000000004s)]
*  reject that. I don't think we can look back now 75 years later and say, well, you should have [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3922.0800000000004s)]
*  accepted losing 55% of your homeland because you ended up losing 78% of it and the remaining 22% [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3929.44s)]
*  was occupied in 1967. That's not how things work. I can imagine an American rejecting, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3936.4s)]
*  giving 10% of the United States to the Palestinians and if that rejection leads to war and you lose [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3947.52s)]
*  half your country, I doubt that 50 years from now you're going to say, well, maybe I should [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3954.7200000000003s)]
*  have accepted that. Sure. I like this answer more than what I usually feel like I'm hearing [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3959.52s)]
*  when it comes to the Palestinian rejection of the 47th petition plan because sometimes I feel like [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3965.92s)]
*  a weird switch happens to where the Arabs in the area are actually presented as entirely pragmatic [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3970.32s)]
*  people who are simply doing a calculation and saying, well, we're losing 55% of our land, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3975.84s)]
*  Jews are only maybe one third of the people here and we've got 45. Nah, the math doesn't work, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3980.56s)]
*  basically. But it wasn't a math problem. I think like you said- [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3985.12s)]
*  It was a matter of principle. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3988.16s)]
*  It was an ideology problem. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3989.12s)]
*  No, it was a matter of principle. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3990.16s)]
*  Ideologically driven. That they, as a people, have a right to or entitled to this land that [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3991.52s)]
*  they've never actually had an independent state on, that they've never had even a guarantee of [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=3998.2400000000002s)]
*  an independent state on that they've never actually ruled a government on. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4001.6000000000004s)]
*  That last point is actually not correct because for all its injustice, the mandate system [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4003.76s)]
*  recognized Palestine as a class A mandate which provisionally recognized the independence [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4011.76s)]
*  of that territory. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4019.4399999999996s)]
*  Of what would emerge from that territory, but not of the Palestinian- [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4020.72s)]
*  It was provisionally recognized. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4023.2799999999997s)]
*  But the territory itself was, but not of the Palestinian people to have a right or a guarantee [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4025.8399999999997s)]
*  to a government that would emerge from it. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4030.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, it was a British mandate of Palestine, not the British mandate of Israel. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4031.52s)]
*  The word exclusive, which you keep using, is nonsense. The state which Ben-Gurion envisioned [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4035.04s)]
*  would be a Jewish majority state as they accepted the 1947 partition resolution, as Stephen said, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4040.3999999999996s)]
*  that included 400,000 plus Arabs in a state which would have 500,000 Jews. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4048.48s)]
*  So the idea of exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air at all among the Zionist leaders in 47, 48. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4054.16s)]
*  They wanted a Jewish majority state, but were willing to accept a state which had 40% Arabs. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4060.64s)]
*  That's one point. The second thing is the Palestinians may have regarded the land [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4066.08s)]
*  of Palestine as their homeland, but so did the Jews. It was the homeland of the Jews as well. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4071.2000000000003s)]
*  The problem was the Arabs were unable and remain to this day unable to recognize that for the Jews, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4076.64s)]
*  that is their homeland as well. And the problem then is how do you share this homeland, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4083.2s)]
*  either with one bi-national state or separate this partition into two states? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4087.7599999999998s)]
*  The problem is that the Arabs have always rejected both of these ideas. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4093.2s)]
*  The homeland belongs to the Jews as Jews feel as much as it does- [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4097.12s)]
*  I think I would say Zionists are Jews. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4101.28s)]
*  ... more than for the Arabs. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4102.48s)]
*  I would say for the Jews. It's the Jewish people's homeland. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4103.68s)]
*  Real quick, I just want for both of you guys, because I haven't heard these questions answered. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4106.32s)]
*  I really want these questions to be, I'm just so curious how to make sense of them. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4109.12s)]
*  It was correctly brought up that I believe that Ben-Gurion had, I think Shlomo Ben-Amin describes [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4112.96s)]
*  it as an obsession with getting validation or support from Western states, Great Britain, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4118.24s)]
*  and then a couple of decades later it becomes- [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4122.88s)]
*  That explains us to us war, the crisis. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4124.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Correct. That was one of the major motivators, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4126.0s)]
*  the idea to work with Britain and France on a military operation against Arabs. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4128.799999999999s)]
*  But then the question again I go back to, if that is true, if Ben-Gurion, if the early Israel saw [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4133.12s)]
*  themselves as a Western fashion nation, how could we possibly imagine that they would have engaged [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4139.44s)]
*  in the transfer of some 400,000 Arabs after accepting the partition plan? Would that not [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4144.4s)]
*  have completely and totally destroyed their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire Western [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4149.12s)]
*  world? Would it not have been, how not? Well, first of all, I think that Zionist [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4152.56s)]
*  leadership's acceptance of the partition resolution, and I think you may have written [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4158.32s)]
*  about this, that they accepted it because it provided international endorsement of [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4165.679999999999s)]
*  the legitimacy of the principle of Jewish statehood, and they didn't accept the borders, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4173.28s)]
*  and in fact later expanded the border. Second of all- [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4179.36s)]
*  No, they didn't accept the borders. The borders were expanded in war. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4183.12s)]
*  Accepted the UN partition resolution, borders and all. That's how they accepted it. You can say that [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4185.839999999999s)]
*  some of the Zionists deep in their hearts had the idea that maybe at some point they would be able [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4191.04s)]
*  to get more. Including their most senior leaders who said so, and I think you've quoted them as [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4196.5599999999995s)]
*  saying so. But they grudgingly accepted what the United Nations, the world community, had said, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4200.96s)]
*  this is what you're going to get. And second of all, I mean removing dark people, darker people, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4205.28s)]
*  it's intrinsic. It's intrinsic to Western history. So the idea that Americans or Brits or the French [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4211.04s)]
*  would have an issue with, I mean French had been doing it in Algeria for decades. Americans have [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4222.16s)]
*  been doing it in North America for centuries. So how would Israel forcibly displacing Palestinians [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4227.76s)]
*  somehow besmirch Israel in the eyes of the West? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4236.08s)]
*  In fact, in the 1944 resolution of the Labor Party, and at the time even Bertrand Russell [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4240.16s)]
*  was a member of the Labor Party, it endorsed transfer of Arabs out of Palestine. As Muinz [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4247.6s)]
*  pointed out, that was a deeply entrenched idea in Western thinking that there was nothing, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4255.12s)]
*  it doesn't in any way contradict or violate or breach any moral values to displace the [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4261.44s)]
*  Palestinian population. Now, I do believe there's a legitimate question. Had it been the case, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4268.32s)]
*  as you said, Professor Morris, that the Zionists wanted to create a happy state with a Jewish [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4277.12s)]
*  majority but a large Jewish minority, and if by virtue of immigration, like in our own country, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4285.12s)]
*  in our own country, given the current trajectories, non-whites will become the majority [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4293.6s)]
*  population in the United States quite soon. And according to democratic principles, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4299.76s)]
*  we have to accept that. So if that were the case, I would say maybe there's an argument [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4305.68s)]
*  that had there been mass Jewish immigration, changed the demographic balance in Palestine, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4313.280000000001s)]
*  and therefore, Jews became the majority. It can make an argument in the abstract that the [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4320.4800000000005s)]
*  indigenous Arab population should have been accepting of that, just as whites in the United [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4328.56s)]
*  States, quote unquote, whites, have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4334.4800000000005s)]
*  shifting to non-whites in our own country. But that's not what Zionism was about. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4339.92s)]
*  I did write my doctoral dissertation on Zionism, and I don't want to get now bogged down in abstract [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4347.2s)]
*  ideas. But as I suspect you know, most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4353.36s)]
*  nationalism. One is a nationalism based on citizenship. You become a citizen, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4360.4800000000005s)]
*  you're integral to the country. That's sometimes called political nationalism. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4367.28s)]
*  And then there's another kind of nationalism. And that says the state should not belong to its [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4372.4s)]
*  citizens. It should belong to an ethnic group. Each ethnic group should have its own state. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4379.28s)]
*  It's usually called the German Romantic idea of nationalism. Zionism is squarely in the German [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4389.44s)]
*  Romantic idea. That was the whole point of Zionism. We don't want to be Bundists and be one [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4399.759999999999s)]
*  more ethnic minority in Russia. We don't want to become citizens and just become a Jewish people [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4408.24s)]
*  in England or France. We want our own state. Like the Arabs in the 23 states. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4419.04s)]
*  Before we get to the Arabs, let's stick to the Jews for a moment, or the Zionists. We want our [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4430.24s)]
*  own state. And in that concept of wanting your own state, the minority at best lives on sufferance [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4436.64s)]
*  and at worst gets expelled. That's the logic of the German Romantic Zionist idea of a state. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4451.68s)]
*  That's why they're Zionists. Now, I personally have shied away from using the word Zionism [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4462.32s)]
*  ever since I finished my doctoral dissertation. Was that painful? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4471.679999999999s)]
*  Because as I said, I don't believe it's the operative ideology today. It's like talking [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4477.28s)]
*  about Bolshevism and referring to Khrushchev. I doubt Khrushchev could have spelled Bolshevik. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4484.32s)]
*  But for the period we're talking about, they were Zionists. They were committed to their exclusive [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4492.719999999999s)]
*  state with a minority living on sufferance or at worst expelled. That was their ideology. And [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4502.48s)]
*  I really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these Western Democrats like Weizmann, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4513.92s)]
*  and they wanted to live peacefully with the Arabs. Weizmann described the expulsion in 1948 as, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4523.52s)]
*  quote, the miraculous clearing of the land. That doesn't sound like somebody shedding too many [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4530.64s)]
*  tears at the loss of the indigenous population. Let me just respond to the word unsufferance. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4537.6s)]
*  The unsufferance I don't agree with. I think that's wrong. The Jewish state came into being [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4544.8s)]
*  in 1948. It had a population which was 20% Arab when it came into being after Arab refugees. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4549.360000000001s)]
*  Many of them had become refugees, but 20% remained in the country. 20% of Israel's population at [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4557.04s)]
*  inception in 1949 was Arab. 80% went missing. No, no, no. I was talking about what remained [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4563.28s)]
*  in Palestine, Israel after it was created. The 20% who lived in Israel received citizenship [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4570.24s)]
*  and all the rights of Israelis, except of course the right to serve in the army, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4577.84s)]
*  which they didn't want to. And they have Supreme Court justices. They have Knesset members. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4582.08s)]
*  They enjoyed basically- I think they lived under emergency laws until 1966. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4588.32s)]
*  For a period. Sure, they lived under emergency- So they didn't immediately have citizenship. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4592.48s)]
*  No, no, no. Actually, no, no. Wait a minute. At the beginning- [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4596.16s)]
*  This is just fantasy. At the beginning, it's not fantasy. At the [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4597.92s)]
*  beginning they received citizenship, could vote in elections for their own people, and they were [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4599.36s)]
*  put into parliament. But in the first years, the Israeli, the Jewish majority suspected that maybe [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4604.24s)]
*  the Arabs would be disloyal because they had just tried to destroy the Jewish state. Then they [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4611.28s)]
*  dropped the military government and they became fully equal citizens. So if the whole idea was [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4615.92s)]
*  they must have a state without Arabs, this didn't happen in 49, and it didn't happen in the- [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4622.72s)]
*  Then why did you say- Professor Moritz. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4629.12s)]
*  Yes. Then why did you say without [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4632.56s)]
*  a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4635.2s)]
*  Because you're missing the first section of that paragraph, which was they were [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4641.12s)]
*  assaulted by the Arabs. And as a result, a Jewish state could not have come into being unless there [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4646.160000000001s)]
*  had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill them. Norm, I'm officially [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4652.240000000001s)]
*  forbidding you referencing that again. We responded to it. So the main point you're making, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4656.64s)]
*  we have to take Vanyeta's word, is like there was a war and that's the reason why he made that [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4664.400000000001s)]
*  statement. I think just one last point on this. I remember reading your book when it first came out [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4671.76s)]
*  and reading one incident after the other and one example after the other, and then getting to the [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4679.6s)]
*  conclusion where you said the Nakba was a product of war, not design, I think were your exact- And [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4686.4800000000005s)]
*  I remember reacting almost in shock to that, that I felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4694.16s)]
*  that it was a product of design, not war. And I think our discussion today very much reflects, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4702.16s)]
*  let's say, the dissonance between the evidence and the conclusion. You don't feel that the [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4710.4s)]
*  research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was in fact inherent and [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4718.16s)]
*  built and inevitable. And I think the point that Norm and I are making is that your own historical [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4726.96s)]
*  research together with that of others indisputably demonstrates that it does. I think that's a [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4735.52s)]
*  fundamental disagreement we're having here. Can I actually respond to that? Because this is actually, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4740.64s)]
*  I think this is emblematic of the entire conversation. I watched a lot of Norm's [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4745.76s)]
*  interviews and conversations in preparation for this, and I hear Norm will say this over and over [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4750.4s)]
*  and over again. I only deal in facts. I don't deal in hypotheticals. I only deal in facts. I only deal [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4755.44s)]
*  in facts. And that seems to be the case, except for when the facts are completely and totally [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4759.44s)]
*  contrary to the particular point you're trying to push. The idea that Jews would have out of hand [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4763.28s)]
*  rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4768.88s)]
*  acceptance of the 47 partition plan. I don't think you understand politics. Did I just say [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4773.52s)]
*  that there is a chasm that separates your ideology from the limits and constraints imposed by [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4779.4400000000005s)]
*  politics and reality? Now, Professor Morris, I suspect would agree that the Zionist movement [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4789.92s)]
*  from fairly early on was committed to the idea of a Jewish state. I am aware of only one major [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4799.68s)]
*  study probably written 40 years ago, the Binational Idea in Mandatory Palestine by a woman. I forgot [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4809.280000000001s)]
*  her name now. You remember her. I'm trying to. Yeah. Okay. Would you know the book? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4817.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. She is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the Zionist movement was [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4823.04s)]
*  actually, not formally, actually committed to the Binational Idea. But most historians [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4831.12s)]
*  of the subject agree the Zionist movement was committed to the idea of a Jewish state. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4839.76s)]
*  Having written my doctoral dissertation on the topic, I was confirmed in that idea because [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  Professor Chomsky, who was my closest friend for about 40 years, was very committed to the idea [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4852.8s)]
*  that binationalism was the dominant trend in Zionism. I could not agree with it. I couldn't [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4859.84s)]
*  go with him there. But Professor Morris, you are aware that until the Biltmore Resolution in 1942, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4865.76s)]
*  the Zionist movement never declared it was for a Jewish state. Why? Because it was politically [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4874.88s)]
*  impossible at the moment until 1942. There is your ideology. There are your convictions. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4882.8s)]
*  There are your operative plans. And there's also separately what you say in public. The Zionist [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4890.88s)]
*  movement couldn't say in public, we're expelling all the Arabs. They can't say that. And they [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4898.8s)]
*  couldn't even say we support a Jewish state until 1942. You're conflating two things. The Zionists [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4905.12s)]
*  wanted a Jewish state. Correct. That didn't mean expulsion of the Arabs. It's not the same thing. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4914.16s)]
*  They wanted a Jewish state with a Jewish majority, but they were willing, as it turned out, both in [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4920.24s)]
*  1937 and in 1947, and subsequently to have an Arab minority, a large Arab minority. In 1947, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4924.8s)]
*  there was a transfer. They were willing to have a large Arab minority in the country, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4930.16s)]
*  and they ended up with a large Arab minority in the country. 20% of the population in 1949 was [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4937.4400000000005s)]
*  Arab, and it still is 1%. They ended up for about five minutes before they were expelled. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4943.52s)]
*  They agreed to it until 1947, and then they were gone by March 1949. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4948.320000000001s)]
*  What happened in between the rejection of the partition plan and the expulsion of the Arabs? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4954.08s)]
*  The Arabs launched a war. Well, yeah. It wasn't random. There's a potential. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4958.16s)]
*  I agree. It wasn't random. I totally agree with that. It was by design. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4962.48s)]
*  You can say that, but in this case, the facts betray you. There was no Arab acceptance of [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4966.88s)]
*  anything that would have allowed for a Jewish state to exist. Of course not. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4972.72s)]
*  Number one, and number two, I think that it's entirely possible, given how things happen after [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4975.36s)]
*  war, that this exact same conflict could have played out and an expulsion would have happened [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4980.4s)]
*  without any ideology at play. That there was a people that disagreed on who had territorial [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4984.0s)]
*  rights to a land. There was a massive war afterwards, and then a bunch of their friends [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4988.639999999999s)]
*  invaded after to reinforce the idea that the Jewish people in this case couldn't have a state. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4991.759999999999s)]
*  There could have been a transfer regardless. Anything could have been. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=4996.32s)]
*  That's not what history is about. History is about Palestinian [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5000.639999999999s)]
*  rejection. It's up to any peace deal over and over and over again. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5004.32s)]
*  As I said, when the war was thrown into the court of the United Nations, they were faced [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5007.04s)]
*  with a practical problem. I, for one, am not going to try to adjudicate the rights and wrongs from [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5014.799999999999s)]
*  the beginning. I do not believe that if territorial displacement and dispossession was inherent in the [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5024.32s)]
*  Zionist project, I do not believe it can be a legitimate political enterprise. Now, you might [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5033.04s)]
*  say that's speaking from 2022 or 2024. Where are we now? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5041.5199999999995s)]
*  Four now, I think. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. But we have to recognize that from nearly the beginning, for perfectly obvious reasons, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5048.32s)]
*  having nothing to do with anti-Semitism, anti-Westernism, anti-Europeanism, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5059.68s)]
*  but because no people that I am aware of would voluntarily cede its country. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5067.52s)]
*  Except for all the people that sold land voluntarily. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5076.88s)]
*  You can perfectly understand Native American resistance to Euro colonialism. You can perfectly [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5079.68s)]
*  well understand it without any anti-Europeanism, anti-Whitism, anti-Christianism. They didn't want [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5087.76s)]
*  to cede their country to invaders. That's completely understandable. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5096.0s)]
*  You're minimizing the anti-Semitic element in Arab nationalism. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5100.8s)]
*  You minimized it. In all your books, you minimized it. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5106.16s)]
*  No, no, no. Hosseini was an anti-Semite. The leader of the Palestinian national movement [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5108.16s)]
*  in the 30s and 40s was an anti-Semite. This was one of the things which drove him and also drove [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5114.32s)]
*  him in the end to work in Berlin for Hitler for four years, giving Nazi propaganda to the Arab world, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5119.5199999999995s)]
*  calling on the Arabs to murder the Jews. That's what he did in World War II. That's the leader [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5126.96s)]
*  of the Palestinian Arab national movement. And he wasn't alone. He wasn't alone. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5131.679999999999s)]
*  Why is it that if you read your book, Righteous Victims, you can read it and read it [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5136.96s)]
*  and read it as I have, you will find barely a word about the Arabs being motivated by anti-Semitism. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5144.56s)]
*  It exists though. I didn't say it doesn't exist. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5153.200000000001s)]
*  You agree that it exists. Hey, I don't know a single non-Jew who [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5156.16s)]
*  doesn't harbor anti-Semitic sentiment. We're talking about Arabs now. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5160.0s)]
*  But I don't know anybody that's just part of the human condition. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5163.12s)]
*  Anti-Semitism. Hosseini was an anti-Semitic. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5168.240000000001s)]
*  And among the Arabs. So Professor Marz, here's my problem. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5171.12s)]
*  I didn't see that in Your Righteous Victims. Even when you talked about the first intifada [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5176.16s)]
*  and you talked about the second intifada and you talked about how there was a lot of influence [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5182.5599999999995s)]
*  by Hamas, the Islamic movement, you even stated that there was a lot of anti-Semitism in those [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5188.96s)]
*  movements. But then you went on to say, but of course, at bottom, it was about the occupation. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5195.28s)]
*  It wasn't about, and I've read it. Yeah, you'd be moving from different [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5204.24s)]
*  ages across the ages. I'm talking about your whole book. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5209.12s)]
*  Your whole book. The occupation began in 67, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5211.759999999999s)]
*  the one you're talking about. I looked and looked and looked for evidence of this [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5214.639999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism as being a chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism. I didn't see it. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5219.2s)]
*  You like, did he make that claim? I don't remember the word chief. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5226.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very binary. Binary. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5229.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, binary. Please don't give me this [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5233.68s)]
*  postmodernism binary. You're the one. You're the one that said the chief motor. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5235.92s)]
*  Do you have your book here? You talk about black. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5242.96s)]
*  Page 137. You're talking in black and white. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5244.8s)]
*  Page 137. You're talking in [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5246.96s)]
*  black and white concepts when history is much grayer. Lots of things happen because of lots of [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5248.88s)]
*  reasons, not one or the other. You don't seem to see that. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5253.6s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? Because it's for them to talk to. It's a very quick question. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5258.0s)]
*  What do you think the ideal solution was on the Arab side from 47? What would they have preferred? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5261.36s)]
*  Well, they were explicit. And then the second one, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5266.16s)]
*  what would have happened if Jews would have lost the war in 48? What do you think would [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5268.32s)]
*  have happened to the Israeli population, the Jewish population? I think the Palestinians [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5271.4400000000005s)]
*  and the Arabs were explicit that they wanted a unitary, I think, federal state, and they made [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5275.76s)]
*  their submissions to UNSCOP. They made their appeals at the UN General Assembly. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5285.6s)]
*  What do you mean by unitary and federal? I don't get that. They wanted an Arab state. They wanted [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5292.72s)]
*  Palestine to be an Arab state. Yes. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5297.84s)]
*  Put it simply. But I think- [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5299.52s)]
*  Without the word unitary, federal, they wanted Palestine as an Arab and exclusively [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5300.64s)]
*  Arab state. No, it wasn't an exclusively Arab state. I think we have to distinguish between [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5305.6s)]
*  Palestinian and Arab opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine, on the one hand, and Palestinian [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5312.160000000001s)]
*  and Arab attitudes to Jewish existence in Palestine. There's a fundamental difference- [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5320.160000000001s)]
*  Well, Hosseini, the leader of the movement, said that all the Jews who had come since 1917, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5325.4400000000005s)]
*  and that's the majority of the Jews in Palestine in 1947, shouldn't be there. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5331.28s)]
*  Well, he did say that. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5336.48s)]
*  They shouldn't be citizens and they shouldn't be there. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5336.96s)]
*  He did say that. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5338.8s)]
*  He did say that. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5339.2s)]
*  Yes, they said the same. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5340.16s)]
*  I'm not going to deny it. Of course, it's true. I can understand the sentiment, but I think it's wrong. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5340.88s)]
*  But also, you guys are the ones- [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5346.32s)]
*  We agree on this. I also- [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5348.16s)]
*  I want to answer your question. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5349.44s)]
*  You used the words earlier that it was supremacy and exclusivity that the Zionist- [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5350.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I want to answer your question. As you met Hosseini, he did say that, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5353.92s)]
*  and I'm sure there was a very substantial body of Palestinian Arab public opinion that endorsed [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5358.24s)]
*  that. But by the same token, I think a unitary Arab state, as you call it, or a Palestinian state, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5365.28s)]
*  could have been established with arrangements, with guarantees, to ensure the security and rights [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5376.48s)]
*  of both communities. How that would work in detail had been discussed and proposed, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5385.28s)]
*  but never resolved. And again, I think Jewish fears about what would have happened- [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5392.400000000001s)]
*  A second Holocaust, that's what we're talking about. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5399.84s)]
*  Well, no. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5401.2s)]
*  I think- [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5401.68s)]
*  That was the Jewish fear, a second Holocaust. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5402.16s)]
*  That may well have been the Jewish fear. It was an unfounded Jewish fear. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5404.96s)]
*  It was unfounded? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5409.2s)]
*  Of course, it was unfounded. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5410.16s)]
*  What about in 48 and 56? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5411.12s)]
*  You really think that the Palestinians, had they won the war, were going to import [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5413.12s)]
*  ovens and crematoriums from Germany and- [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5418.96s)]
*  I don't know if it would have been that bad, but there were programs across in almost every [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5421.04s)]
*  single Arab state where there were Jews living after 48, after 56, after 67. There were always [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5423.28s)]
*  programs, there were always flights from Jews from those countries to Israel afterward. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5429.36s)]
*  I don't think it would be- [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5432.72s)]
*  I wouldn't say there were always programs in every Arab state. I think there was flight of [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5433.84s)]
*  Arab Jews for multiple reasons. In some cases, for precisely the reasons you say, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5438.56s)]
*  if you look at the Jewish community in Algeria, for example, their flight had virtually nothing [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5446.4800000000005s)]
*  to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict. The issue of Algerian Jews was that the French gave them [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5451.68s)]
*  citizenship during their colonial rule of Algeria, and they increasingly became identified [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5459.76s)]
*  with French rule. When Algeria became independent and all the French ended up leaving out of fear [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5466.240000000001s)]
*  or out of disappointment or out of whatever, the Jews were identified as French rather than Algerian. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5476.08s)]
*  But this is a bit of a red herring. There were pogroms in the Arab countries, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5482.72s)]
*  in Bahrain even, where there's almost no Jews. There was a pogrom in 1947. There was a pogrom [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5486.64s)]
*  in Aleppo in 1947. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5492.160000000001s)]
*  I'm not denying any of that history. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5493.92s)]
*  Killings of Jews in Iraq and Egypt in 1948-49. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5495.6s)]
*  The Jews basically fled the Arab states, not for multiple reasons. They fled because they felt [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5502.56s)]
*  that the governments there and the societies amid which they had lived for hundreds of years [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5507.76s)]
*  no longer wanted them. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5512.96s)]
*  Look, without getting into the details, I think we can both agree that ultimately, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5514.16s)]
*  a clear majority of Arab Jews who believed that after having lived in these countries [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5519.52s)]
*  for centuries, if not millennia, came to the unfortunate conclusion that their situation [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5526.32s)]
*  had become untenable. I also think that we can both agree that this had never been an issue prior [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5538.32s)]
*  to Zionism and the emergence of the state of Israel. Look, pogroms didn't begin with Zionism [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5547.04s)]
*  in the Arab world. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5553.12s)]
*  The issue is the point I raised, which is whether these communities had ever come [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5554.0s)]
*  to a collective conclusion that their position had become untenable in this part of the world. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5560.8s)]
*  No, they were Arab Jews. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5566.88s)]
*  Well, because untenable meant there was no alternative. But with the creation of Israel, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5568.08s)]
*  there was an alternative, right? A place where they could go and not be discriminated against [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5571.6s)]
*  or live with second-class citizens or be subject to Arab majority states. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5575.2s)]
*  I also think it's interesting that when you analyze the flight of Jewish people, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5579.12s)]
*  and I've seen this, it wasn't just a mass expulsion from all the Arab states. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5583.28s)]
*  There were definitely push factors. There were also pull factors. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5587.92s)]
*  Now, I don't know how you guys feel about the Nakba, but when the analysis of the Nakba comes [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5590.8s)]
*  in, again, it's back to that, well, that was actually just a top-down expulsion. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5593.92s)]
*  The retreat of wealthy Arab people in the 30s didn't matter. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5598.8s)]
*  Any of the messaging from the surrounding Arab states didn't matter. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5602.4s)]
*  It was just an expulsion from Jewish people or people running from their lives from Jewish [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5604.56s)]
*  massacres. Again, I feel like it's a selective critical analysis of the- [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5609.52s)]
*  I'm a little uncomfortable always using the term Jewish here because it wasn't the [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5614.56s)]
*  Jews of England or the Soviet Jews. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5618.160000000001s)]
*  Sure. Well, I say Jewish because prior to 1948, it was saying the issue of- [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5620.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's useful to refer to Zionists before 1948 and Israelis after 1948. We don't need to [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5623.92s)]
*  implicate Jews elsewhere. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5631.92s)]
*  Well, sure, but the Jewish people that were being attacked in Arab states weren't Zionists. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5633.2s)]
*  They were just Jews living there, right? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5637.36s)]
*  Okay. I'll just comment on that. I was rereading Shlomo Ben-Ami's last book, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5638.72s)]
*  and he does at the end discuss at some length the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5645.52s)]
*  the so-called peace process. On the question of 48 and the Arab emigration, if you'll allow me, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5650.56s)]
*  let me just quote him. Israel is particularly fond of the awkwardly false symmetry she makes [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5657.04s)]
*  between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5666.24s)]
*  countries following the creation of the state of Israel, as if it were an unplanned exchange of [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5673.5199999999995s)]
*  populations, unquote. And then Mr. Ben-Ami, for those of you who are listening, he was Israel's [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5681.68s)]
*  former foreign minister, and he's an influential historian in his own right. He says, in fact, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5686.96s)]
*  envoys from the Mossad and the Jewish agency worked underground in Arab countries and Iran [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5694.4s)]
*  to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More importantly, for many Jews in Arab states, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5705.12s)]
*  the very possibility of emigrating to Israel was the culmination of millennial aspirations. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5713.36s)]
*  It represented the consummation of a dream to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5721.599999999999s)]
*  So this idea that they were all expelled after 1948, that's one area, Professor Moritz, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5729.76s)]
*  I defer to expertise, that's one of my credos in life. I don't know the Israeli literature, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5739.28s)]
*  but as it's been translated in English, there is very little solid scholarship on what happened [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5745.36s)]
*  in 1948 in the Arab countries and which caused the Jews to leave. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5752.88s)]
*  Arab Jews. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5757.12s)]
*  Arab Jews, right. But Shlomo Ben-Ami knows the literature, he knows the scholarship. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5758.16s)]
*  He also comes from Tangieres. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5765.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, from Morocco. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5767.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5768.08s)]
*  So he knows this. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5768.400000000001s)]
*  And Abish Slime from Iraq. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5769.12s)]
*  And he's written on this issue as well. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5770.320000000001s)]
*  And they wrote that the Jews in the Arab lands were not pro-Zionist. They weren't Zionists at all. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5771.6s)]
*  Certainly Abish Slime's family was anti-Zionist. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5777.200000000001s)]
*  And Abish Slime, when he was interviewed by Maren Rappaport on this question, he said, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5779.6s)]
*  you simply cannot say that the Iraqi Jews were expelled. It's just not true. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5784.32s)]
*  And he was speaking as an Iraqi Jew who left with his father and family in 1948. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5789.12s)]
*  They were pushed out. They weren't expelled. That's probably the right phrase. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5794.88s)]
*  I think it's more complex than that. I think it was... Sorry, I interrupted you. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5799.599999999999s)]
*  No, you're not interrupting me because I only know what's been translated into English. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5804.48s)]
*  And the English literature on the subject is very small and not scholarly. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5809.68s)]
*  Now, there may be Hebrew literature. I don't know. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5816.16s)]
*  But I was surprised that even Shlomo Ben Ami, a stalwart of his state, fair enough, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5820.16s)]
*  on this particular point, he called it false symmetry. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5827.280000000001s)]
*  No, no, Stephen is right. There was a pull and push mechanism [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5830.400000000001s)]
*  in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post-48. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5833.84s)]
*  But there was also a lot of push. A lot of push. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5837.68s)]
*  That's indisputable. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5840.4800000000005s)]
*  And on the point of agreement, on this one brief light of agreement, let us wrap up [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5842.400000000001s)]
*  with this topic of history and move on to modern day. But before that, I'm wondering if [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5849.280000000001s)]
*  we can just say a couple of last words on this topic. Stephen? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5856.8s)]
*  Yeah. I think that when you look at the behaviors of both parties [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5861.12s)]
*  in the time period around 48, or especially 48 and earlier, there's this assumption that there [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5864.72s)]
*  was this huge built-in mechanism of Zionism and that it was going to be inevitable from the [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5871.76s)]
*  inception of the first Zionist thought, I guess, that appeared in Herzl's mind that there would be a [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5876.32s)]
*  mass violent population transfer of Arab Palestinians out of what would become the Israeli state. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5881.2s)]
*  I understand that there are some quotes that we can find that maybe seem to possibly support [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5888.0s)]
*  an idea that looks close to that. But I think when you actually consult the record of what happened, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5892.72s)]
*  when you look at the populations, the massive populations that Israel was willing to accept [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5897.280000000001s)]
*  within what would become their state borders, their nation borders, I just don't think that [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5902.4800000000005s)]
*  the historical record agrees with the idea that Zionists would have just never been okay living [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5907.2s)]
*  alongside Arab Palestinians. But when you look at the other side, Arabs would out of hand reject [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5911.52s)]
*  literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land for any state relating to Jewish people [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5917.6s)]
*  or the Israeli people. I think it was said even on the other end of the table that Arab Palestinians [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5924.0s)]
*  would have never accepted the Arabs would have never accepted any Jewish state whatsoever. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5928.88s)]
*  So it's interesting that on the ideology part where it's claimed that Zionists are people of [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5932.320000000001s)]
*  exclusion and supremacy and expulsion, we can find that in diary entries, but we can find that [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5937.200000000001s)]
*  expressed very real terms on the Arab side, I think in all of their behavior around [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5942.8s)]
*  48 and earlier where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli state. It would have been the [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5946.96s)]
*  dispossession of many Jewish people, it probably would have been the expulsion of a lot of them [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5951.280000000001s)]
*  back to Europe. And I think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5954.4800000000005s)]
*  of the Arabs versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders. Benny? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5957.84s)]
*  One thing which stood out and I think Muin made this point is that the Arabs had nothing to do [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5962.8s)]
*  with the Holocaust, but then the world community forced the Arabs to pay the price for the [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5968.8s)]
*  Holocaust. That's the traditional Arab argument. This is slightly distorting the reality. The Arabs [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5973.68s)]
*  in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent Jewish immigration from Europe and reaching Palestine, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5981.28s)]
*  which was the only safe haven available because America, Britain, France, nobody wanted Jews [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5989.04s)]
*  anywhere and they were being persecuted in central Europe and eventually would be massacred in large [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5994.0s)]
*  numbers. So the Arab efforts to pressure the British to prevent Jews reaching Palestine's [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=5998.88s)]
*  safe shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many Jews in Europe because they couldn't get [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6005.92s)]
*  to anywhere and they couldn't get to Palestine because the Arabs were busy attacking Jews [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6012.72s)]
*  in Palestine and attacking the British to make sure they didn't allow Jews to [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6016.88s)]
*  reach the safe haven. That's important. The second thing is, of course, there's no point [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6021.52s)]
*  in belittling the fact that the Palestinian Arab National Movement's leader, Hosseini, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6026.0s)]
*  worked for the Nazis in the 1940s. He got a salary from the German Foreign Ministry. He raised [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6033.12s)]
*  troops among Muslims in Bosnia for the SS and he broadcast to the Arab world calling for the murder [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6039.52s)]
*  of the Jews in the Middle East. This is what he did. The Arabs since then have been trying to [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6046.88s)]
*  whitewash Hosseini's role. I'm not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust, but he helped [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6052.4s)]
*  the Germans along in doing what they were doing and supported them in doing that. So this can't be [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6061.839999999999s)]
*  removed from the fact that the Arabs, as you say, paid a price for the Holocaust, but they also [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6070.16s)]
*  participated in various ways in helping it happen. I'll make two points. The first is, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6075.76s)]
*  you mentioned Haj Amin Hosseini and his collaboration with the Nazis. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6085.84s)]
*  Entirely legitimate point to raise, but I think one can also say definitively had Haj Amin Hosseini [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6092.320000000001s)]
*  never existed, the Holocaust would have played out precisely as it did. As far as Palestinian [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6100.08s)]
*  opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine during the 1930s is concerned, it was of a [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6108.96s)]
*  different character than, for example, British and American rejection of Jewish immigration. They [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6116.0s)]
*  just didn't want Jews on their soil. Objectively, it helped the Germans kill the Jews. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6124.16s)]
*  In the Palestinian case, their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6128.56s)]
*  of their homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them. I think that's an important [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6135.120000000001s)]
*  distinction to make. The other point I wanted to make is we've spent the past several hours talking [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6140.240000000001s)]
*  about Zionism transfer and so on, but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6147.4400000000005s)]
*  which is that Zionism, I think, would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6155.2s)]
*  political project had it not been for the British, what the preeminent Palestinian historian Waleed [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6164.5599999999995s)]
*  Khalidi has termed the British shield. Because I think without the British sponsorship, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6171.599999999999s)]
*  we wouldn't be having this discussion today. The British sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6177.68s)]
*  which is that during World War I, the Ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suez Canal. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6188.16s)]
*  Suez Canal was the jugular vein of the British Empire between Europe and India. The British came [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6194.72s)]
*  to the conclusion that they needed to secure the Suez Canal from any threat. As the British have [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6204.88s)]
*  done so often in so many places, how do you deal with this? Well, you bring in a foreign minority, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6212.24s)]
*  implant them amongst a hostile population, and establish a protectorate over them. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6220.96s)]
*  I don't think a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of British intentions. In the Balfour [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6227.52s)]
*  Declaration, it very specifically speaks about a Jewish national home in Palestine, in other words, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6234.56s)]
*  a British protectorate. Things ended up taking a different course. I think the most important [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6240.72s)]
*  development was World War II. I think this had maybe less to do with the Holocaust and more to [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6250.64s)]
*  do with the effective bankruptcy of the United Kingdom during that war and its inability to [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6257.68s)]
*  sustain its global empire. It ended up giving up India, ended up giving up Palestine. It's in that [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6264.240000000001s)]
*  context, I think, that we need to see the emergence of a Jewish state in Palestine. Again, a Jewish [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6272.320000000001s)]
*  state means a state in which the Jewish community enjoys not only a demographic majority, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6281.84s)]
*  but an uncontestable demographic majority, an uncontestable territorial hegemony, and an [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6291.28s)]
*  uncontestable political supremacy. That is also why after 1948, the nascent Israeli state confiscated, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6300.4800000000005s)]
*  I believe, up to 90% of lands that had been previously owned by Palestinians who became [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6310.24s)]
*  citizens of Israel. It is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6319.5199999999995s)]
*  population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966. It is why the Israeli state effectively [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6327.84s)]
*  reduced the Palestinians living within the Israeli state as citizens of the Israeli state [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6339.6s)]
*  to second-class citizens, on the one hand, promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6346.88s)]
*  parties, on the other hand, doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6353.360000000001s)]
*  Palestinian or Arab nationalist movements. That's why today there's a consensus among all major [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6358.240000000001s)]
*  human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state. What the Israeli human rights [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6366.4s)]
*  organization, Bet-Selim, describes a regime of Jewish supremacy between the river and the sea. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6372.799999999999s)]
*  Yes. You're really tempting a response from the other side on the last few sentences. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6379.44s)]
*  The propaganda, yeah. Okay. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6383.759999999999s)]
*  We'll talk about the claims of apartheid and so on. It's a fascinating discussion. We need to have it. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6385.04s)]
*  Norm? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6390.959999999999s)]
*  On the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi Holocaust, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6392.5599999999995s)]
*  direct or indirect, I consider that an absurd claim. As Romiko said, and I quoted him, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6399.2s)]
*  the entire Western world turned its back on the Jews. To somehow focus on the Palestinians [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6409.2s)]
*  strikes me as completely ridiculous. Number two, as Muin said, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6416.88s)]
*  there's a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6424.56s)]
*  because in their minds and not irrationally, these Jews intended to create a Jewish state [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6430.08s)]
*  which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion. I'm a very generous person. I've [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6437.04s)]
*  actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years, but if I knew in advance [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6443.92s)]
*  that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6450.0s)]
*  I would think 10,000 times before I took him in. Okay? As far as the actual complicity of the [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6455.76s)]
*  Palestinian Arabs, if you look at Raoul Hilberg's three-volume classic work, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6466.96s)]
*  The Destruction of the European Jury, he has in those thousand-plus pages one sentence [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6473.92s)]
*  on the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem. That, I think, is probably an overstatement, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6484.08s)]
*  but we'll leave it aside. The only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6489.92s)]
*  number one, I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6496.24s)]
*  rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6503.12s)]
*  the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. And number two, there are two [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6511.679999999999s)]
*  issues. One is the history, and the second is being responsible for your words. Now, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6518.64s)]
*  some people accuse me of speaking very slowly, and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6528.0s)]
*  speed twice to three times whenever I'm on. One of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6534.64s)]
*  value to every word I say, and it is discomforting, disorienting, where you have a person [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6542.48s)]
*  who's produced a voluminous corpus rich in insight and rich in archival sources, who seems [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6553.919999999999s)]
*  to disown each and every word that you pluck from that corpus by claiming that it's either [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6568.4800000000005s)]
*  out of context or it's cherry picking. Words count, and I agree with Lex. Everybody has the [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6576.32s)]
*  right to rescind what they've said in the past, but what you cannot claim is that you didn't say [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6586.72s)]
*  what you said. I'll stick to the history, not the current propaganda. In 1917, the Zionist movement [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6595.52s)]
*  began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades. In 1917, the British jumped [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6604.96s)]
*  in and issued the Balfour Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish national home in [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6610.8s)]
*  Palestine, which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6616.24s)]
*  Most people understood that in Britain and among the Zionists and among the Arabs. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6621.44s)]
*  But the British issued the Balfour Declaration not only because of imperial self-interest, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6627.599999999999s)]
*  and this is what you're basically saying. They had the imperial interests, a buffer state which [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6634.639999999999s)]
*  would protect the Suez Canal from the East. The British also were motivated by idealism, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6639.599999999999s)]
*  and this incidentally is how Balfour described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6645.44s)]
*  He said the Western world, Western Christendom owes the Jews a great debt, both for giving [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6651.599999999999s)]
*  the world and the West, if you like, values, social values as embodied in the Bible, social justice, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6658.639999999999s)]
*  and all sorts of other things, and the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6667.5199999999995s)]
*  for 2,000 years. This debt we're now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6672.64s)]
*  Zionism. But it's also worth remembering that the Jews weren't proxies or attached to the British [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6680.08s)]
*  imperial endeavor. They were happy to receive British support in 1917, and then subsequently, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6689.52s)]
*  when the British ruled Palestine for 20, 30 years, but they weren't part of the British [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6695.68s)]
*  imperial design or mission. They wanted a state for themselves, the Jews, happy to have the British [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6703.12s)]
*  support them, happy today to have the Americans support Israel. But it's not because we're [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6709.360000000001s)]
*  stooges or extensions of American imperial interests. The British incidentally always [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6714.08s)]
*  described in narratives or propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism. They weren't. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6720.96s)]
*  The first British rulers in Palestine 1917, 1920- [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6727.44s)]
*  Herbert Samuel. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6731.36s)]
*  No, before Herbert Samuel. Samuel came in 1920. The British ruled there for three years previously, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6732.24s)]
*  and most of the leaders, the British generals and so on who were in Palestine were anti-Zionist. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6738.4s)]
*  Subsequently, in the 20s and 30s, the British occasionally [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6744.08s)]
*  curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine. In 1939, switched horses and supported the Arab national [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6748.24s)]
*  movement and not Zionism. They turned anti-Zionist and basically said, you Arabs will rule Palestine [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6754.96s)]
*  within the next 10 years. This is what we're giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6760.88s)]
*  Palestine. But the Arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on the silver platter, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6765.12s)]
*  Hosseini again. He said, no, no, we can't accept the British white paper of May 1939, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6771.28s)]
*  which had given the Arabs everything they wanted basically, self-determination in an Arab majority [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6776.88s)]
*  state. What I'm saying is the British at some point did support the Zionist enterprise, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6782.32s)]
*  but that the other points were less consistent in the support. In 1939, until 1948, when they [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6789.28s)]
*  didn't vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6795.28s)]
*  they didn't support Zionism during the last decade of the mandate. It's worth remembering that. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6801.12s)]
*  – I'd like to respond to that. Speaking of propaganda, I find it simply impossible to accept [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6805.679999999999s)]
*  that Balfour, who as British prime minister in 1905 was a chief sponsor of the Aliens Act, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6815.5199999999995s)]
*  which was specifically designed to keep persecuted Eastern European Jews out of the [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6824.4s)]
*  streets of the UK and who was denounced as an anti-Semite by the entire British Jewish establishment. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6833.12s)]
*  A decade later, all of a sudden, people change their minds. But when the changing of the mind [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6841.759999999999s)]
*  just coincidentally happens to coincide with the British imperial interest, I think perhaps [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6852.0s)]
*  the transformation is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for. It was clearly [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6860.16s)]
*  a British imperial venture, and if there had been no threat to the Suez Canal during World War I, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6868.0s)]
*  regardless of what Balfour would have thought about the Jews and their contribution to [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6876.16s)]
*  history and their persecution and so on, there would have been no Balfour. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6881.2s)]
*  – Can I ask a real quick question on that? Why did the British ever cap immigration then [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6884.88s)]
*  from Jews to that area at all? – Well, we're talking now about— [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6889.12s)]
*  – Twenty-three— [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6894.16s)]
*  – Sure, but I'm saying that if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6895.2s)]
*  there were terrorist attacks from Jewish— – Yes, but I'll answer you. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6898.719999999999s)]
*  – Yeah, in the 40s, yeah. – And we're talking now about 1917, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6903.5199999999995s)]
*  and as I mentioned earlier, I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind. That's why [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6908.0s)]
*  they used the term Jewish national home. I think what they wanted was a British protectorate loyal [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6913.84s)]
*  to and dependent upon the British. I think an outstanding review of British policy towards [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6920.400000000001s)]
*  these issues during the mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6929.04s)]
*  and he basically makes the argument that once the British realized the mess they were in, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6935.28s)]
*  certainly by the late 20s, early 30s, they recognized the mess they were in, the irreconcilable [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6943.68s)]
*  differences, and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on. And muddling on in the context [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6952.96s)]
*  of British rule in Palestine, whose overall purpose was to serve for the development of [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6962.56s)]
*  Zionist institutions, Yeshua's economy and so on, meant even if the British were not [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6971.280000000001s)]
*  self-consciously doing this, preparing the groundwork for the eventual establishment [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6978.56s)]
*  of a Jewish state. I don't know if that answers your question. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6984.400000000001s)]
*  – Except they did turn anti-Zionist in 1939— [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6986.56s)]
*  – Yes, yes, of course. – And maintained that anti— [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6988.4800000000005s)]
*  – They were being shot off by— – And maintained that Zionist— [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6990.56s)]
*  – Yeah. – No, no, before they were being shot off, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6993.280000000001s)]
*  but maintained that anti-Zionist posture until 1948. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6994.8s)]
*  – Okay. – And if I may, just also one point. You [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=6998.240000000001s)]
*  mentioned Haj Amin al-Husseini during a world entirely legitimate, but what I would also [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7001.84s)]
*  point out is that you had a Zionist organization, the Leahy— [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7010.400000000001s)]
*  – 300 people, Martin. – 300 people, one of whom happened [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7015.280000000001s)]
*  to become an Israeli prime minister, an Israeli foreign minister, a speaker of Israeli parliament. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7018.48s)]
*  – Maybe you should give his name. – Yitzhak Shamir, proposing an alliance [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7023.04s)]
*  with Nazi Germany in 1941. – Shamir proposed— [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7030.4s)]
*  – Shamir, well no, the Leahy proposed— – Some people in the Leahy proposed— [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7034.48s)]
*  – Of which Shamir was a prominent leader. – Yeah, but then this is a red herring also. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7038.08s)]
*  – No, no, okay, well if he's a red herring, Haj Amin al-Husseini is a red whale. I'm sorry. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7040.639999999999s)]
*  – The Leahy was an unimportant organization in the Yishuv. 300 people versus 30,000 belonged [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7046.48s)]
*  to the Hagana. So it was not a very important organization. It's true, before the Holocaust [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7052.48s)]
*  actually began, they wanted allies against the British where they could find them. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7057.04s)]
*  – We're talking 1941 here, not 1931. – We're talking 1940. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7060.4s)]
*  – 41 from what I recall. – 1940, they approached the [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7063.759999999999s)]
*  German emissary in Ankara. – Yes. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7067.759999999999s)]
*  – And if I may, proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany on what the Leahy described as [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7070.4800000000005s)]
*  on the basis of shared ideological principles. – No, they didn't share ideological principles. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7078.400000000001s)]
*  – Well, they said they did. – No, they didn't. They reviled— [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7083.52s)]
*  – Why are you doing these things? Of course they said it. You know the statement, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7086.24s)]
*  but you know that— – The Leahy was reviled. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7090.16s)]
*  – You know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology. Why do you say no? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7091.52s)]
*  – Do you think that the Leahy— Wait, the Leahy people were Nazis. Is that what you're saying? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7097.68s)]
*  – I'm saying that— – No, you're saying that. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7101.040000000001s)]
*  Forget statements. You like to quote things, but were they Nazis? Were the Leahy Nazis? [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7104.72s)]
*  That's what I'm asking. Some of them supported Stalin, incidentally. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7111.040000000001s)]
*  – Did he say that the basis of the pact was their agreement on ideology? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7114.4800000000005s)]
*  – There wasn't any pact. They suggested— – I said— [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7118.0s)]
*  – They proposed an agreement. – Right. And what did the agreement say? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7120.320000000001s)]
*  – They wanted arms against the British. That's what they wanted. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7123.120000000001s)]
*  – That's what Haj Amin al-Husseini wanted also. That's what others in India— [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7126.16s)]
*  – The Leahy people didn't work in Berlin helping the Nazi regime. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7130.56s)]
*  – I mean, it's what the IRA wanted also. – No, but this is what Haj Amin al-Husseini did. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7134.16s)]
*  You know that he was an anti-Semite. You've probably read some of his works. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7138.56s)]
*  He wasn't just anti-British. He was also anti-Semitic. So he had a common ground with Hitler. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7143.04s)]
*  – I think we can agree— – Not every anti-Semite is a Hitlerite. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7148.4800000000005s)]
*  – He literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people. He wasn't just a guy— [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7152.72s)]
*  – Yes, and he was an absolutely revolting, disgusting human being. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7157.280000000001s)]
*  – There's something happening here. – But the problem is, you're saying [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7162.64s)]
*  that Hussain was his influence. You're saying the move— [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7165.92s)]
*  – But I don't even understand of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7167.76s)]
*  trying to blame them directly, indirectly, indirectly, or indirectly, three times a move [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7175.68s)]
*  for the Nazi Holocaust is completely lunatic. – Hold on. He's not blaming them for the Holocaust. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7182.0s)]
*  He's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region, Palestinians would have been part of [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7188.56s)]
*  the region. That is exactly what he said. – You've read— – You've read— [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7194.72s)]
*  – I've read him. You've read— – You've read— [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7198.0s)]
*  – You've read— – You don't understand him. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7198.4s)]
*  – You've read— – He's sitting right here. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7199.2s)]
*  – Believe me, I'm a lot more literate than you, Mr. Borelli. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7200.24s)]
*  – I'm going to believe the guy that wrote the stuff. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7203.76s)]
*  – You read what Wikipedia says. – That's great. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7205.04s)]
*  – I read Fannie Mars. – And you don't even speak Hebrew. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7206.72s)]
*  You call yourself an Israeli historian. – We're all here on different grounds. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7208.24s)]
*  If I can just respond to you. – No, no, I'm just saying that [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7212.240000000001s)]
*  there were two tricks— – You said nothing, as always. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7214.72s)]
*  – That's fine. There were two tricks that are being played here that I think is interesting. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7216.96s)]
*  One is you guys claim that the Lehi was trying to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany because [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7220.0s)]
*  of a shared ideology. – That's what they said. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7223.92s)]
*  – Yeah, but hold on. No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. No, no. It's about what you said. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7225.84s)]
*  You brought that up to imply that Zionism must be inexorably linked to— [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7229.200000000001s)]
*  – No, no, I'm sorry. No, you're putting words in my mouth. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7233.360000000001s)]
*  – No, no, no. Okay, wait. Well, then what was the purpose of saying that the Lehi claimed that they— [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7236.240000000001s)]
*  – The reason I brought it up— – Small group of people that were reviled by [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7240.8s)]
*  many in Israel— – Not many, by everybody, practically. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7242.96s)]
*  – Well, compared to them, they were so reviled. – The Zionist movement called them terrorists. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7245.68s)]
*  – Yes, yes. And Shemir called himself a terrorist. They were so irrelevant that their leader [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7249.2s)]
*  ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of the Israeli parliament— [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7257.2s)]
*  – That's Israeli politics, 60 years hence. – To Israeli foreign minister. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7260.64s)]
*  – And Begin was also— – Yes. You want to characterize him [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7264.32s)]
*  as irrelevant as well? Go ahead. – No, no, no. Characterizing him as [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7268.0s)]
*  relevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later. The timeline matters. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7270.64s)]
*  The question is, what is the point of saying that the Lehi tried to forge in a long time— [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7274.64s)]
*  – Why is Shemir as relevant as bringing up the Mufti of Jerusalem and trying to blame the Holocaust [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7277.68s)]
*  indirectly? Indirectly? Indirectly? – No, no, no. The Mufti was the leader of the [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7285.28s)]
*  Palestine Arab National Movement. The Lehi was 300 people. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7289.44s)]
*  – And he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7292.64s)]
*  – No, he recruited people for the SS. How can you get away from that? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7295.84s)]
*  – No, he recruited soldiers— – People for the SS. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7299.76s)]
*  – He recruited soldiers in the Balkans, mostly Kosovars, which was disgusting. I have no doubt [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7301.92s)]
*  about that. But he had one— – He also wrote letters to foreign ministers saying, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7307.84s)]
*  don't let the Jews out. The Hungarian foreign minister, the Italian foreign minister, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7311.92s)]
*  received letters from Husseini during the Holocaust. During the Holocaust, don't let the Jews out. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7317.92s)]
*  Don't let the Jews out. I'm not saying he was a major architect of the Holocaust. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7324.16s)]
*  – He wasn't even minor. What sentence? – But if we're agreed that Haj Amin al-Husseini, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7327.84s)]
*  the Mufti of Jerusalem, collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and actively sought [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7334.639999999999s)]
*  their sponsorship, why is it irrelevant— – And probably wanted the destruction of [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7340.8s)]
*  European Jewry. – He probably wanted a lot of things. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7345.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. If that's relevant, why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel— [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7348.64s)]
*  – Not prime minister. In 1941, he wasn't prime minister of Israel. He was a leader of a very small [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7355.84s)]
*  terrorist group. The terrorist is terrorist by the mainstream of Zionism. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7362.16s)]
*  – Do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago Mahmoud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7365.92s)]
*  which is basically tantamount— – It shows something about Mahmoud Abbas. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7371.76s)]
*  – Okay, but— – But I didn't bring it up. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7374.16s)]
*  You're the one who's bringing it up. – Yes, but you consider that relevant. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7375.84s)]
*  – Belittling the Holocaust. That's what you're saying. The president of the Palestinian National [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7378.56s)]
*  Authority belittled the Holocaust and it didn't happen or only a few Jews died. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7383.360000000001s)]
*  – I think that's a fair characterization of Mahmoud Abbas. I brought it up. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7387.360000000001s)]
*  Because my question is then why is Shamir's antecedency relevant? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7392.56s)]
*  – He was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7397.52s)]
*  – Who became Israel— – Haj Amin al-Husseini was the head [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7402.0s)]
*  of the movement at the time. – Also, the point of bringing up [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7403.92s)]
*  Hussaini's stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the Holocaust. It's that he might [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7406.4800000000005s)]
*  have been a great further in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine to escape the Holocaust. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7412.72s)]
*  – Yes, but the point I made— – That was the point. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7417.12s)]
*  – And I explained why I think that's not an entirely accurate characterization. And then I [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7418.4s)]
*  wanted to make another point. If it's legitimate to bring up his role during World War II, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7427.84s)]
*  why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become Israel's speaker of parliament, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7433.84s)]
*  foreign minister— – Forty years since. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7440.96s)]
*  – Yes. Why is it—and also— – He was a young terrorist. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7441.84s)]
*  – And was also responsible for the murder of the United Nations' first international envoy, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7445.6s)]
*  Bernadotti, Foki Bernadotti. Why is all that irrelevant? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7453.04s)]
*  – I don't think anybody would say— – I don't understand. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7456.48s)]
*  – I think that the reason why he was brought up was because Jewish people at the—in [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7457.76s)]
*  this time period would have viewed it as there was a prevention of Jews leaving Europe because [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7462.64s)]
*  of the Palestinians pressuring the British to put a curb at that 75,000 immigration limit, yes. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7467.84s)]
*  But it's not about them furthering the Holocaust or being an architect major or minor play in the [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7473.04s)]
*  Holocaust. It was a major play in that region. So if you wanted to bring up— [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7477.6s)]
*  – Actually, Betty Morris made the specific claim that the Palestinians played an indirect [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7480.56s)]
*  role in the Holocaust. – The indirect role would have been the prevention of people escaping from— [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7486.320000000001s)]
*  – Yes. And my response to that is, first of all, I disagree with that characterization, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7490.08s)]
*  but second of all— – How can you disagree with that? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7497.36s)]
*  They prevented—they forced the British to prevent emigration of Jews from Europe [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7499.6s)]
*  and reaching safe shores in Palestine. That's what they did. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7504.08s)]
*  – Well, again— – And they knew that the Jews— [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7506.8s)]
*  – Was Palestine— – Were being persecuted in Europe. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7508.24s)]
*  – Was Palestine the only spot of land on Earth? – Yes, basically that was the problem. The Jews [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7510.32s)]
*  couldn't emigrate in Europe. – What about your great friends in Britain, the architects of the [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7515.84s)]
*  Balfour Declaration? – By the late 1930s, they weren't happy to take in Jews, and the Americans [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7520.72s)]
*  weren't happy to take in Jews. – And why are Palestinians, who were not Europeans, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7525.76s)]
*  who had zero role in the rise of Nazism, who had no relation to any of this, why are they somehow [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7530.08s)]
*  uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe and uniquely culpable? – Because they were helping [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7536.400000000001s)]
*  to close the only safe haven for Jews. That's all. – Oh, really, the United States wasn't, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7540.400000000001s)]
*  a potential safe haven. The only one was Palestine. The United States had no room [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7544.88s)]
*  from the Atlantic to Pacific for Jews. – No, it did have room. It did have room. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7552.64s)]
*  – It did have room, but it didn't want Jews. – So that wasn't the only safe haven. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7555.120000000001s)]
*  – But it didn't want Jews. – But shouldn't you be focusing your anger and outrage? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7558.96s)]
*  – America should be blamed for not letting Jews in during the 30s and 40s. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7561.200000000001s)]
*  – They are blamed, but nobody blames them for the Holocaust. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7564.96s)]
*  – Well, indirectly— – No, I've never heard it said that [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7568.0s)]
*  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the Holocaust. I never heard that. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7571.2s)]
*  Now, maybe it's in Israeli literature because the Israelis have gone mad. Yes, your prime minister [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7576.96s)]
*  said the whole idea of the gas chambers came from the Mufti of Jerusalem. – That's nonsense. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7582.96s)]
*  – Yeah, but he said it. – We all know that's nonsense. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7589.2s)]
*  – But we also know that Netanyahu said it. – Netanyahu says so many things which are absurd. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7590.639999999999s)]
*  – And he happens to be the prime minister of Israel. – I cannot be responsible for them. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7596.0s)]
*  – You're not responsible for them, but it is relevant that he's the longest-serving prime [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7600.320000000001s)]
*  minister of Israel. – Unfortunately, it says something about the Israeli public. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7605.360000000001s)]
*  – Yes, and he gets selected, not despite saying such things, but because he said such things. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7608.4800000000005s)]
*  – His voters don't care about Haj Amid al-Husseini or Hitler. They know nothing about [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7613.52s)]
*  his voters. – You may well be right. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7618.88s)]
*  – His base know nothing about anything, and he can say what he likes, and they'll say yes, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7619.84s)]
*  so they don't care if he says these things. – You may well be right, but anyway, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7624.24s)]
*  not to beat a dead horse, but I still don't understand. – That's not to beat a dead horse. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7629.2s)]
*  – I'll just conclude by saying I don't understand why the Mufti of Jerusalem is relevant. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7634.5599999999995s)]
*  – He is relevant. He is relevant. – But have you checked Shamir? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7638.5599999999995s)]
*  – The Palestinian… because Shamir wasn't the head of the national movement. He represented [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7642.32s)]
*  100 or 200 or 300 gunmen who were considered terrorists by the Zionist movement at the time. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7647.36s)]
*  The fact that 30 years later he becomes prime minister, that's the crux of history. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7652.96s)]
*  – But Haj Amid al-Husseini was the head of the Palestine Arab national movement at the time. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7658.0s)]
*  Anyway, I think we're speaking past each other. – We're not. I'm talking facts. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7662.72s)]
*  – Let's move to the modern day, and we'll return to history maybe 67 and other important moments, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7667.84s)]
*  but let's look to today in the recent months. October 7th. Let me ask sort of a pointed question. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7673.6s)]
*  Was October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel genocidal? Was it an act of ethnic cleansing? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7681.4400000000005s)]
*  Just so we lay out the moral calculus that we are engaging in. I don't… maybe you was… [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7688.320000000001s)]
*  – The problem with October 7th is this. The Hamas fighters who invaded southern Israel [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7694.64s)]
*  were sent, ordered to murder, rape, and do all the nasty things that they did. They killed some [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7705.52s)]
*  1200 Israelis that day and abducted them, as we know, something like 250 civilians, mostly civilians, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7714.160000000001s)]
*  also some soldiers, took them back to dungeons in Gaza. But they were motivated not just by the [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7722.4800000000005s)]
*  words of their current leader in the Gaza Strip, but by their ideology, which is embedded in [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7730.08s)]
*  their charter from 1988, if I remember correctly. That charter is genocidal. It says that the Jews [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7737.04s)]
*  must be eradicated basically from the land of Israel, from Palestine. The Jews are described [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7744.72s)]
*  there as sons of apes and pigs. The Jews are a base people, killers of prophets, and they should [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7751.28s)]
*  not exist in Palestine. It doesn't say that they necessarily should be murdered all around the world, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7758.08s)]
*  the Hamas charter, but certainly the Jews should be eliminated from Palestine. This is the driving [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7763.36s)]
*  ideology behind the massacre of the Jews on October 7th, which brought down on the Gaza Strip. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7769.5199999999995s)]
*  I think with the intention by the Hamas of the Israeli counteroffensive, because they knew that [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7777.28s)]
*  counteroffensive would result in many Palestinian dead because the Hamas fighters and their [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7783.280000000001s)]
*  weaponry and so on were embedded in the population in Gaza. They hoped to benefit from this in the [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7790.08s)]
*  eyes of world public opinion as Israel chased these Hamas people and their ammunition dumps and so on [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7796.0s)]
*  and killed lots of Palestinian civilians in the process. All of this was understood by [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7801.76s)]
*  Sinwar, by the head of the Hamas, and he strived for that. But initially, he wanted to kill as [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7807.12s)]
*  many Jews as he could in the border areas around the Gaza Strip. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7812.4s)]
*  RL I'll respond directly to the points you made, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7817.599999999999s)]
*  and then I'll leave it to Norm to bring in the historical context. The Hamas charter is from [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7821.36s)]
*  the 90s, I think. I think your characterization of that charter as anti-Semitic is indisputable. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7829.28s)]
*  RL Okay. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7842.32s)]
*  RL I think your characterization of that charter as genocidal is off the mark. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7843.12s)]
*  RL It's implicit. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7850.5599999999995s)]
*  RL And more importantly, that charter has been superseded by a new charter. In fact, it has been, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7851.84s)]
*  well, there is a- RL There is no new charter. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7860.32s)]
*  RL There is a new charter. RL There is an explanation, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7862.639999999999s)]

*  But it doesn't actually step back from what the charter says, eliminate Israel, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7872.08s)]
*  eliminate the Jews from the land of Israel. RL And 2018, the Hamas charter, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7876.08s)]
*  if we look at the current version of the charter- RL It's not a called charter. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7881.52s)]
*  RL You're calling it a charter. It wasn't. The only thing called the charter is what was issued [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7884.88s)]
*  in 1988 by Yassin himself. RL Anyway, it makes a clear distinction [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7888.8s)]
*  between Jews and Zionists in 2018. Now, you can choose to dismiss it, believe it, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7893.68s)]
*  it's sincere, it's insincere, whatever. RL Insincere is probably the right word. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7899.92s)]
*  RL Secondly, I'm really unfamiliar with fighters who consult these kinds of documents. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7904.639999999999s)]

*  years old in the kindergartens of the Hamas. RL At the instruction of the commissioner general [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7923.12s)]
*  of UNRWA, right? RL I didn't say that. I said the Hamas has [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7927.52s)]

*  RL Secondly, you keep saying Jews, to which I would respond- [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7936.64s)]
*  RL They use the word Jews. RL To which I would respond that Hamas [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7940.72s)]
*  does not have a record of deliberately targeting Jews who are not Israelis. And in fact, it also [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7944.080000000001s)]
*  doesn't have a record of deliberately targeting either Jews or Israelis outside Israel and [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7951.52s)]
*  Palestine. So all this talk of- RL Unlike the Hezbollah, which has targeted [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7957.92s)]
*  Jews outside Palestine. RL We're talking about October 7th in Hamas. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7964.160000000001s)]
*  If you'd also like to speak about Hezbollah, let's get to that separately, if you don't mind. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7968.56s)]
*  So again, genocidal, well, if that term is going to be discussed, my first response would be, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7974.64s)]
*  let's talk about potentially genocidal actions against Israelis rather than against Jews for [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7986.88s)]
*  the reasons that I just mentioned. And again, I find this constant conflation of Jews, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=7993.6s)]
*  Israel Zionism to be a bit disturbing. Secondly, I think there are quite a few [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8000.64s)]
*  indications in the factual record that raise serious questions about the accusations of [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8009.4400000000005s)]
*  the genocidal intent and genocidal practice of what happened on October 7th. And my final point [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8016.88s)]
*  would be, I don't think I should take your word for it. I don't think you should take my word for [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8023.360000000001s)]
*  it. I think what we need here is a proper independent international investigation. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8028.88s)]
*  And the reason we need that- RL Of what? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8035.52s)]
*  RL Of genocide during this conflict, whether by Palestinians on October 7th or Israel thereafter. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8036.8s)]
*  The reason that we need such an investigation is because Hamas is, there won't be any hearings [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8044.72s)]
*  on what Hamas did on October 7th at the International Court of Justice, because the [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8053.2s)]
*  international convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide deals only [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8059.12s)]
*  with states and not with movements. I think the International Criminal Court and specifically [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8065.44s)]
*  its current prosecutor, Karim Khan, lacks any and all credibility. He's been an absolute failure [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8070.8s)]
*  at his job. He's just been sitting on his backside for years on this file. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8077.36s)]
*  And I think I would point out that Hamas has called for independent investigations of all [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8081.839999999999s)]
*  these allegations. Israel has categorically rejected any international investigation, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8090.0s)]
*  of course, fully supported by the United States. And I think what is required is to have credible [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8095.44s)]
*  investigations of these things, because I don't think you're going to convince me. I don't think [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8104.64s)]
*  I'm going to convince you. And this is two people sitting across the table from each other. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8109.04s)]
*  RL No, there's certain things you don't even have to investigate. You know how many citizens, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8114.16s)]
*  civilians died in the October 7th assault. You know that there are lots of allegations of rape. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8118.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know how persuaded you are of those. They did find bodies without heads, which is- [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8124.08s)]
*  There were no beheadings of infants. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8130.0s)]
*  There were some beheadings, apparently. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8131.52s)]
*  The Israelis didn't even claim that in the document they submitted before the ICJ. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8134.0s)]
*  Go read what your government submitted. It never mentioned beheadings. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8139.12s)]
*  Well, as far as I know, there were some people who were beheaded. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8143.52s)]
*  I read it. We could bring it up right now. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8145.68s)]
*  You also deny that there were rapes there. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8147.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't deny. I said I've not seen convincing evidence that confirms it. I've said that from [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8149.6s)]
*  day one, and I'll say it today four and a half months later. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8155.12s)]
*  Do you know that they killed 800 or 900 civilians in their assault? [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8158.56s)]
*  Absolutely. That seems to me indisputable. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8161.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad that you're considering something. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8164.080000000001s)]
*  I've said that from day one. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8166.72s)]
*  To be clear, you haven't. You did a debate. I don't remember the talk show, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8168.8s)]
*  but you seem to imply that there was a lot of crossfire, and then it might have been the IDF [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8171.92s)]
*  that killed a lot of- I said that there is no question, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8174.8s)]
*  because the names were published in Horace, there is no question that roughly of the 1,200 people [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8178.72s)]
*  killed, 800 of them were civilians. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8185.6s)]
*  850. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8188.240000000001s)]
*  850, fine. I never said that, but then I said, no, we don't know exactly how they were killed, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8189.120000000001s)]
*  but 800 civilians killed, 850, no question there. I also said on repeated occasions, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8195.2s)]
*  there cannot be any doubt in my opinion as of now with the available evidence [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8203.76s)]
*  that Hamas was responsible for significant atrocities, and I made sure to include the plural. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8208.56s)]
*  There's a lot of tricky language being employed here. Do you think of the 850? [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8214.08s)]
*  It's called attaching value to words and not talking like a motormouth. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8217.12s)]
*  I am very careful about qualifying because that's what language is about. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8223.92s)]
*  That's great. Then let me just ask a clarifying question. Do you firmly believe that the majority [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8229.28s)]
*  of the 850 civilians were killed by Hamas? [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8233.12s)]
*  My view is even if it were half, 400 is a huge number by any reckoning. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8235.44s)]
*  Why? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8244.32s)]
*  Okay, wait, you didn't say it. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8244.800000000001s)]
*  I said even if- [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8245.6s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8246.480000000001s)]
*  Because Benny- [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8247.28s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8247.84s)]
*  Wait, you didn't say my question. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8248.32s)]
*  Because Professor Morris, I don't know, I agree with Muin Rabbani. I'm not sure if he concedes [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8249.28s)]
*  the 400. I'll say- [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8259.04s)]
*  Why 400? Who ever thought of the 100, 400? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8260.480000000001s)]
*  Right, as I said- [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8263.52s)]
*  I said- [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8264.32s)]
*  850 was slaughtered by Hamas. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8264.8s)]
*  If I may. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8267.6s)]
*  No, I don't know- [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8268.0s)]
*  Maybe a couple of individuals were killed in this reaction. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8268.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8271.6s)]
*  You're saying from day one you believe this particular thing and you clearly don't. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8273.199999999999s)]
*  You clearly don't believe this thing. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8276.72s)]
*  I said from day one I- [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8278.08s)]
*  You said people died. That's not controversial. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8280.0s)]
*  Wait, hold on, hold on. If I may- [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8282.48s)]
*  That's not controversial. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8283.84s)]
*  Mr. Bonnell, I attach value to words. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8284.88s)]
*  Yes, you've said that. If you value them, you're talking so much. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8289.92s)]
*  Mr. Bonnell, please slow down the speech and attempt to listen. When I was explicitly asked [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8292.56s)]
*  by Piers Morgan, I said there can be no question that Hamas committed atrocities- [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8299.519999999999s)]
*  I've heard this, yes. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8306.88s)]
*  On October 7th. If you want me to pin down a number, I can't do that. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8307.439999999999s)]
*  And ask you to pin down a number. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8313.76s)]
*  You can listen to what I'm saying. No, my question is- [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8315.279999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8317.279999999999s)]
*  I'll ask you. I'll ask you very precisely. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8317.68s)]
*  Sorry, if you'll be- [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8319.119999999999s)]
*  Excuse me. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8319.92s)]
*  It's a very easy question. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8321.359999999999s)]
*  If I understood your question correctly- [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8322.0s)]
*  My question is, do you think the majority of the people that were killed on October 7th, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8323.519999999999s)]
*  the civilians, were killed by Hamas? Or are we subscribing to the idea that the IDF killed [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8326.64s)]
*  hundreds, four or five hundred in the crossfire? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8330.08s)]
*  Let me explain why that's a difficult question to answer. The total number of civilians killed was [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8331.92s)]
*  800, 850. We know that Hamas is responsible probably for the majority of those killings. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8337.599999999999s)]
*  We also know that there were killings by Islamic Jihad. We also know- [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8347.039999999999s)]
*  No, we're bunching together the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas. That's splitting hairs now. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8353.039999999999s)]
*  His question was specifically about- [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8357.119999999999s)]
*  No, but he means the raiders. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8358.32s)]
*  He means the raiders. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8359.76s)]
*  I'm speaking in opposition to the conspiracy theory that people like- [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8360.72s)]
*  Do you prefer Norm or Professor Frankenstein or what do you- I don't know what you're- [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8365.6s)]
*  Well, it's not a conspiracy theory. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8368.56s)]
*  Well, the conspiracy theory is the idea that the IDF killed the majority of them. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8370.32s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8373.68s)]
*  There's also a theory that, as Norm pointed out on the show that he was on, that he thought that it [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8375.359999999999s)]
*  was very strange that given how reputable Israeli services are when it comes to sending ambulances, [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8379.279999999999s)]
*  retrieving bodies, he thought it was very strange that that number was continually being adjusted. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8386.0s)]
*  And do you know why- [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8389.76s)]
*  When you say that in combination with, well, I'm not sure how many were killed by Hamas. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8390.48s)]
*  Do you know why the number went down? The number went down because the Israeli authorities were [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8394.8s)]
*  in possession of 200 corpses that were burned to a crisp that they assumed were [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8400.72s)]
*  Israelis who had been killed on October 7th. They later determined that these were in fact [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8410.16s)]
*  Palestinian fighters. Now, how does a Palestinian fighter get burned to a crisp? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8416.0s)]
*  No, you're mixing two things. Some of the bodies they weren't able to identify and eventually they [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8421.44s)]
*  ruled that some of them were actually Arab marauders rather than Israeli victims. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8427.039999999999s)]
*  A few of them also, the Jews, were burnt to a crisp and it took them time to work this out. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8433.199999999999s)]
*  And they came out initially with a slightly higher figure, 1,400 dead, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8438.08s)]
*  and eventually reduced it to 1,200 dead Israelis. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8442.08s)]
*  And the reason is that a proportion of Israeli civilians killed on October 7th, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8445.199999999999s)]
*  I don't believe it was a majority. We don't know how many. Some were killed in crossfire. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8449.68s)]
*  Some were killed by Israeli shellfire, helicopter fire, and so on. And the majority were killed [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8456.0s)]
*  by Palestinians. And of that majority, we don't know. I mean, again, I understood your question [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8466.24s)]
*  as referring specifically to Hamas, which is why I tried to answer it that way. But if you meant [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8473.28s)]
*  generically Palestinians, yes. If you mean specifically Hamas, we don't have a clear [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8478.800000000001s)]
*  breakdown of how many were killed. No, I don't mean specifically Hamas. But I just think when [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8484.0s)]
*  you use the word some, that's doing a lot of heavy lifting. Who used some? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8486.56s)]
*  That's fine, but some can mean anywhere from 1% to 49%. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8489.84s)]
*  But we don't know. So the numbers here and the details are interesting and important almost from [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8493.04s)]
*  a legal perspective. But if we zoom out the moral perspective, are Palestinians from Gaza justified [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8498.64s)]
*  in violent resistance? Well, Palestinians have the right to resistance. Palestinians, that right [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8505.44s)]
*  includes the right to armed resistance. At the same time, armed resistance is subject [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8513.2s)]
*  to the laws of war. And there are very clear regulations that separate legitimate acts of [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8520.560000000001s)]
*  armed resistance from acts of armed resistance that are not legitimate. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8527.44s)]
*  And the attacks of October 7th, where did they land for you? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8532.880000000001s)]
*  There has been almost exclusive focus on the attacks on civilian population centers [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8536.24s)]
*  and the killings of civilians on October 7th. What is much less discussed to the point of [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8543.76s)]
*  amnesia is that there were very extensive attacks on Israeli military and intelligence facilities [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8554.48s)]
*  on October 7th. I would make a very clear distinction between those two. And secondly, [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8562.8s)]
*  I'm not sure that I would characterize the efforts by Palestinians on October 7th to seize [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8572.4s)]
*  Israeli territory and Israeli population centers as in and of themselves illegitimate. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8583.44s)]
*  You mean attacking Israeli civilians? No, no, no. That's not what I said. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8590.96s)]
*  I think what you had on October 7th was an effort by Hamas to seize Israeli territory and population [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8596.16s)]
*  centers. That's not what I said. What I said is I think I would not describe the effort to seize [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8603.919999999998s)]
*  Israeli territory as in and of itself illegitimate, as a separate issue from the killing of Israeli [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8612.64s)]
*  civilians where in those cases where they had been deliberately targeted. That's very clearly [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8620.48s)]
*  illegitimate. All families were slaughtered in Kibbutzim. But I'm making- [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8625.76s)]
*  I think- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8628.72s)]
*  Many of them left wingers, incidentally, who helped Palestinians go to hospitals in Israel and so on. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8629.6s)]
*  Again- Even drove [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8635.199999999999s)]
*  Palestinian cancer patients to hospitals in Israeli- Again, I'm making a distinction here. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8636.4s)]
*  But you don't seem to be very condemnatory of what the Hamas did. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8641.039999999999s)]
*  I don't do selective condemnation. I'm not talking about selective. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8644.64s)]
*  I don't do selective outrage. I'm talking about specific condemnation [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8647.52s)]
*  of this specific assault on civilians. I would, for example, condemn Israeli [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8649.76s)]
*  assaults on civilians, deliberate assaults on civilians. I would condemn them, but you're [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8656.32s)]
*  not doing that with the Hamas. You know what the issue is? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8660.48s)]
*  I've been speaking in public now, I would say since the late 1980s and interviewed and so on. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8664.24s)]
*  I have never on one occasion ever been asked to condemn any Israeli act. When I've been in group [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8670.08s)]
*  discussions, those supporting the Israeli action or perspective, I have never encountered an [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8678.32s)]
*  example where these individuals are asked to condemn what Israel is doing. The demand and [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8684.64s)]
*  obligation of condemnation is exclusively applied, in my personal experience over decades, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8693.119999999999s)]
*  is exclusively applied to Palestinians and those- [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8700.88s)]
*  Israel is condemned day and night on every television channel and has been for the last [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8704.56s)]
*  decade. I'm telling you about a personal experience lasting decades. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8710.24s)]
*  Professor Morris, you said quote. I hope I'm trying to quote what you just said. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8713.359999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't have said anything at any point. You should say, Professor Morris, you just said, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8718.64s)]
*  I would condemn any time Israel deliberately attacks civilians, okay? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8724.88s)]
*  Okay. The problem, Professor Morris, is over and over again, you claim in the face of overwhelming [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8731.92s)]
*  evidence that they didn't attack civilians. That's not true. I've said Israel has attacked [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8743.76s)]
*  civilians. In Kivya, Israel attacked civilians and I've written extensively about it. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8750.0s)]
*  I know that. In Kaffir Qasem, they killed civilians. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8754.56s)]
*  And now let's- [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8757.76s)]
*  So you're just admitting, you're selecting, he has as- [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8758.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8762.800000000001s)]
*  As even as you cherry pick. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8763.44s)]
*  If I were you- [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8764.320000000002s)]
*  Before you do- [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8764.800000000001s)]
*  You cherry pick. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8765.36s)]
*  Let's fast forward when you were an adult. What did you say about the 1982 Lebanon War? [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8766.16s)]
*  What did I say? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8774.0s)]
*  You don't remember? Okay. Allow me. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8774.960000000001s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8777.44s)]
*  Okay. So it happens that I was not at all by any, I had no interest in the Israel-Palestine conflict [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8778.4s)]
*  as a young man until the 1982 Lebanon War. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8788.4s)]
*  Yeah. Lost the passage. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8794.16s)]
*  I'll find it. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8796.08s)]
*  Okay, real quick. While he's searching for that. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8796.72s)]
*  Yeah, allow me. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8798.08s)]
*  You bring up something that's really important that a lot of people don't draw distinction [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8798.72s)]
*  between in that there is just causes for war and there is just ways to act within a war. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8802.16s)]
*  And these two things principally do have a distinction from one another. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8807.2s)]
*  Correct. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8809.92s)]
*  However, while I appreciate the recognition of the distinction, the idea that the cause for war [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8810.560000000001s)]
*  that Hamas was engaged in, I don't believe if we look at their actions in war or the statements [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8816.720000000001s)]
*  that they've made, it doesn't seem like it had to do with the territorial acquisition. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8821.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8824.720000000001s)]
*  Like taking land back. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8825.52s)]
*  No, the point I was making was what was Hamas trying to achieve militarily on October 7th? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8827.12s)]
*  And I was pointing out that the focus has been very much on Hamas attacks on civilians and [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8836.4s)]
*  atrocities and so on. And I'm not saying those things should be ignored. What I'm saying is [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8843.92s)]
*  that what's getting lost in the shuffle is that there were extensive attacks on military and [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8849.6s)]
*  intelligence facilities. And as far as the, let's say the other aspects are concerned, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8856.56s)]
*  because I think either you or Lex asked me about the legitimacy of these attacks. I said, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8864.48s)]
*  I'm unclear whether efforts by Hamas to seize Israeli population centers in and of themselves [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8870.960000000001s)]
*  are illegitimate as opposed to actions that either deliberately targeted Israeli civilians [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8880.48s)]
*  or actions that should reasonably have been expected to result in the killings of Israeli [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8889.039999999999s)]
*  civilians. Those strike me as by definition illegitimate. And I want to be very clear [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8897.52s)]
*  about that. I have where I- [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8902.88s)]
*  Illegitimate means you condemn them. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8904.56s)]
*  Illegitimate means they are not legitimate. I have a problem- [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8906.48s)]
*  Condemning your side, yes. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8910.48s)]
*  No, not condemning my side. I have a problem with selective outrage and I have a problem [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8911.68s)]
*  with selective condemnation. And as I explained to you a few minutes ago, in my decades of [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8916.48s)]
*  appearing in public and being interviewed, I have never seen, I've never been asked to condemn an [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8923.68s)]
*  Israeli action. I've never been asked for a moral judgment on an Israeli action. Exclusive [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8931.279999999999s)]
*  requests for condemnation has to do with what Palestinian Zun more. And just as importantly, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8938.08s)]
*  I'm sure if you watch BBC or CNN, when is the last time an Israeli spokesperson has been asked to [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8943.359999999999s)]
*  condemn an Israeli act? I've never seen it. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8950.4s)]
*  I don't think we condemn the Arab side either though, right? I don't think there's any [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8954.16s)]
*  condemnation that- [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8956.72s)]
*  No, but now that we're talking about Israeli victims, all of a sudden morality is- [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8957.359999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the reason why it comes up is because there's no shortage of international [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8962.24s)]
*  condemnation for Israel. As Norm will point out a million times that there are 50 billion UN [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8965.279999999999s)]
*  resolutions, you've got Amnesty International, you've got multiple bodies of the UN, you've [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8969.28s)]
*  got now this case for the ICJ, so there's no question of if there's condemnation for Israel. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8973.28s)]
*  Sorry, if I can interrupt you, in 1948, the entire world stood behind the establishment of a Jewish [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8976.320000000002s)]
*  state and the entire world- [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8984.320000000002s)]
*  No, no, except Arab states and the Muslim states. Not the entire world. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8985.04s)]
*  Okay, but I think you know what I mean by that. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8988.560000000001s)]
*  The Western democracies, that's what you're saying. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8990.720000000001s)]
*  Well, and then also, it's my quick question- [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8992.880000000001s)]
*  Western democracies supported the establishment of Israel. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8993.84s)]
*  My quick question was, you said that you believe that, this is a very short one, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8996.0s)]
*  you think that there's an argument to be made that the people in Gaza, Hamas and the Zami [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=8999.199999999999s)]
*  Jadav, whoever participated, had a just cause for war. Maybe they didn't do it in the correct way, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9003.92s)]
*  but they maybe had a just cause for war. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9007.84s)]
*  I don't think there's a maybe there. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9009.68s)]
*  Okay, you think they absolutely had a just cause for it. Do you think that Israel has a just cause [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9010.96s)]
*  for Operation Swords of Iron? [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9014.8s)]
*  No, of course not. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9016.32s)]
*  Okay, all right. You can say your quote. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9017.439999999999s)]
*  Okay, first of all, on this issue of double standards, which is the one that irks or irritates [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9020.0s)]
*  Muin, you said that you are not a person of double standards, unlike people like Muin. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9030.16s)]
*  You hold high a single standard and you condemn deliberate Israeli attacks on- [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9038.880000000001s)]
*  On civilians. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9044.800000000001s)]
*  On civilians. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9046.640000000001s)]
*  When they occurred, yeah. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9047.44s)]
*  I would say that's true for the period up till 1967, and I think it's accurate, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9049.199999999999s)]
*  your account of the First Intifada. There, it seems to me, you were in conformity with [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9059.359999999999s)]
*  most mainstream accounts. In the case of the First Intifada, you also used, surprisingly, [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9065.84s)]
*  he used Arab human rights sources like Al Haq, which I think Muin worked for during the First [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9073.44s)]
*  Intifada. That's true. But then something very strange happens. So let's illustrate it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9079.84s)]
*  Wait, the something strange which happened is the Arabs rejected the Shia law. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9088.32s)]
*  Okay, wait. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9091.44s)]
*  Peace offers. That's what happened. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9091.94s)]
*  Well- [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9093.6s)]
*  By accepting the Oslo agreements. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9093.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9095.52s)]
*  Not the- [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9095.76s)]
*  By rejecting- [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9096.24s)]
*  He's talking about Camp David and Taba. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9096.800000000001s)]
*  Okay. If we have time, I know the record very well. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9097.76s)]
*  I'd be very happy to go through it with you. But let's get to those double standards. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9103.28s)]
*  So, this is what you have to say about Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9108.400000000001s)]
*  You said Israel was reluctant to harm civilians, sought to avoid casualties on both sides, [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9114.400000000001s)]
*  and took care not to harm Lebanese and Palestinian civilians. You then went on to acknowledge [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9125.04s)]
*  the massive use of IDF firepower against civilians during the siege of Beirut, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9137.12s)]
*  which traumatized Israeli society. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9144.240000000002s)]
*  Marx quickly answers the caveat. The Israel quote, [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9147.599999999999s)]
*  tried to pinpoint military targets, but inevitably many civilians were hit. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9151.68s)]
*  That's your description of the Lebanon War. As I say, that's when I first got involved in the [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9159.76s)]
*  conflict. I am a voracious reader. I read everything on the Lebanon War. I would say [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9166.08s)]
*  there's not a single account of the Lebanon War in which the estimates are between 15 and 20,000 [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9173.92s)]
*  Palestinian and Lebanese were killed, overwhelmingly civilians. The biggest blood [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9183.2s)]
*  letting until the current Gaza genocide, biggest blood letting, I would say, [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9189.04s)]
*  I can't think of a single mainstream account that remotely approximates what you just said. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9198.08s)]
*  So, leaving aside, I can name the books voluminous, huge volumes. I'll just take one example. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9206.240000000002s)]
*  Now, you will remember, because I think you served in Lebanon in 82. Am I correct on that? [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9214.560000000001s)]
*  So, you will remember that Dov Yarmia kept the war diary. So, with your permission, [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9220.640000000001s)]
*  allow me to describe what he wrote during his diary. So, he writes, the war machine of the IDF [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9227.36s)]
*  is galloping and trampling over the conquered territory, demonstrating a total [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9237.04s)]
*  insensitivity to the fate of the Arabs who are found in its path. A PLO run hospital [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9245.36s)]
*  suffered a direct hit. Thousands of refugees are returning to the city when they arrive at their [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9253.039999999999s)]
*  homes, many of which have been destroyed or damaged. You hear their cries of pain and their [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9260.0s)]
*  howls over the deaths of their loved ones. The air is permeated with the smell of corpses. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9266.72s)]
*  Destruction and death are continuing. Does that sound like your description of the Lebanon War? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9273.839999999998s)]
*  Forget my description. Forget it? The point you're making. Words are in print. We can't just forget [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9282.0s)]
*  them. Let me just finish my sentence. The point you're making, which you somehow forget, is that [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9287.12s)]
*  there are Israelis who strongly criticize their own side and describe how Israelis are doing things [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9292.32s)]
*  which they regard as immoral. You don't find that on the Arab side. I'm talking about you, Mr. Morris. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9298.4s)]
*  I'm not talking about you, the historian. How did you depict the Lebanon War? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9305.44s)]
*  I believe that the Israeli military tried to avoid committing a civilian casualty. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9313.28s)]
*  All the accounts by Robert Fisk and Pity the Nation, [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9320.560000000001s)]
*  anti-Zionist journalists, has always been. That's why you can say with such confidence [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9325.76s)]
*  that you don't condemn deliberate Israeli attacks on civilians. There weren't any. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9334.64s)]
*  Because there weren't any. No, I didn't say there weren't any. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9339.6s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't? You agreed that I have condemned Israeli [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9342.08s)]
*  attacks on civilians. Yes, there are. I never quarrel with facts. Your description of the 1982 [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9345.279999999999s)]
*  war is so shocking, it makes my innards writhe. Then your description of the second Intifada, [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9352.88s)]
*  your description of defensive shield, they are worse than apologetics. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9361.519999999999s)]
*  When Arab suicide bombers were destroying Jews in masses and buses and in restaurants. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9368.32s)]
*  That's the second Intifada. Do you remember that? Suicide bombers in Jerusalem's buses and [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9375.039999999999s)]
*  restaurants. I am completely aware of that. But if you forgot the numbers, it was three to one. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9381.359999999999s)]
*  They killed mostly armed Palestinian gunmen. That's what you say in your book. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9389.279999999999s)]
*  That's not what Amnesty International said. That's not what Human Rights Law said. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9395.68s)]
*  I don't remember what they said. I do. That's not what Deft Delam said. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9400.32s)]
*  Amari figures are right. Listen. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9404.48s)]
*  Listen. In the second Intifada, some 4,000 Palestinians were killed. Most of them armed [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9406.88s)]
*  people. And the Israelis, 1,000 Israelis were killed. Almost all of them. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9413.84s)]
*  Professor Morris, fantasy, but I'm not going to argue with here. Here's a simple challenge. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9419.52s)]
*  You said not to look at the camera. It scares the people. I'll make the open challenge. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9425.44s)]
*  You are going to scare them. No. Professor Morris. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9429.84s)]
*  Open challenge. Words are in print. I wrote 50 pages [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9433.28s)]
*  analyzing all of your work. I quote, some will say cherry pick, but I think accurately [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9438.64s)]
*  quote you. Here's a simple challenge. Answer me in print. Answer what I wrote and show where I'm [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9447.28s)]
*  making things up. Answer me in print. I'm not familiar. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9456.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with what you're doing. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9459.28s)]
*  That's no problem. You're a busy man. You're an important historian. You don't have to know [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9461.12s)]
*  everything that's in print, especially by modest publishers. But now you know. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9466.56s)]
*  So here's the public challenge. You answer and show where I cherry picked, where I misrepresented. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9473.279999999999s)]
*  Send me the article. Fine. And then we can have a civil scholarly discussion. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9482.16s)]
*  I'm not sure we will agree even if I- We don't have to agree. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9487.76s)]
*  Yeah, you don't. I understand that. Okay. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9490.56s)]
*  It's for the reader to decide looking at both sides where this truth stands. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9491.44s)]
*  No, and if I may ask, it's good to discuss ideas that are in the air now as opposed to citing [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9497.12s)]
*  literature that was written in the past as much as possible because listeners were not familiar [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9503.84s)]
*  with the literature. So like whatever was written, just express it, condense the key idea, and then [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9509.28s)]
*  we can debate the ideas. There are two aspects. There's a public debate, but there's also [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9515.36s)]
*  written words. Yes. I'm just telling you that you as an academic historian put a lot of value in [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9521.119999999999s)]
*  the written word, and I think it is valuable. But in this- [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9527.44s)]
*  He's incidentally not the only historian who puts value to words. I also do actually. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9530.72s)]
*  Yes. More than just one or two sentences at a time. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9534.4s)]
*  But in this context, just for the educational purpose of teaching people- [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9538.16s)]
*  Well, the educational purpose is why would people commit what I have to acknowledge? [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9542.48s)]
*  Because I am faithful to the facts, massive atrocities on October 7th. Why did that happen? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9548.24s)]
*  And I think that's the problem. The past is erased, and we suddenly went from 1948 [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9556.08s)]
*  to October 7th, 2023, and there is a problem there. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9564.64s)]
*  So first of all, you have complete freedom to backtrack, and we'll go there with you. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9570.16s)]
*  Obviously, we can't cover every single year, every single event, but there's probably critical [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9574.72s)]
*  moments in time. Can I respond to something relating to the Lebanon War? I looked at the [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9578.880000000001s)]
*  book that he got this from and what the quote was from. It sounds cold to say it, but war is tragic, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9582.08s)]
*  and civilians die. There is no war that this has not happened in in the history of all of humankind. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9588.72s)]
*  The statement that Israel might take care not to target civilians is not incompatible with a [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9594.48s)]
*  diary entry from someone who said they saw civilians getting killed. I think that sometimes [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9599.92s)]
*  we do a lot of weird games when we talk about international humanitarian law or laws that [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9603.76s)]
*  govern conflict, where we say things like civilians dying is a war crime, or civilian homes or [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9607.36s)]
*  hospitals getting destroyed is necessarily a war crime, or is necessarily somebody intentionally [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9612.72s)]
*  targeting civilians without making distinctions between military targets or civilian ones. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9617.04s)]
*  I think that when we analyze different attacks, or when we talk about the conduct of the military, [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9621.52s)]
*  I think it's important to understand it like prospectively from the unit of analysis of the [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9625.44s)]
*  actual military committing the acts, what's happening and what are the decisions being made, [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9630.720000000001s)]
*  rather than just saying retrospectively, oh, well, a lot of civilians died, not very many [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9635.28s)]
*  military people died, comparatively speaking. It must have been war crimes, especially when you've [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9640.480000000001s)]
*  got another side, I'll fast forward to Hamas, that intentionally attempts to induce those same [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9645.28s)]
*  civilian numbers, because Hamas is guilty of any war crime that you would potentially accuse, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9650.8s)]
*  and this is according to Amnesty International, people that Norm loves to cite, Hamas is guilty [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9655.279999999999s)]
*  of all of these same war crimes, of them failing to take care of the civilian population, of them [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9659.279999999999s)]
*  essentially utilizing human shields to try to fire rockets free from attacks. Essentially, yes. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9662.88s)]
*  I'm just saying that essentially, in terms of how international law defines it, not how Amnesty [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9669.519999999999s)]
*  International defines it, but Amnesty International describes times of human shielding, but they don't [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9672.88s)]
*  actually apply the correct international legal standard. You don't know what's the correct [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9676.4s)]
*  international law. You haven't the clothes. You haven't the clothes. You can't find it on Wikipedia. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9679.44s)]
*  You can't find it on Wikipedia. Believe it or not, Norm, the entire Geneva Convention is all on [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9685.6s)]
*  Wikipedia. It's a wonderful website. But I'm just saying that on the Hamas side, if there's an [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9689.6s)]
*  attempt to induce this type of military activity, attempt to induce civilian harm, that it's not just [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9693.36s)]
*  enough to say, well, here's a diary entry where a guy talks about how tragic these attacks are. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9697.68s)]
*  I think the problem with your statement is that if you go back and listen to it, the first part of it [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9701.76s)]
*  is war is hell, civilians die. It's a fact of life. You state that in a very factual matter. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9709.44s)]
*  Then when you start talking about Hamas, all of a sudden you've discovered morality, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9717.6s)]
*  and you've discovered condemnation, and you've discovered intent. You are unfortunately far [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9723.28s)]
*  from alone in this. You know who for me is a perfect example? [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9729.04s)]
*  Well, wait, hold on. We don't need examples. The false equivalency of the two sides is astounding. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9732.800000000001s)]
*  When Hamas kills civilians in a surprise attack on October 7th, this isn't because they are [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9739.28s)]
*  attempting to target military targets, and they happen to stumble into a giant festival of people. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9744.720000000001s)]
*  Well, they did happen to stumble into it. They did, but when they stumbled into it, [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9748.640000000001s)]
*  it wasn't an issue of trying to figure out a military target or not. They weren't failing [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9754.0s)]
*  in distinction. There wasn't a proportionality assessment done. It was just to kill civilians. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9757.04s)]
*  Even the Amnesty International in 2008 and in 2014, and even today, will continue to say that [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9761.12s)]
*  I don't think you'll find anyone who will deny that Hamas has targeted civilians. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9766.32s)]
*  You gave the example of suicide bombings during the second Intifada. I mean, facts are facts. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9772.08s)]
*  Sure, but I'm saying that the Hamas targeting civilians is different than the incidental [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9778.64s)]
*  loss of life that occurs when Israel does- How, you know, genocide is the intentional [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9782.32s)]
*  mass murder. Genocide is a entirely separate claim. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9787.84s)]
*  Yeah, but the idea that Israel is not in the business of intentionally [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9790.72s)]
*  targeting civilians, I know that's what we're supposed to believe, but the historical record [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9795.359999999999s)]
*  stands very clearly. I don't believe it does. You've written about it yourself. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9803.119999999999s)]
*  When you say historical, do you mean like in the 40s to the 60s, or do you mean like [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9807.279999999999s)]
*  over the past like- I would say from the 30s of the last century to the 20s of this century. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9811.039999999999s)]
*  I just like to make you- the way you characterized it, I think the best example of that I've come [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9815.84s)]
*  across during this specific conflict is John Kirby, the White House spokesman. I've named [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9823.04s)]
*  him Tears Tossed to Rome for a very good reason. When he's talking about Palestinian civilian [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9829.2s)]
*  deaths, war is hell, it's a fact of life, get used to it. When he was confronted with Israeli [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9836.4s)]
*  civilian deaths on October 7th, he literally broke down in tears. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9844.88s)]
*  But he understood that one is deliberate and one isn't. He understood that. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9848.16s)]
*  No, that's what he tried to make us understand. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9850.96s)]
*  No, no, he was speaking facts. The Hamas guys who attacked the Kibbutzim, apart from the attacks on [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9852.8s)]
*  the military sites, when they attacked the Kibbutzim, were out to kill civilians, and they killed [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9859.759999999998s)]
*  family after family, house after house. The Israeli attacks on Hamas installations- [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9865.279999999999s)]
*  You know better. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9870.96s)]
*  And finally, you don't know better. No, you don't know Israeli pilots, that's the problem. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9871.68s)]
*  Thank God. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9875.76s)]
*  No, you don't know Israeli pilots. They believe that they are killing Hamasniks, [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9877.2s)]
*  they're given certain objectives, and that's what they attack. And if the Hamas is hiding [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9882.24s)]
*  behind civilians, civilians die. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9886.800000000001s)]
*  Every time they target a kid, I'm sure they believe it's Hamas. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9888.720000000001s)]
*  When they killed the four kids- [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9894.880000000001s)]
*  They believe they were Hamasniks. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9897.52s)]
*  Even though they were diminutive size. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9899.76s)]

*  Yeah, no, they saw the size. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9904.800000000001s)]
*  You don't see the size. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9905.44s)]

*  Oh, I know what he's quoting here. You've lied about this particular instance in the past. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9907.04s)]
*  Those kids weren't just on the beaches, as often stated in articles. Those kids were literally [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9910.800000000001s)]
*  coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that they had operated from. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9914.08s)]

*  That was an old fisherman's shack. What are you talking about? It's so painful. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9935.68s)]
*  Hamas Naval- [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9942.64s)]

*  But let's- [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9946.4s)]
*  To be clear, on the other side, you're implying that a strike was okayed on the Israeli side, [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9946.88s)]
*  where they said, we're just gonna kill four Palestinian prisoners today for no reason. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9950.88s)]

*  As you said, there was a hotel of journalists. Do you think that they killed your children? [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9957.199999999999s)]
*  Mr. Borrelli, Mr. Borrelli, here we go. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9961.6s)]
*  We'll never answer that question. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9962.64s)]
*  I will answer the question. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9963.359999999999s)]
*  The pilots were out to kill four children. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9964.72s)]
*  Morons questions. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9966.96s)]
*  Because that was a strike. That was a drone strike. So it was a proof all the way up the chain [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9967.76s)]
*  that we're gonna kill children today. We're gonna kill Palestinian children today. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9970.96s)]

*  By all reckonings of human rights organizations and journalists who were there, it was overwhelmingly [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9985.44s)]
*  nonviolent. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9994.56s)]

*  Whoever organized it- [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=9997.6s)]

*  Overwhelmingly organized, overwhelmingly nonviolent. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10008.64s)]
*  Resembled at the beginning, the first- [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10012.48s)]
*  Bombs here and there. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10014.16s)]

*  Correct? [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10047.36s)]

*  throwing stones, and Molotov cocktails towards Israeli forces and flying incendiary kites and [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10082.720000000001s)]

*  Yeah. What did the UN investigation find? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10138.96s)]
*  Well, he just read it to you. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10142.16s)]
*  I read the report. I don't read things off of those machines. I read the report. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10143.2s)]
*  What did it find? Brace yourself. You thought it was so funny, the idea of IDF targeting civilians. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10151.44s)]
*  It found- Go look this up on your machine. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10161.36s)]
*  I already know what you're going to say. You're going to say it found that only one or two of them [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10164.0s)]
*  were justified killings. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10167.2s)]
*  Targeted journalists, targeted medics, and here's the funniest one of all. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10169.679999999998s)]
*  It's so hilarious. They targeted disabled people who were 300 meters away from the fence [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10176.72s)]
*  and just standing by trees. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10187.359999999999s)]
*  This is true. If what you're saying is true. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10189.199999999999s)]
*  If it's true. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10190.24s)]
*  Just quick pause. I think everything was fascinating to listen to, [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10192.24s)]
*  except the mention of hilarious. Nobody finds any of this hilarious. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10196.64s)]
*  Any of us are laughing. It's not at the suffering of civilians or suffering of anyone. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10200.56s)]
*  It's at the obvious joyful camaraderie in the room. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10205.84s)]
*  So I'm enjoying it and also the joy of learning. So thank you. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10209.279999999999s)]
*  Well, can we talk about the targeting civilian thing a little bit? [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10213.119999999999s)]
*  I think there's an important underlying- Not necessarily that. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10215.439999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to understand. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10218.48s)]
*  There's three different things here that we need to think about. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10221.279999999999s)]
*  One is a policy of killing civilians. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10223.119999999999s)]
*  I would ask the other side. I'm going to ask all three because I know there won't be a short answer. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10226.4s)]
*  Do you think there is a policy top down from the IDF to target civilians? That's one thing. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10229.6s)]
*  A second thing is- He said yes. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10234.16s)]
*  Yeah, sure. Okay. That's fine. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10236.08s)]
*  More than one answer. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10237.76s)]
*  But then the second thing is, or there's two distinct ones to draw between. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10238.24s)]
*  I think Benny would say this. I would say this. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10241.52s)]
*  I'm sure undoubtedly there have been cases where IDF soldiers, for no good reason, [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10244.32s)]
*  have targeted and killed Palestinians that they should not have done. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10250.08s)]
*  That would be prosecutable as war crimes as defined by the Rome Statute and the ICC. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10253.12s)]
*  And some have been prosecuted. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10256.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm absolutely sure- [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10257.6s)]
*  According to you and your books, practically none. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10258.880000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that we would all agree for soldiers that that happens. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10260.480000000001s)]
*  But I think that it's important that when we talk about military strikes, [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10265.84s)]
*  or we talk about things especially involving bombings or drone attacks, [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10271.04s)]
*  these are things that are signed off by multiple different layers of command, [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10274.240000000002s)]
*  by multiple people involved in an operation, including intelligence gathering, [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10278.08s)]
*  including weaponeering. And they also have typically lawyers involved. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10281.2s)]
*  When you make the claim that an IDF soldier shot a Palestinian, those three people, [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10284.320000000002s)]
*  the three hostages that came up with white flags and something horrible happened, [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10289.04s)]
*  I think that's a fair statement to make. And I think a lot of criticism is deserved. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10291.6s)]
*  But when you make the statement that four children were killed by a strike, [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10294.400000000001s)]
*  the claim that you're making- Deliberately. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10298.0s)]
*  Yeah. Deliberately, yes. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10299.2s)]
*  The claim that you're making is that multiple levels of the IDF signed off on just killing- [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10300.16s)]
*  I have no idea what- [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10305.84s)]
*  That's right. If you don't understand the process, then let me educate you. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10306.800000000001s)]
*  You don't understand the process. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10309.2s)]
*  I do understand the process. I'm telling you. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10309.76s)]
*  You're really- I'm trying to explain it to you right now. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10311.44s)]
*  You're studying the IDF. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10312.64s)]
*  No, it's basic military. You can ask anybody that talks about- [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10313.6s)]
*  Aside from Wikipedia, can you tell me what your knowledge of the IDF is? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10315.76s)]
*  You can talk to people who work in the military. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10318.880000000001s)]
*  What's your knowledge of the IDF? [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10321.52s)]
*  Audience can look this up. Do you think that bombing and strikes are decided by one person [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10322.960000000001s)]
*  in the field? Do you think one person can take control of an airplane or a drone strike? [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10327.68s)]
*  At least I can tell you, as a pilot doesn't do it on his own, can I respond wholeheartedly? [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10329.76s)]
*  Strikes don't have entire apparatuses that are designed to figure out how to strike and who to strike. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10332.4s)]
*  When you say that four children are targeted, you're saying that a whole apparatus is trying [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10337.039999999999s)]
*  to murder four Palestinian children. You make my argument better than me. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10341.119999999999s)]
*  Which is a ridiculous argument. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10343.759999999998s)]
*  Because really, it's impossible at the command level. It's impossible at the command level. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10345.199999999999s)]
*  But you said that they couldn't have done it at the bottom if it weren't also at the top. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10352.0s)]
*  You don't understand the strength of the claim that you're making. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10356.08s)]
*  With all due respect- You're saying that from a top-down [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10358.88s)]
*  level that lawyers, multiple commanders, all these people signed off on killing four Palestinians. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10360.56s)]
*  It's true. I don't spend my nights on Wikipedia. I read books. I admit that as a signal- [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10367.759999999998s)]
*  It's a waste of time. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10373.359999999999s)]
*  I know. Books are a waste of time. With all due regard, there- [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10375.119999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you, Arthur. The only thing you take from them are two or three quotes that you use. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10378.4s)]
*  I completely respect the fact, and I'll say it on the air, as much as I find totally disgusting [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10381.199999999999s)]
*  what's come of your politics, a lot of the books are excellent. I'll even tell you, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10390.96s)]
*  because I'm not afraid of saying it, whenever I have to check on the basic fact, [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10397.519999999999s)]
*  the equivalent of going to the Britannica, I go to your books. I know you got a lot of the facts [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10402.64s)]
*  right. I would never say books are a waste of time, and it's regrettable to you that you got [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10408.64s)]
*  strapped with a partner who thinks that all the wisdom- [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10417.52s)]
*  I never said books are a waste of time. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10421.12s)]
*  He didn't say they're a waste of time. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10422.560000000001s)]
*  I'd like to respond to what you were saying. I think the question that we're trying to answer- [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10424.08s)]
*  I think you don't understand Israel. Neither of you really understands Israel. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10433.44s)]
*  I think we're all- [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10437.6s)]
*  Now it works. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10438.16s)]
*  I think we're all agreed that Palestinians have deliberately targeted civilians. Whether [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10438.960000000001s)]
*  we're talking about Hamas and Islamic Jihad today or previously- [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10445.92s)]
*  I prefer the word murdered and raped rather than targeted. Target is too soft for what the Hamas [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10450.48s)]
*  did. I'm not talking about- [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10455.6s)]
*  I'm talking about this now. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10458.16s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm trying to answer his question. Historically, there is substantial evidence [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10459.12s)]
*  that Palestinians have targeted civilians. Whether it's been incidental or systematic [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10467.12s)]
*  is a different discussion. I don't want to get into that now. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10474.64s)]
*  For some reason, there seems to be a huge debate about whether any Israeli has ever [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10477.519999999999s)]
*  sunk so low as to target a civilian. I don't- [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10484.16s)]
*  No, we've agreed both steps. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10487.439999999999s)]
*  We just agreed. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10488.16s)]
*  I've just said that this has happened here. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10488.88s)]
*  Okay. And I think- [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10490.72s)]
*  We've agreed on that. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10491.6s)]
*  Okay. I think- [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10492.32s)]
*  What we're saying is it's not policy, which is what you guys are implying, [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10493.84s)]
*  that they kill civilians deliberately. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10497.199999999999s)]
*  If I understand you correctly, you're basically making the claim that none of these attacks [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10499.28s)]
*  could have happened without going through an entire chain of commands. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10506.08s)]
*  For strike cells that are involved in drone attacks or plane attacks or- [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10509.2s)]
*  Yes. My understanding of the Israeli military and you could perhaps, you've served in it, [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10512.560000000001s)]
*  you would know better. It's actually a fairly chaotic organization. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10518.480000000001s)]
*  No, no, that's not true. Especially not the Air Force. Extremely, extremely organized. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10522.16s)]
*  The Air Force works in a very organized fashion, as he says, with lawyers, [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10526.72s)]
*  chain of command, and ultimately the pilot drops the bomb where he's told to drop it. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10531.599999999999s)]
*  In Protective Edge, was that 200 strikes in like 60 seconds, I think? I think at the opening of [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10535.599999999999s)]
*  Protective Edge. Yeah, the coordination between- [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10540.48s)]
*  You're talking about 2000-8. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10542.64s)]
*  I think- [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10544.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10545.199999999999s)]
*  Protective Edge was 2014. But I'm just saying that the coordination in the military is pretty tight. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10545.439999999999s)]
*  Well, my understanding of the Israeli military- [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10548.8s)]
*  It's very organized. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10551.92s)]
*  Is that it's quite chaotic and there's also a lot of testimonies from Israel. But be that as it may, [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10553.359999999999s)]
*  okay, I'm prepared to accept both of your contentions that it's a highly organized [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10560.0s)]
*  and disciplined force. The Air Force under any scenario is going to be more organized [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10567.119999999999s)]
*  than the other branches. And you're saying such a strike would have been inconceivable. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10571.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not necessarily saying inconceivable. I'm just saying that that would have required [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10576.56s)]
*  a murderous intent for so many people. I don't think good evidence has been presented to say [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10579.92s)]
*  that that's the case. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10583.68s)]
*  Your basic claim is that it would be fair to assume that such a strike could have only been [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10584.24s)]
*  carried out with multiple levels of authorization and signing off. Okay, let's accept that for the [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10589.68s)]
*  sake of argument. We have now seen incident after incident after incident after incident [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10597.6s)]
*  where entire families are vaporized in single strikes. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10607.2s)]
*  Who is in the families? Who lives in the house? [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10612.16s)]
*  Family members. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10614.720000000001s)]
*  No, or next to the house in which these families are killed. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10615.84s)]
*  We have seen incident- [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10619.04s)]
*  Do you know that Hamasniks weren't in that house? Do you know that their ammunition dumps weren't [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10620.800000000001s)]
*  in those houses? [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10625.44s)]
*  Why do I have to prove a negative? [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10625.52s)]
*  You're saying that they deliberately targeted families. If Israel wanted to kill civilians in [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10627.2s)]
*  Gaza, they could have killed 500,000 by now with the number of strikes they've done. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10633.44s)]
*  And the fact that they've only killed a certain small number- [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10638.32s)]
*  30,000 is a small number. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10641.76s)]
*  A small number in proportion over four months probably is an indication that it's targeted [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10643.28s)]
*  and that there are Hamas targets in these places. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10651.6s)]
*  Okay, so I've given- [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10654.32s)]
*  12,000 children is only, and if that's the case, why is it- [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10655.44s)]
*  Did I use the word only? [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10660.720000000001s)]
*  You said only. Only. Professor Maros, here's a question for you. If we take every combat zone [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10661.28s)]
*  in the world for the past three years, every combat zone in the world- [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10670.400000000001s)]
*  In Vietnam, Americans killed a million people. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10674.560000000001s)]
*  Well, they could have killed 40 million. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10677.2s)]
*  I wasn't in the anti-war movement. So don't- [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10678.800000000001s)]
*  Americans killed a million people in Vietnam. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10682.320000000002s)]
*  Fine, fine. And 30 million Russians were killed during World War II, so everything else is [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10684.0s)]
*  irrelevant. Okay, here's a question. Professor Maros, here's a question. It's very perplexing. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10690.48s)]
*  If you take every combat zone in the world for the past three years and you multiply the number of [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10698.8s)]
*  children killed by four, every combat zone in the world, you get Gaza. Okay? [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10706.72s)]
*  So when you say- [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10716.56s)]
*  What is that supposed to prove? [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10717.199999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to tell you. Just shut up. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10718.32s)]
*  You're relying on Hamas numbers. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10720.72s)]
*  No, I'm not relying. I'm relying on the numbers that everybody else- [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10722.72s)]
*  You know that. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10726.24s)]
*  Even if we take the numbers, though, what does that prove? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10726.96s)]
*  Those are Hamas numbers. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10728.72s)]
*  Okay. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10729.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10730.24s)]
*  Which may not be true. They could invent anything because you know that they are a [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10730.64s)]
*  mendacious organization. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10734.96s)]
*  I know mendacious. Believe me. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10736.8s)]
*  You like words. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10738.64s)]
*  Mendacious as in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Okay, so here's the thing. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10739.039999999999s)]
*  You say they could have killed 500,000, but they only killed only. That's your word. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10745.919999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying that if you believe that they deliberately target civilians, [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10751.359999999999s)]
*  they would have killed many, many more. The fact is that they don't deliberately target civilians. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10756.56s)]
*  Professor Maros, for a historian, I don't want to understand Israeli society. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10761.759999999998s)]
*  You don't want to understand. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10768.4s)]
*  I don't want to. I don't want to get inside their heads. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10769.439999999999s)]
*  That's the problem here. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10771.519999999999s)]
*  90% of- [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10772.4s)]
*  A good historian tries to get into the heads of the very antagonists. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10773.119999999999s)]
*  There's a limit. When 90% of Israelis think that Israel's using enough or too little force in [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10780.56s)]
*  Gaza, I don't want to get inside that head. 40% think that Israel's using insufficient force [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10789.52s)]
*  in Gaza. I don't want to get inside that head. I don't want to get inside the head of people [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10797.039999999999s)]
*  who think they're using insufficient force against the population, half of which is children. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10801.92s)]
*  I don't want to get inside that head. But here's the point, because your partner wants to know the [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10810.24s)]
*  point. You don't understand political constraints. One of your ministers said, let's drop an atomic [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10817.04s)]
*  bomb on Gaza. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10824.88s)]
*  Do you think he really meant that? [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10826.16s)]
*  He said it through you. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10827.36s)]
*  No, no, no. It was said in a very questionable way. He didn't say they should drop an atomic bomb. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10828.64s)]
*  I'm not supporting it. He's an idiot. This minister is a messianic idiot. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10834.8s)]
*  None other than Israel's chief historian, the famed, justifiably famed, Benny Morris, [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10844.4s)]
*  thinks we should be dropping nuclear weapons on Iran. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10852.96s)]
*  Iran has for years, its leaders for years, have said we should destroy Israel. You agree with that? [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10856.56s)]
*  They've said we should destroy Israel. Israel must be destroyed. Is that correct? This is what [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10862.32s)]
*  Iranian leaders have been saying since Khomeini. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10867.76s)]
*  I would say Iranian leaders have said mixed messages. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10869.92s)]
*  Okay, okay. But some of them have said, including Khomeini and Khomeini. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10873.12s)]
*  If you don't know their evidence, if you don't know their evidence, why are you laughing? [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10876.960000000001s)]
*  This is like skepticism. It's very funny. Iran supports the Hezbollah and the Houthis and Hamas. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10880.48s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. To the extent that the Houthis are trying to stop the genocide in Gaza. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10885.199999999999s)]
*  There is no genocide. They have the right to attack civilian ships. I know our [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10894.08s)]
*  selectively support international law when it agrees with you. And then when it doesn't, [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10898.16s)]
*  you decide to throw international law to the wind. If you like, if you like. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10902.16s)]
*  Norm, Norm, Norm, stop, please. Norm, just for me, please. Just give me a second. You said that [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10906.56s)]
*  there's no genocide going on in Gaza. Let me ask that clear question. The same question I asked on [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10912.88s)]
*  Hamas attacks. Is there, from a legal, philosophical, moral perspective, is there [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10918.08s)]
*  genocide going on in Gaza today? Is there a genocide going on in Gaza? Well, in several years, [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10922.88s)]
*  we will have a definitive response to that question. What has happened thus far is that on the 29th of [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10930.72s)]
*  December, the Republic of South Africa instituted proceedings against Israel pursuant to the 1948 [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10937.12s)]
*  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. South Africa basically [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10948.320000000002s)]
*  accused Israel of perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip. On the 26th of January, [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10955.52s)]
*  the court issued its initial ruling. The court at this stage is not making a determination [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10964.48s)]
*  on whether Israel has or has not committed genocide. So just as it has not found Israel [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10976.24s)]
*  guilty, it certainly also hasn't found Israel innocent. What the court had to do at this stage [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10983.92s)]
*  was take one of two decisions. Either South Africa's case was the equivalent of a frivolous [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10991.28s)]
*  lawsuit and dismiss it and close the proceedings, or it had to determine that South Africa presented [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=10999.28s)]
*  a plausible case that Israel was violating its obligations under the genocide convention, [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11008.320000000002s)]
*  and that it would on that basis hold a full hearing. Now, a lot of people have [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11016.0s)]
*  looked at the court's ruling of the 26th of January and focused on the fact that the court [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11024.08s)]
*  did not order a ceasefire. I actually wasn't expecting it to order a ceasefire, and I wasn't [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11030.96s)]
*  surprised that it didn't because in the other cases that the court has considered most prominently, [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11036.56s)]
*  Bosnia and Myanmar, it also didn't order a ceasefire. South Africa, in requesting a ceasefire, [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11043.76s)]
*  also didn't ask the court to render an opinion on the legitimacy or lack thereof of Israel's military [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11053.04s)]
*  operation. From my perspective, the key issue on the 26th of January was whether the court would [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11061.52s)]
*  simply dismiss the case or decide to proceed with it. And it decided to proceed. And I think that's [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11069.6s)]
*  enormously significant. You already said they committed genocide. It's committing genocide. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11076.56s)]
*  But if I could just- Allow me- [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11084.24s)]
*  Allow me- Use that word. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11087.04s)]
*  That's correct. I don't run away- [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11088.24s)]
*  So Norman, you did say Israel committed genocide. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11090.800000000001s)]
*  Can you let me finish? Well, the end of the story is you specifically asked whether I think Israel [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11092.800000000001s)]
*  is committing genocide. I explained formally there is no finding, and as you said, we won't know [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11098.32s)]
*  for a number of years. And I think there's legitimate questions to be raised. I mean, [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11104.48s)]
*  in the Bosnia case, which I think all four of us would agree was clearly a case of genocide, [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11108.72s)]
*  the court determined- [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11114.16s)]
*  You mean by the Serbs? [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11115.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. In the Bosnia case, the court determined that of all the evidence placed before them, [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11116.4s)]
*  only Srebrenica qualified as genocide and all the other atrocities committed did not qualify as [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11123.12s)]
*  genocide. International law is a developing organism. I don't know how the court is going [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11129.68s)]
*  to respond in this case, so I wouldn't take it as a foregone conclusion how the court is going to [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11136.720000000001s)]
*  respond. But my- [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11143.84s)]
*  But Norman has determined already. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11144.480000000001s)]
*  I have too, because you're asking my personal opinion. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11146.160000000002s)]
*  Personal opinion is also- [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11148.560000000001s)]
*  As a matter of law, I want to state very clearly it has not been determined and won't be determined [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11150.08s)]
*  for several years. Based on my observations and the evidence before me, I would say it's [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11155.76s)]
*  indisputable that Israel is engaged in a genocidal assault against the Palestinian people in the Gaza [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11166.48s)]
*  Strip. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11172.960000000001s)]
*  Which is the PLO line. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11173.28s)]
*  Yeah, with the program. The PLO is long past what- [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11173.92s)]
*  Okay, the Palestinian authority. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11178.24s)]
*  As you were saying, genocide is not a body count. Genocide consists of two elements. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11180.4s)]
*  The destruction of a people in whole or in part. In other words, you can commit genocide by killing [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11190.56s)]
*  30,000 people. It doesn't have to- Well, five probably is below the threshold. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11197.76s)]
*  There is a problem with numbers. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11201.04s)]
*  But I think 30,000 crosses the threshold and not reaching 500,000 is probably relevant. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11202.72s)]
*  The second element is there has to be an intent. In other words- [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11209.6s)]
*  And you believe there's an intent? [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11213.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. I think if there is any other plausible reason for why all these people are being murdered, [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11215.039999999999s)]
*  it's not genocide. As far as intent is- [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11222.64s)]
*  What about hiding behind a human shield? You don't think that's the reason for them being killed? [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11225.279999999999s)]
*  Well, let's get the intent part out of the way first. South Africa's- [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11229.84s)]
*  Forget South Africa. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11234.32s)]
*  I'd like to finish. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11236.16s)]
*  They made the application. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11237.04s)]
*  I think they're pro-Satan as well last time I checked. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11238.4s)]
*  No, they're pro-Khamaas. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11242.880000000001s)]
*  For some reason, you don't have a problem with people being pro-Israeli at the time of this. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11245.44s)]
*  But if they support Palestinians' right to life or self-determination, they get demonized and [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11250.880000000001s)]
*  delegitimized as pro-Khamaas. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11257.28s)]
*  Because they support an organization which murdered 1,200 people deliberately. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11258.56s)]
*  That's my problem. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11262.24s)]
*  But supporting a state that has murdered 30,000 people. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11262.8s)]
*  But they haven't because these 30,000 are basically human shields used by the Khamas [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11265.119999999999s)]
*  in which the Khamas wanted killed. They wanted them killed. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11270.08s)]
*  All right. If I can- [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11273.76s)]
*  The Khamas wanted these people killed. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11274.24s)]
*  If I could just get- [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11275.68s)]
*  You don't think they wanted them killed? [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11276.48s)]
*  No, I don't. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11278.08s)]
*  They didn't provide them with shelters. They build tunnels for their fighters, [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11278.24s)]
*  but not one shelter for their own civilians. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11281.76s)]
*  You asked me about- [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11284.24s)]
*  Of course they want them killed. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11285.039999999999s)]
*  You asked me about intent. The reason that I bought in the South African application [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11286.24s)]
*  is because it is actually exceptionally detailed on intent by quoting numerous- [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11292.72s)]
*  All sorts of idiotic ministers in Israel. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11299.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, including the prime minister, the defense minister, the chief of staff. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11301.199999999999s)]
*  Didn't say genocide. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11305.84s)]
*  No, he said Amalek. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11306.72s)]
*  According to Asaq Hasher- [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11307.84s)]
*  Use the word Amalek because the Khamas are a really- [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11309.039999999999s)]
*  According to Asaq Hasher- [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11312.4s)]
*  If I may. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11314.16s)]
*  According to Asaq Hasher, the philosopher of IDF, he said that Netanyahu was avowing genocide. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11315.119999999999s)]
*  He's an idiot? [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11325.119999999999s)]
*  He didn't say he's an idiot, but he is past it. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11325.84s)]
*  The reason I raised the South African application is twofold. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11329.519999999999s)]
*  Khamas or no Khamas. It's exceptionally detailed on the question of intent. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11333.199999999999s)]
*  Secondly, when the International Court of Justice issues a ruling, individual justices [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11339.439999999999s)]
*  can give their own opinion. I found the German one to be the most interesting on this specific [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11348.8s)]
*  question because he was basically saying that he didn't think South Africa presented a persuasive [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11354.32s)]
*  case, but he said their section on intent was so overpowering that he felt he was left with no [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11361.36s)]
*  choice but to vote with the majority. I think that answers the intent part of your question. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11372.32s)]
*  For the ICJ case that South Africa's brought, I think there's a couple of things that need to [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11379.04s)]
*  be mentioned. One is, and I saw you two talk at length about this, the plausibility standard is [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11382.400000000001s)]
*  incredibly low. The only thing we're looking for is a basic presentation of facts that make it [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11388.16s)]
*  conceivable, possible, plausible, which legally, this is obviously below criminal conviction. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11392.64s)]
*  Think of it as an indictment. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11402.08s)]
*  Sure, possibly. Maybe even a lower level than even an indictment. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11404.24s)]
*  Plausibility is an incredibly low standard, number one. Number two, if you actually go through and [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11408.08s)]
*  you read the complaint that South Africa filed, I would say that if you go through the quotes and [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11413.92s)]
*  you even follow through to the source of the quotes, the misrepresentation that South Africa [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11421.04s)]
*  does and their case about all of these horrendous quotes, in my opinion, borders on criminal. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11425.84s)]
*  16 ICJ judges disagree with you. That's fine if 16 ICJ judges disagree, [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11431.6s)]
*  but I'm going to give- They must be awful incompetent. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11435.68s)]
*  You know, they could be, but- They must be. Even the American judge, [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11437.92s)]
*  she must have been awful incompetent if she was unable to see the misrepresentations that Mr. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11441.6s)]
*  Bonnell, based on his Wikipedia entry, was able to find. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11449.84s)]
*  So this is based on the official ICJ report that was released. I'm not sure if you read the entire [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11453.36s)]
*  thing or not. I read every aspect. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11458.08s)]
*  Okay, that's great. Did you go through and actually identify any of the sources for the [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11458.880000000001s)]
*  underlying quotes? Actually, brace yourself for this, [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11462.48s)]
*  and Muin could confirm it. Yanniv Kogan, an Israeli, and Jamie Sternweiner, half Israeli, [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11464.96s)]
*  they checked every single quote in the Hebrew original, and Yanniv Kogan loved the guy. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11474.0s)]
*  He has terrifying powers of concentration. He checked every single quote. Is that correct, [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11483.919999999998s)]
*  Muin? Jamie checked every single quote in the English, in the context, and where there were [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11491.2s)]
*  any contextual questions, they told us. I think they found one. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11499.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think they found one. So I do not believe that those 16, 15 judges, it was 15 to 2. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11504.240000000002s)]
*  16 to 2, I think. They're 15 on the court plus 2, so it's 17, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11513.76s)]
*  so it's 15 to 2. I don't think those 15 judges were incompetent, and I certainly don't believe [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11518.4s)]
*  the president of the court, an American, would allow herself to be duped. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11529.68s)]
*  Okay, well, let me read one. You might recall Mr. Mubarew. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11537.039999999999s)]
*  Let me read one. Let him read. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11541.68s)]
*  Sure. So this was taken from the South African complaint. There's tons of these, but so here's [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11544.4s)]
*  one. In the complaint for the ICJ, they said that on the 12th of October, 2023, President Isaac [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11549.92s)]
*  Herzog made clear that Israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11556.8s)]
*  in Gaza, stating in a press conference to foreign media in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11561.68s)]
*  over one million of whom are children, quote, quote, it's an entire nation out there that is [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11566.88s)]
*  responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11572.72s)]
*  I saw that. It's absolutely not true, [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11577.519999999999s)]
*  and we will fight until we break their backbone, end quote. If you actually go to the news article [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11579.679999999998s)]
*  that they even state, they even link it in their complaint, the full context for the quote was, [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11585.519999999999s)]
*  quote, it is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It's not true this rhetoric about [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11590.64s)]
*  civilians not being aware, not involved. It's absolutely not true. They could have risen up. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11595.359999999999s)]
*  They could have fought against that evil regime, which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat, [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11599.68s)]
*  but we are at war. We are defending our homes. We are protecting our homes. That's the truth. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11603.52s)]
*  And when a nation protects its home, it fights and we will fight until we break their backbone. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11608.24s)]
*  He acknowledged that many Gazans had nothing to do with Hamas, but was adamant that others did, [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11612.720000000001s)]
*  quote, I agree. There are many innocent Palestinians who don't agree with this, [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11617.04s)]
*  but you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and you want to shoot it at me. Am I allowed to [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11620.960000000001s)]
*  defend myself? We have to defend ourselves. We have the right to do so. This is not the same [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11625.039999999999s)]
*  as saying there is no distinction between militants and civilians in Gaza. His statement [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11629.839999999998s)]
*  here is actually fully compliant with international law to the letter, because if you are storing [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11634.32s)]
*  military supplies in civilian areas, these things become military targets and you're allowed to do [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11639.599999999999s)]
*  proportionality assessments afterwards. So this is supposed to be one of many quotes that they've [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11643.759999999998s)]
*  shown that is supposed to demonstrate genocidal intent, but it is very easily explained by [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11648.32s)]
*  military intent or by a conflict between two parties. I saw that press conference. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11653.6s)]
*  Let me just say something. All of this talk is a bit irrelevant because it sounds, it may sound to [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11658.08s)]
*  the listeners that the court in the Hague has ruled that Israel is committing genocide. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11663.04s)]
*  No, I think we- No. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11668.56s)]
*  It's just going in the next few years to look at the whole subject. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11670.08s)]
*  Okay. I think we agree on that. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11673.44s)]
*  There has been no determination at all. And as Stephen says, some of the quotes are not exactly [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11675.2s)]
*  accurate quotes or taken out of context. Okay. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11681.44s)]
*  Total mischaracterization. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11682.960000000001s)]
*  Okay. It is correct, as Muin put it, that it'll be several years before the court [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11685.04s)]
*  makes a determination. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11694.480000000001s)]
*  And my guess is that it will determine there was no genocide. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11695.84s)]
*  I am not. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11698.480000000001s)]
*  That's my guess. Yes, no, I'm just giving you my guess. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11698.960000000001s)]
*  I can't predict. I got it all wrong, actually, as Muin will attest. I got it all wrong the first [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11702.32s)]
*  time. I never thought the American judge would vote in favor of plausibility. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11708.08s)]
*  So you admit that you were wrong? [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11712.48s)]
*  Yeah, of course. I think I tell Muin twice a day I was wrong about this and I was wrong about that. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11714.0s)]
*  I'm not wrong about the facts. I try not to be, but my speculations, they can be wrong. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11720.0s)]
*  Okay. Leaving that aside. First of all, as Muin pointed out, there's a difference between the [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11725.6s)]
*  legal decision by the ruling and an independent judgment. Now, South Africa was not filing a [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11731.36s)]
*  frivolous case. That was 84 pages. It was single. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11739.04s)]
*  Even 84 pages can be frivolous. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11744.08s)]
*  It takes an hour and a half to read. It was not a massive case. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11746.560000000001s)]
*  It was single spaced and it had literally hundreds of footnotes. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11749.84s)]
*  It can still be frivolous. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11754.16s)]
*  With, it's possible. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11755.36s)]
*  Of course, but this one wasn't. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11757.2s)]
*  Yeah. I read the report. To tell you the truth, I followed very closely everything that's been [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11759.599999999999s)]
*  happening to October 7th. I was mesmerized. I couldn't believe the comprehensiveness [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11764.0s)]
*  of that particular report. Number two, there are two quite respected judges, excuse me. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11769.359999999999s)]
*  There were two quite respected experts of international law sitting on the South African [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11775.68s)]
*  panel, John Dugard and Vaughn Lowe. Vaughn Lowe, as you might know, he argued the war case [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11781.76s)]
*  in 2004 before the International Court of Justice. Now, they were alleging genocide, [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11788.800000000001s)]
*  which in their view means the evidence in their minds, we're not yet at the court, [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11797.12s)]
*  the evidence in their minds compels the conclusion that genocide is being committed. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11801.92s)]
*  I am willing because I happen to know Mr. Dugard personally and have corresponded with Vaughn Lowe. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11808.4s)]
*  I've heard their claim. I've read the report. I would say they make a very strong case, [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11814.48s)]
*  but let's agree plausible. Now, here's a question. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11820.720000000001s)]
*  If somebody qualifies for an Olympic team, let's say a regional person qualifies for an Olympic [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11826.0s)]
*  team, it doesn't mean they're going to be on the Olympic team. It doesn't mean they're going to [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11838.0s)]
*  win a gold medal, a silver medal or a bronze medal. But they can swim, that's what you're saying. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11843.28s)]
*  No, I would say that's a very high bar. You're saying they can swim. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11848.88s)]
*  Even qualify. Swim well enough to have a realistic prospect. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11852.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So to even make it to plausible. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11856.24s)]
*  That is not true. That is not what plausible means. It is absolutely not. You're dead wrong. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11861.52s)]
*  Mr. Borelli, please don't teach me about the English language. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11866.72s)]
*  I said plausibility is the same concept as qualifying. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11872.88s)]
*  Court is not asked at this present phase of the proceedings to determine whether South Africa's [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11878.56s)]
*  allegations of genocide are well founded. They're not even well founded. You said that plausible [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11882.72s)]
*  is a high standard. It is absolutely not. It is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11889.6s)]
*  against Israel, just like the majority of the quotes they have in this case are. And also, [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11894.88s)]
*  you said it was an extremely well-founded case. They spend like one fourth of all of the quotations, [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11898.48s)]
*  some even pulled from the Goldstone report, that actually deal with the intent part. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11902.56s)]
*  Which is, by the way, I think you guys, I don't know if you use the phrase, [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11908.08s)]
*  the dolo specialis, that the intentional part of genocide. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11910.560000000001s)]
*  Sorry, I don't know that term. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11913.2s)]
*  I think it's called dolo specialis. It is the most important part of genocide, [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11915.04s)]
*  which is proving the special, it is a highly special intent to commit genocide. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11918.640000000001s)]
*  That's mens reum. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11922.0s)]
*  No. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11924.560000000001s)]
*  Yes, I understand the state of mind, but for genocide there is, it's called dolo specialis. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11926.560000000001s)]
*  It's a highly special intent. Did you read the case? [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11931.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11933.6s)]
*  It is a highly special intent. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11934.34s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you again. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11935.86s)]
*  Because it's a [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11936.9s)]
*  genocide. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11937.48s)]
*  Yes. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11937.98s)]
*  Please stop displaying your imbecility. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11938.48s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry if you think the declaration of the judge is imbecility. [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11941.380000000001s)]
*  Don't put on public display that you're a moron. At least have the self-possession to shut up. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11944.1s)]
*  Did I read the case? [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11950.82s)]
*  I'm comfortable putting my display on camera if you're comfortable putting yours in books, okay? [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11952.02s)]
*  I read the case around four times. I read all of the majority opinion, the declarations, [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11956.1s)]
*  I read Aaron Barack's declaration. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11964.1s)]
*  Then why are you lying and saying plausible is my standard? [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11966.58s)]
*  Because I said even reaching the benchmark of plausibility is a very high standard in the world. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11969.86s)]
*  It's the equivalent of a regional player qualifying for an Olympics. It's still two steps removed. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11981.460000000001s)]
*  You may not be on the team and you may not get a medal, but to get qualified, [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11989.7s)]
*  which in this context is the equivalent of plausible, you must be doing something pretty [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=11996.42s)]
*  horrible. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12004.02s)]
*  But the court- [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12004.58s)]
*  As it happens- [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12005.380000000001s)]
*  The court- [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12006.1s)]
*  And as it happens, Professor Morris- [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12006.58s)]
*  There was no genocide. That's what the court will rule. Remember what I just told you. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12008.58s)]
*  The court will rule- [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12012.740000000002s)]
*  I don't expect to be even around when the court reaches its final decision. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12013.140000000001s)]
*  Why? [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12016.980000000001s)]
*  They'll take a long, long time. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12018.18s)]
*  Two years. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12019.7s)]
*  No, I don't think they'll take two or three years. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12020.26s)]
*  I mean, Bosnia, which was admittedly a special type of case because they were accusing [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12022.18s)]
*  Serbia of sponsoring the Bosnian Serbs. That took, I think, 17 years from- [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12028.900000000001s)]
*  I assume they'll take two or three years. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12034.26s)]
*  But the point you're making- [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12036.820000000002s)]
*  I'm saying that something horrible must be happening to even achieve- [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12038.58s)]
*  It is horrible. It's a war. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12043.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12044.42s)]
*  I know. It's true. [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12044.740000000002s)]
*  It's horrible. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12046.02s)]
*  Except they weren't rendering a ruling on a war. They were rendering a ruling on a genocide. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12046.82s)]
*  And I think the suggestion- [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12052.82s)]
*  And they said it was plausible. They also said it was plausible that Israel is committing [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12054.58s)]
*  a military operation as well. [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12057.46s)]
*  Yeah, but I think the problem with your characterization is you're saying in so many [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12058.82s)]
*  words that South Africans basically only have to show up in court with a coherent statement. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12062.82s)]
*  Right. That is correct. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12067.22s)]

*  She was the president. [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12080.98s)]

*  in hearing this case- [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12088.74s)]

*  It's ridiculous. [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12173.46s)]
*  When the defense, ridiculous. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12174.019999999999s)]
*  Yes, ridiculous. [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12175.699999999999s)]
*  Uh, the American judge. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12176.42s)]
*  He also doesn't determine policy. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12178.42s)]
*  The American judge. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12180.099999999999s)]
*  I didn't hear nothing. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12180.98s)]
*  The American judge read. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12181.38s)]
*  You are holding the American judge to, you know. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12184.019999999999s)]
*  Well, he was the president. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12186.099999999999s)]
*  Because he'll appeal to the authority when it agrees with him and we won't deal with the actual [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12187.06s)]
*  facts of the matter. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12190.18s)]
*  Okay. [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12191.06s)]
*  The American judge read several of the quotes. [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12191.7s)]
*  Look at the American Supreme Court today. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12195.460000000001s)]
*  They may support Trump. [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12197.62s)]
*  Okay. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12198.58s)]
*  Shows you how worthy American judges are. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12199.06s)]
*  Professor Marv, without going too far afield, if you heard a statement by the defense minister, [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12201.54s)]
*  the defense minister said, we are going to prevent any food, water, fuel, or electricity [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12210.58s)]
*  from entering Gaza. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12218.74s)]
*  Did Israel do that? [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12219.78s)]
*  Okay. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12221.62s)]
*  No, I'm wondering. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12221.94s)]
*  What he said. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12223.060000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12223.7s)]
*  Isn't Israeli government policy. [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12224.58s)]
*  But we're talking about statements now, intent. [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12226.02s)]
*  How would you interpret that? [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12228.66s)]
*  After 1200 of your citizens are murdered the way they were, I would expect extreme statements [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12230.02s)]
*  by lots of politicians. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12235.380000000001s)]
*  But you don't accept extreme Palestinian. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12236.58s)]
*  But that's not Israeli policy. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12240.5s)]
*  But you don't accept. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12241.220000000001s)]
*  What he said isn't Israeli policy. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12241.86s)]
*  But you don't. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12243.140000000001s)]
*  They let him order. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12243.54s)]
*  They let him gas. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12244.34s)]
*  I'm true. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12245.220000000001s)]
*  They let him electricity. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12245.7s)]
*  You don't accept extreme Palestinian statements after they lost their entire country, [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12247.14s)]
*  not just 1200 people. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12251.859999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12252.98s)]
*  No, no, it's a good point. [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12254.34s)]
*  And on that, on that moment, brief moment of agreement, let's just take a quick pause. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12255.22s)]
*  We need a smoke break, a water break, a bathroom break. [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12262.5s)]
*  Take down Gaza is not a genocide. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12265.38s)]
*  I don't know what it means. [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12266.74s)]
*  To be in Russia is a genocide statement. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12267.539999999999s)]
*  What does take down Gaza mean? [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12268.26s)]
*  When we went to war with Iraq and we wanted to destroy Iraq, that was a genocidal statement. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12269.3s)]
*  There's a reason why genocide is such an importantly guarded concept. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12272.74s)]
*  To condemn every nation that goes to war. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12276.9s)]
*  What's the finale? [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12278.5s)]
*  You do know how to pronounce my name. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12280.18s)]
*  Why you mispronounce it intentionally? [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12281.460000000001s)]
*  I'm so touched, but you're solicit for international law. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12282.82s)]
*  You should try learning it sometime. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12289.7s)]
*  It would help you sort out a lot of the civilian deaths. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12290.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, 15 judges disagree. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12292.66s)]
*  You could keep citing the judges. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12295.300000000001s)]
*  You should actually try reading the actual statements. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12296.98s)]
*  This is tiring. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12299.460000000001s)]
*  You've invited us to a tiring session. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12301.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12303.539999999999s)]
*  How are you guys doing? [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12305.3s)]
*  Okay. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12306.66s)]
*  There are major things to discuss here. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12309.22s)]
*  Not just what some court is doing and judging two years time. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12310.9s)]
*  Yes. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12314.66s)]
*  What you just said is my whole one of the reasons why I feel so strongly about this [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12315.699999999999s)]
*  particular conflict is because there are really important things to discuss, [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12320.259999999998s)]
*  but they will never be discussed. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12322.82s)]
*  They're not doing. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12323.939999999999s)]
*  We're not going to talk about like area A, B, and C or what a transference of territory. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12324.5s)]
*  Instead, we're going to talk about apartheid. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12329.22s)]
*  We're not going to talk about the differences in how do you conduct war in an urban environment. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12330.58s)]
*  We're not going to talk about what's a good solution for the Palestinians. [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12336.42s)]
*  We're just going to say ethnic cleansing. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12339.46s)]
*  It's possible to be productive over the next two hours and talk about solutions. [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12340.42s)]
*  About solutions, I have no idea what to say. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12344.42s)]
*  I don't see any solutions. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12348.26s)]
*  If you wanted a positive end to this discussion, which is what you said at the beginning, [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12350.1s)]
*  I can't contribute to that because I'm pessimistic. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12354.1s)]
*  I don't see any way forward here. [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12356.98s)]
*  The solution is easy. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12359.939999999999s)]
*  The reason why the solution is hard is because the histories and the myths are [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12361.46s)]
*  completely different. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12364.74s)]
*  There's a different factual record. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12365.22s)]
*  One of the things that would be good to talk about solutions with the future is going back [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12367.539999999999s)]
*  in all the times it has failed. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12371.22s)]
*  Even at that, we're probably not going to agree. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12374.18s)]
*  He's going to say, you can write that. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12375.699999999999s)]
*  I can predict the whole line. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12376.74s)]
*  He's going to say from 93 to 99, he's going to say Israel didn't adhere to the Oslo courts ever. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12377.619999999999s)]
*  Settlement expansion continued. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12381.699999999999s)]
*  Raids happened into the West Bank that there was never a legitimate, that Netanyahu came in and [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12383.539999999999s)]
*  violated the Y memorandum, the transparency. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12388.82s)]
*  He's going to say all of this and he's not going to bring up anything that Palestinians said. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12392.18s)]
*  And then for Camp David, he's going to say that, yeah, that Arafat was trying, [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12394.5s)]
*  that the maps and the territorial exchange wasn't good enough, [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12397.86s)]
*  that they were asking Palestinians to make all the concessions that Israel would have made. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12400.26s)]
*  That gets, yeah. [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12403.699999999999s)]
*  Well, lay it all out. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12404.42s)]
*  Lay it out. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12405.699999999999s)]
*  You do it all quickly. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12406.42s)]
*  My future book should interest you guys. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12411.94s)]
*  Oh, what are you working on? [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12413.779999999999s)]
*  No, not working on. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12415.779999999999s)]
*  It's actually going to come out. [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12416.74s)]
*  It deals with Israeli and Arab atrocities, war crimes, I call them, in the 48th war. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12420.18s)]
*  Oh, really? [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12426.5s)]
*  Just deals with that subject. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12427.86s)]
*  Because I know you've also talked about the closure of the archives and stuff. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12430.66s)]
*  Well, it's marginal. [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12436.34s)]
*  It deals with that as well, but they have tried to seal off documents which had already been used [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12439.22s)]
*  and seen. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12444.58s)]
*  So now they don't let people see them. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12445.3s)]
*  That's happened, but it's marginal in terms of its effect on production. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12447.62s)]
*  Were the British archives useful for you, for this new book? [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12451.94s)]
*  Well, for this list, it's mostly Israeli archives. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12455.14s)]
*  The British and the Americans and the UN did deal with these subjects, [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12458.34s)]
*  but not as well as Israeli documents. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12461.94s)]
*  What's your casualty count for Deir Yassin? [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12464.66s)]
*  It's about 100. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12468.34s)]
*  I think there's agreement on that by Israelis and Arabs. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12469.38s)]
*  100, 105. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12471.94s)]
*  Because before they were... [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12473.46s)]
*  They used to say 245 or 254. [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12474.74s)]
*  Those were the figures the British and the Arabs and the Haganah agreed on at the beginning. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12477.14s)]
*  Because the Red Cross, I think, was the one that first put out that number. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12482.02s)]
*  I don't remember. [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12485.46s)]
*  Maybe it was, what's his name, Jacques de Rainier, or maybe. [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12486.34s)]
*  Maybe he came up with that number, but it was just he didn't count. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12490.1s)]
*  They didn't count bodies. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12494.9s)]
*  They just threw the number out and everybody was happy to blame the Irgun and the Lehi [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12496.26s)]
*  for killing more Arabs than actually... [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12501.22s)]
*  Well, and they put it to good use as well. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12503.14s)]
*  Well, they said that it helped to precipitate more evacuations. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12505.939999999999s)]
*  I think Megan and his memoirs... [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12509.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they also used that number. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12511.619999999999s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for that heated discussion about the present. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12513.939999999999s)]
*  I would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12519.14s)]
*  in a way of hope for the future. [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12526.5s)]
*  So when has, in Israel and Palestine, have we been closest to something like a peace [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12531.22s)]
*  settlement? [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12536.82s)]
*  To something that where both sides would be happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples? [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12538.18s)]
*  Well, from my knowledge of the 120 years or so of conflict, the closest, I think, [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12546.82s)]
*  the two sides have been to reaching some sort of settlement appears to have been in [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12554.02s)]
*  the year 2000 when Barack and then subsequently Clinton offered a two-state settlement to PLO [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12559.7s)]
*  Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12571.220000000001s)]
*  And Arafat seemed to waver. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12574.26s)]
*  He didn't immediately reject what was being offered, but ultimately came down at the end [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12576.82s)]
*  of Camp David in July 2000. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12583.62s)]
*  He came down against the proposals and Clinton, who said he wouldn't blame him later, blamed [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12585.78s)]
*  Arafat for bringing down the summit and not reaching a solution there. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12591.060000000001s)]
*  But I think there on the table, certainly in the Clinton parameters of December 2000, [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12598.42s)]
*  which followed the proposals by Barack in July, the Palestinians were offered the best [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12604.740000000002s)]
*  deal they're ever going to get from Israel unless Israel is destroyed and then there'll [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12613.14s)]
*  just be a Palestinian Arab state. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12617.14s)]
*  But the best deal that Israel could ever offer them, they were offered, which essentially [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12619.22s)]
*  was 95% of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, half of the old city of Jerusalem, some sort [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12624.099999999999s)]
*  of joint control of the Temple Mount and the Gaza Strip, of course, in full. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12630.5s)]
*  And the Palestinians said no to this deal. [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12636.019999999999s)]
*  And nobody really knows why Arafat said no. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12638.5s)]
*  That is, some people think he was trying to hold out for slightly better terms. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12640.9s)]
*  But my reading is that he was constitutionally, psychologically incapable of signing off on a [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12647.22s)]
*  two-state deal, meaning acceptance of the existence of a Jewish state. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12655.14s)]
*  This was really the problem. [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12659.619999999999s)]
*  Of Israel or of a Jewish state? [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12660.82s)]
*  Of a Jewish state, the Jewish state of Israel. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12662.82s)]
*  He wasn't willing to share Palestine with the Jews and put his name to that. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12664.74s)]
*  I think he just couldn't do it. [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12669.779999999999s)]
*  That's my reading. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12671.619999999999s)]
*  But some people say it was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing, [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12672.5s)]
*  but was waiting for slightly better terms. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12676.66s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12679.14s)]
*  I don't think so. [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12680.66s)]
*  But other people disagree with me on this. [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12681.46s)]
*  What do you think? [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12683.14s)]
*  Well, just briefly in response, Arafat formally recognized Israel in 1993. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12685.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, earlier. [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12696.18s)]
*  I don't think actually that in 2000, 2001, a genuine resolution was on offer because I think [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12697.78s)]
*  the maximum Israel was prepared to offer, admittedly more than it had been prepared to [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12706.820000000002s)]
*  offer in the past, fell short of the minimum that the Palestinians considered to be a reasonable [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12712.18s)]
*  two-state settlement, bearing in mind that as of 1949, Israel controlled 78% of the British [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12719.22s)]
*  mandate of Palestine. [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12727.94s)]
*  Palestinians were seeking a stay on the remaining 22%. [[03:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12730.5s)]
*  This was apparently too much for Israel. [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12735.62s)]
*  My response to your question would be- [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12738.58s)]
*  Wait, wait, they were being offered something like 22% or 21%. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12740.34s)]
*  They were being offered, I think, less than a withdrawal to the 1967 borders with mutual [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12744.019999999999s)]
*  minor and reciprocal land swaps and the just resolution of- [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12751.539999999999s)]
*  A refugee problem was one of the questions. [[03:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12756.019999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12759.06s)]
*  I worked for a number of years with International Crisis Group and my boss at the time was Rob [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12760.74s)]
*  Malley, who was one of the American officials present at Camp David. [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12767.939999999999s)]
*  He'd thrown out of the State Department or whatever. [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12771.78s)]
*  Well, the point I want to make about Rob was he wrote, I think, a very perceptive article in 2001 [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12775.380000000001s)]
*  in the New York Review of Books. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12783.300000000001s)]
*  I know that you and Ehud Barak have had a debate with them, but I think he gives a very [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12784.34s)]
*  compelling reason of why and how Camp David failed. [[03:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12789.380000000001s)]
*  But rather than going into that- [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12795.78s)]
*  He wrote that together with Hussein Ara. [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12797.54s)]
*  Hussein Ara, yes, who was not at Camp David. [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12800.02s)]
*  But in response to your question, I think there could have been a real possibility of [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12804.02s)]
*  Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli peace in the mid-1970s in the wake of the 1973 October War. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12813.78s)]
*  I'll recall that in 1971, Moshe Dayan, Israel's defense minister at the time, [[03:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12823.22s)]
*  full of triumphalism about Israel's victory in 1967, speaking to a group of Israeli military [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12834.66s)]
*  veterans, stated, if I had to choose between Sharm el-Sheikh without peace or peace without [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12842.019999999999s)]
*  Sharm el-Sheikh, this is referring to the resort in Egyptian Sinai, which was an [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12851.94s)]
*  under-Israeli occupation, Dayan said, I will choose for Sharm el-Sheikh without peace. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12857.380000000001s)]
*  Then the 1973 war came along, and I think Israeli calculations began to change very significantly. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12864.980000000001s)]
*  I think it was in that context that had there been a joint US-Soviet push for an Arab-Israeli [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12874.66s)]
*  and Israeli-Palestinian resolution that incorporated both an Israeli withdrawal [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12890.18s)]
*  to the 1967 lines and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories. [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12896.82s)]
*  I think there was a very reasonable prospect for that being achieved. It ended up being aborted, [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12905.779999999999s)]
*  I think, for several reasons, and ultimately the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, decided [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12913.539999999999s)]
*  for reasons we can discuss later to launch a separate unilateral initiative for Israeli-Egyptian [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12923.06s)]
*  rather than Arab-Israeli peace. I think once that set in motion, the prospects disappeared because [[03:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12933.619999999999s)]
*  Israel essentially saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation and felt that this would [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12942.66s)]
*  give it a free hand in the occupied territories, also in Lebanon, to get rid of the PLO and so on. [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12949.94s)]
*  You ask when were we closest, and I can't give you an answer of when we were closest. I can only [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12959.54s)]
*  tell you one I think we could have been close, and that was a lost opportunity. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12965.220000000001s)]
*  If we look at the situation today, there's been a lot of discussion [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12974.259999999998s)]
*  about a two-state settlement. My own view, and I've written about this, I don't buy the arguments of [[03:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12979.06s)]
*  the naysayers that we have passed the so-called point of no return with respect to a two-state [[03:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12987.619999999999s)]
*  settlement. Certainly, if you look at the Israeli position in the occupied territories, [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=12994.179999999998s)]
*  I would argue it's more tenuous than was the French position in Algeria in 1954, [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13002.019999999999s)]
*  than was the British position in Ireland in 1916, than was the Ethiopian position in Eritrea [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13008.419999999998s)]
*  in 1990. As a matter of practicality, as a matter of principle, I do think the establishment of a [[03:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13016.099999999999s)]
*  Palestinian state in the occupied territories remains realistic. I think the question that [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13026.74s)]
*  we now need to ask ourselves, it's one I'm certainly asking myself since October 7th, [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13033.06s)]
*  and looking at Israel's genocidal campaign, but also looking at larger questions, is it desirable? [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13042.42s)]
*  Can you have peace with what increasingly appears to be an irrational, genocidal state [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13048.74s)]
*  that seeks to confront and resolve each and every political challenge with violence, [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13060.42s)]
*  and that reacts to its failure to achieve solutions to political challenges with violence [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13067.140000000001s)]
*  by applying even more violence, that has an insatiable lust for Palestinian territory, [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13075.14s)]
*  that a genocidal apartheid state that seems increasingly incapable of even conceiving of [[03:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13083.14s)]
*  peaceful coexistence with the other people on that land? So I'm very pessimistic that a solution is [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13091.699999999999s)]
*  possible. I grew up in Western Europe in the long shadow of the Second World War. I think we can all [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13102.26s)]
*  agree that there could have been no peace in Europe had certain regimes on that continent not [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13112.26s)]
*  been removed from power. I look at Southeast Asia in the late 1970s, and I think we're all agreed [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13119.86s)]
*  that there could not have been peace in that region had the Khmer Rouge not been ousted. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13128.82s)]
*  I look at Southern Africa during the 1990s, and I think we can all be agreed that had the [[03:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13135.54s)]
*  white minority regimes that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa not been dismantled, there could [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13141.78s)]
*  not have been peace in that region. And although I think it's worth having a discussion, I do think [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13149.14s)]
*  it's now a legitimate question to ask, can there be peace without dismantling the Zionist regime? [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13156.26s)]
*  And I make a very clear distinction between the Israeli state and its institutions on the one hand, [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13168.1s)]
*  and the Israeli people who I think regardless of our discussion about the history, I think you can [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13174.42s)]
*  now talk about an Israeli people and a people that have developed rights over time. And [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13181.7s)]
*  a formula for peaceful coexistence with them will need to be found, which is a separate matter [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13190.58s)]
*  from dismantling the Israeli state and its institutions. And again, I haven't reached [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13198.66s)]
*  clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter, I think a two-state [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13204.58s)]
*  settlement remains feasible. But I think there are very legitimate questions [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13210.9s)]
*  about its desirability and about whether peace can be achieved in the Middle East [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13217.78s)]
*  with the persistence of an irrational, genocidal apartheid regime, particularly because Israeli [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13226.26s)]
*  society is beginning to develop many extremely, extremely distasteful supremacist, dehumanizing [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13234.74s)]
*  aspects that I think also stand in the way of coexistence that are being fed by this regime. [[03:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13249.22s)]
*  CB So if you look back into history, when were closest to peace? And do you draw any hope from [[03:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13257.46s)]
*  any of them? BD I feel like in 2000, I feel like the deal that was present, at least at the end of [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13264.58s)]
*  the Taba Summit, I think in terms of what Israel I think had the appetite to give and what the [[03:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13271.3s)]
*  Palestinians would have gotten would have definitely been the most agreeable between the two parties. [[03:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13276.42s)]
*  I don't know if in 73, I'm not sure if the appetite would have ever been there for the [[03:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13281.22s)]
*  Arab states to negotiate alongside the Palestinians. I know that in Jordan, there was no love for the [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13287.3s)]
*  Palestinians after 1970, after Black September. I know that Sadat had no love for the Palestinians [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13292.9s)]
*  due to their association with the Muslim Brotherhoods, attempted assassinations in Egypt. [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13300.5s)]
*  CB Sorry, which? PLO and the Muslim Brotherhood? BD Sadat was upset because there were attempted [[03:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13306.5s)]
*  assassinations by people in, oh no, an assassination. It was a personal friend of his, Yusuf Al-Sibai, [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13311.54s)]
*  I can't pronounce that. He was assassinated by a Palestinian squad. [[03:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13317.140000000001s)]
*  CB He was killed by the Abu Nidal organization. BD Sure, yeah. Admittedly, yeah, he says as much, [[03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13320.900000000001s)]
*  belongs to a center group, not the PLO directly. But I think that there was a history of the [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13323.86s)]
*  Palestinians sometimes fighting with their neighboring states that were hosting them if [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13328.980000000001s)]
*  they weren't getting the political concessions they wanted. The assassination of the Jordanian [[03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13333.3s)]
*  king in 51 might be another example of that in Jordan. It feels like over a long period of time, [[03:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13337.3s)]
*  it feels like the Palestinians have been kind of told from the neighboring Arab states that if they [[03:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13342.98s)]
*  just continue to enact violence, whether in Israel or abroad, that eventually a state will [[03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13348.259999999998s)]
*  materialize somehow. I don't think it's gotten them any closer to a state. If anything, I think it's [[03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13353.859999999999s)]
*  taken them farther and farther and farther away from one. And I think as long as the hyperbolic [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13358.26s)]
*  language is continually employed internationally, the idea that Israel is committing a genocide, [[03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13362.98s)]
*  the idea that there is an apartheid, the idea that they live in a concentration camp, [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13367.54s)]
*  all of these words I think further the narrative for the Palestinians that Israel is an evil state [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13371.300000000001s)]
*  that needs to be dismantled. I mean, you said as much about the institution at least of the Zionist [[03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13375.460000000001s)]
*  government. Israel's government is probably not going anywhere. All of the other surrounding Arab [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13379.78s)]
*  states have accepted that, or at least most of them down in the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan, [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13383.62s)]
*  have accepted that. The Palestinians need to accept it too. The Israeli state or the state [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13387.46s)]
*  apparatus is not going anywhere. And at some point they need to realize like, hey, we need a leader [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13392.419999999998s)]
*  that's going to come out and represent us, represent all of us, is willing to take political risks, [[03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13396.259999999998s)]
*  is willing to negotiate some lasting peace for us. And it's not going to be the international [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13400.58s)]
*  community or some invocation of international law or some invocation of morality or justice that's [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13405.539999999999s)]
*  going to extricate us from this conflict. It's going to take some actual difficult political [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13410.9s)]
*  maneuvering on the ground. Of accepting Israel. Of accepting Israel, yeah. Which they formally did [[03:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13414.58s)]
*  in 1993. Which they formally did in 1993, yeah, but then no lasting peace came after that in 2000. [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13419.46s)]
*  No, because 1993 was not a peace agreement. Sure, the Oslo Accords were an interim agreement. And [[03:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13426.9s)]
*  Palestinians actually began clamoring for commencing the permanent status resolutions on schedule. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13436.5s)]
*  And the Israelis kept delaying them. In fact, they only began, I believe in 99, [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13446.1s)]
*  under American pressure on the Israelis. I think you're being a bit one-sided. Both sides [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13452.42s)]
*  didn't fulfill the promise of Oslo and the steps needed for Oslo. There was Palestinian terrorism [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13458.02s)]
*  which accompanied Israel's expansion of settlements and other things. The two things fed each other [[03:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13465.46s)]
*  and led to what happened in 2000, which was a breakdown of the talks altogether, [[03:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13470.58s)]
*  when the Palestinians said no. But I don't agree, incidentally, with this definition of Israel [[03:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13476.58s)]
*  or the Israeli state as apartheid. It's not. There is some sort of apartheid going on in the West Bank. [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13482.98s)]
*  The Israeli regime itself is not an apartheid regime. That is nonsense. By any definition of [[03:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13489.46s)]
*  apartheid, which… Well, by the formal definition, I think it qualifies. No, it doesn't qualify. [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13494.98s)]
*  Apartheid is a race-based distinction between different segments of the population. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13500.1s)]
*  And some of them don't have any representation at all, like the blacks in South Africa. [[03:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13506.34s)]
*  No rights at all. In Israel itself, the minority, the Arabs, do have representation, do have rights, [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13511.46s)]
*  and so on. I don't think Israel is also genocidal. I don't think it's been genocidal. It wasn't [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13519.3s)]
*  so in 1948. It wasn't so in 1967. And it hasn't been recently, in my view. [[03:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13523.86s)]
*  And talk about dismantling Israel, and that's what you're talking about, [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13529.54s)]
*  is, I think Stephen said it correctly, is counterproductive. It just pushes Israelis [[03:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13533.78s)]
*  further away from willing to give Palestinians anything. [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13540.02s)]
*  Please, Norm, tell me you have… [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13544.18s)]
*  Something optimistic to say. [[03:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13546.26s)]
*  Optimistic to say. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13547.380000000001s)]
*  Well, even though I agree, I've thought about it a lot, and I agree with Muin's analysis. [[03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13548.42s)]
*  I'm not really in the business of punditry. I'd rather look at the historical record, [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13556.98s)]
*  where I feel more comfortable, and I feel on terra firma. So I'd like to just go through that. [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13562.5s)]
*  I agree and I disagree with Muin on the 1973 issue. After the 1973 war, [[03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13570.82s)]
*  it was clear that Israel was surprised by what happened during the war. And [[03:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13578.179999999998s)]
*  it took a big hit. The estimates are, I don't know what numbers you use, but I hear between [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13586.66s)]
*  2,000 and 3,000 Israeli soldiers were killed during the 19th century. [[03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13592.179999999998s)]
*  It was 2,500? [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13596.42s)]
*  2,700. [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13598.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, so I got it right. I read different numbers. It's a very large number [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13598.74s)]
*  of Israelis who were killed. There were moments at the beginning of the war where there was a [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13604.74s)]
*  fear that this might be it. In fact… [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13609.78s)]
*  No, there wasn't. There wasn't. There wasn't. This is nonsense. [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13611.94s)]
*  Everybody forgets Israel's atomic weaponry. [[03:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13615.300000000001s)]
*  I know, but… [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13617.78s)]
*  So how could they have been defeated? [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13618.66s)]
*  Didn't Dayan talk about the collapse of the Third Temple? [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13620.18s)]
*  He did, but it was hysterical and silly because Israel had atomic weapons. They wanted to stop [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13623.060000000001s)]
*  the Syrians or the Egyptians. [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13628.1s)]
*  But we're talking about perceptions here. [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13629.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I can't tell you if he was hysterical or not. [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13630.66s)]
*  No, he was. For a day he was hysterical. [[03:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13633.78s)]
*  I was in the same room with him. [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13634.82s)]
*  For a day he was hysterical. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13636.34s)]
*  But I'm just saying, let's not bog down on that. The war is over, and when President Carter comes [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13636.9s)]
*  into power, Carter was an extremely smart guy, Jimmy Carter, extremely smart guy, and he was very [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13644.18s)]
*  fixed on details. He was probably the most impressive of modern American presidents, [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13650.18s)]
*  in my opinion, by a wide margin. And he was determined to resolve the conflict [[03:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13655.14s)]
*  on a big scale, on the Arab-Israeli scale. On the Palestinian issue, he wouldn't go past what he [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13661.3s)]
*  called the Palestinian homeland. He wouldn't accept… [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13668.42s)]
*  Palestinian national home. [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13670.74s)]
*  On the Palestinian national home, he wouldn't go as far as a Palestinian state. I'm not going to [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13672.02s)]
*  go into the details of that. I don't think realistically, given the political balance of [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13677.539999999999s)]
*  forces, that was going to happen, but that's a separate issue. Let's get to the issue at hand, [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13682.66s)]
*  namely what is the obstacle, or what has been the obstacle, since the early 1970s. [[03:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13688.58s)]
*  Since roughly 1974, the Palestinians have accepted a two-state settlement on the June 1967 border. [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13694.1s)]
*  Now, as it got, as more pressure was exerted on Israel, because the Palestinians [[03:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13701.94s)]
*  seemed reasonable, the Israelis, to quote the Israeli political scientist Avner Yaniv, [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13709.3s)]
*  he since passed from the scene, Yaniv in his book Dilemmas of Security, he said that the big [[03:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13714.74s)]
*  Israeli fear was what he called the Palestinian peace offensive. That was their worry, [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13722.18s)]
*  that the Palestinians were becoming too moderate. And unless you understand that, [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13729.3s)]
*  you can't understand the June 1982 Lebanon War. The purpose of the June 1982 Lebanon War [[03:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13736.34s)]
*  was to liquidate the PLO in southern Lebanon because they were too moderate, [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13744.02s)]
*  the Palestinian peace offensive. I'm going to have to fast forward. There are many events. [[03:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13750.74s)]
*  There's the first Intifada, then there's the Oslo Accord, and let's now go to the heart of the [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13756.74s)]
*  issue, namely the 2000-2001 negotiations. Well, the negotiations are divided into three parts, [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13764.58s)]
*  for the sake of listeners. There's Camp David in July 2000. There are the Clinton parameters [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13776.26s)]
*  in December 2000. And then there are negotiations in Taba in Egypt in 2001. Those are the three [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13783.06s)]
*  phases. Now, I have studied the record probably to the point of insanity, because there are so [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13793.38s)]
*  many details you have to master. I'll vouch for that insanity part. [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13801.46s)]
*  Yeah, actually, I will vouch for it. I will personally vouch for it. There is one extensive [[03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13805.619999999999s)]
*  record from that whole period from 2000 to, you could say, 2007. And that is what came to be [[03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13814.179999999998s)]
*  called the Palestine Papers, which are about 15,000 pages of all the records of the negotiations. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13822.42s)]
*  I have read through all of them, every single page. And this is what I find. If you look at [[03:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13831.7s)]
*  Shlomo Ben-Ami's book, which I have with me, Profits Without Honor, it's his last book, [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13839.06s)]
*  he says, going into Camp David, that means July, going into Camp David, July 2000, [[03:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13845.859999999999s)]
*  he said the Israelis were willing to return about, not return, but will withdraw from 90, [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13854.18s)]
*  relinquish, 92% of the West Bank. Ben-Ami was at Camp David. [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13861.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Ben-Ami, he was at Taba. Oh yeah, he was also at Camp David. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13866.26s)]
*  They wanted, Israel wanted to keep all the major settlement blocks. It wanted to keep roughly 8% [[03:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13871.619999999999s)]
*  of the West Bank. They were allowing for, you put it at 84 to 90% in your books. They put it at roughly [[03:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13882.82s)]
*  92% Israel was willing to give up. It also depends how you calculate. [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13894.26s)]
*  It also depends what stage Camp David, because there were two weeks. [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13899.38s)]
*  I'll get to that. Proposals changed during those two weeks. [[03:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13902.66s)]
*  Israel wants to keep all the major settlement blocks. [[03:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13906.019999999999s)]
*  Means the border area of the West Bank. Well, not the border. We have Ariel, [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13909.46s)]
*  we have Maale Adumim, we have a Condoleezza Rice called Ariel. She said it was a dagger into the [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13913.939999999999s)]
*  heart of the West Bank. So they want to keep 8% of the land. They want to keep the settlement blocks. [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13923.22s)]
*  They want to keep 80% of the settlers. They will not budge an inch on the question of refugees. [[03:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13932.9s)]
*  To quote Ehud Barak in the article he co-authored with you in the New York Review of Books, [[03:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13942.099999999999s)]
*  and I think the quote's accurate, no moral, legal, or historical responsibility for what [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13949.699999999999s)]
*  happened to the refugees. So forget about even allowing refugees to return. We accept no moral, [[03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13954.9s)]
*  legal, or historical responsibility for the refugees. And on Jerusalem, they wanted to keep [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13960.9s)]
*  large parts of Jerusalem. Now, how do we judge who is reasonable and who is not? [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13967.46s)]
*  Danehmi says, I think the Israeli offer was reasonable. That's how he sees it. [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13976.259999999998s)]
*  But what is the standard of reasonable? My standard is what does international law say? [[03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13982.42s)]
*  International law says the settlements are illegal. Israel wants to keep all the settlement blocks. [[03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13990.179999999998s)]
*  15 judges, all 15 in the wall decision in 2004, in July 2004, all 15 judges, including the American [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=13999.38s)]
*  Judge Bergenthal, ruled the settlements are illegal under international law. They want to keep 80% [[03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14009.54s)]
*  of the settlers. Under international law, all the settlers are illegal in the West Bank. They want [[03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14018.74s)]
*  to keep large parts of East Jerusalem. But under international law, East Jerusalem is occupied [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14027.46s)]
*  Palestinian territory. That's what the international- No, not Palestinian, because there was no [[03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14037.859999999999s)]
*  Palestine. There's never been a Palestinian state. How could it be Palestinian? I listen patiently [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14043.46s)]
*  to you. Under international law, if you read the decision, all territory beyond the green line, [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14049.3s)]
*  which includes East Jerusalem, is occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14064.98s)]
*  Except in the Golan Heights. [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14071.859999999999s)]
*  The designated unit, according to the International Court of Justice, [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14073.939999999999s)]
*  the designated unit for Palestinian self-determination. They deny any right whatsoever [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14078.58s)]
*  on the right of return. I don't want to go into the details now. The maximum formal offer was by [[03:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14087.859999999999s)]
*  Ehud Omar in 2008. He offered 5,000 refugees could return under what was called family [[03:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14096.98s)]
*  reunification. 5,000 in the course of five years and no recognition of any Israeli responsibility. [[03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14105.859999999999s)]
*  So, if you use as the baseline what the UN General Assembly has said and what the [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14115.94s)]
*  International Court of Justice has said, if you use that baseline, international law, [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14125.62s)]
*  by that baseline, all the concessions came from the Palestinian side. Every single concession [[03:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14133.300000000001s)]
*  came from the Palestinian side. None came from the Israeli side. They may have accepted less [[03:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14143.7s)]
*  than what they wanted, but it was still beyond what international law allocated to them. [[03:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14152.419999999998s)]
*  Now, you'll say- Allocated to the Palestinians. [[03:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14164.019999999999s)]
*  Allocated to Palestinians, yes. Thank you for the clarification. Now, about Arafat, [[03:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14166.259999999998s)]
*  like the Mufti, never like the guy. I think that was one of the only disagreements Muin and I had [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14174.339999999998s)]
*  when Arafat passed. You were a little sentimental, I was not. Never like the guy, but politics, [[03:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14180.66s)]
*  you don't have to like the guy. There was no question, nobody argues it, that whenever the [[03:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14186.98s)]
*  negotiations started up, the Palestinians just kept saying the same things. No. [[03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14193.94s)]
*  No. They kept saying no. [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14200.66s)]
*  No. Professor Maras with due respect, incorrect. They kept saying international legitimacy, [[03:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14202.18s)]
*  international law, UN resolutions. They said, we already gave you what the law required. [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14209.46s)]
*  We gave that in 1988, November 1988, and then ratified again at Oslo in 1993. They said, now, [[03:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14217.46s)]
*  we want what was promised us under international law. That was the one point where everybody on [[03:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14227.699999999999s)]
*  the other side agreed. Clinton, don't talk to me about international law. Livni, during the [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14237.7s)]
*  Omar administration, she said, I studied international law. I don't believe in international [[03:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14245.62s)]
*  law. Every single member on the other side, they didn't want to hear from international law. [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14251.060000000001s)]
*  To my thinking, that is the only reasonable baseline for trying to resolve the conflict [[03:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14259.539999999999s)]
*  that Israel has along with the US. When has international law been relevant to any conflict [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14268.82s)]
*  basically in the world over the last 150 years? That's why the Palestinians have to recognize [[03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14276.18s)]
*  Israel, because that's international law. No, but international law is meaningless. [[03:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14281.06s)]
*  That was UN resolution 242. Professor Maras, for argument's sake, [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14284.5s)]
*  let's agree on that. Strictly for argument's sake. What's the alternative? Dennis Ross said, [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14295.06s)]
*  we're going to decide who gets what on the basis of needs. He says, Israel needs this, Israel needs [[03:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14303.3s)]
*  that, Israel needs that. Dennis Ross decided to be the philosopher king. He's going to decide [[03:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14312.98s)]
*  on the basis of needs. Well, if you asked me, since Gaza is one of the densest places on earth, [[03:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14320.1s)]
*  it needs a good chunk. It needs part of Sinai. It needs a nice big chunk. Of Sinai. [[03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14328.42s)]
*  That's what it actually needs. Okay, I don't even want to go there. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14336.1s)]
*  It needs a nice big chunk, but I have to accept international law says no. [[03:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14340.339999999998s)]
*  International law is irrelevant. [[03:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14346.179999999998s)]
*  Now Ben-Ami says, I think the Israeli offer was reasonable. [[03:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14347.939999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's your- And he's a reasonable guy. [[03:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14355.46s)]
*  That's your- He seems to, even though, okay, I don't want to go there. I've debated him [[03:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14356.98s)]
*  and part I agree with you. But who decides what's reasonable? I think the international community in [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14361.54s)]
*  its political incarnation, the General Assembly, the Security Council, all those UN Security Council [[03:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14370.26s)]
*  resolutions saying the settlements are illegal, annexation of East Jerusalem is null and void, [[03:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14379.300000000001s)]
*  and the International Court of Justice. That to me is a reasonable standard. And by that standard, [[03:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14385.619999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians were asked to make concessions, which I consider unreasonable, [[03:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14393.859999999999s)]
*  or the international community considers unreasonable. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14398.82s)]
*  I think that the issue is when you apply international law or international standards, [[04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14401.699999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say what Benny Moore says that they're irrelevant, but I think that these have to be seen [[04:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14406.58s)]
*  as informing the conversation. I don't think these are the final shape of the conversation. [[04:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14411.22s)]
*  I don't think historically Israel has ever negotiated within the strict bounds, [[04:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14415.22s)]
*  whether we're talking Resolution 242, whether we're talking about any General Assembly resolutions, [[04:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14420.099999999999s)]
*  that's just not how these negotiations tend to go. You might consider international opinion on [[04:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14424.58s)]
*  things, but at the end of the day, it's the bilateral negotiations, oftentimes historically [[04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14429.619999999999s)]
*  started in secret, independent of the international community, that end up shaping what the final [[04:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14433.06s)]
*  agreements look like. I think the issue with this broad appeal to international law is, again, [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14437.46s)]
*  going back to my earlier point about all of the euphemistic words, all it simply does is drive [[04:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14442.74s)]
*  Palestinian expectations up to a level that is never going to be satisfied. For instance, [[04:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14447.06s)]
*  you can throw that ICJ opinion all you want. It was an advisory opinion. That came in 2004. [[04:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14452.58s)]
*  Palestinians gained more or less land since that 2004 advisory opinion was issued. [[04:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14457.22s)]
*  So what would your standard be then? [[04:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14461.699999999999s)]
*  Both sides have to have a delegation that confronts each other and they assess the [[04:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14463.46s)]
*  realistic conditions on the ground and they try to figure out within the confines of international [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14466.98s)]
*  law and what both sides are reasonable for. But for instance, this statement of full retreat from [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14472.019999999999s)]
*  the West Bank, what is it, 400,000 settlers? How many settlers live in the West Bank now? [[04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14476.66s)]
*  Probably half a million. Depends if you include the Jerusalem suburbs or not. [[04:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14479.859999999999s)]
*  Four or 500,000 people are never- I think it's 700,000. [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14483.38s)]
*  With the Jerusalem suburbs, perhaps. There's no call for Jerusalem, not settlements. [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14485.859999999999s)]
*  I know that, but that's not what the law. The law calls it null and void. [[04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14490.98s)]
*  Let me just- We can say whatever we want until we're [[04:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14494.34s)]
*  blue in the face, but there's half a million Israeli people are not being expelled. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14496.82s)]
*  My response to you are basically saying, if I understand correctly, there's only one way [[04:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14500.42s)]
*  to resolve this and that is through direct bilateral negotiations. [[04:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14504.66s)]
*  Probably, yeah. Or ideally, but- [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14507.939999999999s)]
*  I've taken over your house. You're not going to go to the police because the law is only of limited [[04:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14510.9s)]
*  value. So you come over and sit in what is now my living room that used to be your living room, [[04:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14518.42s)]
*  and we negotiate. The problem there is that you're not going to get anything unless I agree to it, [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14525.86s)]
*  and standards and norms and law and all the rest of it be damned. So you need to take into account [[04:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14532.9s)]
*  that when you're advocating bilateral negotiations, that effectively that gives each of the parties [[04:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14540.82s)]
*  veto power. In the current circumstances, the Palestinians have already recognized Israel. [[04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14548.02s)]
*  You keep bringing that up like it's a significant concession. [[04:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14558.66s)]
*  It's not true. It's not even true. [[04:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14560.34s)]
*  Even though I'm the law- The recognition from Palestine isn't [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14562.98s)]
*  doing anything for- Hamas totally rejects. [[04:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14566.58s)]
*  I'm not talking about Hamas. Hamas is the majority among the [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14569.380000000001s)]
*  Palestinian people. They won the elections in 2006. [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14572.42s)]
*  They won a majority of the seats. They didn't win a majority of the votes. [[04:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14576.339999999998s)]
*  Every opinion poll today says the majority of Palestinians support the Hamas. [[04:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14579.14s)]
*  That sounds right. The Hamas absolutely rejects Israel. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14583.699999999999s)]
*  If Arafat in 1993 or whatever issued a recognition of Israel- [[04:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14586.9s)]
*  It wasn't a recognition. Okay, a recognition of Israel. It's meaningless. [[04:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14592.42s)]
*  I don't believe that Arafat was sincere about it. [[04:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14598.42s)]
*  Does it matter what you or I think about what's going on? [[04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14600.98s)]
*  Most Israelis do and that does matter. Okay. [[04:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14602.66s)]
*  But Hamas says no and Hamas is the majority. [[04:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14606.18s)]
*  So for years, the Israeli and US demand was that the Palestinians recognize [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14608.5s)]
*  242 and 338. They did. But you're saying, okay, we demanded that they do this, [[04:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14617.22s)]
*  but it was meaningless when they did it. Then the demand was that- [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14622.42s)]
*  It was a tactical thing, yes. Then the demand was the PLO recognize Israel. [[04:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14626.02s)]
*  Tactical. Okay. [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14631.06s)]
*  We demanded that they did this and they did it, but it's meaningless. [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14631.78s)]
*  And they never changed their charter, the PLO. You may remember that. [[04:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14635.380000000001s)]
*  In fact- They supposedly [[04:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14638.42s)]
*  abrogated the old charter but never came up with a new one. [[04:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14640.34s)]
*  No. But in 1996- [[04:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14642.900000000001s)]
*  And Farouk Kadoumi said, of course, the old charter is still in force. [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14645.460000000001s)]
*  Yes. But the point is, the Palestinians demands are constantly made of them. [[04:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14648.5s)]
*  And of Israel. [[04:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14655.460000000001s)]
*  And when they accede to those demands, they're then told actually what you did is meaningless. [[04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14656.74s)]
*  So here's a new set of demands. I mean, it's like a hamster- [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14661.38s)]
*  There's no new set of demands. [[04:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14664.179999999998s)]
*  It's like a hamster stuck in a wheel- [[04:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14665.14s)]
*  Let me tell you what the bottom line is. [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14666.66s)]
*  If you run fast enough, you'll get out of the cage. [[04:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14669.779999999999s)]
*  No, no. The bottom line is that Israel would like a Palestinian Sadat. It wants the Palestinians- [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14672.019999999999s)]
*  This is really a worst case scenario you're talking about now. [[04:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14680.9s)]
*  Okay. Let me just, because they shot Sadat. But anyhow, the Israelis want- [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14682.58s)]
*  For good reason? [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14687.539999999999s)]
*  Want the Palestinians, Israelis want the Palestinians to actually accept the legitimacy [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14688.18s)]
*  of the State of Israel and the Zionist project and then live side by side with them in two states. [[04:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14695.460000000001s)]
*  That's what the Israelis- [[04:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14700.66s)]
*  What is the formal position- [[04:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14703.460000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if that's true today. [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14704.1s)]
*  And what is the formal position of this Israeli government? [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14704.82s)]
*  No, no. I'm saying, I don't know if it exists today- [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14708.5s)]
*  Okay. It's predecessor and it's predecessor and it's predecessor. Come on. [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14709.86s)]
*  That's what Israelis want. They want a change of psyche among the Palestinians. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14714.42s)]
*  And if that doesn't happen, there won't be a Palestinian state. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14719.22s)]
*  Muin, Muin has an interesting point. [[04:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14722.18s)]
*  Forget international law. [[04:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14725.86s)]
*  Because I know you want to forget it, just like you want to forget the genocide charge. [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14727.06s)]
*  I know you want to forget that. [[04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14733.460000000001s)]
*  Well, the Palestinians want to forget it too, but it doesn't suit them as well, right? [[04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14734.66s)]
*  But here's the problem. And it's exactly the problem that Muin just brought up. [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14737.22s)]
*  Now, I read carefully your book, One State, Two States. With all due respect, absolutely a disgrace. [[04:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14742.179999999998s)]
*  Coming from you- [[04:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14748.5s)]
*  Most reviewers didn't agree with you though. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14750.5s)]
*  Yeah. Coming from you was like you wrote it in your sleep. [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14752.019999999999s)]
*  It's nothing compared to what you wrote before. I don't know why you did it. [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14755.06s)]
*  In my opinion, you ruined your reputation. Not totally, but you undermined it with that book. [[04:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14759.3s)]
*  But let's get to the issue that Muin wrote. [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14764.339999999998s)]
*  Here's what you said. You said formally, you said, yes, it's true, the Palestinians recognize Israel. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14767.46s)]
*  But then you said viscerally in their hearts, they didn't really recognize Israel. [[04:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14777.3s)]
*  So I thought to myself, how does Professor Morris know what's in the hearts of Palestinians? [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14783.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I was surprised as a historian, you would be talking about what's lurking in the [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14791.78s)]
*  hearts of Palestinians. But then you said something which was really interesting. [[04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14800.02s)]
*  You said, even if in their hearts they accepted Israel, you said, quote, rationally, [[04:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14804.820000000002s)]
*  they could never accept Israel because they got nothing. They had this beautiful Palestine, [[04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14813.140000000001s)]
*  and now they're reduced to just a few parcels of land. [[04:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14819.22s)]
*  So they will never accept it. [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14823.38s)]
*  So yes. So you said there's no way they can accept it. [[04:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14824.82s)]
*  No, I would say that as well. The two-state solution, as proposed, doesn't make any sense. [[04:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14828.74s)]
*  Exactly as Muin said, you keep moving the goalposts until we reach the point where we realize, [[04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14834.82s)]
*  according to Benny Morris, there can't be a solution. So why don't you just say that [[04:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14844.74s)]
*  outright? Why don't you say it outright? According to you, the Palestinians can never be reasonable. [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14850.58s)]
*  Because according to you, they couldn't possibly agree to a two-state settlement because it's such [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14861.22s)]
*  a lousy settlement. That's what you said. Because you said rationally they couldn't accept it, [[04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14871.62s)]
*  not their feelings. You said rational. You went from formally, viscerally, rationally. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14878.740000000002s)]
*  So now we're reaching the point where according to Benny Morris, the Palestinians can't be [[04:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14886.42s)]
*  reasonable because reasonably they have to reject two states. [[04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14893.7s)]
*  They want all of Palestine. [[04:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14900.02s)]
*  Absolutely correct. There's no way to resolve the problem, according to your logic. [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14901.699999999999s)]
*  He said that himself. He said they should dismantle Israel. That's what he's saying. [[04:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14905.699999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about what I said. [[04:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14909.539999999999s)]
*  You didn't say that. [[04:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14910.58s)]
*  What I said and I've written- [[04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14911.779999999999s)]
*  I'm glad you didn't deny it. [[04:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14914.42s)]
*  I've written extensively on this issue, on why a two-state settlement is still feasible. [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14915.779999999999s)]
*  I came out in support of that proposition. Perhaps in my heart, you can see that I was [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14924.339999999998s)]
*  just bullshitting, but that's what I actually wrote. That was a number of years ago. Just as [[04:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14930.34s)]
*  a matter of historical record, beginning in the early 1970s, there was fierce debate within the [[04:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14936.5s)]
*  Palestinian national movement about whether to accept or reject. There were three schools of [[04:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14944.74s)]
*  thought. There was one that would accept nothing less than the total liberation of Palestine. [[04:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14951.460000000001s)]
*  There was a second that accepted what was called the establishment of a fighting national authority [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14957.06s)]
*  on Palestinian soil, which they saw as a springboard for the total liberation of Palestine. [[04:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14962.18s)]
*  There was a third school that believed that under current dynamics and so on, that they should go [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14968.5s)]
*  for a two-state settlement. Our friend and correspondent, Kauter Loehrse, has written a [[04:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14975.78s)]
*  very perceptive article on when the PLO, already in 1976, came out in open support [[04:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14983.54s)]
*  of a two-state resolution at the Security Council. PLO accepted it. Israel, of course, rejected it, [[04:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=14990.980000000001s)]
*  but the resolution didn't pass because the US and the UK vetoed it. It was both of them. [[04:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15000.02s)]
*  I think it was nine to five. [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15004.660000000002s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. But the fact of the matter is that the PLO came to accept a two-state settlement. [[04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15006.74s)]
*  Why they did it, I think is irrelevant. Subsequently, the PLO acted on the basis [[04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15017.460000000001s)]
*  of seeking to achieve a two-state settlement. The reason I think, and I think, Norm, you've written [[04:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15025.62s)]
*  about this, the reason that Arafat was so insistent on getting minimally acceptable terms for a [[04:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15030.1s)]
*  two-state settlement at Camp David and afterwards was precisely because he knew that once he signed, [[04:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15040.34s)]
*  that was all the Palestinians were going to get. If his intention had been, [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15047.140000000001s)]
*  I'm not accepting Israel, I simply want a springboard, he would have accepted a Palestinian [[04:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15052.74s)]
*  state in Jericho, but he didn't. That's something I've never understood. He should have logically [[04:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15057.86s)]
*  accepted the springboard and then from there launched his next stage. [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15063.54s)]
*  No, he understood what he doesn't understand. He understood international law would put a real [[04:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15066.980000000001s)]
*  constraint on him. Once he accepted, it was over. Constitutionally, he was incapable of signing. [[04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15072.34s)]
*  Well, I don't know that. You're right that he should have accepted it. [[04:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15077.62s)]
*  But if you're correct, that he was really out to eliminate Israel, then he wouldn't have cared [[04:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15081.3s)]
*  about the borders. He wouldn't have cared about what the thing said about refugees. He would [[04:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15088.9s)]
*  have gotten a sovereign state and used that to achieve that purpose. But I think it was precisely [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15092.58s)]
*  because he recognized that he was not negotiating for a springboard, he was negotiating permanent [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15097.699999999999s)]
*  status that he was such a stickler about the details. Just as a factual matter, he wasn't [[04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15103.38s)]
*  such a stickler. When they asked him how many refugees, the numbers- [[04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15110.74s)]
*  It was a principle rather than the numbers. [[04:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15116.18s)]
*  He said that we'd be pragmatic about it. [[04:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15118.26s)]
*  Yes. The numbers that were used at Annapolis were between 100 and 250,000 refugees over 10 years. [[04:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15120.02s)]
*  That was the number. Arafat, when he was asked at Camp David, he kept saying, [[04:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15130.74s)]
*  I care about the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, which came to about 300,000. [[04:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15136.58s)]
*  It was a risk priority. [[04:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15142.02s)]
*  Which was a large concession from them, whether you accept the number or not, [[04:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15143.14s)]
*  that he wasn't talking about 6 million. He was talking about between 100 and 250,000 over 10 [[04:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15148.18s)]
*  years. Now, the best offer that came from the Palestinians, excuse me, the best offer that [[04:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15155.3s)]
*  came from Israel was the Omert offer. [[04:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15161.06s)]
*  Can we just pretend we didn't all lay out the exceptionally pessimistic view of a two-state [[04:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15164.58s)]
*  holocaust, like a two-state solution. Let's pretend that in five years, in 10 years, [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15171.86s)]
*  a two-state peace settlement is reached. As historians, you'll still be here writing about [[04:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15177.300000000001s)]
*  it 20 years from now. How would it have happened? [[04:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15184.980000000001s)]
*  I think that historically, I think that the big issue is, I think that both sides have had their [[04:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15189.060000000001s)]
*  own internal motivations to fight because they feel like they have something to gain from it. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15193.46s)]
*  But I think as time has gone on, unfortunately, the record proves that the Palestinian side is [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15197.14s)]
*  delusional. The longer that the conflict endures, the worse position they'll be in. [[04:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15201.859999999999s)]
*  But for some reason, they've never had a leader that convinced them of that as much. [[04:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15206.019999999999s)]
*  That Arafat thought that if he held on, there was always a better deal around the corner. [[04:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15210.179999999998s)]
*  Abbas is more concerned with trying to maintain any legitimacy amongst Palestinians than actually [[04:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15214.099999999999s)]
*  trying to negotiate anything realistic with Israel. That Palestinians are always incentivized [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15218.339999999998s)]
*  to feel like as long as they keep fighting, either the international community is going to [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15223.22s)]
*  save them with the 5 millionth UN resolution condemning whatever, that another ICJ advisory [[04:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15227.06s)]
*  opinion is finally going to lead to the expulsion of half a million Jews from the West Bank, [[04:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15231.779999999999s)]
*  or that some other international body, the ICJ and the genocide charge, is going to come and [[04:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15235.859999999999s)]
*  save the Palestinians. As long as they, in their mind, feel like somebody is coming to save them, [[04:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15239.699999999999s)]
*  then they feel like they're going to have the ability to get something better in the future. [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15244.179999999998s)]
*  But the reality is, is all of the good partners for peace that the Palestinians had have [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15247.38s)]
*  completely and utterly abandoned them. Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf States, whether you're talking [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15251.38s)]
*  bilateral peace or the Abraham Accords, most of the Arab leaders in negotiating peace with Israel [[04:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15257.779999999999s)]
*  have just not had as much of an interest in maintaining the rights and the representations [[04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15262.259999999998s)]
*  of what the Palestinian people want. And the only people they have today to draw legitimacy from, [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15268.099999999999s)]
*  or to have on their side to argue with them, are people that, I guess, write books or tweet, [[04:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15272.74s)]
*  or people in the international community that do resolutions or amnesty international reports. [[04:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15277.38s)]
*  And the reality is, we can scream until we're blue in the face on these things, none of it has gotten [[04:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15281.859999999999s)]
*  any closer to helping the Palestinians in any sense of the word. The condition has only gotten [[04:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15285.619999999999s)]
*  worse, the settlements only continue to expand, the military operations are only going to get more [[04:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15289.3s)]
*  brutal, the blockade is going to continue to have worse effects. As long as we use international law [[04:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15293.3s)]
*  as the basis, and there isn't a strong, a Sadat-like Palestinian leader that's willing to come up [[04:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15298.5s)]
*  and confront Israel with the brave, peaceful negotiations to force them to acquiesce, [[04:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15302.66s)]
*  nothing is going to happen. And I think that the issue you come up with is, whether it's people [[04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15308.34s)]
*  like Norm that talk about how brave the October 7th attacks were, or how much respect they have [[04:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15312.26s)]
*  for those fighters, Israel in a way, and I think people have said as much about Netanyahu, the right [[04:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15315.78s)]
*  wants violence from the Palestinians because it always gives them a perpetual excuse to further [[04:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15322.26s)]
*  the conflict. Well, we have to go in October 7th, we've got to remove Hamas, well, we can't trust [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15326.34s)]
*  these people in the West, we have to do the night raids because the second Intifada made us feel [[04:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15330.58s)]
*  like the Palestinian people didn't want trust with us. I feel like the biggest thing that would force [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15335.78s)]
*  Israel to change its path would be an actual, a real, not for like two weeks, but an actual [[04:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15340.66s)]
*  peaceful Palestinian leader, somebody committed to peace that is able to apply those standards and [[04:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15346.5s)]
*  hold the entire region of Palestine to those standards, because I think over time, the mounting [[04:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15351.22s)]
*  pressure from without the international community and the mounting pressure from within, because [[04:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15355.78s)]
*  Israel hosts a lot of its own criticism, if we talk about Bet-Solem, we're talking about Haaretz, [[04:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15360.5s)]
*  like Israel will host a lot of its own criticism, I think that that pressure would force Israel [[04:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15363.94s)]
*  towards an actual peace agreement, but it's never going to come through violence. Historically, [[04:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15367.38s)]
*  it hasn't, and in the modern day, violence has just hurt the Palestinians more and more. [[04:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15371.78s)]
*  If you paint a picture of the future, now is a good moment for both Palestine and Israel to get [[04:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15376.1s)]
*  new leadership. Netanyahu's on the way out, Hamas possibly is on the way out, who should rise to the [[04:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15381.86s)]
*  top such that a peaceful settlement can be reached. The problem is, like Benny said, yeah, [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15388.66s)]
*  it's difficult because Hamas enjoys so much widespread support amongst the Palestinian people. [[04:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15394.18s)]
*  I think that the, well, I don't know, there's opinions on whether democracy or pushing them [[04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15400.5s)]
*  towards elections was the right or wrong idea, but with like an Islamic fundamentalist government [[04:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15403.7s)]
*  for Hamas, I don't know if a negotiation with Israel ever happens there, and then when the [[04:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15408.26s)]
*  international pressure is always, you know, 67 borders, infinite right of return for refugees, [[04:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15412.82s)]
*  and a total withdrawal of Israel from all these lands to even start negotiations, [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15417.46s)]
*  I just don't see realistically that on the Palestinian side, no negotiations are ever [[04:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15421.859999999999s)]
*  going to start in a place that Israel's willing to accept. If you want to dismiss international [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15425.46s)]
*  law, that's fine, but then you have to do it consistently. You can't set standards for the [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15432.66s)]
*  Palestinians, but reject applying those standards to Israel. If we're going to have the law of the [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15439.54s)]
*  jungle, then we can all be beasts and not only some of us. And I think, so it's either that [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15448.740000000002s)]
*  or you have certain agreed standards that are intended to regulate our conduct, all of our [[04:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15456.34s)]
*  conduct, not just some of us. So that's a fundamental- [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15463.62s)]
*  Well, what are the standard of things I'm saying to abandon? [[04:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15465.86s)]
*  Well, you're saying, you know, international law and the millionth UN resolution, you're being very [[04:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15468.34s)]
*  dismissive about all these things. And that's fine, but then you have to be dismissive across [[04:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15472.18s)]
*  the board. I'm saying, like for instance, like 242, that was a chapter six resolution. That's [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15477.300000000001s)]
*  non-binding. But 242 is the thing- Of course it's binding. [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15479.300000000001s)]
*  Of course it's binding. Absolutely not binding. [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15481.380000000001s)]
*  What is binding? Do you know anything about how the UN system works? [[04:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15483.060000000001s)]
*  If you read the language of the resolution, binding is typically if it commits you to upholding [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15487.220000000001s)]
*  a particular international law or if it establishes a new law- [[04:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15490.82s)]
*  What is chapter six? You just throw out words, you hear binding, not binding- [[04:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15492.34s)]
*  Does 242 mention a Palestinian state? No. [[04:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15498.019999999999s)]
*  Of course not. That's part of the problem. [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15500.34s)]
*  That was the reason why Palestinians didn't want to recognize 242, because they only referred [[04:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15502.1s)]
*  at the very end for refugee problems. Sure, but the PLO recognized 181 and [[04:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15507.46s)]
*  242 when they were there in Wisconsin. Yeah, but hold on, hold on. Every United [[04:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15510.1s)]
*  Nations Security Council resolution, irrespective of under which chapter it was adopted, is by [[04:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15513.22s)]
*  definition binding. Binding not only on the members of the Security Council, but on every member state [[04:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15519.46s)]
*  of the UN. Read the UN charter. It's black and white. [[04:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15526.5s)]
*  Sure. People can look that up. [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15531.06s)]
*  Okay. Now regarding- Yes? [[04:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15532.1s)]
*  The language even of 242 is kept intentionally vague, such that it doesn't actually provide [[04:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15533.06s)]
*  again the final concourse. It's actually not that vague, [[04:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15537.94s)]
*  because the term land for peace originates in 242. The idea is- [[04:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15539.78s)]
*  The idea about territorial acquisition and Israel's need to give it up was kept vague. [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15545.7s)]
*  Okay. That's why in 79- You asked a separate question. [[04:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15548.74s)]
*  You asked a separate question. Allow me points of information. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15551.46s)]
*  Allow me points of information. Yeah. [[04:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15555.38s)]
*  The first principle in UN resolution 242 is that the inadmissibility of the acquisition [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15557.779999999999s)]
*  of territory by force. Which is meaningless. [[04:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15563.859999999999s)]
*  That, Chris, it may be meaningless to you, Mr. Bonnell. [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15565.859999999999s)]
*  It was meaningless to everyone in the region. Okay, Mr. Bonnell, that principle was adopted by [[04:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15568.98s)]
*  the friendly nations resolution, the UN General Assembly in 1970. That resolution was then [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15576.26s)]
*  reiterated in the International Court of Justice ruling advisory opinion in 2004. That was the [[04:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15583.380000000001s)]
*  basis of the coalition against Iraq when it acquired Kuwait and then declared it a province of Kuwait. [[04:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15593.78s)]
*  Yep, which Iraq had supported. That's what's called- [[04:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15603.300000000001s)]
*  That's true, Arafat. Arafat did support. [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15605.94s)]
*  Arafat did support. Why you can't just [[04:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15608.1s)]
*  treat it with the Oslo Accords. It's not accurate. I'm not going to go there. [[04:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15609.140000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to go there. It's not accurate that Arafat endorsed- [[04:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15612.18s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to go there. Okay. [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15615.060000000001s)]
*  The whole policy- It's called under international law, [[04:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15616.66s)]
*  use Cogans or peremptory norms of international law, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15619.78s)]
*  territory by war. That is not controversial. It's not vague. You couldn't put it more succinctly. [[04:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15626.74s)]
*  You cannot acquire territory by force under international law. [[04:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15634.74s)]
*  On the West Bank before 67. Who only got on the strip before 67? [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15639.3s)]
*  Mr. Bonnell, don't change the subject. If you don't know what you're talking about, [[04:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15643.539999999999s)]
*  at least have the humility. You talk about Chapter 6. [[04:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15649.46s)]
*  I'm curious, how close is 242? How close has 242 gotten to the Palestinian [[04:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15654.1s)]
*  East Peace? You don't know Chapter 6 from Tweet 5. [[04:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15657.78s)]
*  You have no idea what you're talking about. It's just so embarrassing. [[04:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15659.619999999999s)]
*  At least have some humility between us who have read maybe 10,000 books on the topic, [[04:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15663.94s)]
*  and you've read two Wikipedia entries, and you start talking about Chapter 6. [[04:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15670.26s)]
*  Do you know what Chapter 7 is? Answer me. [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15676.02s)]
*  Do you know what Chapter 7 is? Answer me a question. [[04:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15678.02s)]
*  How close has 242 gotten the Palestinians to a state? [[04:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15679.86s)]
*  How close has the 2004 advisory opinion gotten the West Bank settlement? [[04:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15682.58s)]
*  What's your alternative? The alternative is not this, [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15686.1s)]
*  whatever this making money off the conflict is. The actual alternative, [[04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15689.78s)]

*  Yeah, you're a media blitz where you go and talk to 50 million different people [[04:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15696.5s)]
*  about your awesome solutions. But he has a point there. [[04:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15699.539999999999s)]
*  One point. All these resolutions [[04:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15701.46s)]
*  have gotten the Palestinians no closer to a state. [[04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15703.779999999999s)]
*  Because they haven't been enforced because of the US veto. [[04:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15706.66s)]

*  Okay, if I may. You know what, Professor Morris? [[04:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15711.939999999999s)]
*  We're talking about the case for genocide. Professor Morris, because of your logic, [[04:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15717.3s)]
*  and I'm not disputing it, that's why October 7 happened. [[04:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15721.7s)]
*  Oh my God. Because there was no options left [[04:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15725.62s)]
*  for those people. Exactly what Mowey said. And now what options are left? [[04:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15730.18s)]
*  After October 7th? This has been the counseling [[04:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15734.58s)]
*  mechanism for 16 years. What's the options left? [[04:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15736.5s)]
*  The only option is conflict. Listen to this. [[04:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15738.5s)]

*  fighting. And then when I point out they've also gone to the court and the UN and say, well, [[04:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15870.9s)]

*  Of course, it could have been more effective. Everyone could have always been more effective. [[04:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15908.66s)]
*  The fundamental issue here is that Israel has never been prepared to concede [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15912.58s)]
*  the legitimacy of Palestinian national rights in the land of the former British mandate of Palestine. [[04:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15920.34s)]

*  No, all of Palestine? All of Palestine. [[04:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15942.18s)]

*  The occupied territories. Is that all of Israel? [[04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15950.18s)]
*  The occupied territories are those territories that Israel occupied in June of 1967. [[04:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15951.86s)]

*  in the negotiations, because that's what we were talking about, wanted all of Israel? [[04:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15977.380000000001s)]
*  They can't say that because international community won't accept it. [[04:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15983.62s)]
*  So they didn't say it, they didn't ask for it. [[04:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15987.060000000001s)]
*  No, Hamas did. Hamas always said it, all of it. [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15989.380000000001s)]
*  Hamas only negotiated with Israel about prisoner exchanges. [[04:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=15992.74s)]

*  The only place I saw pieces of Israel were the land swaps, and the land swaps accounted for about [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16000.02s)]
*  2 to 5% of Israel. Nobody asked for all of Israel. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16007.46s)]
*  Hey, what do you mean? They asked for all of Israel in 48, they asked for all of Israel in 67. [[04:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16011.78s)]

*  You talk so... I'll respond to you. [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16019.46s)]
*  Okay, Mr. Bonnell, we were talking about the diplomatic negotiations beginning with 2000, 2001. [[04:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16021.539999999999s)]
*  You can't pretend that the first ask for Israel was in diplomacy. [[04:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16030.66s)]
*  It was through war. You don't know what [[04:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16034.26s)]
*  you're talking about. Is the international law argument [[04:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16035.619999999999s)]
*  ever going to get the Palestinians closer to the state? Is the Israeli state ever going to be [[04:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16038.42s)]
*  dismantled? Do you think that's realistic coming up ever in the next 20 years? [[04:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16041.699999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm posing a question. Regardless of what's feasible or realistic today, [[04:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16046.02s)]
*  the question I'm posing is, can you have peace in the Middle East with this militant, irrational, [[04:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16056.58s)]
*  genocidal, apartheid state and power? [[04:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16064.98s)]
*  At last, I don't think so, no. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16068.98s)]
*  Okay. The question I'm asking is, can you have peace with this regime or does this regime [[04:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16070.58s)]
*  and its institutions need to be dismantled similar to what the examples I gave of Europe [[04:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16077.78s)]
*  and Southern Africa? How do you contend with the fact [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16084.5s)]
*  that most of the surrounding Arab states seem to agree that you can? [[04:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16086.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're correct. Several of them, most importantly Egypt, Jordan have made their peace [[04:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16089.38s)]
*  with Israel. I should add that Israel's conduct since then has placed these relations under [[04:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16097.939999999999s)]
*  strain. I didn't take the reports of a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement particularly seriously [[04:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16105.46s)]
*  before October 7th. The reason being that it was really a Saudi-Israeli-US deal which committed [[04:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16115.779999999999s)]
*  the US to make certain commitments to Saudi Arabia that would probably never get through [[04:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16122.74s)]
*  Congress. Do you not consider the Egypt-Israeli [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16128.02s)]
*  peace deal legitimate then since the United States made a great financial contribution to Egypt? [[04:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16130.18s)]
*  I don't think the question is whether that deal is legitimate or not. I think that deal exists. [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16134.98s)]
*  The point is whether the core of this conflict is not between Israel and Egypt. The core of this [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16143.699999999999s)]
*  conflict is between Israel and the Palestinian people. The reason that Israel agreed to [[04:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16153.46s)]
*  relinquish the occupied Egyptian Sinai and the reason that Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was [[04:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16162.02s)]
*  signed in 1979 is because Israel in 1973 recognized that its military superiority [[04:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16169.94s)]
*  was ultimately no match for Egypt's determination to recover its occupied territories and that [[04:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16178.74s)]
*  there would come a point when Egypt would find a way to extract an unbearable price. [[04:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16184.02s)]
*  Maybe just the Israelis wanted peace. Not just because they were afraid of what [[04:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16188.5s)]
*  Egypt might do at some point. If you're talking about the average Israeli citizen, [[04:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16193.380000000001s)]
*  I think that's a fair characterization. If you're talking about the Israeli leadership, [[04:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16197.38s)]
*  I think they looked at it in more strategic terms. How do you remove the most powerful [[04:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16201.3s)]
*  Arab military state from the equation? Two points. Simple points. What was the [[04:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16206.1s)]
*  terms of that Egypt-Israel peace treaty? International law. Egypt demanded every— [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16209.939999999999s)]
*  Nobody cared about international law. Allow me to finish. Every single inch of Egypt— [[04:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16218.42s)]
*  Nobody even talked about international law. [[04:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16224.18s)]
*  Begin and Carter and Sadat talked about the reality of Israel occupying territory and wanting [[04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16227.14s)]
*  peace. Professor Morris, I know the record. They demanded, as you know, because you've written [[04:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16233.220000000001s)]
*  about it, they demanded every square inch—as you know, they demanded the oil fields be dismantled. [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16241.62s)]
*  No, that's in the— The air fields be dismantled. [[04:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16248.66s)]
*  No, not dismantled. They wanted the oil fields. And they wanted the settlements dismantled. [[04:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16250.26s)]
*  They wanted the settlements dismantled. [[04:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16253.94s)]
*  The settlements, the oil fields, and the airfield. They demanded all three back. You can't have— [[04:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16255.3s)]
*  What do you mean back? The airfields weren't there when the Egyptians were there. [[04:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16261.14s)]
*  That's incorrect. You're incorrect. The Israeli's built an airfield in the occupied Sinai. [[04:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16264.34s)]
*  They didn't want it back. It wasn't theirs. They wanted the territory in which the airfield [[04:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16273.619999999999s)]
*  Israel had built back. The oil fields, the airfields, [[04:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16278.259999999998s)]
*  the settlements had to be dismantled. Begin said, I don't want to be the first prime minister to [[04:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16281.62s)]

*  No. It was because of peace. [[04:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16291.380000000001s)]
*  Nobody can remember about the law. The law had nothing to do with anything. [[04:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16293.060000000001s)]
*  It was a negotiation between two states, each of which wanted certain things. [[04:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16296.820000000002s)]

*  I've read the negotiations. There are two foreign relations of [[04:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16307.140000000001s)]

*  The Palestinians kept saying we want— Forget the Palestinians. They weren't there. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16314.5s)]
*  Allow me to finish. The Palestinians kept saying we want what Egypt got. [[04:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16318.66s)]
*  We want what Egypt got. Egypt got everything back. [[04:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16324.179999999998s)]
*  But nothing to do with the law. Okay. [[04:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16327.619999999999s)]
*  Nothing to do with the law. And number two, I'm not saying it's [[04:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16328.98s)]
*  the whole picture, but as Foreign Minister Moisha Dayan said at the time, he said, [[04:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16332.339999999998s)]
*  if a car has four wheels and you remove one wheel, the car can't move. And for them, [[04:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16340.179999999998s)]
*  removing Egypt from the Arab front would then remove any Arab military threat to Israel. [[04:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16350.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got nothing to do with the international law. [[04:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16358.099999999999s)]
*  No, the first part did. And that's what the Palestinians kept saying. [[04:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16360.26s)]
*  I don't know what the first part is. We want what Egypt got from the settlement. [[04:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16364.66s)]
*  That's true, but forget international law. And by the way, one last thing on a personal note. [[04:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16368.26s)]
*  The quote about Sharm el-Sheikh without peace. Yeah, yeah. [[04:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16374.58s)]
*  Okay. That's the only thing you ever cited from a book of mine. [[04:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16378.1s)]
*  I cited from your book? Yes. [[04:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16383.7s)]
*  I was absolutely shocked at your betrayal of your people. That was pure treason. [[04:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16386.260000000002s)]

*  what gives you hope? We just heard a lot of pessimistic, cynical takes. [[04:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16405.3s)]
*  People don't like war. That's a good reason. That's hope. In other words, the fear of war, [[04:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16408.9s)]
*  the disaster of war should give people an impetus to try and seek peace. [[04:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16414.5s)]

*  fundamentally, no, but fundamentally, they hate war. [[04:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16425.86s)]
*  Yes, I think so. What gives you hope? [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16429.54s)]

*  Israel believes it has to restore what it calls its deterrence capability. [[04:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16447.22s)]
*  I think you've written about it, actually. I just realized. Israel has to restore its [[04:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16454.9s)]
*  deterrence capability. After the catastrophe of October 7th, restoring its deterrence capacity [[04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16459.54s)]
*  means this part you didn't write about, the annihilation of Gaza and then moving on to [[04:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16467.3s)]
*  the Hezbollah. No, no, no. [[04:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16472.74s)]

*  On the Arab side, and I know Muin and I have disagreed on it and we're allowed to disagree, [[04:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16482.579999999998s)]

*  Israelis aren't as strong as we thought they were. [[04:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16493.94s)]

*  They think that there is a military option, though. [[04:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16502.66s)]

*  That I agree with. [[04:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16525.14s)]

*  the permanent ceasefire and the inhuman and illegal blockade of Gaza and free the hostages. [[04:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16532.02s)]
*  Why is it illegal? They were shooting rockets at Israel for 20 years. [[04:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16538.82s)]

*  I'll tell you why. [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16560.02s)]

*  That means 500,000 children are on the verge of famine. [[04:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16759.22s)]
*  They keep saying on the verge of famine. [[04:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16765.7s)]
*  I have not seen one Palestinian die of starvation in these last four months. [[04:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16767.38s)]
*  Well, there have been documented cases. [[04:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16774.1s)]
*  There have been documented cases. [[04:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16776.98s)]
*  I haven't seen them. [[04:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16778.5s)]
*  Yesterday Al Jazeera said six and the day before that they said two. [[04:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16779.22s)]
*  So those are the two. [[04:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16782.1s)]
*  That number probably dies in Israel of starvation also. [[04:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16784.34s)]
*  I don't think there's famine in Israel. [[04:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16787.22s)]
*  There isn't. [[04:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16788.98s)]
*  There isn't in the Gaza Strip either. [[04:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16789.7s)]
*  It's something which is produced for the West. [[04:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16791.940000000002s)]
*  There are infants dying due to an engineered lack of access to food and nutrition. [[04:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16795.3s)]
*  I don't think it's engineered. [[04:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16801.86s)]
*  I think the Hamas stopped shooting perhaps. [[04:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16802.9s)]
*  As you said, engineered. [[04:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16806.34s)]
*  I think Human Rights Watch called it using starvation as a weapon. [[04:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16808.18s)]
*  That's called engineering. [[04:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16814.260000000002s)]
*  That's what they did, but you were pushed on this by Coleman Hughes to bring up an example of why [[04:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16815.7s)]
*  is the Gaza Strip? [[04:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16819.46s)]
*  By what metric are they starving? [[04:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16820.58s)]
*  By what metric is it so behind the rest of the world? [[04:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16822.260000000002s)]
*  I want to hear an answer to that because he didn't answer it before. [[04:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16826.98s)]
*  I'm happy to answer it. [[04:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16828.34s)]
*  I just called you from the humanitarian organizations. [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16829.94s)]
*  They said one quarter of the population of Gaza is now verging on famine. [[04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16832.82s)]
*  Before October 7th. [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16836.98s)]
*  I'm not going before October 7th. [[04:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16838.34s)]
*  That's what you use it as justification for Hamas fighting. [[04:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16839.699999999997s)]
*  You say the conditions were unlivable. [[04:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16841.94s)]
*  They had to fight. [[04:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16843.3s)]
*  I said to him... [[04:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16843.94s)]
*  So my question is what made it unlivable prior to October 7th? [[04:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16844.739999999998s)]
*  What are the metrics that you're using? [[04:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16847.379999999997s)]
*  There were about five, six or seven reports issued by UNCTAD, issued by the World Bank, [[04:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16849.699999999997s)]
*  issued by the International Monetary Fund, and they all said that's why. [[04:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16857.539999999997s)]
*  Why did they say why? [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16863.379999999997s)]
*  Why did they say that? [[04:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16864.5s)]
*  That's why the Economist, not a radical periodical, described Gaza as a human rubbish. [[04:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16865.14s)]
*  So tell me by what metrics? [[04:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16872.26s)]
*  If you're a historian, if you do all this work to tell me what they said... [[04:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16875.46s)]
*  Here's something Mr. Penel. [[04:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16878.5s)]
*  Tell me by what metrics. [[04:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16880.1s)]
*  He's not going to answer again. [[04:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16881.46s)]
*  I don't think I've avoided any of your questions. [[04:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16883.54s)]
*  Except when they breached the threshold of complete imbecility. [[04:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16885.7s)]
*  So you're about to tell me by what metric that Gaza Strip is a humanitarian crisis. [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16890.98s)]
*  You remember what I said a moment ago? [[04:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16894.66s)]
*  I said to Professor Morris, I defer to expertise. [[04:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16896.34s)]
*  I look at what the organizations say. [[04:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16901.06s)]
*  I look at what the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said. [[04:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16904.02s)]
*  You don't know. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16907.3s)]
*  You don't know. [[04:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16908.02s)]
*  You don't care. [[04:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16908.5s)]
*  Okay. [[04:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16909.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[04:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16909.46s)]
*  You know how complicated... [[04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16910.02s)]
*  Have you ever investigated how complicated is the metric for hunger, starvation, and famine? [[04:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16911.7s)]
*  It is such a complicated metric they figured out. [[04:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16918.66s)]
*  If you asked me to repeat it now, I couldn't do it. [[04:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16922.5s)]
*  And yet we have a human development index where we rank countries, yet we can still measure infant [[04:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16925.54s)]
*  mortality, life expectancy. [[04:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16929.46s)]
*  Yeah, we can measure all of these things. [[04:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16932.02s)]
*  I'm holding out for you here. [[04:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16935.3s)]
*  You still didn't answer the hope question. [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16936.9s)]
*  What gives you a source of hope about the region? [[04:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16938.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would agree with Bendy Morris and Norman Finkelstein [[04:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16942.58s)]
*  that the current situation is bleak. [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16948.98s)]
*  And I think it would be unreasonable to expect it to not get even bleaker [[04:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16951.7s)]
*  in the coming weeks and months. [[04:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16960.34s)]
*  And we now this conflict, really it originated in the late 19th century. [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16962.18s)]
*  It's been a more or less active conflict since the 1920s, 1930s. [[04:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16969.38s)]
*  And it has produced a tremendous amount of suffering and regional conflict and geopolitical [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16976.980000000003s)]
*  complications and all of that. [[04:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16985.86s)]
*  But what gives me hope is that throughout their entire ordeal, the Palestinian people [[04:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16988.5s)]
*  have never surrendered. [[04:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16994.74s)]
*  And I believe they never will surrender to overwhelming force and violence. [[04:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=16997.06s)]
*  They have taken everything that Israel has thrown at them. [[04:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17004.02s)]
*  They have taken everything that the West has thrown at them. [[04:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17007.38s)]
*  They have taken everything that those who are supposed to be their natural allies have [[04:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17011.140000000003s)]
*  on occasion thrown at them. [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17017.780000000002s)]
*  But this is a people that never has and I believe never will surrender. [[04:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17019.780000000002s)]
*  And at a certain point, I think Israel and its leaders will have to come to the realization [[04:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17025.620000000003s)]
*  that by hook or by crook, these people are going to achieve their inalienable and legitimate [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17036.260000000002s)]
*  national rights. [[04:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17047.7s)]
*  And that is going to be a reality. [[04:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17048.980000000003s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[04:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17052.98s)]
*  You mean all of Palestine? [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17055.38s)]
*  Is that what you mean? [[04:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17056.58s)]
*  No. [[04:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17057.94s)]
*  From the river to the sea? [[04:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17058.98s)]
*  Well, ideally, of course, yes. [[04:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17060.5s)]
*  Those are inalienable rights. [[04:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17063.78s)]
*  No. [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17065.62s)]
*  What I was saying earlier and then the discussion got sidetracked is that I did believe that a [[04:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17066.1s)]
*  two-state settlement, a partition of Palestine along the 1967 boundaries would have been a [[04:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17073.46s)]
*  reasonable solution because I think it also would have opened pathways to further nonviolent [[04:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17085.219999999998s)]
*  engagement between Israel and the Palestinians that could create other forms of coexistence [[04:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17096.82s)]
*  in a federal or binational or other- [[04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17103.14s)]
*  What do you think about refugees in regards to that? [[04:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17106.18s)]
*  Do you think there has to be a resettlement of the five or six million, [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17108.02s)]
*  whoever wants to lay claim to being the Senate? [[04:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17110.66s)]
*  I think there has to be an explicit acknowledgement of the responsibility and of the rights. [[04:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17113.22s)]
*  I think that in the framework of a two-state settlement, I think a formula would need to [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17124.82s)]
*  be found that does not undermine the foundations of a two-state settlement. [[04:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17131.539999999997s)]
*  And I don't think it would be that difficult because I suspect that there are probably [[04:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17139.94s)]
*  large numbers of Palestinian refugees who, once their rights are acknowledged, [[04:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17146.34s)]
*  will find it exceptionally distasteful to have to live among the kind of sentiments that we've [[04:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17153.14s)]
*  heard around this table today, to be quite frank. I was previously unfamiliar with you, [[04:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17162.66s)]
*  and I watched one of your preparation videos. Very disconcerting stuff, I have to say. You [[04:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17170.66s)]
*  were explaining two days ago in the discussion about apartheid and how absurd it was that, [[04:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17176.58s)]
*  in your view, Jim Crow was not apartheid. But Arab states not giving citizenship to Palestinian [[04:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17181.78s)]
*  refugees is apartheid. That's what I meant with my earlier comments about white supremacy. [[04:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17190.5s)]
*  So my issue, that's great, the white supremacy comment. Hold on, let me respond. My issue is [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17196.42s)]
*  that I feel like we have jumped on this euphemistic treadmill, and I think that's part of the reason [[04:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17201.539999999997s)]
*  why this conflict will never get solved. It's because on one end, you've got a people who are [[04:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17205.94s)]
*  convinced internationally that they're victims of apartheid, genocide, concentration camp [[04:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17210.739999999998s)]
*  conditions, ethnic cleansing, they're forced to live in an open air prison, with all of these [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17215.379999999997s)]
*  things that are stacked against them, all of these terms that are highly specific, that refer to very [[04:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17221.14s)]
*  precise things. I would expect nothing less from someone who doesn't think Jim Crow is apartheid. [[04:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17225.46s)]
*  The problem is you're morally loading. For you, apartheid is when racists do bad things. [[04:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17234.1s)]
*  No, no, there's a definition of apartheid. [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17238.58s)]
*  That's great. But this specific top-down racial domination enacted through top-down [[04:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17241.22s)]
*  federal legislative policies or whatever, means that I don't know if Jim Crow would have qualified [[04:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17246.82s)]
*  for apartheid. That doesn't make it any less- Have you ever heard of the C-verse? [[04:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17252.82s)]
*  Excuse me, Twenkelstein, I'm talking to your friend over here. I don't know if it would have [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17254.42s)]
*  qualified as the crime of apartheid. Just like if Israel were to literally nuke the Gaza Strip [[04:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17261.06s)]
*  and kill two million people, I don't know if that would qualify for the crime of genocide. [[04:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17265.14s)]
*  In your eyes, probably not. [[04:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17267.22s)]
*  Because genocide requires a special intent. I think the issue is instead of, [[04:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17269.54s)]
*  and I think this conversation is emblematic of the entire conversation. [[04:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17273.300000000003s)]
*  Let me finish answering Jenny Morris's question. [[04:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17277.22s)]
*  Sure, but you accused me of supporting racism. [[04:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17278.82s)]
*  Well, you did. And you are. [[04:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17280.74s)]
*  I did. Do you think I support Jim Crow laws? The fact that you can't even answer that honestly. [[04:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17283.14s)]
*  It doesn't matter- You wouldn't say that 800 civilians [[04:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17288.66s)]
*  were killed by Hamas. You said, well, maybe 400 were killed by Israel. [[04:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17290.66s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. I don't know the number. [[04:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17294.02s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. No, I didn't say that. [[04:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17294.98s)]
*  You said 400. No, I didn't say that. [[04:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17295.94s)]
*  You co-signed the opinion. No, I didn't. [[04:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17297.14s)]
*  No, I didn't. Oh, well, wait. How many? [[04:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17299.219999999998s)]
*  I think the word was some. That's what I heard. [[04:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17301.699999999997s)]
*  No, I didn't. Well, you weren't listening. [[04:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17303.62s)]
*  How many people do you think approximately, if you had to ballpark it, how many do you think [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17305.14s)]
*  were killed by Hamas on October 7th? I think it's pretty clear that the majority [[04:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17308.82s)]
*  of civilians that were killed- 51% or 90%? [[04:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17313.78s)]
*  Don't ask me to put a number on something I don't know. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17318.42s)]
*  I just want to ballpark. Those are two very different intuitions. [[04:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17320.98s)]
*  First of all, when you say Hamas, do you mean Palestinians or do you mean Hamas specifically? [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17322.1s)]
*  I mean the invading Palestinian force. I don't like to say Palestinians because I don't think [[04:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17326.019999999997s)]
*  all Palestinian civilians were involved in the attacks. I'll say Hamas, Islamic Jihad, whatever. [[04:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17329.46s)]
*  That's how this discussion started. You said Hamas and I began to answer that. [[04:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17334.1s)]
*  And then Beny Morris said, actually, he means Hamas in addition to Jihad and the others. [[04:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17337.699999999997s)]
*  So of the invading Palestinian force, how many do you think killed civilians versus the IDF? [[04:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17342.42s)]
*  What do you think of the ballpark, the percentage? [[04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17348.18s)]
*  Well, the figures we have are that about a third of the casualties on October 7th were military. [[04:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17349.94s)]
*  That's not what I asked at all. What's your question? [[04:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17355.219999999998s)]
*  Yeah, asking about the two thirds. What percentage of civilians [[04:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17357.379999999997s)]
*  do you think were killed by the invading force? I think a clear majority, [[04:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17359.46s)]
*  but I can't give you a specific figure. If you thought it was closer to 51% or 99% [[04:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17363.539999999997s)]
*  were killed by- Why would people know that? [[04:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17368.1s)]
*  How would you know that? Because it's interesting [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17370.02s)]
*  to actually stake out a position. If you want to be completely [[04:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17371.539999999997s)]
*  agnostic on it, that's fine. They based on complete ignorance because we don't know. [[04:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17374.82s)]
*  Professor Morris doesn't know. Muin Rabbani doesn't know. [[04:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17379.06s)]
*  And yet you can speak with absolute certainty that the IDF is targeting and murdering Palestinian [[04:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17381.22s)]
*  children intentionally. Do you see the double standard? [[04:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17385.38s)]
*  Oh, actually, no, I don't. You see- I know you don't. It was a rhetorical question. [[04:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17387.62s)]
*  I don't see it. You know why? Because- [[04:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17390.58s)]
*  Because you're uneducated on the matter. I looked at the UN report. [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17392.5s)]
*  Uh-huh. The Gulps don't report? [[04:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17395.3s)]
*  No. The UN report on the Great March of Return in 2018, and they said that the snipers were [[04:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17397.22s)]
*  targeting children, medics, journalists, and disabled people. [[04:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17405.460000000003s)]
*  Just as they are now in this conflict. Exactly. [[04:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17411.38s)]
*  More journalists have been killed in the last several months in Gaza than in any other conflict. [[04:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17415.7s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that Hamas- And in all of World War II. [[04:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17421.06s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that Hamas- And in all of World War II. [[04:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17422.82s)]
*  That's right. The comparison is final. Hamas is not killing journalists in the Gaza- [[04:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17424.100000000002s)]
*  Agree that they operate in civilian uniforms, that their goal is to induce that confusion, [[04:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17427.62s)]
*  that that's the way that they conduct themselves militarily? [[04:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17431.14s)]
*  Let me finish my point. More journalists have been- [[04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17433.7s)]
*  I understand. I have had it. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17437.059999999998s)]
*  More children in the- I know. He doesn't want to hear it. So boring. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17437.54s)]
*  No, because it's- It's so boring. [[04:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17439.7s)]
*  It's so boring. You're not having a material- [[04:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17440.5s)]
*  Virtue signaling. A substantial- [[04:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17441.7s)]
*  It is virtue signaling. Virtue signaling, yeah. [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17442.899999999998s)]
*  Yes, like when you say children over and over again. That's virtue signaling. [[04:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17444.18s)]
*  But talking about- You know, you have this habit of walking to the dead. [[04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17446.34s)]
*  Talking about how many Israelis were killed, that's not virtue signaling, [[04:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17448.98s)]
*  because that's human life. I don't care about- [[04:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17453.54s)]
*  I don't care if 100 are killed or 1,000. I'm curious who you're assigning blame to. [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17455.62s)]
*  You just interrogated him 51%. I'm curious who you're assigning- [[04:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17459.3s)]
*  The question- Yes. [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17461.46s)]
*  And then Muin- That's not the number. [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17462.26s)]
*  That's the responsibility norm. And then Muin mentions that [[04:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17463.7s)]
*  more journalists were killed in Gaza than in all of World War II. [[04:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17468.5s)]
*  That doesn't get it. That doesn't further any part of the conversation. [[04:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17472.579999999998s)]
*  And more medics were killed in Gaza. No, no, that's silly. [[04:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17474.66s)]
*  Journalists- And then he says it's virtue signaling. [[04:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17477.379999999997s)]
*  Not on the scenario. But when Israelis get killed, that's serious. [[04:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17480.02s)]
*  I never said it's serious on both sides. I didn't say it's top- [[04:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17484.9s)]
*  No, you were talking virtue signaling. [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17488.260000000002s)]
*  I'm not virtue signaling. I'm asking a substantive question of who [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17489.7s)]
*  do you assign blame to or do you plan to norm Finkelstein's conspiracies, [[04:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17492.66s)]
*  that the ambulances should have known immediately who was dead, that the numbers were changed [[04:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17495.940000000002s)]
*  because they were fake, or that maybe 51% of the people were killed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, [[04:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17499.54s)]
*  but 49% were killed by IBS helicopters. You asked me a direct question and you got [[04:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17505.38s)]
*  a direct answer. I did and I got majority, [[04:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17510.02s)]
*  which could be- I said a clear majority. [[04:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17511.86s)]
*  What percent is a clear majority? As opposed to- [[04:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17515.06s)]
*  It's always they live in ambiguity, of course. [[04:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17517.22s)]
*  A clear majority, in my view, is well over 50%. Please don't ask me to be more precise [[04:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17517.940000000002s)]
*  because I- You could say 80, 90, 95%. [[04:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17523.62s)]
*  If I knew that, I would say it. I think it's a reasonable- [[04:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17526.420000000002s)]
*  It's a reasonable- Perhaps it is, but I- [[04:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17529.22s)]
*  You're not the best person to be asking that question. I read when you described [[04:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17531.7s)]
*  Operation Defensive Shield and you said a few dozen homes were destroyed. [[04:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17538.1s)]
*  You're talking about what happened in the Nigerian refugee camp. [[04:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17542.98s)]
*  And you said- No, the Arabs said 500. You guys said 500 [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17545.219999999998s)]
*  Palestinians were killed in Nigerian- No, no, no. [[04:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17549.62s)]
*  I never said that. No, but that was the statement of the PLO, [[04:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17550.899999999998s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority. You said a few dozen homes- [[04:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17554.5s)]
*  And that there were massacres there. There were a few dozen homes- [[04:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17557.379999999997s)]
*  Yes, a few dozen homes. Yeah. [[04:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17559.3s)]
*  Well, it turned out 140 buildings were destroyed. 5,000 people were [[04:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17560.579999999998s)]
*  left homeless. How many were killed? [[04:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17568.02s)]
*  5,000. How many were killed? [[04:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17569.94s)]
*  You described it- No, I'm talking about homes destroyed. [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17571.14s)]
*  So you're not the best person to be criticizing what Muin says when he says [[04:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17574.260000000002s)]
*  clear majority, but he can't say more. You know why he can't say more? [[04:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17579.7s)]
*  He doesn't- He doesn't know. [[04:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17583.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I understand that. I hope that's a historic- [[04:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17585.06s)]
*  If I was trying to belittle, I would give you a very different answer. [[04:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17588.02s)]
*  I would just say, I don't know. I do know that some were shot up. [[04:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17591.7s)]
*  You know what the right phrase there would be? The overwhelming majority [[04:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17594.5s)]
*  were killed by Arab gunmen and very small number were killed by Israelis [[04:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17597.94s)]
*  by accident or whatever. That's probably true. [[04:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17603.06s)]
*  That's probably true. That may be- [[04:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17606.02s)]
*  I can state with confidence a clear majority, overwhelming majority. [[04:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17608.42s)]
*  You may be correct, but I can't state that with certainty. [[04:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17612.58s)]
*  I think there's a very easy way to find out is to have an independent- [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17615.62s)]
*  Forget independence. Exactly. [[04:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17619.86s)]

*  Just repeat these numbers. They're all from barbaric countries. [[04:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17630.66s)]
*  Assyrian was the head of the UN Commission for Human Rights. [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17633.22s)]

*  I think there's a value to preserving the record. [[04:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17680.9s)]
*  I'm not optimistic about where things are going to end up. [[04:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17684.5s)]
*  There was a very nice book written by a woman named Helen Hunt Jackson [[04:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17688.82s)]
*  at the end of the 19th century describing what was done to the Native Americans. [[04:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17694.34s)]
*  She called it a century of dishonor. [[04:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17699.46s)]
*  And she described in vivid, poignant detail what was done to the Native Americans. [[04:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17702.02s)]
*  Did it save them? [[04:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17708.98s)]
*  No. [[04:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17710.34s)]
*  Did it help them? [[04:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17712.26s)]
*  Probably not. [[04:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17713.62s)]
*  Did it preserve their memory? [[04:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17715.46s)]
*  Yes. [[04:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17717.3s)]
*  And I think there's a value to that. [[04:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17717.94s)]
*  There was a famous film by Eisenstein, Sergei Eisenstein. [[04:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17720.74s)]
*  It was either Battleship Potemkin or Mother. [[04:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17726.26s)]
*  I can't remember which one. [[04:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17728.74s)]
*  The last scene was the Tsar's troops mowing down all the Russian people. [[04:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17731.14s)]
*  He pans the scene. [[04:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17738.58s)]
*  Not all the Russian people. [[04:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17740.1s)]
*  He pans the massacre. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17742.5s)]
*  He pans the massacre. [[04:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17744.34s)]
*  But he could have killed a lot more. [[04:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17745.62s)]
*  And the last words of the movie were proletarians! [[04:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17749.14s)]
*  Remember! [[04:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17755.3s)]
*  And I've seen it as my life's work to preserve the memory and to remember. [[04:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17758.420000000002s)]
*  I didn't expect that anyone would read my book on Gaza. [[04:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17764.74s)]
*  It's very dense. [[04:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17768.5s)]
*  It gives me even a bit of a headache to read at least one of the chapters. [[04:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17770.34s)]
*  But I thought that the memory deserves to be preserved. [[04:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17777.54s)]
*  Amen. [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17781.62s)]
*  Well, I would just say very briefly, unlike my colleague, I think writing the truth about [[04:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17782.74s)]
*  what happened in history, in various periods of history, if I've done a little bit of that, [[04:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17789.14s)]
*  I'm happy. [[04:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17795.38s)]
*  Thank you, Norman. [[04:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17796.82s)]

*  Peace is a journey of a thousand miles, and it must be taken one step at a time. [[04:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X_KdkoGxSs&t=17815.379999999997s)]
