# Michael I. Jordan Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, and Future of AI  Lex Fridman Podcast #74
**Lex Fridman:** [February 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYIKy_FM9x0)
*  The following is a conversation with Michael I. Jordan,
*  a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential
*  people in the history of machine learning,
*  statistics and artificial intelligence.
*  He has been cited over 170,000 times
*  and he has mentored many of the world-class researchers
*  defining the field of AI today,
*  including Andrew Eng, Zubin Garamani,
*  Van Tascar and Yoshua Bengio.
*  All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points
*  in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan
*  of basketball fame.
*  There's a non-zero probability that I talk to
*  the other Michael Jordan, given my connection to
*  and love of the Chicago Bulls in the 90s,
*  but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan
*  of statistics and computer science,
*  or as John LeCun calls him,
*  the Miles Davis of machine learning.
*  In his blog post titled,
*  Artificial Intelligence, The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet,
*  Michael argues for broadening the scope
*  of the artificial intelligence field.
*  In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast
*  is the same, to see artificial intelligence
*  as a deeply human endeavor,
*  to not only engineer algorithms and robots,
*  but to understand and empower human beings
*  at all levels of abstraction,
*  from the individual to our civilization as a whole.
*  This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
*  If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
*  give it five stars on Apple Podcast,
*  support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,
*  at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
*  As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,
*  and never any ads in the middle
*  that can break the flow of the conversation.
*  I hope that works for you,
*  and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
*  This show is presented by Cash App,
*  the number one finance app in the App Store.
*  When you get it, use code LexPodcast.
*  Cash App lets you send money to friends,
*  buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
*  with as little as one dollar.
*  Since Cash App does fractional share trading,
*  let me mention that the order execution algorithm
*  that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction
*  of the fractional orders is, to me, an algorithmic marvel.
*  So big props for the Cash App engineers
*  for solving a hard problem that, in the end,
*  provides an easy interface that takes a step up
*  to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,
*  making trading more accessible for new investors
*  and diversification much easier.
*  So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store
*  or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,
*  you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to first.
*  One of my favorite organizations
*  that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education
*  for young people around the world.
*  And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan.
*  Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI,
*  machine learning, computer science, and so on,
*  you're trivially called the Michael Jordan
*  of machine learning.
*  Although, as you know, you were born first,
*  so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball,
*  but anyway, my favorite is Jan Lukuen calling you
*  the Miles Davis of machine learning,
*  because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically
*  and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads
*  after you change direction.
*  So can you put, at first, your historian hat on
*  and give a history of computer science and AI
*  as you saw it, as you experienced it,
*  including the four generations of AI successes
*  that I've seen you talk about?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Jan's metaphor.
*  Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz
*  and he had a coherent story.
*  So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived,
*  it's the one you think about later.
*  What a good historian does is they look back
*  and they revisit.
*  I think what's happening right now is not AI.
*  That was an intellectual aspiration
*  that's still alive today as an aspiration.
*  But I think this is akin to the development
*  of chemical engineering from chemistry
*  or electrical engineering from electromagnetism.
*  So if you go back to the 30s or 40s,
*  there wasn't yet chemical engineering.
*  There was chemistry, there was fluid flow,
*  there was mechanics and so on.
*  But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals,
*  tried to build factories that make chemicals products
*  and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale.
*  So people started to try to do that, of course,
*  and some factories worked, some didn't,
*  some were not viable, some exploded.
*  But in parallel, developed a whole field
*  called chemical engineering.
*  Chemical engineering is a field.
*  It's no bones about it.
*  It has theoretical aspects to it.
*  It has practical aspects.
*  It's not just engineering, quote unquote.
*  It's the real thing, real concepts are needed.
*  Same thing with electrical engineering.
*  There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense
*  were everything you know about electromagnetism,
*  but you needed to figure out how to build circuits,
*  how to build modules, how to put them together,
*  how to bring electricity from one point to another
*  safely and so on and so forth.
*  So a whole field is developed called electrical engineering.
*  I think that's what's happening right now,
*  is that we have a proto field, which is statistics,
*  computer, more the theoretical side of it,
*  algorithmic side of it, computer science.
*  That was enough to start to build things, but what things?
*  Systems that bring value to human beings
*  and use human data and mix in human decisions.
*  The engineering side of that is all ad hoc.
*  That's what's emerging.
*  In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field,
*  I think that's what it is.
*  That's a proto form of engineering based on statistical
*  and computational ideas of previous generations.
*  But do you think there's something deeper about AI
*  in his dreams and aspirations as compared
*  to chemical engineering and electrical engineering?
*  Well, the dreams and aspirations may be,
*  but those are 500 years from now.
*  I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there
*  and saying it would be neat to get to the moon someday.
*  Right.
*  I think we have no clue how the brain does computation.
*  We're just a clueless.
*  We're even worse than the Greeks
*  on most anything interesting scientifically of our era.
*  Can you linger on that just for a moment
*  because you stand not completely unique,
*  but a little bit unique in the clarity of that.
*  Can you elaborate your intuition of why we are,
*  like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain?
*  A lot of people say, neuroscientists say,
*  we're not very far in understanding human brain.
*  But you're saying we're in the dark here.
*  Well, I know I'm not unique.
*  I don't even think in the clarity,
*  but if you talk to real neuroscientists
*  that really study real synapses or real neurons,
*  they agree, they agree.
*  It's a hundreds of year task
*  and they're building it up slowly and surely.
*  What the signal is there is not clear.
*  We have all of our metaphors.
*  We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical.
*  It's a whole soup.
*  It's ions and proteins and it's a cell.
*  And that's even around like a single synapse.
*  If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse,
*  it's a city of its own.
*  And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree,
*  which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing.
*  And it's doing these spikes and voltages
*  are flying around and then proteins are taking that
*  and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what.
*  So it is the problem of the next few centuries.
*  It is fantastic.
*  But we have our metaphors about it.
*  Is it an economic device?
*  Is it like the immune system?
*  Or is it like a layered set of arithmetic computations?
*  We have all these metaphors and they're fun.
*  But that's not real science per se.
*  There is neuroscience.
*  That's not neuroscience.
*  That's like the Greeks speculating
*  about how to get to the moon.
*  Fun, right?
*  And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly
*  because I think a lot of young people think
*  we're on the verge.
*  Because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly
*  let it be understood that yes,
*  this is brain inspired.
*  We're kind of close.
*  Breakthroughs are on the horizon.
*  And unscrupulous people sometimes
*  who need money for their labs.
*  As I say unscrupulous, but people will oversell.
*  I need money from a lab.
*  I'm studying computational neuroscience.
*  I'm gonna oversell it.
*  And so there's been too much of that.
*  So step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering
*  with I'm not sure if you're familiar
*  with brain computer interfaces.
*  So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink
*  that's working on putting electrodes into the brain
*  and trying to be able to read both read
*  and send electrical signals.
*  Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication
*  in the brain is not something we understand.
*  But do you hope without understanding
*  the fundamental principles of how the brain works,
*  we'll be able to do something interesting
*  at that gray area of metaphor?
*  It's not my area.
*  So I hope in the sense like anybody else hopes
*  for some interesting things to happen from research.
*  I would expect more something like Alzheimer's
*  will get figured out from modern neuroscience.
*  That there's a lot of human suffering
*  based on brain disease.
*  And we throw things like lithium at the brain.
*  It kind of works.
*  No one has a clue why.
*  That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know.
*  And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain.
*  And how it leads to mood swings and so on.
*  How thought emerges from that.
*  We were really, really completely dim.
*  So that you might wanna hook up electrodes
*  and try to do some signal processing on that
*  and try to find patterns.
*  Fine, by all means go for it.
*  It's just not scientific at this point.
*  It's just, so it's like kind of sitting in a satellite
*  and watching the emissions from a city
*  and trying to affirm things about the micro economy
*  even though you don't have micro economic concepts.
*  I mean, it's really that kind of thing.
*  And so yes, can you find some signals
*  that do something interesting or useful?
*  Can you control a cursor or a mouse with your brain?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And then I can imagine business models based on that.
*  And even medical applications of that.
*  But from there to understanding algorithms
*  that allow us to really tie in deeply
*  from the brain to computer.
*  I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk.
*  I don't think that's even, that's not for our generation.
*  It's not even for the century.
*  So just in the hopes of getting you to dream,
*  you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up.
*  Do you think that there might be breakthroughs
*  that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years
*  and say, wow?
*  Oh, I'm sure there will be,
*  but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me.
*  I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant
*  and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough.
*  Some people present it as such.
*  It's imitating human intelligence.
*  It's even putting coughs in the thing
*  to make a bit of a PR stunt.
*  And so fine, the world runs on those things too.
*  And I don't want to diminish all the hard work
*  and engineering that goes behind things like that
*  and the ultimate value to the human race.
*  But that's not scientific understanding.
*  And I know the people that work on these things,
*  they are after scientific understanding.
*  In the meantime, they've got to kind of,
*  the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed
*  and they got things to do.
*  And there's nothing wrong with all that.
*  I would call that though, just engineering.
*  And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field
*  like electrical engineering, chemical engineering
*  that originally emerged that had real principles
*  and you really knew what you were doing
*  and you had a little scientific understanding,
*  maybe not even complete.
*  So it became more predictable
*  and it was really gave value to human life
*  because it was understood.
*  And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters
*  of what we're able to do versus what we really can do
*  in a way that's going to impress the next.
*  So I don't need to be wowed,
*  but I think that someone comes along in 20 years,
*  a younger person who's absorbed all the technology
*  and for them to be wowed,
*  I think they have to be more deeply impressed.
*  A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts
*  that you see right now coming from the big companies.
*  The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs
*  from Kolmogorov would be,
*  and give this question a chance,
*  do you think they'll be in the scientific
*  fundamental principles arena
*  or do you think it's possible
*  to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering?
*  Meaning, I would say some of the things
*  that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others,
*  sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals
*  of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying,
*  here's a problem we know how to do a demo of
*  and actually taking it to scale.
*  Yeah, so there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs.
*  I just don't like that terminology.
*  I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out
*  and things move along and eventually say,
*  wow, something happened,
*  but I don't like that language very much.
*  Also, I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs
*  over practical ones.
*  I tend to be more of a theoretician
*  and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now.
*  And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs,
*  I might point to the Edison's of the era
*  and maybe Musk is a bit more like that.
*  But, you know, Musk, God bless him,
*  also will say things about AI
*  that he knows very little about.
*  And he leads people astray when he talks about things
*  he doesn't know anything about.
*  Trying to program a computer to understand natural language,
*  to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now,
*  ain't gonna happen in our lifetime.
*  You could fake it, you can mimic,
*  sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them,
*  but the deep understanding of language,
*  no, it's not gonna happen.
*  And so from that, you know, I hope you can perceive
*  that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects
*  in intelligence are not gonna happen.
*  Now, will there be breakthroughs?
*  No, I think that Google was a breakthrough.
*  I think Amazon is a breakthrough.
*  I think Uber is a breakthrough.
*  Bring value to human beings at scale in brand new ways
*  based on data flows and so on.
*  A lot of these things are slightly broken
*  because there's not a kind of a engineering field
*  that takes economic value in context of data
*  and planetary scale and worries about all the externalities,
*  the privacy.
*  You know, we don't have that field
*  so we don't think these things through very well.
*  But I see that as emerging
*  and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years,
*  that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era,
*  just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough
*  in the early part of the last century
*  and chemical engineering was a breakthrough.
*  So the scale, the markets that you talk about
*  and we'll get to, will be seen as sort of breakthrough.
*  And we're in very early days
*  of really doing interesting stuff there.
*  And we'll get to that,
*  but it's just taking a quick step back.
*  Can you give, we kind of threw off the historian hat.
*  I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI
*  kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but.
*  I keep saying machine learning.
*  You keep wanting to say AI just to let you know,
*  I don't, you know, I'd resist that.
*  I don't think this is about,
*  AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying,
*  wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer?
*  If we could mimic the human capability to think
*  or put intelligence in, in some sense, into a computer.
*  That's an interesting philosophical question.
*  And he wanted to make it more than philosophy.
*  He wanted to actually write down a logical formula
*  and algorithms that would do that.
*  And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do.
*  That's not what's happening in this era.
*  Right.
*  So the reason I keep saying AI actually,
*  and I'd love to hear what you think about it.
*  Machine learning has a very particular
*  set of methods and tools.
*  Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't.
*  No, it doesn't. Mine is very, very open.
*  It does optimization, it does sampling, it does.
*  So systems that learn is what machine learning is.
*  Systems that learn and make decisions.
*  And make decisions.
*  So it's not just pattern recognition
*  and finding patterns.
*  It's all about making decisions in real worlds
*  and having close feedback loops.
*  So something like symbolic AI, expert systems,
*  reasoning systems, knowledge-based representation,
*  all of those kinds of things, search.
*  Does that neighbor fit into
*  what you think of as machine learning?
*  So I don't even like the word machine learning.
*  I think that with the field you're talking about
*  is all about making large collections of decisions
*  under uncertainty by large collections of entities.
*  Yes. Right?
*  And there are principles for that, at that scale.
*  You don't have to say the principles
*  are for a single entity that's making decisions.
*  Single agent or single human.
*  It really immediately goes to the network of decisions.
*  Is a good word for that or not?
*  No, there's no good words for any of this.
*  That's kind of part of the problem.
*  So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that.
*  I just want to kind of raise the flag here
*  that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is
*  and real intelligence.
*  We don't know much about abstraction
*  and reasoning at the level of humans.
*  We don't have a clue.
*  We're not trying to build that
*  because we don't have a clue.
*  Eventually it may emerge.
*  I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs,
*  but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that.
*  It's not what's happening there right now.
*  We're taking data.
*  We're trying to make good decisions based on that.
*  We're trying to do it scale.
*  We're trying to do it economically viably.
*  We're trying to build markets.
*  We're trying to keep value at that scale.
*  And aspects of this will look intelligent.
*  Computers were so dumb before.
*  They will seem more intelligent.
*  We will use that buzzword of intelligence.
*  So we can use it in that sense.
*  But so machine learning, you can scope it narrowly
*  as just learning from data and pattern recognition.
*  But whatever, when I talk about these topics,
*  maybe data science is another word
*  you could throw in the mix.
*  It really is important that the decisions are as part of it.
*  It's consequential decisions in the real world.
*  Or am I gonna have a medical operation?
*  Am I gonna drive down this street?
*  Things that are scarcity.
*  Things that impact other human beings
*  or other environments and so on.
*  How do I do that based on data?
*  How do I do that adaptably?
*  How do I use computers to help those kind of things
*  go forward?
*  Whatever you wanna call that.
*  So let's call it AI.
*  Let's agree to call it AI.
*  But let's not say that what the goal of that is
*  is intelligence.
*  The goal of that is really good working systems
*  at planetary scale that we've never seen before.
*  So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth Conference
*  from many decades ago of the dream of human.
*  I don't wanna reclaim it.
*  I want a new word.
*  I think it was a bad choice.
*  I mean, if you read one of my little things,
*  the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name
*  because cybernetics already existed.
*  And he didn't like, you know,
*  no one really liked Norbert Wiener.
*  Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself.
*  And he felt that he had encompassed all this.
*  And in some sense he did.
*  You look at the language of cybernetics,
*  it was everything we're talking about.
*  It was control theory and signal processing
*  and some notions of intelligence
*  and close feedback loops and data.
*  It was all there.
*  It's just not a word that lived on partly
*  because of maybe the personalities.
*  But McCarthy needed a new word to say,
*  I'm different from you.
*  I'm not part of your show.
*  I got my own.
*  Invented this word.
*  And again, as a kind of thinking forward
*  about the movies that would be made about it,
*  it was a great choice.
*  But thinking forward about creating a sober academic
*  and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice
*  because it led to promises that are not true.
*  That we understand.
*  We understand artificial perhaps,
*  but we don't understand intelligence.
*  As a small tangent, because you're one
*  of the great personalities of machine learning,
*  whatever the heck you call the field,
*  the, do you think science progresses by personalities
*  or by the fundamental principles and theories
*  and research that's outside of personalities?
*  Both.
*  And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality.
*  I have mine and I have my preferences
*  and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me
*  and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree.
*  But all kinds of personalities are needed.
*  Right now, I think the personality
*  that it's a little too exuberant,
*  a little bit too ready to promise the moon
*  is a little bit too much in ascendance.
*  And I do think that there's some good to that.
*  It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field.
*  But a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions
*  and they have to then unlearn those
*  and then find something to do.
*  And so I think there's just gotta be some multiple voices
*  and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice.
*  So as a continuation of a fun tangent
*  and speaking of vibrant personalities,
*  what would you say is the most interesting disagreement
*  you have with Jan LeCun?
*  So Jan's an old friend and I just say that
*  I don't think we disagree about very much really.
*  He and I both kind of have a let's build that kind of
*  mentality and does it work kind of mentality
*  and kind of concrete.
*  We both speak French and we speak French more together
*  and we have a lot in common.
*  And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement,
*  it's not really a fundamental one.
*  I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing.
*  Jan has emphasized pattern recognition
*  and has emphasized prediction.
*  And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can.
*  If you could do perfect prediction,
*  what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment?
*  And I think that's way too limited.
*  We cannot do perfect prediction.
*  We will never have the data sets that allow me
*  to figure out what you're about ready to do,
*  what question you're gonna ask next.
*  I have no clue.
*  I will never know such things.
*  Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day
*  in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of
*  that are kind of very novel in various ways.
*  And in that moment, we want to think through what we want.
*  And also there's gonna be market forces acting on us.
*  I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full
*  because there's a crane in the street.
*  I gotta think about that.
*  I gotta think about what I might really want here.
*  And I gotta sort of think about how much it costs me
*  to do this action versus this action.
*  I gotta think about the risks involved.
*  A lot of our current pattern recognition
*  and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations.
*  They have no error bars, right?
*  I gotta think about other people's decisions around me.
*  I gotta think about a collection of my decisions.
*  Even just thinking about like a medical treatment.
*  I gotta take the prediction of a neural net
*  about my health, about something consequential.
*  Am I about ready to have a heart attack
*  because some number is over 0.7?
*  Even if you had all the data in the world
*  that's ever been collected about heart attacks
*  better than any doctor ever had,
*  I'm not gonna trust the output of that neural net
*  to predict my heart attack.
*  I'm gonna wanna ask what if questions around that.
*  I'm gonna wanna look at some us or other possible data
*  I didn't have, causal things.
*  I'm gonna wanna have a dialogue with a doctor
*  about things we didn't think about
*  when we gathered the data.
*  I could go on and on, I hope you can see.
*  And I think that if you say prediction is everything
*  that you're missing all of this stuff.
*  And so prediction plus decision making is everything,
*  but both of them are equally important.
*  And so the field has emphasized prediction.
*  Ayan, rightly so, has seen how powerful that is.
*  But at the cost of people not being aware
*  that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road
*  where human lives are at stake,
*  where risks are being taken,
*  where you gotta gather more data.
*  You gotta think about the error bars.
*  You gotta think about the consequences
*  of your decisions on others.
*  You gotta think about the economy around your decisions.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  I'm not the only one working on those,
*  but we're a smaller tribe.
*  And right now we're not the one
*  that people talk about the most.
*  But if you go out in the real world and industry,
*  at Amazon, I'd say half the people there
*  are working on decision making
*  and the other half are doing the pattern recognition.
*  It's important.
*  And the words of pattern recognition and prediction,
*  I think the distinction there, not to linger on words,
*  but the distinction there is more a constrained
*  in the lab data set versus decision making
*  is talking about consequential decisions in the real world
*  under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world.
*  And just the whole of it,
*  the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings
*  and scale, like you said, market forces,
*  that's the distinction.
*  Yeah, it helps add that perspective,
*  that broader perspective.
*  I mean, you're right.
*  I totally agree.
*  On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person,
*  of course you want it to be in the real world.
*  You wanna predict real world events.
*  I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets.
*  That it has to be in the context of strategic things
*  that someone's doing, data they might gather,
*  things they could have gathered,
*  the reasoning process around data.
*  It's not just taking data
*  and making predictions based on the data.
*  So one of the things that you're working on,
*  I'm sure there's others working on it,
*  but I don't hear often it talked about,
*  especially in the clarity that you talk about it.
*  And I think it's both the most exciting
*  and the most concerning area of AI
*  in terms of decision making.
*  So you've talked about AI systems
*  that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way,
*  millions, billions decisions,
*  and sort of markets of decisions.
*  Can you, as a starting point,
*  sort of give an example of a system that you think about
*  when you're thinking about these kinds of systems?
*  Yeah, so first of all,
*  you're absolutely getting into some territory,
*  which I will be beyond my expertise.
*  And there are lots of things
*  that are gonna be very not obvious to think about.
*  Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit,
*  but think about, put yourself back in the 60s.
*  There was kind of a banking system
*  that wasn't computerized really.
*  There was database theory emerging.
*  And database people had to think about,
*  how do I actually not just move data around,
*  but actual money and have it be valid
*  and have transactions that ATMs happen
*  that are actually all valid and so on and so forth.
*  So that's the kind of issues you get into
*  when you start to get serious about things like this.
*  I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment
*  to help me think something simpler,
*  which is the music market.
*  And, because there is, to first order,
*  there is no music market in the world right now,
*  in our country for sure.
*  There are something called, things called record companies,
*  and they make money,
*  and they prop up a few really good musicians
*  and make them superstars,
*  and they all make huge amounts of money.
*  But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people
*  that make lots and lots of really good music
*  that is actually listened to by more people
*  than the famous people.
*  They are not in a market, they cannot have a career.
*  They do not make money.
*  The creators, the creators.
*  The creators, the so-called influencers or whatever,
*  that diminishes who they are, right?
*  So there are people who make extremely good music,
*  especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days.
*  They do it on their laptop, that's what they do.
*  On the weekend, and they have another job during the week,
*  and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites.
*  Eventually it gets streamed, it now gets turned into bits.
*  It's not economically valuable.
*  The information is lost.
*  It gets put up there, people stream it.
*  You walk around in a big city,
*  you see people with headphones,
*  especially young kids listening to music all the time.
*  If you look at the data,
*  very little of the music they listen to
*  is the famous people's music, and none of it's old music.
*  It's all the latest stuff.
*  But the people who made that latest stuff
*  are like some 16 year old somewhere
*  who will never make a career out of this,
*  who will never make money.
*  Of course, there'll be a few counter examples.
*  The record companies incentivize to pick out a few
*  and highlight them.
*  Long story short, there's a missing market there.
*  Consumer producer relationship
*  at the level of the actual creative acts.
*  The pipelines and Spotify's of the world
*  that take this stuff and stream it along,
*  they make money off of subscriptions or advertising
*  and those things.
*  They're making the money, all right?
*  And then they will offer bits and pieces of it
*  to a few people, again, to highlight that,
*  you know, they simulate a market.
*  Anyway, a real market would be,
*  if you're a creator of music,
*  that you actually are somebody who's good enough
*  that people wanna listen to you,
*  you should have the data available to you.
*  There should be a dashboard
*  showing a map of the United States.
*  So in last week, here's all the places
*  your songs were listened to.
*  It should be transparent, vetable
*  so that if someone in down in Providence
*  sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times
*  in Providence, that they know that's real data,
*  you know it's real data,
*  they will have you come give a show down there.
*  They will broadcast to the people who've been listening
*  to you that you're coming.
*  If you do this right, you could, you know,
*  go down there and make $20,000.
*  You do that three times a year,
*  you start to have a career.
*  So in this sense, AI creates jobs.
*  It's not about taking away human jobs,
*  it's creating new jobs because it creates a new market.
*  Once you've created a market,
*  you've now connected up producers and consumers.
*  You know, the person who's making the music
*  can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot,
*  hey, I'll play your daughter's wedding for $10,000.
*  You'll say 8,000, they'll say 9,000.
*  Then you, again, you can now get an income up to $100,000.
*  You're not gonna be a millionaire, all right?
*  And now even think about really the value of music
*  is in these personal connections,
*  even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a t-shirt
*  with their favorite musician's signature on it, right?
*  So if they listen to the music on the internet,
*  the internet should be able to provide them
*  with a button that they push
*  and the merchandise arrives the next day.
*  We can do that, right?
*  And now why should we do that?
*  Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy,
*  but more the person who made the music will get the money.
*  There's no advertising needed, right?
*  So you could create markets between producers and consumers,
*  take 5% cut, your company will be perfectly sound,
*  it'll go forward into the future,
*  and it will create new markets,
*  and that raises human happiness.
*  Now, this seems like, well, this is easy,
*  just create this dashboard,
*  kind of create some connections and all that,
*  but if you think about Uber or whatever,
*  you think about the challenges in the real world
*  of doing things like this,
*  and there are actually new principles gonna be needed.
*  You're trying to create a new kind of two-way market
*  at a different scale that's ever been done before.
*  There's gonna be unwanted aspects of the market,
*  there'll be bad people,
*  there'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways,
*  it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver a value.
*  You have to think that through,
*  just like anyone who ran a big auction
*  or ran a big matching service in economics
*  will think these things through.
*  And so that maybe doesn't get it.
*  All the huge issues that can arise
*  when you start to create markets,
*  but it starts for at least for me, solidify my thoughts
*  and allow me to move forward in my own thinking.
*  Yeah, so I talked to, had a research at Spotify, actually,
*  and I think their long-term goal, they've said,
*  is to have at least one million creators
*  make a comfortable living putting on Spotify.
*  So, and I think you articulate a really nice vision
*  of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets.
*  What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube
*  or Netflix can do to create such markets?
*  Is it an AI problem?
*  Is it an interface problem?
*  So interface design, is it some other kind of,
*  is it an economics problem?
*  Who should they hire to solve these problems?
*  Well, part of it's not just top down.
*  So the Silicon Valley has this attitude
*  that they know how to do it.
*  They will create the system,
*  just like Google did with the search box,
*  that will be so good that they'll just,
*  everyone will adopt that, right?
*  It's not, it's everything you said,
*  but really, I think missing that kind of culture, all right?
*  So it's literally that 16 year old
*  who's able to create the songs.
*  You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity.
*  You don't hire them per se, right?
*  You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted
*  and that they're belong, right?
*  And so you have to have some cultural credibility
*  to do things like this.
*  Netflix, to their credit,
*  wanted some of that sort of credibility
*  and they created shows, content.
*  They call it content, it's such a terrible word,
*  but it's culture, right?
*  And so with movies, you can kind of go give
*  large sum of money to somebody
*  graduating from the USC film school.
*  It's a whole thing of its own,
*  but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do.
*  And American culture has not been so much
*  about rich white people.
*  It's been about all the immigrants,
*  all the Africans who came and brought that culture
*  and those rhythms to this world
*  and created this whole new thing, American culture.
*  And so companies can't artificially create that.
*  They can't just say, hey, we're here,
*  we're gonna buy it up.
*  You got a partner.
*  And so, but anyway, not to denigrate,
*  these companies are all trying and they should
*  and I'm sure they're asking these questions
*  and some of them are even making an effort,
*  but it is partly a respect the culture
*  as a technology person.
*  You gotta blend your technology with cultural meaning.
*  How much of a role do you think the algorithm,
*  so machine learning has in connecting the consumer
*  to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect
*  of this?
*  Yeah, it's a great question.
*  I think pretty high.
*  There's no magic in the algorithms,
*  but a good recommender system is way better
*  than a bad recommender system.
*  And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry
*  back even 10, 20 years ago.
*  And it continues to be extremely important going forward.
*  What's your favorite recommender system
*  just so we can put something?
*  Well, just historically, I was one of the,
*  I first went to Amazon.
*  I first didn't like Amazon
*  because they put the book people out of business
*  or the library, the local booksellers went out of business.
*  I've come to accept that there probably are more books
*  being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before
*  and then local books stores are coming back.
*  So that's how economics sometimes work.
*  You go up and you go down.
*  But anyway, when I finally started going there
*  and I bought a few books,
*  I was really pleased to see another few books
*  being recommended to me that I never would have thought of.
*  And I bought a bunch of them.
*  So they obviously had a good business model,
*  but I learned things and I still to this day
*  kind of browse using that service.
*  And I think lots of people get a lot,
*  you know, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system.
*  I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way.
*  And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose
*  what we learn.
*  It really is trying to find out what's in the data.
*  It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities,
*  but that's just the complexity of human life, like shirts.
*  You know, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts.
*  But that's interesting.
*  If you try to recommend restaurants,
*  it's hard.
*  It's hard to do it at scale.
*  But a blend of recommendation systems
*  with other economic ideas,
*  matchings and so on,
*  is really, really still very open research-wise
*  and there's new companies that are going to emerge
*  that do that well.
*  What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land
*  of say, politics and things like that,
*  that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with
*  in terms of recommendation systems?
*  Being able to suggest,
*  I think Facebook just launched Facebook News.
*  So they're having,
*  recommend the kind of news that are most likely
*  for you to be interesting.
*  You think this is AI-solvable,
*  again, whatever term one would use.
*  Do you think it's a solvable problem for machines
*  or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable?
*  So I don't even think about it at that level.
*  I think that what's broken with some of these companies,
*  it's all monetization by advertising.
*  They're not, at least Facebook,
*  I want to critique them,
*  but they didn't really try to connect a producer
*  and a consumer in an economic way.
*  No one wants to pay for anything.
*  And so they all, starting with Google, then Facebook,
*  they went back to the playbook
*  of the television companies back in the day.
*  No one wanted to pay for this signal.
*  They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal,
*  at least back in the day.
*  And so advertising kind of filled that gap
*  and advertising was new and interesting
*  and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right?
*  Fast forward, Google provides a service
*  that people don't want to pay for.
*  And so somewhat surprisingly in the 90s,
*  they made, ended up making huge amounts
*  so they cornered the advertising market.
*  It didn't seem like that was going to happen,
*  at least to me.
*  These little things on the right-hand side of the screen
*  just did not seem all that economically interesting,
*  but that companies had maybe no other choice.
*  The TV market was going away and billboards and so on.
*  So they got it.
*  And I think that sadly that Google just has,
*  it was doing so well with that and making such,
*  they didn't think much more about how,
*  wait a minute, is there a producer-consumer relationship
*  to be set up here?
*  Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created.
*  Is there an actual market between the producer and consumer?
*  They're the producers, the person who created
*  that video clip, the person that made that website,
*  the person who could make more such things,
*  the person who could adjust it as a function of demand,
*  the person on the other side who's asking
*  for different kinds of things.
*  So you see glimmers of that now.
*  There's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering
*  of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago.
*  It should have been thought about.
*  It should have been created in parallel
*  with the advertising ecosystem.
*  And then Facebook inherited that,
*  and I think they also didn't think very much about that.
*  So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts
*  of money off of advertising,
*  and the news thing and all these clicks
*  is just feeding the advertising.
*  It's all connected up to the advertising.
*  So you want more people to click on certain things
*  because that money flows to you, Facebook.
*  You're very much incentivized to do that.
*  And when you start to find it's breaking,
*  so people are telling you, well,
*  we're getting into some troubles.
*  You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right?
*  And figure out what are bad clicks.
*  So maybe shouldn't be click-through rated.
*  I find that pretty much hopeless.
*  It does get into all the complexity of human life,
*  and you can try to fix it, you should,
*  but you could also fix the whole business model.
*  And the other thing is that really,
*  are there some human producers and consumers out there?
*  Is there some economic value to be liberated
*  by connecting them directly?
*  Is it such that it's so valuable
*  that people will be willing to pay for it?
*  All right?
*  And when they-
*  Micro payments, like small payments.
*  Micro, but even after you micro.
*  So I like the example.
*  Suppose next week I'm going to India.
*  Never been to India before, right?
*  I have a couple of days in Mumbai.
*  I have no idea what to do there, right?
*  And I could go on the web right now and search.
*  It's gonna be kind of hopeless.
*  I'm not gonna find.
*  I'll have lots of advertisers in my face, right?
*  What I really wanna do is broadcast to the world
*  that I am going to Mumbai
*  and have someone on the other side of a market look at me.
*  And there's a recommendation system there.
*  So they're not looking at all possible people
*  coming to Mumbai.
*  They're looking at the people who are relevant to them.
*  So someone in my age group,
*  someone who kind of knows me at some level.
*  I give up a little privacy by that,
*  but I'm happy because what I'm gonna get back
*  is this person can make a little video for me,
*  or they're gonna write a little two page paper
*  on here's the cool things that you want to do
*  in Mumbai this week, especially, right?
*  I'm gonna look at that.
*  I'm not gonna pay a micro payment.
*  I'm gonna pay $100 or whatever for that.
*  It's real value.
*  It's like journalism.
*  And as an odd subscription,
*  it's that I'm gonna pay that person in that moment.
*  Company is gonna take 5% of that.
*  And that person has now got it.
*  It's a gig economy, if you will,
*  but done for thinking about a little bit.
*  Behind YouTube, there was actually people
*  who could make more of those things.
*  If they were connected to a market,
*  they would make more of those things independently.
*  You don't have to tell them what to do.
*  You don't have to incentivize them.
*  Any other way.
*  And so, yeah, these companies,
*  I don't think I've thought long and hard about that.
*  So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side,
*  who just not thought about these things at all.
*  I think thinking that AI will fix everything.
*  And Amazon thinks about them all the time
*  because they were already out in the real world.
*  They were delivering packages to people's doors.
*  They were worried about a market.
*  They were worried about sellers.
*  And they worry and some things they do are great.
*  Some things maybe not so great,
*  but they're in that business model.
*  And then I'd say Google sort of hover somewhere in between.
*  I don't think for a long, long time,
*  they got it.
*  I think they probably see that YouTube
*  is more pregnant with possibility
*  than they might have thought.
*  And that they're probably heading that direction.
*  But Silicon Valley's been dominated
*  by the Google Facebook kind of mentality
*  and the subscription and advertising.
*  And that's the core problem, right?
*  The fake news actually rides on top of that
*  because it means that you're monetizing
*  with clip through rate.
*  And that is the core problem.
*  You gotta remove that.
*  So advertisement, if we're gonna linger on that,
*  I mean, that's an interesting thesis.
*  I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that.
*  So you're right.
*  The thought is the advertisement model
*  is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have.
*  So we have to fix, we have to build algorithms
*  that despite that business model,
*  find the better angels of our nature
*  and do good by society and by the individual.
*  But you think we can slowly,
*  you think, first of all,
*  there's a difference between should and could.
*  So you're saying we should slowly move away
*  from the advertising model and have a direct connection
*  between the consumer and the creator.
*  The question I also have is can we?
*  Because the advertising model is so successful now
*  in terms of just making a huge amount of money
*  and therefore being able to build a big company
*  that provides, has really smart people working
*  that create a good service.
*  So you think it's possible?
*  And just to clarify, you think we should move away?
*  Well, I think we should, yeah.
*  But we is the, you know, me.
*  Society.
*  Yeah, well, the companies.
*  I mean, so first of all, full disclosure,
*  I'm doing a day a week at Amazon
*  because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things.
*  So I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way,
*  but I did go there because I actually believe
*  they get a little bit of this
*  or trying to create these markets.
*  And they don't really use,
*  advertisement is not a crucial part of it.
*  That's a good question.
*  So it has become not crucial,
*  but it's more present if you go to Amazon website
*  and without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon,
*  I can tell you that a lot of people in the company
*  question this and there's a huge questioning going on.
*  You do not want a world where there's zero advertising.
*  That actually is a bad world, okay?
*  So here's a way to think about it.
*  You're a company that like Amazon
*  is trying to bring products to customers, right?
*  And the customer, at any given moment,
*  you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say.
*  You want to know what's available for me.
*  And it's not going to be that obvious.
*  You have to do a little bit of work at it.
*  The recommendation system will sort of help, right?
*  But now suppose this other person over here
*  has just made the world,
*  they spent a huge amount of energy.
*  They had a great idea.
*  They made a great vacuum cleaner.
*  They know, they really did it.
*  They nailed it.
*  It's an MIT, you know, Wizz kid
*  that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right?
*  It's not going to be in the recommendation system.
*  No one will know about it.
*  The algorithms will not find it
*  and AI will not fix that, okay, at all, right?
*  How do you allow that vacuum cleaner
*  to start to get in front of people, be sold?
*  Well, advertising.
*  And here what advertising is,
*  is a signal that you believe in your product enough
*  that you're willing to pay some real money for it.
*  And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal and I say,
*  well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads
*  because we have now right now.
*  I know that these are super cheap, pennies.
*  If I see an ad where it's actually,
*  I know the company is only doing a few of these
*  and they're making real money is kind of flowing.
*  And I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it.
*  And I actually might want that
*  because I see, hey, that guy spent money
*  on his vacuum cleaner.
*  Oh, maybe there's something good there.
*  So I will look at it.
*  And so that's part of the overall information flow
*  in a good market.
*  So advertising has a role.
*  But the problem is of course,
*  that signal is now completely gone
*  because it just, you know, dominated by these tiny
*  little things that add up to big money for the company.
*  You know, so I think it will just,
*  I think it will change because societies just don't,
*  you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people.
*  Oh, and advertising currently annoys people
*  more than it provides information.
*  And I think that Google probably is smart enough
*  to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model,
*  even though it's a hard, huge amount of money
*  and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it
*  slowly.
*  And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out,
*  but they need to do it.
*  And they needed it to,
*  so if you reduce advertising, not to zero,
*  but you reduce it at the same time,
*  you bring up producer, consumer,
*  actual real value being delivered.
*  So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut,
*  that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out
*  the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind
*  of advertising.
*  And I think that a good company will do that,
*  will realize that.
*  And there are, you know, Facebook, you know, again,
*  God bless them.
*  They bring, you know, grandmothers, you know,
*  they bring children's pictures into grandmothers' lives.
*  It's fantastic.
*  But they need to think of a new business model.
*  And that's the core problem there.
*  Until they start to connect producer, consumer,
*  I think they will just continue to make money
*  and then buy the next social network company
*  and then buy the next one.
*  And the innovation level will not be high
*  and the health issues will not go away.
*  So I apologize that we kind of returned to words.
*  I don't think the exact terms matter,
*  but in sort of defense of advertisement,
*  don't you think the kind of direct connection
*  between consumer and creator, producer,
*  is the best, like the,
*  is what advertisement strives to do, right?
*  So that is the best advertisement.
*  It's literally now, Facebook is listening
*  to our conversation and heard that you're going to India
*  and will be able to actually start automatically
*  for you making these connections
*  and start giving this offer.
*  So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms,
*  but just to draw a distinction,
*  is it possible to make advertisements just better
*  and better and better algorithmically
*  to where it actually becomes a connection?
*  Almost a direct connection.
*  That's a good question.
*  So let's put on that foot push line.
*  First of all, what we just talked about,
*  I was defending advertising, okay?
*  So I was defending it as a way to get signals
*  into a market that don't come any other way,
*  especially algorithmically.
*  It's a sign that someone spent money on it.
*  It's a sign they think it's valuable.
*  And if I think that if other thinks,
*  someone else thinks it's valuable,
*  then if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen.
*  I don't trust that Facebook though,
*  who's an intermediary between this.
*  I don't think they care about me, okay?
*  I don't think they do.
*  And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India
*  next week because of our conversation.
*  Why do you think that?
*  So what, could you just put your PR hat on?
*  Why do you think you find Facebook creepy
*  and not trust them as do majority of the population?
*  So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies
*  I saw like, not approval rate,
*  but there's ranking of how much people trust companies
*  and Facebook is in the gutter.
*  In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook.
*  So what do you attribute that to?
*  Because when I-
*  Come on, you don't find it creepy
*  that right now we're talking that I might walk out
*  on the street right now that some unknown person
*  who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says,
*  I hear you going to India.
*  I mean, that's not even Facebook.
*  That's just, I want transparency in human society.
*  I want to have, if you know something about me,
*  there's actually some reason you know something about me.
*  That's something that if I look at it later
*  and audit it kind of, I approve.
*  You know something about me because you care in some way.
*  There's a caring relationship even,
*  or an economic one or something.
*  Not just that you're someone who could exploit it
*  in ways I don't know about or care about
*  or I'm troubled by or whatever.
*  And we're in a world right now
*  where that happens way too much.
*  And that Facebook knows things about a lot of people
*  and could exploit it and does exploit it at times.
*  I think most people do find that creepy.
*  It's not for them.
*  It's not that Facebook does not do it
*  because they care about them in any real sense.
*  And they shouldn't.
*  They should not be a big brother caring about us.
*  That is not the role of a company like that.
*  Why not?
*  Not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting.
*  I mean, don't those companies, just to linger on it
*  because a lot of companies have a lot of information
*  about us, I would argue that there's companies
*  like Microsoft that has more information about us
*  than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more.
*  Well, Microsoft is pivoting.
*  Microsoft under such an adult has decided
*  this is really important.
*  We don't wanna do creepy things.
*  Really want people to trust us to actually only use
*  information in ways that they really would approve of
*  that we don't decide, right?
*  And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market
*  is that when I connect to someone who produced or consumer,
*  it's not just a random producer or consumer.
*  It's people who see each other.
*  They don't like each other, but they sense that
*  if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides.
*  If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose
*  of my choosing, then fine.
*  So, and also think about the difference between
*  browsing versus buying, right?
*  There are moments in my life, I just wanna buy a gadget
*  or something, I need something for that moment.
*  I need some ammonia for my house or something
*  because I got a problem with a spill.
*  I wanna just go in.
*  I don't wanna be advertised at that moment.
*  I don't wanna be led down various, that's annoying.
*  I want to just go and have it be extremely easy
*  to do what I want.
*  Other moments I might say, no, it's like today
*  I'm going to the shopping mall.
*  I wanna walk around and see things and see people
*  and be exposed to stuff.
*  So I want control over that though.
*  I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me.
*  Right, and I think that's the thing.
*  It's a total loss of control.
*  If Facebook thinks they should take the control from us
*  of deciding when we want to have certain kinds
*  of information, when we don't, what information that is,
*  how much it relates to what they know about us
*  that we didn't really want them to know about us.
*  They're not, I don't want them to be helping me
*  in that way.
*  I don't want them to be helping them,
*  but they decide, they have control over what I want and when.
*  I totally agree.
*  So Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing
*  where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information
*  about us that could create a beautiful thing.
*  So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do.
*  It's not what it's doing, but what it could do.
*  I don't see that.
*  I think that optimism is misplaced
*  because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model
*  behind these things.
*  Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be clear.
*  It's about something that people would value.
*  And I don't think they have that business model.
*  And I don't think they will suddenly discover it
*  by what you know, a long hot shower.
*  I disagree.
*  I disagree in terms of,
*  you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower.
*  So.
*  I didn't say that.
*  I said they won't come.
*  They won't.
*  They won't do it.
*  But in the shower, I think a lot of other people
*  will discover it.
*  I think that this, so I should also, full disclosure,
*  I think that there's a company called United Masters,
*  which I'm on their board.
*  And they've created this music market.
*  They have a hundred thousand artists now signed on.
*  And they've done things like gone to the NBA.
*  And the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now
*  is their music.
*  That's a company that had the right business model in mind
*  from the get-go, right?
*  Executed on that.
*  And from day one, there was value brought to,
*  so here you have a kid who made some songs
*  who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right?
*  And so, you know.
*  And so, you know.
*  And so, you know.
*  So you and I differ on the optimism of being able to
*  sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right?
*  So I.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm older than you.
*  So I think the Titanic's crash.
*  Got it.
*  But just to elaborate, because I totally agree with you.
*  And I just want to know how difficult you think
*  this problem is of, so for example,
*  I want to read some news.
*  There's a lot of times in the day where something
*  makes me either smile or think in a way
*  where I consciously think this really gave me value.
*  Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcast
*  in the New York Times.
*  Way better than the New York Times themselves, by the way,
*  for people listening.
*  That's like real journalism is happening for some reason
*  in the podcast space.
*  It doesn't make sense to me.
*  But often I listen to it 20 minutes.
*  And I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10,
*  for that experience.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at
*  is that little transaction.
*  How difficult is it to create a frictionless system
*  like Uber has, for example, for other things?
*  What's your intuition there?
*  So first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know,
*  to send, there's something called Quartz
*  that does financial things.
*  I like Medium as a site.
*  I don't pay there, but I would.
*  You had a great post on Medium.
*  I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others.
*  But I wouldn't have wanted it per se
*  because there should be also sites
*  where that's not actually the goal.
*  The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel
*  that I monetize in some other way if I chose to.
*  I mean, I could now.
*  People know about it.
*  I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me.
*  Also, the musicians who are making all this music,
*  I don't think the right model is that you pay
*  a little subscription fee to them, all right?
*  Because people can copy the bits too easily.
*  And it's just not that, it's not what the value is.
*  The value is that a connection was made
*  between real human beings.
*  And then you can follow up on that, all right?
*  And create yet more value.
*  So no, I think...
*  So there's a lot of open questions here.
*  A lot of open questions, but also, yeah,
*  I do want good recommendation systems
*  that recommend cool stuff to me, but it's pretty hard, right?
*  I don't like them to recommend stuff
*  just based on my browsing history.
*  I don't like them to base on stuff
*  they know about me, quote unquote.
*  What's unknown about me is the most interesting.
*  So this is the really interesting question.
*  We may disagree, maybe not.
*  That I love recommender systems
*  and I wanna give them everything about me
*  in a way that I trust.
*  Yeah, but you don't.
*  Because so for example, this morning I clicked on,
*  I was pretty sleepy this morning.
*  I clicked on a story about the Queen of England, right?
*  I do not give a damn about the Queen of England.
*  I really do not.
*  But it was click-bait.
*  It kinda looked funny.
*  And I had to say, what the heck are they talking about?
*  I don't wanna have my life heading that direction.
*  Now that's in my browsing history.
*  The system and any reasonable system will think
*  that I care about my Queen of England.
*  That's browsing history.
*  Right, but you're saying all the trace,
*  all the digital exhaust or whatever,
*  that's been kind of the models.
*  If you collect all this stuff,
*  you're gonna figure all of us out.
*  Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person,
*  like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out.
*  But if you're trying to figure out 500 million people,
*  no way, no way.
*  You think so?
*  No, I think so.
*  I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich
*  and complicated.
*  Every one of us has our little quirks.
*  Every one of us has our little things
*  that could intrigue us that we don't even know
*  and will intrigue us.
*  And there's no sign of it in our past,
*  but by God, there it comes.
*  And you fall in love with it.
*  And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me
*  and anticipate that.
*  I want them to provide a forum, a market,
*  a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook,
*  this happens.
*  I'm walking down the street
*  and I hear some Chilean music being played.
*  And I never knew I liked Chilean music.
*  Wow, so there is that side.
*  And I want them to provide a limited,
*  but interesting place to go.
*  And so don't try to use your AI to kind of figure me out
*  and then put me in a world where you figured me out.
*  No, create huge spaces for human beings
*  where our creativity and our style will be enriched
*  and come forward.
*  And it'll be a lot of more transparency.
*  I won't have people randomly, anonymously,
*  putting comments up.
*  And I'll special based on stuff they know about me,
*  facts that we are so broken right now,
*  especially if you're a celebrity.
*  And I don't want anybody that,
*  anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people
*  right now.
*  And that's part of this thing that Silicon Valley
*  is thinking that, you know,
*  just collect all this information and use it in a great way.
*  So no, I'm not a pessimist.
*  I'm very much an optimist by nature,
*  but I think that's just been the wrong path
*  for the whole technology to take.
*  Be more limited, create, let humans rise up.
*  Don't try to replace them.
*  That's the AI mantra.
*  Don't try to anticipate them.
*  Don't try to predict them.
*  Because you're not gonna be able to do those things.
*  You're gonna make things worse.
*  Okay, so right now, just give this a chance.
*  Right now, the recommender systems
*  are the creepy people in the shadow
*  watching your every move.
*  So they're looking at traces of you.
*  They're not directly interacting with you.
*  Sort of your close friends and family,
*  the way they know you is by having conversation,
*  by actually having interactions back and forth.
*  Do you think there's a place for recommender systems
*  sort of to step, because you just emphasized
*  the value of human to human connection.
*  But just give it a chance, AI, human connection.
*  Is there a role for an AI system
*  to have conversations with you in terms of,
*  to try to figure out what kind of music you like,
*  not by just watching what you listen to,
*  but actually having a conversation,
*  natural language or otherwise?
*  Yeah, no, so I'm not against it.
*  I just wanted to push back against the,
*  maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook.
*  So there, I think it's misplaced.
*  I think that distributing-
*  I'm the one guy defending Facebook.
*  Yeah, no, so good for you.
*  Go for it.
*  That's a hard spot to be.
*  Yeah, no, good.
*  Human interaction, like on our daily,
*  the context around me in my own home
*  is something that I don't want some big company
*  to know about at all.
*  But I would be more than happy
*  to have technology help me with it.
*  Which kind of technology?
*  Well, you know, just-
*  Alexa, Amazon.
*  Well, a good, Alexa's done right.
*  I think Alexa's a research platform right now
*  more than anything else.
*  But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like,
*  I leave the water running in my garden
*  and I say, hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden.
*  And even have Alexa figure out that that means
*  when my wife comes home that she should be told about that.
*  That's a little bit of a reasoning.
*  I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch,
*  it's a little bit of reasoning.
*  And it actually kind of would make my life
*  a little easier and better.
*  And, you know, I wouldn't call this a wow moment,
*  but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up
*  to have that kind of thing.
*  But not when you're lonely.
*  Alexa knowing loneliness-
*  No, no, I don't want Alexa to be feeling intrusive
*  and I don't want just the designer of the system
*  to kind of work all this out.
*  I really want to have a lot of control
*  and I want transparency and control.
*  And if a company can stand up and give me that
*  in the context of new technology,
*  I think they're gonna, first of all,
*  be way more successful than our current generation.
*  And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft,
*  I really think they're pivoting
*  to kind of be the trusted old uncle.
*  But, you know, I think that they get
*  that this is a way to go.
*  That if you let people find technology empowers them
*  to have more control and have control,
*  not just over privacy,
*  but over this rich set of interactions,
*  that people are gonna like that a lot more.
*  And that's the right business model going forward.
*  What does control over privacy look like?
*  Do you think you should be able to just view all the data?
*  No, it's much more than that.
*  I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision.
*  Some people don't want privacy.
*  They want their whole life out there.
*  Other people's want it.
*  Privacy is not a zero one.
*  It's not a legal thing.
*  It's not just about which data is available
*  and which is not.
*  I like to recall to people that, you know,
*  a couple hundred years ago,
*  there was not really big cities.
*  Everyone lived in the countryside and villages.
*  And in villages, everybody knew everything about you.
*  You didn't have any privacy.
*  Is that bad?
*  Are we better off now?
*  Well, you know, arguably no,
*  because what did you get for that loss
*  of certain kinds of privacy?
*  Well, people helped each other.
*  Because they know everything about you.
*  They know something bad's happening.
*  They will help you with that, right?
*  And now you live in a big city, no one knows the amount.
*  You get no help.
*  So it kind of depends, the answer.
*  I want certain people who I trust
*  and there should be relationships.
*  I should kind of manage all those.
*  But who knows what about me?
*  I should have some agency there.
*  I shouldn't just be adrift in a sea of technology
*  where I have no agency.
*  I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes.
*  So I don't know how to do this.
*  I'm not a privacy researcher per se.
*  I recognize the vast complexity of this.
*  It's not just technology.
*  It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists.
*  There's got to be kind of whole layers around it.
*  And so when I alluded to this emerging engineering field,
*  this is a big part of it.
*  When electrical engineering came,
*  I wasn't around at the time,
*  but you just didn't plug electricity into walls
*  and all kind of worked.
*  I had to have like underwriter's laboratory
*  that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn
*  up your house and that that machine will do this and that
*  and everything.
*  There'll be whole people who can install things.
*  There'll be people who can watch the installers.
*  There'll be a whole layers,
*  whole onion of these kinds of things.
*  And for things as deep and interesting as privacy,
*  which is as least as interesting as electricity,
*  that's going to take decades to kind of work out,
*  but it's going to require a lot of new structures
*  that we don't have right now.
*  So it's kind of hard to talk about it.
*  And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made
*  if you get it right.
*  So a lot of money to be made.
*  And all these things that provide human services
*  and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives.
*  So yeah, the dialect sometimes goes
*  from the exuberant technologists to the no technology
*  is good kind of.
*  And that's in our public discourse,
*  and in this verse you see too much of this kind of thing.
*  And the sober discussions in the middle,
*  which are the challenging ones to have
*  or where we need to be having our conversations.
*  And actually there's not many forum for those.
*  That's kind of what I would look for.
*  Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section
*  of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue
*  going back and forth.
*  You don't see much of this, right?
*  Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts
*  out of all because people are really hungry
*  for conversation.
*  But there's technology is not helping much.
*  So comment sections of anything including YouTube
*  is not hurting and not helping.
*  And you think technically speaking it's possible to help.
*  I don't know the answers, but it's a less anonymity,
*  a little more locality, you know,
*  and you kind of enter in and you trust the people
*  there in those worlds so that when you start
*  having a discussion, you know,
*  not only is that people not gonna hurt you,
*  but it's not gonna be a total waste of your time
*  because there's a lot of wasting of time that,
*  you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on
*  because it was clearly gonna waste a lot of my time,
*  even though there was some value.
*  And so yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in
*  and you know what you're getting
*  and it's kind of appeals to you.
*  New things might happen,
*  but you kind of have some trust in that world.
*  And there's some deep, interesting, complex
*  psychological aspects around anonymity,
*  how that changes human behavior that's quite dark.
*  Quite dark, yeah.
*  I think a lot of us are, especially those of us
*  who really love the advent of technology.
*  I loved social networks when they came out.
*  I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all.
*  But then I started seeing comment sections,
*  I think it was maybe, you know,
*  one of the CNN or something.
*  And I started to go, wow, this darkness,
*  I just did not know about.
*  And our technology is now amplifying it.
*  Sorry for the big philosophical question,
*  but on that topic, do you think human beings,
*  because you've also, out of all things,
*  had a foot in psychology too,
*  do you think human beings are fundamentally good?
*  Like all of us have good intent that could be mined
*  or is it depending on context and environment,
*  everybody could be evil?
*  So my answer is fundamentally good,
*  but fundamentally limited.
*  All of us have very blinkers on.
*  We don't see the other person's pain that easily.
*  We don't see the other person's point of view that easily.
*  We're very much in our own head, in our own world.
*  And on my good days, I think that technology
*  could open us up to more perspectives
*  and more less blinkered and more understanding.
*  You know, a lot of wars in human history happened
*  because of just ignorance.
*  They didn't, they thought the other person was doing this,
*  well, the other person wasn't doing this,
*  and we have huge amounts of that.
*  But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology
*  really help in that way yet.
*  And I do believe in that.
*  No, I think fundamentally humans are good.
*  People suffer, people have grievances,
*  people have grudges, and those things cause them
*  to do things they probably wouldn't want.
*  They regret it often.
*  So no, I think it's a, you know,
*  part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it
*  to be a little easier to be the real good person
*  you actually are.
*  Well put.
*  Do you think individual human life or society
*  could be modeled as an optimization problem?
*  Not the way I think, typically.
*  I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most
*  complex phenomena in the whole, you know, in all of the
*  universe.
*  Which, individual human life or society as a whole?
*  Both, both.
*  I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex.
*  And so, you know, optimization is kind of just one
*  branch of mathematics that talks about certain kind
*  of things, and it just feels way too limited
*  for the complexity of such things.
*  What properties of optimization problems,
*  do you think most interesting problems
*  that could be solved through optimization?
*  What kind of properties does that surface have?
*  Non-convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds
*  of things, saddle points.
*  Well so optimization is just one piece of mathematics.
*  You know, there's like, even in our era we're aware
*  that say sampling is coming up examples of something.
*  Coming up with a distribution.
*  What's optimization, what's sampling?
*  Well, you can, if you're a kind of, a certain kind
*  of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them
*  seem to be sort of the same thing.
*  But optimization is roughly speaking trying to find a point
*  that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion
*  function of some kind.
*  And sampling is trying to, from that same surface,
*  treat that as a distribution or density and find points
*  that have high density.
*  So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm,
*  and I want the, you know, the single point that's the best
*  point in the optimization paradigm.
*  Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability
*  measures, the output of that could be a whole probability
*  distribution, so you can start to make these things
*  the same, but in mathematics if you go too high up that kind
*  of abstraction arc, you start to lose the, you know,
*  the ability to do the interesting theorems,
*  so you kind of don't try to, you don't try to overly,
*  over abstract.
*  So as a small tangent, what kind of world view do you find
*  more appealing, one that is deterministic or stochastic?
*  Well that's easy, I mean I'm a statistician, you know,
*  the world is highly stochastic, I don't know what's gonna
*  happen in the next five minutes, right?
*  What you're gonna ask, what we're gonna do,
*  what I'll say.
*  Due to the uncertainty.
*  Due to the.
*  Massive uncertainty, you know, massive uncertainty.
*  And so the best I can do is have come rough sense
*  or probability distribution on things and somehow use that
*  in my reasoning about what to do now.
*  So how does the distributed at scale when you have
*  multi-agent systems look like, so optimization can optimize
*  sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of, at least
*  from my robotics perspective, for a single robot,
*  for a single agent trying to optimize some objective
*  function, when you start to enter the real world,
*  this game theoretic concept starts popping up.
*  That, how do you see optimization in this,
*  because you've talked about markets in a scale,
*  what does that look like?
*  Do you see it as optimization?
*  Do you see it as sampling?
*  Do you see, like how should you.
*  These all blend together and a system designer thinking
*  about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend
*  of all these things.
*  So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing
*  a functional called a Lagrangian, right?
*  The particle doesn't know that.
*  There's no algorithm running that does that.
*  It just happens.
*  It's a description mathematically of something that helps
*  us understand as analysts what's happening, right?
*  And so the same will happen when we talk about, you know,
*  mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on
*  and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us
*  to understand what's happening and whether or not the actual
*  algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear.
*  Now, at some point I may have set up a multi-agent
*  or market kind of system and I'm now thinking about
*  an individual agent in that system and they're asked
*  to do some task and they're incentivized in some way.
*  They get certain signals and they have some utility.
*  Maybe what they will do at that point is they just won't
*  know the answer.
*  They may have to optimize to find an answer.
*  Okay, so an outage could be embedded inside
*  of an overall market.
*  You know, and game theory is very, very broad.
*  It is often studied very narrowly
*  for certain kinds of problems, but it's roughly speaking
*  that it's just the, I don't know what you're gonna do
*  so I kind of anticipate that a little bit
*  and you anticipate what I'm anticipating
*  and we kind of go back and forth in our own minds.
*  We run kind of thought experiments.
*  You've talked about this interesting point
*  in terms of game theory.
*  You know, most optimization problems
*  really hate saddle points.
*  Maybe you can describe what saddle points are,
*  but I've heard you kind of mention that there's a branch
*  of optimization that you could try to explicitly look
*  for saddle points as a good thing.
*  Oh, not optimization, that's just game theory.
*  That's so, there's all kinds of different equilibrium
*  game theory and some of them are highly explanatory
*  behavior, they're not attempting to be algorithmic.
*  They're just trying to say, if you happen to be
*  at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior
*  and we see that in real life.
*  That's what an economist wants to do,
*  especially a behavioral economist.
*  In continuous differential game theory,
*  you're in continuous spaces, some of the simplest
*  equilibria are saddle points.
*  A Nash equilibrium is a saddle point.
*  It's a special kind of saddle point.
*  So classically in game theory, you are trying
*  to find Nash equilibrium and algorithmic game theory,
*  you're trying to find algorithms that would find them.
*  So you're trying to find saddle points.
*  So that's literally what you're trying to do.
*  But any economist knows that Nash equilibria
*  have their limitations.
*  They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations.
*  They're not what you really want.
*  There's other kind of equilibria and there's names
*  associated with these because they came from history
*  with certain people working on them,
*  but there will be new ones emerging.
*  So one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium.
*  So Nash, you and I are both playing this game
*  against each other or for each other.
*  Maybe it's cooperative and we're both gonna think it through
*  then we're gonna decide and we're gonna do our thing
*  simultaneously.
*  In a Stackelberg, no, I'm gonna be the first mover.
*  I'm gonna make a move, you're gonna look at my move
*  and then you're gonna make yours.
*  Now, since I know you're gonna look at my move,
*  I anticipate what you're gonna do
*  and so I don't do something stupid.
*  But then I know that you are also anticipating me
*  so we're kind of going back in some form of mind,
*  but there is then a first mover thing.
*  And so there's a different equilibria.
*  And so just mathematically, yeah,
*  these things have certain topologies, certain shapes
*  that are like salivary, algorithmically or dynamically,
*  how do you move towards them?
*  How do you move away from things?
*  So some of these questions have answers,
*  they've been studied, others do not,
*  and especially if it becomes stochastic,
*  especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things,
*  there's just young people getting in this field
*  who kind of think it's all done
*  because we have TensorFlow.
*  Well, no, these are all open problems
*  and they're really important and interesting
*  and it's about strategic settings.
*  How do I collect data?
*  Suppose I don't know what you're gonna do
*  because I don't know you very well, right?
*  Well, I gotta collect data about you
*  so maybe I wanna push you in a part of the space
*  where I don't know much about you so I can get data
*  and then later I'll realize that you'll never go there
*  because of the way the game is set up.
*  But that's part of the overall data analysis context.
*  Yeah, even the game of poker is fascinating space.
*  Whenever there's any uncertainty or lack of information,
*  it's a super exciting space.
*  Yeah.
*  Just linger on optimization for a second.
*  So when we look at deep learning,
*  it's essentially minimization
*  of a complicated loss function.
*  So is there something insightful or hopeful
*  that you see in the kinds of function surface
*  that loss functions,
*  that deep learning in the real world
*  is trying to optimize over?
*  Is there something interesting?
*  Is it just the usual kind of problems of optimization?
*  I think from an optimization point of view,
*  that surface first of all, it's pretty smooth.
*  And secondly, if it's over parameterized,
*  there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable optima.
*  And so kind of the getting downhill to an optimum
*  is viewed as not as hard as you might have expected
*  in high dimensions.
*  The fact that some optima tend to be really good ones
*  and others not so good and you tend to,
*  sometimes you find the good ones
*  is sort of still needs explanation.
*  Yes, that's a total mystery.
*  But the particular surface is coming
*  from the particular generation of neural nets,
*  I kind of suspect those will change.
*  In 10 years, it will not be exactly those surfaces,
*  there'll be some others that are,
*  and optimization theory will help contribute
*  to why other surfaces or why other algorithms.
*  Layers of arithmetic operations
*  with a little bit of non-linearity,
*  that didn't come from neuroscience personally.
*  I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people
*  working on it, they were thinking even about brains,
*  but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields,
*  computer science control theory and so on.
*  And that layers of these could transform things
*  in certain ways and that if it's smooth,
*  maybe you could find parameter values.
*  It's a big discovery that it's able to work at this scale.
*  But I don't think that we're stuck with that
*  and we're certainly not stuck with that
*  because we're understanding the brain.
*  So in terms of on the algorithm side,
*  sort of gradient descent,
*  do you think we're stuck with gradient descent
*  as variants of it?
*  What variants do you find interesting
*  or do you think there'll be something else invented
*  that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces
*  in more interesting ways?
*  So there's a co-design of the surface
*  and there are the architecture and the algorithm.
*  So if you just ask, if we stay with the kind
*  of architectures that we have now, not just neural nets,
*  but phase retrieval architectures
*  or matrix completion architectures and so on.
*  I think we've kind of come to a place where,
*  yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant
*  and there are versions that are a little better than others.
*  They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on.
*  And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out
*  which is the best time for which situation.
*  But I think that that'll start to co-evolve,
*  that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture.
*  And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way.
*  We should do it in a different way
*  because there's other algorithms now available
*  if you do it in a different way.
*  So that I can't really anticipate that co-evolution process.
*  But gradients are amazing mathematical objects.
*  They have a lot of people who start to study them
*  more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked
*  about what they are and what they can do.
*  I mean, think about it this way.
*  Suppose that I tell you, if you move along the x-axis,
*  you get, you go uphill in some objective by three units.
*  Whereas if you move along the y-axis,
*  you go uphill by seven units.
*  Now I'm gonna only allow you to move a certain unit distance.
*  What are you gonna do?
*  Well, most people will say, I'm gonna go along the y-axis.
*  I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck.
*  And my buck is only one unit.
*  So I'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis.
*  And why should I even take any of my strength,
*  my step size and put any of it in the x-axis
*  because I'm getting less bang for my buck.
*  That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong
*  because the gradient direction is not to go along the y-axis.
*  It's to take a little bit of the x-axis.
*  And to understand that, you have to know some math.
*  And so even a trivial so-called operator-like gradient
*  is not trivial and so exploiting its properties
*  is still very, very important.
*  Now we know that just pervading descent
*  has got all kinds of problems.
*  It gets stuck in many ways and it had never,
*  good dimension dependence and so on.
*  So my own line of work recently has been about
*  what kinds of stochasticity,
*  how can we get dimension dependence,
*  how can we do the theory of that.
*  And we've come up pretty favorable results
*  with certain kinds of stochasticity.
*  We have sufficient conditions generally.
*  We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee.
*  We don't have necessary conditions
*  that it must be done a certain way in general.
*  So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject
*  into the walking along the gradient.
*  And what kind of randomness?
*  Why is randomness good in this process?
*  Why is stochasticity good?
*  Yeah, so I can give you simple answers,
*  but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing.
*  Stochasticity just, you know, particular features
*  of a surface that could have hurt you
*  if you were doing one thing deterministically,
*  it won't hurt you because, you know, by chance,
*  you know, there's very little chance that you would get hurt.
*  And, you know, so here stochasticity, you know,
*  it just kind of saves you from some of the particular
*  features of surfaces that, you know,
*  and in fact, if you think about, you know,
*  surfaces that are discontinuous in a first derivative,
*  like, you know, absolute value function,
*  you will go down and hit that point
*  where there's non-differentiability, right?
*  And if you're running a deterministic algorithm,
*  at that point, you can really do something bad, right?
*  Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely
*  that's gonna happen, that you're gonna hit that point.
*  So, you know, it's again, not trivial to analyze,
*  but especially in higher dimensions,
*  also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it,
*  but it has properties that kind of are very appealing
*  in high dimensions for kind of law of large number of reasons.
*  So it's all part of the mathematics,
*  it's what's fun to work in the field
*  is that you get to try to understand this mathematics.
*  But long story short, you know,
*  partly empirically it was discovered
*  stochastic gradient is very effective
*  and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that.
*  But I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that.
*  What's the most beautiful, mysterious,
*  or profound idea to you in optimization?
*  I don't know the most, but let me just say that,
*  you know, Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me
*  is pretty surprising and pretty deep.
*  Can you elaborate?
*  Well, Nesterov acceleration is just that,
*  suppose that we are gonna use gradients
*  to move around into space for the reasons I've alluded to,
*  they're nice directions to move.
*  And suppose that I tell you
*  that you're only allowed to use gradients.
*  You're not gonna be allowed to,
*  you know, see this local person,
*  it can only sense kind of the change in the surface.
*  But I'm gonna give you kind of a computer
*  that's able to store all your previous gradients.
*  And so you start to learn something about the surface.
*  And I'm gonna restrict you to maybe move in the direction
*  of like linear span of all the gradients.
*  So you can't kind of just move
*  in some arbitrary direction, right?
*  So now we have a well-defined mathematical complexity model.
*  There's a certain classes of algorithms that can do that
*  and others that can't.
*  And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces,
*  how fast can you get down to the optimum?
*  So there's an answers to these.
*  So for a, you know, a smooth convex function,
*  there's an answer,
*  which is one over the number of steps squared.
*  You will be within a ball of that size after K steps.
*  Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate,
*  it's one over K, okay?
*  So you could ask is gradient descent,
*  actually even though we know it's a good algorithm,
*  is it the best algorithm?
*  And the answer is no.
*  Well, not clear yet because what one over K score
*  is a lower bound.
*  That's probably the best you can do.
*  What gradient is one over K,
*  but is there something better?
*  And so I think it's a surprise to most,
*  though Nesterov discovered a new algorithm
*  that has got two pieces to it.
*  It uses two gradients.
*  And puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way.
*  And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time.
*  It sometimes goes back uphill.
*  And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense.
*  You're building up some momentum.
*  And that is kind of the right intuition,
*  but that intuition is not enough to understand
*  kind of how to do it and why it works.
*  But it does.
*  It achieves one over K squared,
*  and it has a mathematical structure.
*  And it's still kind of, to this day,
*  a lot of us are writing papers
*  and trying to explore that and understand it.
*  So there are lots of cool ideas in optimization,
*  but just kind of using gradients, I think, is number one.
*  That goes back 150 years.
*  And then Nesterov, I think,
*  has made a major contribution with this idea.
*  So like you said, gradients themselves
*  are in some sense mysterious.
*  They're not as trivial as mathematically speaking.
*  Coordinate descent is more of a trivial
*  when you just pick one of the coordinates
*  and build another one. That's how we think.
*  That's how our human minds think.
*  That's how our human minds think.
*  And gradients are not that easy
*  for our human mind to grapple with.
*  An absurd question, but what is statistics?
*  So here it's a little bit,
*  it's somewhere between math and science and technology.
*  It's somewhere in that convex hole.
*  So it's a set of principles that allow you
*  to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed.
*  And also principles allow you to make decisions
*  where you can have some reason to believe
*  you're not gonna make errors.
*  So all of that requires some assumptions
*  about what do you mean by an error?
*  What do you mean by the probabilities?
*  But after you start making some of those assumptions,
*  you're led to conclusions that,
*  yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way,
*  your probability of making error will be small.
*  Your probability of continuing to not make errors
*  over time will be small.
*  And probability you found something that's real
*  will be high.
*  So decision making is a big part of that.
*  Decision making is a big part, yeah.
*  So the original, so statistics,
*  short history was that it sort of goes back
*  as a formal discipline, 250 years or so.
*  It was called inverse probability
*  because around that era,
*  probability was developed sort of especially
*  to explain gambling situations.
*  Of course.
*  And-
*  Interesting.
*  So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this,
*  there's a certain roulette board
*  that has a certain mechanism in it.
*  What kind of outcomes do I expect to see?
*  And especially if I do things long amounts of time,
*  what outcomes will I see?
*  And the physicists started to pay attention to this.
*  And then people said, well, given,
*  let's turn the problem around.
*  What if I saw certain outcomes,
*  could I infer what the underlying mechanism was?
*  That's an inverse problem.
*  And in fact, for quite a while,
*  statistics was called inverse probability.
*  That was the name of the field.
*  And I believe that it was Laplace
*  who was working in Napoleon's government,
*  who needed to do a census of France,
*  learn about the people there.
*  So he went and gathered data
*  and he analyzed that data to determine policy
*  and said, well, let's call this field
*  that does this kind of thing statistics.
*  Cause the word state is in there.
*  In French, that's etah,
*  but it's the study of data for the state.
*  So anyway, that caught on
*  and it's been called statistics ever since.
*  But by the time it got formalized,
*  it was sort of in the thirties.
*  And around that time,
*  there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby.
*  People in that era didn't think of themselves
*  as either computer science or statistics
*  or control or econ.
*  They were all the above.
*  And so, von Neumann is developing game theory,
*  but also thinking of that as decision theory.
*  Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory
*  and then turn that into statistics.
*  And so it's all about,
*  here's not just data and you analyze it.
*  Here's a loss function.
*  Here's what you care about.
*  Here's the question you're trying to ask.
*  Here is a probability model
*  and here's the risk you will face
*  if you make certain decisions.
*  And to this day,
*  in most advanced statistical curricula,
*  you teach decision theory as the starting point.
*  And then it branches out
*  into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist.
*  But that's, it's all about decisions.
*  In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious,
*  maybe surprising idea that you've come across?
*  Yeah, good question.
*  I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones.
*  There's something that's way too technical for this thing,
*  but something called James Stein estimation,
*  which is kind of surprising
*  and really takes time to wrap your head around.
*  Can you try to maybe?
*  I think I don't want to even want to try.
*  Let me just say a colleague at a Steven Stickler
*  at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper
*  on James Stein estimation, which is helps to,
*  it's views a paradox.
*  It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it,
*  but you can, and Steve has a nice perspective on that.
*  So one of the troubles with statistics
*  is that it's like in physics, or in quantum physics,
*  you have multiple interpretations.
*  There's a wave and particle duality in physics.
*  And you get used to that over time,
*  but it still kind of haunts you
*  that you don't really quite understand the relationship.
*  The electron's a wave and the electron's a particle.
*  Well, the same thing happens here.
*  There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist,
*  and they are different.
*  They sometimes become sort of the same in practice,
*  but they are physically different.
*  And then in some practice, they are not the same at all.
*  They give you rather different answers.
*  And so it is very much like wave and particle duality,
*  and that is something you have to kind of
*  get used to in the field.
*  Can you define Bayesian and frequentist?
*  Yeah, in decision theory, you can make,
*  I have a video that people could see.
*  It's called, are you a Bayesian or a frequentist?
*  And kind of help try to make it really clear.
*  It comes from decision theory.
*  So, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions,
*  which are a function of data X and parameter theta.
*  So they're a function of two arguments, okay?
*  Neither one of those arguments is known.
*  You don't know the data a priori, it's random,
*  and the parameter's unknown, all right?
*  So you have this function of two things you don't know,
*  and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small.
*  I want small loss, right?
*  Well, what are you gonna do?
*  So you sort of say, well, I'm gonna average
*  over these quantities or maximize over them or something
*  so that I turn that uncertainty into something certain.
*  So you could look at the first argument and average over it,
*  or you could look at the second argument and average over it.
*  That's Bayesian and frequentist.
*  So the frequentist says, I'm gonna look at the X, the data,
*  and I'm gonna take that as random,
*  and I'm gonna average over the distribution.
*  So I take the expectational loss under X.
*  Theta's held fixed, all right?
*  That's called the risk.
*  And so it's looking at all the data sets you could get,
*  all right, and saying how well will a certain procedure
*  do under all those data sets?
*  That's called a frequentist guarantee, all right?
*  So I think it is very appropriate
*  when you're building a piece of software
*  and you're shipping it out there,
*  and people are gonna use it on all kinds of data sets.
*  You wanna have a stamp, a guarantee on it
*  that as people run it on many, many data sets
*  that you never even thought about,
*  that 95% of the time it will do the right thing.
*  Perfectly reasonable.
*  The Bayesian perspective says, well, no,
*  I'm gonna look at the other argument of the loss function,
*  the theta part, okay?
*  That's unknown, and I'm uncertain about it.
*  So I could have my own personal probability for what it is.
*  How many tall people are there out there?
*  I'm trying to infer the average height of the population.
*  Well, I have an idea roughly what the height is.
*  So I'm gonna average over the theta.
*  So now that loss function has only now, again,
*  one argument's gone.
*  Now it's a function of X.
*  And that's what a Bayesian does is they say,
*  well, let's just focus on the particular X we got,
*  the data set we got.
*  We condition on that.
*  Condition on the X, I say something about my loss.
*  That's a Bayesian approach to things.
*  And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant
*  to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten
*  and average over them, the frequentist approach.
*  It's really only the data sets you got, all right?
*  And I do agree with that, especially in situations
*  where you're working with a scientist,
*  you can learn a lot about the domain
*  and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data
*  and you gathered your data and you make inferences.
*  I don't agree with it though, in the sense that
*  there are needs for frequentist guarantees.
*  You're writing software, people are using it out there,
*  you wanna say something.
*  So these two things have to got to fight each other
*  a little bit, but they have to blend.
*  So long story short, there's a set of ideas
*  that are right in the middle,
*  they're called empirical Bayes.
*  And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework.
*  It's kind of arguably philosophically more reasonable
*  in kosher, write down a bunch of the math
*  that kind of flows from that and then realize
*  there's a bunch of things you don't know
*  because it's the real world and you don't know everything.
*  So you're uncertain about certain quantities.
*  At that point ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in
*  an estimate for those things?
*  Okay, and in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing
*  to do, to plug in.
*  There's a natural thing you can observe in the world
*  that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics
*  and assure yourself it's really good.
*  So based on math or based on human expertise,
*  what are good?
*  They're both going in.
*  The Bayesian framework allows you to put
*  a lot of human expertise in,
*  but the math kind of guides you along that path
*  and then kind of reassures you at the end
*  you could put that stamp of approval.
*  Under certain assumptions, this thing will work.
*  So you asked the question, what's my favorite,
*  what's the most surprising nice idea?
*  So one that is more accessible
*  is something called false discovery rate,
*  which is you're making not just one hypothesis test
*  but you're making one decision,
*  you're making a whole bag of them.
*  And in that bag of decisions,
*  you look at the ones where you made a discovery,
*  you announced that something interesting had happened.
*  All right, that's gonna be some subset of your big bag.
*  In the ones you made a discovery,
*  which subset of those are bad?
*  There are false discoveries.
*  You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries
*  among your discoveries to be small.
*  That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision
*  or recall or sensitivity and specificity.
*  It's a different quantity.
*  Those latter ones are almost all of them
*  have more of a frequentist flavor.
*  They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true,
*  here's what accuracy I would get.
*  Or given that the alternative is true,
*  here's what I would get.
*  So it's kind of going forward
*  from the state of nature to the data.
*  The Bayesian goes the other direction
*  from the data back to the state of nature.
*  And that's actually what false discovery rate is.
*  It says, given you made a discovery,
*  okay, that's conditioned on your data,
*  what's the probability of the hypothesis?
*  It's going the other direction.
*  And so the classical frequency look at that,
*  so I can't know that there's some priors needed in that.
*  And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward
*  and starts writing down these formulas
*  and realizes at some point,
*  some of those things can actually be estimated
*  in a reasonable way.
*  And so it's a beautiful set of ideas.
*  So this kind of line of argument has come out.
*  It's not certainly mine,
*  but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960,
*  and I think that Efron has written beautifully about this
*  in various papers and books.
*  And the FDR is, you know, Benyamini in Israel,
*  John Storey did this Bayesian interpretation and so on.
*  So I've just absorbed these things over the years
*  and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics.
*  Let me ask you about intelligence,
*  to jump slightly back out into philosophy perhaps.
*  Maybe you can elaborate,
*  but you said that defining just even the question
*  of what is intelligence is a very difficult question.
*  Is that a useful question?
*  Do you think we'll one day understand
*  the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means,
*  you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence
*  that we put before our machines?
*  So I don't work on these topics so much.
*  You're really asking the question for a psychologist,
*  and I've studied some, but I don't consider myself,
*  at least an expert at this point.
*  You know, a psychologist aims
*  to understand human intelligence, right?
*  And I think many of the psychologists I know
*  are fairly humble about this.
*  They might try to understand how a baby understands,
*  you know, whether something's a solid or a liquid
*  or whether something's hidden or not,
*  and maybe how a child starts to learn
*  the meaning of certain words, what's a verb,
*  what's a noun, and also, you know,
*  slowly but surely trying to figure out things.
*  But humans' ability to take a really complicated environment,
*  reason about it, abstract about it,
*  find the right abstractions, communicate about it,
*  interact and so on is just, you know,
*  really staggeringly rich and complicated.
*  And so, you know, I think in all humility,
*  we don't think we're kind of aiming for that
*  in the near future.
*  A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies
*  in the lab or with people talking
*  has a much more limited aspiration.
*  And, you know, Kahneman and Dversky
*  would look at our reasoning patterns,
*  and they're not deeply understanding
*  how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying,
*  hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning
*  and some things you need to think about it.
*  But also, as I emphasize some things I've been writing about,
*  you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet.
*  Yeah, great blog post.
*  I've been emphasizing that, you know,
*  if you step back and look at intelligent systems
*  of any kind, whatever you mean by intelligence,
*  it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know,
*  the plants or whatever, you know.
*  So a market that brings goods into a city, you know,
*  food to restaurants or something every day is a system.
*  It's a decentralized set of decisions.
*  Looking at it from far enough away,
*  it's just like a collection of neurons.
*  Every neuron is making its own little decisions,
*  presumably in some way.
*  And if you step back enough,
*  every little part of an economic system
*  is making its own decisions.
*  And just like with the brain, who knows what any of the neurons
*  are doing, doesn't know what the overall goal is, right?
*  But something happens at some aggregate level.
*  Same thing with the economy.
*  People eat in a city and it's robust.
*  It works at all scales, small villages to big cities.
*  It's been working for thousands of years.
*  It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive.
*  So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives
*  one tends to apply to intelligent systems.
*  Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep
*  adjusting it, self-healing, whatever.
*  Plus not perfect, you know,
*  intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect.
*  But I do not believe in this era that you can say,
*  well, our computers, our humans are smart,
*  but you know, no markets are not, more markets are.
*  So they are intelligent.
*  Now, we humans didn't evolve to be markets.
*  We've been participating in them, right?
*  But we are not ourselves a market per se.
*  The neurons could be viewed as the market of science.
*  You can, there's economic, you know,
*  neuroscience kind of perspectives.
*  That's interesting to pursue all that.
*  The point though is, is that if you were to study humans
*  and really be the world's best psychologist
*  to study for thousands of years
*  and come up with the theory of human intelligence,
*  you might have never discovered principles of markets.
*  You know, supply and demand curves and you know,
*  matching and auctions and all that.
*  Those are real principles and they lead to a form
*  of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence.
*  It's arguably another kind of intelligence.
*  There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth
*  that none of us are really thinking too much about right now.
*  So if you really, and then all those are relevant
*  to computer systems in the future.
*  Certainly the market one is relevant right now.
*  Whereas understand human intelligence is not so clear
*  that it's relevant right now, probably not.
*  So if you want general intelligence,
*  whatever one means by that, or you know,
*  understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that,
*  it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence.
*  It's gotta be this broader thing.
*  And that's not a mystery.
*  Markets are intelligent.
*  So you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical
*  stance to say we gotta move beyond human intelligence.
*  That sounds ridiculous.
*  But it's not.
*  And in that blockbuster, you define different kinds
*  of like intelligent infrastructure,
*  I which I really like is some of the concept
*  you've just been describing.
*  Do you see ourselves, if we see earth,
*  human civilization as a single organism,
*  do you think the intelligence of that organism
*  when you think from the perspective of markets
*  and intelligence infrastructure is increasing?
*  Is it increasing linearly?
*  Is it increasing exponentially?
*  What do you think the future of that intelligence?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't tend to answer questions like that
*  because you know, that's science fiction.
*  I was hoping to catch your off guard.
*  Well, again, because you said it's so far in the future,
*  it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know,
*  like you said, predicting the future
*  is really nearly impossible.
*  But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level,
*  a superhuman level intelligent,
*  not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual.
*  What do you think it would take to do that?
*  Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system
*  be different than the biological human beings
*  that we see around us today?
*  Is it possible to say anything interesting
*  to that question or is it just a stupid question?
*  It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction.
*  Science fiction.
*  And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction
*  and think about it from time to my own life.
*  There was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know,
*  little thing that people were talking about
*  when I was a student.
*  I remember, you know, imagine that, you know,
*  between your brain and your body, there's a, you know,
*  there's a bunch of wires, right?
*  And suppose that every one of them was replaced
*  with a literal wire.
*  And then suppose that wire was turned
*  into actually a little wireless, you know,
*  there was a receiver and sender.
*  So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know,
*  on all of its exiting axons and all the dendrites
*  down the body, you have a replaced with senders and receivers.
*  Now you could move the body off somewhere
*  and put the brain in a vat, right?
*  And then you could do things like start killing off
*  those senders and receivers one by one.
*  And after you've killed off all of them,
*  where is that person?
*  You know, they thought they were out in the body
*  walking around in the world and they moved on.
*  So those are science fiction things.
*  Those are fun to think about.
*  It's just intriguing about what is thought,
*  where is it and all that.
*  And I think every 18 year old,
*  it's to take philosophy classes and think about these things.
*  And I think that everyone should think about
*  what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that.
*  But I really don't think that's the right thing
*  for most of us that are my age group to be doing
*  and thinking about.
*  I really think that we have so many more present,
*  you know, first challenges and dangers
*  and real things to build and all that,
*  such that, you know,
*  spending too much time on science fiction,
*  at least in public for like this,
*  I think is not what we should be doing.
*  Maybe over beers in private.
*  That's right.
*  I'm welcome.
*  I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers
*  because this is going to go on Facebook
*  and I don't want a lot of people showing up there, but yeah.
*  I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube.
*  I'm optimistic and hopeful,
*  but maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope.
*  Let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest,
*  sort of some of the seminal figures in the field.
*  Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today?
*  What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey
*  if they're interested in machine learning, in AI,
*  in the ideas of markets from economics to psychology
*  and all the kinds of things that you're exploring,
*  what steps should they take on that journey?
*  Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open
*  and second, it's a journey.
*  I like your language there.
*  It is not that you're so brilliant
*  and you have great, brilliant ideas
*  and therefore that's just, you know,
*  that's how you have success
*  or that's how you enter into the field.
*  It's that you apprentice yourself,
*  you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things,
*  you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can,
*  you talk to lots of people
*  and it's like entering in any kind of a creative community.
*  There's years that are needed
*  and human connections are critical to it.
*  So, you know, I think about, you know,
*  being a musician or being an artist or something,
*  you don't just, you know, immediately from day one,
*  you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it.
*  No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics
*  and you be humble about where you are
*  and then you realize you'll never be an expert
*  on everything so you kind of pick
*  and then there's a lot of randomness
*  and a lot of kind of luck
*  but luck just kind of picks out
*  which branch of the tree you go down
*  but you'll go down some branch.
*  So, yeah, it's a community.
*  So, the graduate school is, I still think,
*  is one of the wonderful phenomena
*  that we have in our world.
*  It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor,
*  it's very much about a group of people you belong to.
*  It's a four or five year process
*  so it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing
*  to come up to something, you know, more expertise
*  and then start to have your own creativity start to flower
*  even surprising your own self.
*  And it's a very cooperative endeavor.
*  It's, I think, a lot of people think of science
*  as highly competitive and I think in some other fields
*  it might be more so.
*  Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine
*  and people are always teaching each other something
*  and people are always more than happy to be clear.
*  So, I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things
*  but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things
*  and a lot of them are relevant
*  and a lot of them are, I should know,
*  but should in some sense, you know, you don't.
*  So, I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance
*  to people around me so they can teach me things
*  and I think a lot of us feel that way
*  about our field so it's very cooperative.
*  I might add it's also very international
*  because it's so cooperative.
*  We see no barriers and so the nationalism that you see,
*  especially in the current era and everything,
*  is just at odds with the way that most of us think
*  about what we're doing here.
*  Where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate
*  and are very much trying to do it together
*  for the benefit of everybody.
*  So, last question, where and how and why
*  did you learn French and which language
*  is more beautiful, English or French?
*  Great question.
*  So, first of all, I think Italian's actually
*  more beautiful than French and English
*  and I also speak that so I'm married to an Italian
*  and I have kids and we speak Italian.
*  Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you
*  to express things a bit differently
*  and it is one of the great fun things to do in life
*  is to explore those things.
*  So, in fact, when kids or teens or college students
*  ask me what is the study, I say, well, do what your heart,
*  where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math.
*  Math is good for everybody but do some poetry
*  and do some history and do some language too.
*  Throughout your life, you'll wanna be a thinking person.
*  You'll wanna have done that.
*  For me, yeah, French I learned when I was,
*  I'd say, a late teen.
*  I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas
*  and not much was going on in Kansas
*  with all due respect to Kansas.
*  And so my parents happened to have some French books
*  on the shelf and just in my boredom,
*  I pulled them down and I found this is fun
*  and I kind of learned the language by reading
*  and when I first heard it spoken,
*  I had no idea what was being spoken
*  but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life
*  and so I made the connection.
*  But then I traveled and just I loved to go
*  beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever
*  and I found myself on trains in France
*  next to say older people who had lived
*  a whole life of their own and the ability
*  to communicate with them was special
*  and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes
*  and have empathy and kind of work on that language
*  as part of that.
*  So after that kind of experience
*  and also embedding myself in French culture,
*  which is quite amazing,
*  languages are rich not just because there's something
*  inherently beautiful about it
*  but it's all the creativity that went into it.
*  I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books
*  and then I was here actually at MIT
*  where we're doing the podcast today
*  and young professor, not yet married
*  and not having a lot of friends in the area
*  so I just didn't have, I was getting kind of a bored person
*  I said I heard a lot of Italians around,
*  there's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT,
*  a lot of Italian professors for some reason
*  and so I was kind of vaguely understanding
*  what they were talking about.
*  I said well I should learn this language too.
*  So I did and then later met my spouse
*  and Italian, Bohemian, were part of my life
*  but I go to China a lot these days,
*  I go to Asia, I go to Europe
*  and every time I go I kind of am amazed
*  by the richness of human experience
*  and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled
*  kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity.
*  It's not just a buzz word to me, it really means something.
*  I love to embed myself with other people's experiences
*  so yeah learning language is a big part of that.
*  I think I've said in some interview at some point
*  that if I had millions of dollars
*  and infinite time or whatever,
*  what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI?
*  And for me that is natural language
*  and really done right, deep understanding of language.
*  That's to me an amazingly interesting scientific challenge.
*  One we're very far away on.
*  One we're very far away but good natural language people
*  are kind of really invested in.
*  I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is,
*  if you understand that you really help human communication.
*  You understand something about the human mind,
*  the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree.
*  I think that will be such a long time.
*  So I didn't do that in my career
*  just because I kind of I was behind in the early days.
*  I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff.
*  I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language
*  and it was too late at some point
*  to kind of spend a whole career doing that
*  but I admire that field.
*  And so my little way by learning language,
*  you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up.
*  Yeah, and was right.
*  You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning.
*  I don't think there's a better place than it is.
*  Mike, it was a huge honor talking to you today.
*  Merci beaucoup.

*  And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom
*  from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled,
*  Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet,
*  and the call for the creation of a new branch of engineering.
*  The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense
*  in academia and beyond,
*  with overtones of cold, effectless machinery
*  and negative connotations of loss of control by humans.
*  But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be.
*  In the current era, we have a real opportunity
*  to conceive of something that is not just a tool
*  but a tool that is a tool that is a tool
*  and we have a real opportunity
*  to conceive of something historically new,
*  a human-centric engineering discipline.
*  I would resist giving this emerging discipline a name,
*  but if the acronym AI continues to be used,
*  let's be aware of the very real limitations
*  of this placeholder.
*  Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype
*  and recognize the serious challenges ahead.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
*  you
