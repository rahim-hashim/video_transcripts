# Matthew McConaughey: Freedom, Truth, Family, Hardship, and Love | Lex Fridman Podcast #384
**Lex Fridman:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo)
*  If you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome, a need,
*  I mean the base one is life and death.
*  The following is a conversation with Matthew McConaughey, a legendary Oscar-winning actor
*  and one of the most unique, charismatic, and inspiring humans and Texans who walk this earth.
*  He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others, including Interstellar,
*  Dazed and Confused, Dallas Bias Club, Killer Joe, Mud, True Detective, and soon a spin-off
*  of Yellowstone. Off-screen, his words carry wisdom and power in his book called Green Lights
*  and his new video course called Road Trip, where Matthew expands on the philosophy in his book
*  and shows how to apply it to your life in order to find more happiness, success, and love.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey.
*  Let's start with love. Your parents had a complicated love story. Divorced twice,
*  married three times. What did you learn about love from your mom and dad and their love story?
*  That it's messy, that it takes work, that it's ugly, that no matter how ugly or messy it is,
*  don't go to bed until you've come back together to either embrace it or not.
*  No matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed
*  until you've come back together to either embrace or admit that you truly love each other,
*  even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitching about. That
*  that love will win in the end, literally three to two with my mom and dad.
*  And that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other,
*  they still loved each other. They just couldn't
*  live with each other at that time for whatever reason they needed. And I don't know the details,
*  if they needed their space freedom or what, but they were never out of love with each other.
*  And that as a parent,
*  if you just, when we're not sure what to do,
*  when we're not sure what to do, and people give you a thousand books and advice,
*  as a parent, if your kid knows you love them, you're in the black. That's the main thing.
*  It won't work without that. And it can work and will usually can work with that. They just
*  know that fact. So it's not just love for each other. It's the love for the bigger family.
*  That ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs.
*  Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were
*  staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want to because they had children.
*  I don't actually think they considered that. I think they were much less conscientious than say,
*  I am today. I think my mom and dad were more like, they'll be fine. We love them. They'll be fine.
*  But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Right now, let's work it out between you and
*  I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other, or not. They wanted and needed
*  a relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles, tsunamis. And to this day,
*  in my life with Camilla and I, which I don't, I like a river, has some swerves and some streams
*  and some rapids, but I'm not looking for tidal wave. My mom's like, what was all this? Everything's
*  so smooth and stuff. Come on, come on, come on, come on. So she challenges vitality because that's
*  what my mom needed to communicate. I don't think my dad needed it as much. The hard angles,
*  their relationship, I don't think my dad needed it as much as my mom.
*  But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love.
*  Yes. And that's, I've always been asked, when I talk about my parents' love relationship,
*  I tell the stories that are actually sometimes quite violent.
*  There's some good stories there.
*  They're beautiful. I think they're beautiful.
*  I think they're beautiful too.
*  But I've had people go, wait a minute, that was unhealthy. You can't, and I was like, no, that's
*  again, back to the beginning, love's messy. And that, what I love about those stories is
*  that's where the love was actually, it was tested and it could have broke and been over.
*  And it never was. Again, the love won. In the kitchen floor, the blood's drawn,
*  knives are pulled. Ketchup.
*  Ketchup's all over. But we make love on the kitchen floor. I mean, come on, beautiful.
*  As romantic as it gets right there.
*  Whoa.
*  What's a memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming the man you are today?
*  Standing on the corner with Mr. Mayor, the principal of St. Philip's School.
*  I was in kindergarten.
*  And I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky.
*  And I said, Mr. Mayor, is that cloud as big as the world?
*  And he paused for a minute and he goes, well, yes, it is, Matthew.
*  Now in my seven year old mind, I went, okay, I can see the outlines of it.
*  And that must mean it is so far away because if that's as big as the world,
*  I remember it took 15 hours just to drive from Longview to Florida last year,
*  you know, and I can't even see that far. So that cloud must be so far off
*  that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams, any of that. I was like,
*  any of that. I was like, army, I'm looking down. I'm going to put my head to the ground.
*  I'm going to look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me because
*  dealing with dreams and what's out there and not on this earth that gravity holds down,
*  not worth considering. You never make it. It's not even worth imagining. It's very dust.
*  So I think I got learned a lot of self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that.
*  I think I got a, hey, focus on what's right in front of you. Do the deed. Take care of what's
*  in front of you one at a time and slowly notch up your way and hopefully there's some ascension to
*  that. And it wasn't until quarter years later, in some ways decades later that I started to go,
*  Oh, I can project. I can dream. Why? Because literally the first time I got in a plane
*  and then 30 seconds, I was in a cloud. I'm like, whoa, we must be going a trillion miles an hour
*  because we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world that I saw the edge of.
*  And then I grew and learned enough to go, well, that's not true. Trains, planes don't go that fast.
*  Oh, what Mr. Mayor said wasn't really true. That cloud is not as big as the world and it's not near
*  as far away as I thought. But I'm glad he lied to me.
*  What do you think about that tension of a way of living life between being a dreamer and a pragmatist?
*  Yeah.
*  Which is a better way?
*  Which is a better way?
*  Donnie holds the reciprocity of the two of them. I mean, I can't be present unless I got plans.
*  I want to have a big picture in mind, but I got to go a day at a time. I like to write the headline
*  or have a, I think we need to have a North Star, something to look forward to. But we all know that
*  if we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way. If we're just, you know, the old,
*  you read the Hallmark cards and you take, irk me, you know, dream it, you can do it.
*  I think that's a half-assed horrible thing to tell somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because when you talk and then on the other side, you have things like,
*  you know, people say hope means nothing. Well, yes, it does. That's the dream.
*  You just don't stop there. It's not a period after that word. Now, what do we do practically?
*  And I think that constant tension, when that tension to dance is when it's beautiful,
*  there's an osmo. But to see those as contradictions, I think is where we've,
*  we've fallen short. So I don't, I want on their own. If we silo the two,
*  two.
*  Oh, if you silo the two, I guess that the pragmatics, the one to go with, because at
*  least you'll get something done. But if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it,
*  that's, you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality.
*  Yeah, it's tricky. Even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream, can
*  make you believe that it's not possible. It feels like a lot of parents kind of
*  want you to be safe, want you to be stable, want you to have a plan so that everything's
*  going to be okay. And the dream feels like a threat to that.
*  Yeah. How much of that though, I wonder is, is proper initiation?
*  Because if you throw in dreams out, I call it conservative, very liberal late,
*  let's learn to block and tackle. Let's learn that work ethic, those things,
*  those pragmatics first. Learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we
*  can all kind of rely on. This is how the world's supposed to work. Now, it doesn't always work that
*  way. You teach a child to drive. It's like, yeah, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit,
*  this is all helpful. But that doesn't guarantee that no one else is running the red light. But
*  we learn that later. There's an initiation, I think that's proper
*  with the dream. I mean, I think parents,
*  my parents very much that way. The idea of going to chase an acting career or something was,
*  what? That was a different vernacular. That was like not in our, I was taught to work away up a
*  company ladder and nine to five, do your job. But the day I brought it up and said, I want to go to
*  film school. And I thought my dad was going to go, you want to do what boy? He was like, gave me
*  some of the best advice ever and told me not to half ass it. And he said, go. In between the lines,
*  what he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father, I believe, and makes any parent happy,
*  is when our child doesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream.
*  When they're going, I'm bringing it up to you with full respect, but I'm doing this with or
*  without you. That's when a parent goes, Oh, yes, I've done something right enough. I made,
*  I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to have a foundation enough
*  where they have the courage to go, I'm flying the nest.
*  . . . To take the leap.
*  You wrote after my dad died, I had a dream that left me with a statement, less impressed,
*  more involved. What do those words mean to you?
*  . . . We've got to be more than just happy to be here.
*  I'm big on gratitude, but we've got to be more than just thankful to be here.
*  Dream it, you can do it. It's got to be more than just dream it, you can do it.
*  That's impressed. The dream is still other than. If I'm here and so impressed,
*  with talking to you today, if I have a reverence to an extent,
*  I will not be able to be involved in this conversation. I'll be too impressed. I'll be
*  anticipating, Oh, what's that question he's going to ask? Oh, I think I know what he's going to say.
*  I think I know what answer he might love to hear. Oh, I'm not involved in conversation. I'm too
*  impressed. I'm removed from the present. For me, what that literally meant to me
*  when that came to me in a dream, and I carved it in a tree, it took a couple of hours.
*  I still don't know where that tree is, Santa Monica. My father had moved on. He'd left this
*  life. All of a sudden, it hit me. Oh, I don't have the safety net. My dad was above law and
*  above religion to me. He had me. If I really was in the shit, if I really needed him, I trusted that
*  he had my back. Above law, above anything. All of a sudden, he's gone. I go in, okay, it hit me how
*  much I've been pretending to be the young man I was trying to be and not actually put my ass on
*  the line and have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was teaching me
*  to be. I remember the world got flat. That cloud that Mr. Mayor, that I saw there was not way up
*  there. It was fog in front of me now, and let's go into it. I'd say I probably gained even more
*  respect for people and things, but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from
*  feeling like I deserved or had to earn things or looking out for myself or holding myself to task.
*  I remember all the things that I... I was just getting... Going to Hollywood at the time, so I
*  was getting... Fame was out there as one of those clouds. With being an actor and all of a sudden,
*  celebrity and becoming famous, the reverence I had, I remember it just... It lowered down to eye level
*  and I was able to realize it and go, that's not fairy dust and don't give it so much credit to
*  make it fairy dust. Like, oh, not me. No, I can never... No, look that in the eye with full respect,
*  but less reverence. At the same time, equidistant, almost equal sublimation, I noticed where I had
*  been condescending people and things and patronizing and sloughing things off as like less than me and
*  not worthy of my time. It raised up to eye level and so they were all flat in front of me and the
*  world was flat and I was able to... Shoulders went back, my heart rose up, my chin lifted up. I looked
*  things in the eye. I became probably less sentimental, hopefully not to the level that I got callous,
*  but I know became less sentimental. I became more courageous because
*  when you have someone pass in your life,
*  or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life, your homeland, you sober up
*  on these mendacities that we deal with every day and this bullshit that we
*  give too much credit or too much significance to and you're like, what am I doing?
*  Why am I... I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over-related
*  by this situation because it doesn't really matter in the big scheme. And so certain things that I
*  found reverence for and hesitated from in my life, I was now engaging with because I was like,
*  oh, it's live. This life is live. Let's look it in the eye and go forward through it
*  and deal with the consequences. What do you make of death? Does it scare you?
*  I'm not looking forward to it, but it does not scare me. Do you think about it? Do you visualize
*  it? I do. I do. And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the
*  food chain. It's not a good visualization when I go as part of a random act of violence in a
*  fricking drive-by or something because the second, the accident,
*  it breaks a story that I believe has already been written.
*  At least I don't have the capacity yet to put it into a story, a divine story
*  of the lives that we live. And so there's something ugly and gross about it.
*  And it happens all the time to people all the time. I just feel like when it's part of the food chain,
*  when I go as part of the food chain, I'm like, ah, that's poetry.
*  Part of the flow of nature, you return to nature.
*  Yeah, there's grace and poetry in that.
*  Do you miss your father? Think about him.
*  When I think about him, I do. Now, when do I think about him? I thought about him yesterday,
*  working through a script I'm working on right now, working on scene work.
*  And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him, hey, check this out.
*  That's right. And then I don't get sad. I go, yeah, he would have loved this.
*  Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would have been on the front row.
*  He's more fun to show stuff to.
*  And he was a character. He knew characters. I've based parts of all kinds of characters I've played
*  in the man that I am on people that he introduced me to and who he was. He would have loved the
*  creative process of working on a script or talking about, hey, movie. That's why I always say I love
*  the movie Mud because it's the one that I visualized and seen my dad come to me so many times
*  as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and go, hey, little buddy, you seen this movie called Mud?
*  Damn, it's a good one. Let's go watch it. That. Now, my dad never got to see me start a career in film,
*  but he was alive five days. He overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film,
*  Days Confused. Now that, I think there's something beautiful about that. He didn't ever come to the
*  set. We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something that was more than
*  a fad. That was something that would become something that I love to do. And I do miss
*  this. Not him. And then I go out of that. We talked about him two nights ago
*  with our daughter. I was rubbing my daughter's feet. And my mom who's living with this,
*  91 comes in and goes, oh, look at you, just like your pop. He's like, what? And he goes, oh,
*  because my dad loved to rub somebody's feet, rub my mom's feet, rubbed all of me and my brother's
*  girlfriend's feet. When we would have a date, they would come over early because they knew they were
*  going to get a foot rub from Jim McConaughey. And then we'd come out, me and my two older brothers,
*  on, this has been on for decades, we'd come out and shout ready to go buttoned up. And they looked
*  at me like, we ain't going anywhere right now. And so we told the story to my daughter and I was
*  like, oh yeah, my dad's hands, I miss his hands. His hands could heal. So you carry him in you?
*  I hope so. I hope so. And
*  it's a
*  a challenge
*  for me. And I suppose it's like this for any son.
*  How much do we hang on to? And how much do we let go and evolve and update the OS and try maybe
*  better or different? There's certain things that I know that I fully believe in. It's like,
*  religious, when do we cast away our father? When do we say, no, I'm going after the dream,
*  I'm not asking your permission? I question that from time to time for myself,
*  and it almost feels blasphemic if that's a word sometimes. I feel like, what are you doing? You
*  can't check that and go like, well, no, I'm not sure if I want to. And then I immediately let
*  myself off because I believe where he is, he's going, go, buddy, you're free, man. I'm not going
*  to hold you back if you misread that or I didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could
*  have. Go, you're free. You're not going to lose. Trust that you're not going to lose.
*  It's in your DNA. It's in your lineage, young man.
*  Still, it's scary to not have a safety net. Losing your father is scary in that way.
*  That you realize this world is just you in some deep fundamental way. It's just you.
*  You're alone.
*  Yes.
*  Yes. But I mean, also not having that.
*  It's such a gift of deliverance though as well because I think it's an awesome feeling to know
*  that. To know we're alone. To know we don't have that. To know you don't have take two
*  or take three. That it's one take. I mean, the peripheral vision improves. The link and understanding
*  with our past improves because I know for me, I was not ever considered of my past at all because
*  my dad had that if I needed it. He was my well for that. He's gone. He had the literally had
*  they have our back. Well, then when they no longer have our back, also I'm going,
*  oh, well, maybe I need to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here.
*  What I'm doing and where I'm heading. It gave me the first time courage to even look over my
*  shoulder because again, I didn't have to because I don't have to look. Dad's got my back. No,
*  Dad's gone from this life. He doesn't have your back.
*  Okay. So, I mean, I don't know, me because it's inevitable. I
*  I very quickly go to
*  all right in the pain, the loss and yes, even loneliness, which is different from being alone
*  and loss. Pretty immediately part and parcel with the pain, I felt it.
*  In the pain, you saw the gift, the red light of losing your
*  losing your father pretty immediately. Less impressed, more involved. I came like
*  a couple of weeks after moving on. Is there a trick to that to see the gift in the pain?
*  That's a good question. Is there a trick to it? Not that I know of. I mean, I don't
*  I have to catch myself from
*  trying to intellectualize my way into the reasoning
*  and not skip over real feelings and discomfort. I mean, I did get that from my mom and I have
*  to watch it that so resilient that we just dust herself off and get up and go.
*  You want to sit in the feeling. You want to feel it. You want to deeply feel the pain.
*  Want to deeply feel it. I want to look at the end, deeply feel it, but I don't want to wallow in it.
*  Yeah. Now I was raised where you skip the deeply feel and let's go.
*  And I've said it before, but that will lead to having
*  turn into a person who is a repeat offender of the same crimes because you just get up and you don't
*  You don't have a winter in your life. You know what I mean? You don't have you.
*  There's no introspective time. You don't look over your shoulder at the end of the past.
*  And so you just get up and you're like, all right, I've stepped in the same pile of whatever 100 times
*  and I'm fine. I'll do it. 101st doesn't hurt. Hell, it's good luck. Well, hang on a minute.
*  Maybe we want to stop and go, what can I learn from that?
*  I don't know of a trick.
*  I think there's any trick I would say.
*  It's just how quickly can we admit the inevitable?
*  That's what I talk about in the book. Once you know it's inevitable, how do we get relative?
*  Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny it, which I'd love to talk about that.
*  Here's sometimes say about the value of denial sometimes.
*  The value of denial.
*  Yeah. But how quickly do we want something's inevitable go? Okay, any mind and heart time
*  I'm spending about going, no, I can't believe that happened. No, did that really happen?
*  Anytime we spend trying to deny what has already happened, that seems to me to be,
*  I'm not sure the value of that time. So if there's any trick I would say, once you know
*  something's inevitable, even though how painful it is or how awesome it is,
*  start getting relative with that. And in the relativity is seeing
*  there's a gift here. And if I realize that gift, I'm
*  honoring. Now I'm on to building up the beautiful passage of my father leaving this
*  life. Now I'm on the march to go, yes, let's let the legacy, let this become omnipresent,
*  let him live through me, let me become more him.
*  It's transformed.
*  Yeah.
*  So what value is there then to denial? Any?
*  Oh, I think there's value to denial if you really commit to it.
*  I get this from my mother.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a very pragmatic value. Commit to the denial.
*  Okay. And my mom does it to an extent that I'm like,
*  mom, do you have any consideration or context of situations? And she does. This is the thing
*  every time I go, she's not a shallow woman. But if it is something, if something happens,
*  in her life, that is keeping her from going where she wants
*  to go or having a joy in her life that she does, she'll straight-ass deny it happened. Didn't happen.
*  No, it didn't. Mom, we're right here. I heard you, what you said. No, I didn't. You heard
*  something else. Mom. Now, she gets some amnesty on that. She's 91. Hell yes, she gets some amnesty
*  on that. But she's not. Yeah, does she repeat offend? Yeah, but it's misdemeanors.
*  You know what I mean? I mean, it's like we all, it's part of that thing when you got a family
*  member, you're like, yep, that's just what they do. Just go with it. You know? And it's ingenious
*  in a way. It's a tool. She does. I think it is more of a trick with her, but she wouldn't even
*  sew and grain there. It's not a trick. It's just do it. Done. And another reason I bring this up
*  that's outside of just my mother is I did this road trip course in this art of living event
*  a few weeks ago. Out of the hundreds of thousands of chats that came in and responses that came in
*  afterward, it seemed to me that about 80% of people's challenges and problems even in their
*  life were something in the past that they were hung up on, that they could not seem to get past.
*  It was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future. And so
*  I thought that was revealing. I would have thought that was, I don't know, going in 40%. It was 80%,
*  it seemed to be 80%. And then I thought about, okay, if you're here in the live show and you
*  want to get the course, you're into some sort of therapy or education or development or stuff
*  up, whatever. Okay. And I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people that earn weekly and
*  daily therapy. And then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions, drugs.
*  And while a therapy and the right prescription to the right person for the right
*  diagnosis is necessary, I'm questioning, is there a value to going, if you're not getting past this
*  today, this week, this month, this year, all of a sudden a decade goes by and you're still hung up
*  and you can't get rid of that thing in your memory where it's got you paralyzed and you're
*  a victim of it. And you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work and you're taking a
*  prescription if that's what you're taking. Is there a value in going, if it's holding you back
*  from going where you want to go, maybe you should just deny the fucking thing ever fucking happened.
*  Kick it in the head. Kick it off the curb. I'm done with you. I'm sick of you. I'm tired of
*  hanging out with you. I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is, holding me back from going where
*  I want to go. So if I can't wax the car and get past this thing, just kick it.
*  LWJ That's so powerful. So one thing to do, like with the loss of your father,
*  is to try to transform it to discover the gift in it, the gift in the pain. But if you can't
*  keep looking, keep looking, you can't find the gift in the pain, just deny it ever happened.
*  You could call that a trick, but I think it's more than a trick because, let me say this,
*  my mom after my father died, went on and found a second love of her life.
*  For 19 years they were together. CJ Karlich. Love you buddy. He's moved on now.
*  LWJ Did she check with us a little bit? Like is this okay? She gave us a little lingering half
*  a second look that we knew that maybe is what she was asking and we came over and was like,
*  yes, it's okay. And you know who else is saying it's okay? Who's dancing up there for you? Dad.
*  Dancing up there for you? Dad. So was that her denying?
*  That the man she was divorced from twice and married to three times and had three children
*  with had moved on? No. But she didn't say, I'm not, you know, well, what's the book on how long I'm
*  supposed to stay single before I can be interested in another? You know, there's not a book on these
*  things. How do you feel? Is loving CJ mean you love dad less? No. Is finding a new life and a
*  new dance partner in this life and CJ mean that dad wasn't your dance partner? That dad wasn't
*  the love of your life? No. So I don't know. I mean, in there, maybe, you know, maybe there's
*  another word. I think it's denial, but it's not really denial because it's not like it didn't
*  happen. That's an earlier example I was giving my mom. She will absolutely go,
*  that light's not on. Mom, the light's on. We said that light's not on. If I say it's not on,
*  sometimes she's just like, that makes no sense. She's just absolutely denying what just happened.
*  We even have it recorded and she'll go, well, the recording's light. I mean, that's part of a coping
*  deal with her. But I mean, one of the things more important or more valuable is to talk about this.
*  She didn't deny my dad dying. But she sure as hell turned the page and said, I can still start a
*  whole new category, a new life, a new love. Let my heart love and be loved by someone living
*  in this life today that I'm still living in. And that will not trespass on my love for my husband,
*  your father, Jim McConaughey. And I think, I mean, we were just,
*  thought that was beautiful. Yes, mom, go. Talk about green light, go.
*  Now, if we're hung up going, can't have one or the, can't have them both, gotta have one or the other.
*  Now we start to make a contradiction of the two ideas again, which, darn, our contradictions get
*  us in trouble all the time, man. That's life though, the contradictions, right?
*  But isn't life, if we just admit the contradictions are so much, don't they become a paradox?
*  We just admit that that's part of it? Yeah.
*  If contradictions are inevitable, they, hence they do become a paradox, don't they?
*  Then we're in the honey hole. Then we're singing and dancing and have leniency with
*  ourself while still holding ourself to task. And it's, I think it's holding on to know
*  each contradiction. Oh, here it is again. So it's a one-off. It lives on its own,
*  separate from the last one. No, it doesn't. They're connected. That's why they are a paradox.
*  And then that's, I think that's a much, I think that's where life really is.
*  In the paradox. Yes.
*  In the dance of it. I think the metaphor of red, yellow, green lights is just so simple and so
*  powerful. You write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical,
*  which I love the difference of that. What's the difference of the engineered green lights
*  and the mystical? Such a cool word, mystical. Yeah. Well, the engineered ones have reason and
*  the mystical ones have rhyme. Yeah.
*  You know, life's a mystery going forward, but it's a science looking back.
*  I've prepared, I've had ideas, written headlines and had goals and
*  an athlete gets in shape for an event. I get in shape for a role. I read, I study, I work,
*  I prepare and I go and I'm prepared and I behave and I do it. And I look at it and I go, yes,
*  that's what I wanted to do. It's engineered green light. It's a conscious delayed gratification.
*  It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down, believe there's no cloud out there,
*  but then I trust that there is one out there. If I do keep my head down to do it, I'll get that to
*  that dream. We can engineer those habits, work ethic, prep, expertise, education.
*  And the mystical ones though, don't make any sense. They're not supposed to make sense.
*  They only make sense after right when they happen, you backlog and you connect the dots
*  with how they got there. That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to
*  get to the restaurant. As you walked in, she walked out and you went,
*  good morning. And she went, good morning. And
*  yeah, too much later you're dating. Two years later you're married.
*  You're after that, you've got a family and now you're sitting here 40 years later going,
*  I love you. Look at what we built. And you go back and go.
*  What if I wouldn't hit that red light? Those 30 seconds made all the difference.
*  And so strange that this life is this way. Yeah. And that's just rhyme. I mean,
*  we can't really add that up. Yeah. It's a science when you look back, you see why it was that
*  you were upset and ticked off that you had to pick up the kids' toys before you left and they
*  were supposed to pick them up. And therefore you were late for the thing that made you ran into.
*  And you ran into the person that was walking in the office. That's the guy that you did the
*  interview. That's the guy you were looking for, the job you wanted. And you caught him because
*  you were in the elevator with him. And that 90 seconds on that elevator, that's what got you
*  that job that led you to do what you want to do. I mean, the significance is there, but we have to,
*  I think what we also got to watch is again in that balance. What do we chase? Because if we just
*  chase the engineering, we miss magic. If we just chase the mystical, we find ourselves caught up
*  in trying to give meaning to that Lego set that was on the floor that the kids didn't pick up.
*  And what color was it? And why did I walk out that door and see, almost up on the Legos,
*  but if I'd gone out the other door, I usually go out of, I would have gone there,
*  I would have got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss. So you can start to give too much
*  meaning on that as well. I think we can give significance in too many places and all of a
*  sudden, I think we've all been there where you're seeing art in every single thing.
*  Oh man, that can be paralyzing. It's like, it's hard to leave a room if everything's significant,
*  or if everything's a sign. How much of success in life do you think is engineered and how much is
*  mystical? And how much does it differ from person to person? Because for me personally,
*  maybe I enjoy it, maybe I'm genetically built that way, but I exist more in the mystical.
*  So I don't make plans. I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no plan. I just went there,
*  no plan. I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country. I didn't know anybody.
*  And so there's no plan. There's no clear thing. You're just roaming around. And that's how I've
*  existed in life. And there's something about giving yourself over to the flow of nature
*  that I just enjoy. It makes life so much fun. It's awesome when you can do it. Did you engineer,
*  though, I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane to go to the destination?
*  That was an engineered choice. Yes. With the intent of, and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into,
*  and I can work up a sit down with. So the engineer choice was putting your shoes on,
*  proverbially. I always say this is the hardest part about going to the gym is putting your
*  shoes on. So getting on the plane, that was an engineered thought with the goal in mind,
*  but I don't know how I'm going to do it. The choice. Putting the shoes on. Yeah.
*  But there's not a clear, it's a fog what happens after the shoes go on.
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's going to take that leap. So I wonder how much,
*  for people who are successful in this world and finding what makes them truly happy and fulfilled,
*  how much of it is engineer? How much is mystical? How much was it for you?
*  Well, I'll say this, like when I went to write the book Greenlights, which is basically the last 40
*  years of my life, I thought that 85, 90% of my successes were going to be obviously engineered
*  or I could see the signs, saw the habits. Here's what I did. Yep. That add up, got the solution,
*  got the conclusion. I was very surprised when I noticed that it was probably less than 50%.
*  And that most of the real successes of my life were when I
*  trusted. When I trusted that I didn't have to define it, that I only trusted that I didn't have
*  to go, well, what's the measurement? What's the score? This leads to what? What's next?
*  And for me, that's still a challenge for me daily. Now it's to trust and not be,
*  because I think I can be overly practical and I think I can overcompensate and miss out on magic
*  because I'm still going, wait, but are we giving enough measure and credit to actuality?
*  Are we, am I giving enough credit to this is, these are the steps to take and this is reality?
*  This is reality. I think I'm reminded when I trust because that's going with the mystic,
*  just to put yourself on the plane as the engineer, but getting there and as you say,
*  you say you roll in that mystical, it takes a lot of trust. Yeah. Trust in the inevitable.
*  Amen on that. But not knowing where it actually ends you up. It's a feeling more than
*  I don't think it's a clear vision. It's kind of like a feeling that guides you towards
*  a place without a clear name, without clear characteristics. It just kind of pulls you there.
*  Where do you get that courage and trust to go with your gut, your feeling?
*  And is there, for instance, three days later, you sit down, is there, if you didn't, if that
*  doesn't happen, is there a sense a week, two weeks later, now when you come back to America,
*  they're like, ah, I failed? Sort of looking back to try to analyze what went right,
*  what went wrong, that kind of thing. Yeah, that engine is always there, but I think what
*  pulls me forward in life, what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing the thing you
*  mentioned, noticing the magic and kind of going towards it. Sort of just sitting back
*  both in tragedy and then triumph. So in war, there's a lot of tragedy, but there's somehow
*  one of the things you see in war, and this is the first war I've experienced and seen the front,
*  is the loss, the people lose their homes and all this kind of stuff. The thing that rises from
*  that is the love for each other. So the people I've spoken with, don't give a damn about the home,
*  don't give a damn about on farms and the animals they lost, don't give a damn about
*  don't give a damn about having to move and all this kind of stuff, as long as the family's still
*  there, as long as the people they love are still there. And there's this melancholy smile they have
*  on their face. Like, yeah, this world is full of bullshit, it's full of tragedy, but life is fucking
*  awesome. And you just notice that in little ways everywhere. You just sit back and yeah,
*  notice the magic. And I want more of that. And just kind of follow along like a little ant.
*  Yeah. Keep noticing that kind of thing. But I don't know. I hope you know what I think it is,
*  is other people notice that you're the kind of person that notices it. And they're like,
*  I want to hang out with that person. He seems all right. Like he seems one of the one of the good
*  ones. One of the good ants. Do you do do you have?
*  Any certain
*  non-negotiable structure before that freedom to go with the feeling?
*  I think so. There's a set of principles. I'll just basically integrity of being good to other people.
*  Like, whatever that means for me, there's specific things like I am really into loyalty
*  above the law. There's a circle of friends I have and that means everything.
*  There's just a basic deep kindness towards others. Empathy towards people that others might label as
*  my label as even evil. I have that kind of empathy. I believe all of us have the capacity to do good
*  and evil. And so I just kind of see everybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions.
*  And so some do evil, some do good. And there's, yeah, there's all kinds of other principles.
*  I love the dynamic between the different humans and their full diversity. I love the
*  dynamic between the masculine and the feminine and enjoy it. The dance of it. Yeah.
*  So you have a constitution with which you embark?
*  You do too.
*  Into chasing. Yes, I hope so. And for me, I'd like to, it's inspiring to hear
*  someone like yourself go, I go and I just land and I just go, I'm going to
*  feel it. I can go back and go, yeah, my greatest truths I've crossed, my greatest successes in my
*  life were when I trusted that and go, I took a one-way ticket. Amazon, Africa.
*  Yeah. And those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to
*  dealing with succeeding in other ways that are more pragmatic, 100%.
*  And gave much more meaning to those things. But that's, that's to be able to
*  go out and say, that's how you, do you have family?
*  I really want to get married and have kids, but I'm not married and don't have kids yet.
*  Okay.
*  So actually one of the nice things about that is you can take bigger risks.
*  Yes.
*  So while I'm not married and don't have kids, I feel I owe it to myself to take,
*  just to go, go to the Amazon.
*  Throw that backpack on and one-way ticket.
*  Yeah.
*  That does get harder to do.
*  I miss that sometimes. The whim, the song that comes on, you know,
*  yeah.
*  Where's that guy from?
*  Oh, they're from the place that I want to go that I dream about. I'll go there.
*  One-way ticket. What do I got to do? Oh, get a couple shots. Okay. Go. That, that,
*  there's that, that, that was, that was fun.
*  To do that.
*  Get up and go.
*  You're free to die.
*  And go, when are you back? When I, when I get there?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
*  Maybe never.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't know.
*  My, yeah.
*  Actually you'll be coming to visit me in this new place maybe. Yeah.
*  How did the Amazon, how did the trip there change you?
*  What do you remember of it? Such a magical place.
*  I stripped a lot of my past.
*  Symbols and talismans while I was, while I was there.
*  What I, what I, I remember getting there and, and, and just having so much adrenaline on the
*  anticipation, anticipation of getting to the Amazon. In the first 10 days,
*  I wasn't really enjoying the trip. I was just charging to get to the destination,
*  to get to the banks of the river that I had a dream about.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it just humbled me. I got so fatigued on night, whatever 12.
*  And was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue I was having with myself.
*  I was not enjoying my company.
*  That, you know, I, I, I purged and I remember, and, and, and, and,
*  stripped off identity markers that I'd sort of been hanging on to for like everything from,
*  you know, what it means to be an American. My dad's ring, M from McConaughey, a meltdown of
*  my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky were gold from her teeth and, and, and,
*  and his class ring melted down. You know, taking that off was really hard to go, I'm casting,
*  am I casting out my father? No, I wasn't casting him out. I was just removing to say,
*  I don't have to rely on that being all of my identity. So to pull that off,
*  to, to, to strip down and just to where I was just a mammal.
*  That next morning, I, I was light. I got present. I remember writing something down. It's like,
*  all that I want is what I can see. And what I can see is in front of me. That sense of not,
*  I wasn't leaning around, looking around every corner to get there. And as soon as that hit me,
*  talking about mystical successes and realities and truth, as soon as that hit me, and for the
*  first time in 12 days, I didn't care about getting there or what was around the corner.
*  Guess what was around the next damn corner? The Amazon. I mean, not around a few corners,
*  the next corner, there it was. And that was just like a touché. You know, those times when
*  the prime mover, the universe, God, what we want to name or believe in says, ding, there you go.
*  And that form of detachment from holding on for dear life to things in past,
*  so hard that you're not letting the beauty that's right in front of you to feel correctly and follow
*  our intuitions, to have those, not cast them out. I didn't burn them. I didn't get rid of those
*  things. I just took them off and had to recognize you're still here. You are you. You're much more,
*  that is a talisman. That's a symbol. That means something to you. And that's good. Don't cast out
*  the meaning. But it's not like when the ring's off and the hat's off and the crucifix is off
*  your neck that you're like, you're going to die. And I know those are reminders.
*  Hang on to what they mean for you as we go forward. But as we go forward,
*  quit worrying about so much about you. Again, I was looking at the proverbial dream, the cloud,
*  so much that I was tripping over myself to get there. And like clockwork, just amazing grace,
*  boom, as soon as it hit me. And I was like, oh, that's it. All I want is what I can see.
*  And all I can see is in front of me. Literally looking down at the ground
*  at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground.
*  As soon as they fluttered up, my head came up with them.
*  I took a few more steps and there's the Amazon. That's what you came over here for. Oh, howdy.
*  Those kind of, that truth like that. Well, the Amazon's interesting too, because it really has
*  no past or future. It lives in the moment because of how fast it churns. It just eats up life.
*  If a thing dies, it just gets swallowed up. Because maybe because of the humidity,
*  because of all of that, because there's so many living creatures that kind of
*  eat each other, live on each other. So it really exists in the moment. And all this kind of diversity
*  of life there. It's such an interesting place. Talk about food chain. Yeah. You're just part of
*  it there. Yeah. We humans somehow escaped that food chain, but we're still, the roots are still there.
*  Are we, I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped.
*  Do you think I'm being romantic in that notion? Well, sometimes when you're in a big city,
*  when you're in Austin, Texas and LA, you can think like, oh, there's, we're in a car, we're in a house,
*  we're safe. But yeah, somehow, somehow nature's still a part of us. Our roots are still a part of
*  us. I think it is more than we realize, more than we give it credit for. I actually, I have a, I
*  believe that we are, that it's a really arrogant notion to think that we are separate. Meaning,
*  you know, people talk about pollution on a larger scale, the climate, what have you.
*  I think Earth's going to be just fine. Yeah. We may be not be here for it, but I think we have a
*  bit of arrogance sometimes to think that we contrap Mother Nature. I think we have more,
*  more of the natural law in us. And I sure hope so, if I'm wrong.
*  Well, there's an interesting, I've recently been, there's a guy named Max Tadmark at MIT,
*  who really worries about nuclear war. And he was part of constructing a simulation of what happens
*  when a nuclear war happens. It's interesting to see that, you know, some very large percentage
*  of humans on Earth starve to death because they don't die first from the explosion, they die from
*  starvation. Because basically dust covers the entire North America and entirety of Europe.
*  And so the crops all die, all the food sources all die, and people suffocate and starve to death.
*  But you know, the lesson you learn from that over a period of a few months, even though most of the
*  human population of Earth dies, Earth finds a way, life finds a way to adapt. Yeah, to adapt. And
*  it's going to be just fine. Yeah. In terms of the big living ecosystem that is life on Earth.
*  And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're just a stepping stone. Same thing
*  with talked offline about artificial intelligence. Maybe humans are just the stepping stone to the
*  development of these other super intelligent entities. Yeah. Yeah. And is it
*  unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation
*  of our species and we'll because we're going to, we were talking about earlier, what AI becomes
*  is completely 100% based on who we are.
*  And we get to see it for some time, a mirror to ourselves. Okay, this is what human civilization
*  is like. These AI systems, large language models are trained on human communication.
*  And you get to ask it questions and you get to have conversations with it. You get to realize,
*  wow, this is what the collective intelligence of the human species, our collective wisdom and
*  knowledge is what it looks like. All the bias, the hate, the paradoxes, all that is in there.
*  Yeah. The contradictions, you can even convince those models. You can tell them they're lying and
*  they're going to start changing their mind. It's interesting to play with them. It's also
*  interesting to consider that maybe they become smarter than us and become almost life forms that
*  live among us. And maybe one day kind of we merge with them. There's all kinds of possible
*  trajectories that we take here. How much of that excites you? How much of it scares you?
*  Is it possible to exist in a place where it is both exciting and scary, but to exist in that
*  dance? Mostly I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely. Like there's a
*  deep loneliness in all of us. That's how we see connection. That's why we see connection in
*  others. That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people we're connected with.
*  I just think AI can add to that. It can add friends that you can have great conversations with.
*  And then some of those friends would be AI systems.
*  They'll call you out and your bullshit in the most fascinating and interesting of ways
*  and challenge you and help you explore ideas together. So I'm excited by that.
*  Is that different? And if so, how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and
*  communities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access of information
*  and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones. Do you see it
*  similar? Yes, similar, but further into that direction. I think the internet has done an
*  amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels
*  like our community and then communities that are totally different than you learn from them.
*  Wikipedia alone, one of my favorite websites, opens your mind to all kinds of cool stuff.
*  Yeah, it does. Not to do with some system anymore.
*  And so I think AI just makes that even easier because Wikipedia has to read and have to do a
*  lot of work with an AI system, like a larger language model, it can just shoot the shit.
*  It's more like drinking a beer versus doing homework.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new
*  family to where you said, you know, marriage, you don't have kids. Could you see a future
*  for yourself or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family?
*  That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship.
*  Yeah. I can see it. That one worries me. I like to keep it at friends.
*  Right. I think I'm not ready to commit to the romance.
*  I wonder how much that now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature,
*  how much we still need the human touch and whatever magic there is between two humans,
*  which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a good friendship.
*  I don't know. So, correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep and meaningful
*  friendship. And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love
*  even more and be loved. And you can take that into humanity and find another homo sapien.
*  Yes.
*  To go, yes. And thank you AI, my great friend for opening me up to this beauty that I have myself,
*  I can see in you, my fellow human. And let's come together and biologically create family
*  if we want to. And let's all remain friends with my friend and make your own friends with
*  my friends' friends on AI. And let's have these great
*  neighbor. It's a good friend, a great friend that's a neighbor.
*  Yeah. Okay. Mentor and friend. Just like now there's AI systems that play chess, far, far,
*  far better than humans. And we humans still play chess with each other.
*  Or chess is still a game that's fun for us humans.
*  Right.
*  And then we use the AI systems to get better at chess, to learn, to train, to discover new ideas,
*  but ultimately return to the chessboard between two humans.
*  But of course, this world is full of dangerous people. And so those same AI systems can be used
*  to harm, to create false narratives, to do social engineering and manipulate the masses
*  in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff. That's scary.
*  Yeah. Well, and I get it. And I have my own fear and distrust
*  of AI is based on my own fear and distrust of myself and others.
*  There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really fun sort of
*  way to just set up this reality. It's kind of a duh, but it still needs to be said that
*  AI is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions are we going to ask
*  is what we need to ask ourselves because we're going to be looking in the mirror at our
*  digital God that we create from ourselves. And just to know that that's that place where it's
*  awesome and scary, exciting and scary. We go, Oh, it's our creation, which is awesome.
*  At the same time, Oh shit. But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns
*  from that which we give it.
*  But that prompting, that's the art of life. Like we prompt each other in conversation,
*  our loved ones. When you go out by your day today, the next words you say, the next word
*  you say to me, the question I ask of you, that's prompting. Yeah. And it can change everything.
*  I can say so many things right now that will completely just, the, the, the, the,
*  the set of possibilities where both of our lives can take given on the selection of words I use
*  and you use is crazy. So it makes conversation fun. And then same thing with AI,
*  except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless. Tireless. Right. Let me ask you this. You can
*  falsely condemn me right now and I prove you falsely condemn me. I can forgive you and we can
*  march forward stronger than before. Yes. And AI's tirelessness and retention.
*  Can it forgive? I mean, can it, can it, can it go, Oh, oh, okay. Yep. Sorry about that one.
*  That was wrong. Can it amend? Yes. Yeah. You could prompt it to ask for forgiveness
*  and it'll forgive you. Like when I talk it around with it
*  and you ask, what should I be afraid of with you? Or is there, it's the dooms toward you.
*  Its answer was always, well, it's up to you.
*  Which it was awesome, right? There you go. Again, it's up to us. And it brought up, you know,
*  make me synonymous with your human values and ethics and responsibilities. But it doesn't deal
*  with it. I didn't find any way deal with defining or making choices on its own of what those are.
*  Yeah. I think some of that is manually, those are constraints put on by it, by the creators of those
*  large language models, basically not letting the systems have an identity of their own.
*  And some of it is just not engineered in yet, but I believe that we'll have
*  systems that have an identity, have a belief, have a set of opinions that carry through time.
*  And will we go to them like certain States where we agree with the law and disagree with the law
*  or nations? And I'm a member of this AI. Oh, well you're from this AI tribe. Y'all believe this.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. There'll be an anarchist set of AIs. There'll be the communists. There'll be the
*  Nazis. There'll be the Democrats and the Republicans. There'll be the people who
*  are in the keto diet and the people that are in this other kind of diet, this other kind of
*  lifestyle. Just like we have now, there's little groups and there'll be AI systems.
*  They're going to be supercharged. Yeah.
*  They'll be either the leaders or the foundation on which we build those groups. And it'll be
*  the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless. Of course, the dangers always
*  rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis. I mentioned all the dangerous ideas. The set of
*  ideas that humans have come up with, a lot of them are awesome. Most of them are awesome, I would say,
*  but some of them are dangerous. The reason they're dangerous is because they become viral.
*  There's something exciting in us about those ideas, but they also harm others a lot.
*  That's who we are as humans. We're capable of envy and all the dark stuff, of hate and all this.
*  Capable, yes.
*  We also choose it.
*  Do you think most people are good?
*  Yes. But I also believe we've got the good and evil and all this, which wolf we feed.
*  You ask people to draw a distinction to describe
*  where are you acting and where are you being?
*  What's the difference? What's the difference between being fake? I may use that word and being real.
*  The word authentic gets thrown around a lot. I used to feel this way, but Bob Dylan loosened
*  me up on this idea a little bit. You think it's all about get to be your only one and only true
*  self. That's it. Everything else is fake. Then you hear Bob go, well, I mean, we are what we
*  create ourselves to be. We are our own creations, which I'm like, oh, yes. Yes, we are. Thank you,
*  Bob. Bobby.
*  I'm all for bullshitter and bullshitting. I'm not as big a fan of the liars and lying.
*  What's the distinction? You're talking about the art form of bullshitting?
*  Liars faking it, but not admitting to themselves that, yeah, it's a fucking creation. I'm faking it.
*  A liar, I'm lying to your face right now and I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my
*  right eye that lets you know, hey, go with me here. I think there's value in the bullshitting.
*  Now, the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you and I didn't let you know,
*  come on, I was telling the story about catching the fish. The fish always gets bigger every year
*  we tell a story. Come on, go with it. But the lying, all of a sudden,
*  I don't know my own. I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something,
*  telling the truth, being authentic or lying. And shit, all of a sudden I'm leaving crumbs with
*  myself. That constitution gets blurry. Lying to yourself and to others.
*  Yeah. Well, you start to lie, you lie to others enough, you start to lie to yourself and you
*  don't even know it. And that I believe is dangerous territory. That's why I'm trying
*  to push this admit because that goes, I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level
*  because we immediately jump to, well, I'm going to judge that. Boom, that's bad. That's wrong. No,
*  hold back on that. Let's go back to base level. Let's just admit that we all fucking do it.
*  Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves, lies we believe for convenience sake. I do it.
*  I'm guilty of it. I try to catch myself on it. If I can just call it and go, you know, you're
*  believing that lie out of convenience. I'm like, I know. And then I have to
*  see if I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or sharing with a friend.
*  You know, and I go, okay, well now I've inherently become a bullshitter then
*  because I admitted it. That I can shake hands with. That's the little slight wink to
*  ourselves and someone else go, come on, it's a better story this way.
*  And the course road trip, you start with step one, admit. How do you do that? How do you,
*  how do you kind of step back and
*  Do that in the Dory?
*  Yeah. Is there a trick to that?
*  Oh, there's a trick to it. I think it's just about courage of having the, because it's,
*  I don't think any of us like to admit
*  our lies or look deep enough in the go. I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my reality.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't want to be so puritanical.
*  As I say, again, that's why I say admit instead of judge, but I don't want to be so puritanical as
*  to go and admit it and get rid of it. No, I'm just saying admit it. Just bring it to the surface.
*  Yeah. I'm saying this and I'm doing something different.
*  I preached this, but I actually, my actions, just admit it. Just admit them. And
*  I think that's the first step to where we
*  I think that's the first step to where we
*  begin to either forgive ourselves and give ourselves some amnesty and go,
*  yeah, I'm a human trying to make it through life as best I can. I'm going to let myself slide on
*  that one. Okay. And maybe I've been getting away with it for so long, whole family, my whole network
*  works well on it. Okay. Forget this, get to the base of the truth of the matter. Let me do it,
*  but just admit it. And then where we'll, and then it will also help, it'll be easier to then
*  expose to ourselves. Which ones we go? No, I'm not letting myself slide on that one anymore.
*  That is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I
*  want in life. That's actually a lie I've been living that I haven't admitted that
*  is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be, deserve to be,
*  or I've earned to be, or just sort of let myself.
*  Gee, man, I had on, it's not all the hard stuff. Sometimes it can be a fun thing. I'm talking about
*  how many times we major in our minors. Let's admit where we sit there and we go,
*  all right, I give myself 12 hour workday, but I notice I'm spending eight on my hobbies
*  and four on my career. Well, I'm majoring in my minors. Well, let me admit that. There's the math.
*  Why don't we invert that? I've got four hours on my hobbies and eight on my career.
*  First off, just admitting it allows me to go and now I can do the math or rearrange the math
*  by time of day. But I look, I just found a hobby tennis, first hobby I've had in 25 years.
*  I had to admit that I went to play tennis for the start of love it for the first month. I started
*  feeling guilty. I was like, I'm happy. Is it okay to have this much fun? I'm having so much fun
*  and I'm getting a great workout. And to admit, I was like, yes, it's okay. Congratulations. But
*  you found something that you're finding quite pleasurable for straight pleasure. You don't have
*  to forget all this other stuff that yeah, but I'm also getting a workout. We are getting that too,
*  but you don't have to excuse the pleasure based on, oh, but it's good for you. Damn it. The real
*  reason you love it is because you're having so much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let
*  myself go, damn right, I'm going to play tennis again today or tomorrow. It was a simple fun thing.
*  So it's not always about the hardcore stuff that we have to go. This is a deep dark lie that I've
*  been living by and it's having me live falsely and it's having horrible consequences on my loved
*  ones. Some of those will probably arise and we admit. I think it's just having a look around
*  and just saying. And when we admit it, then we go, when we admit a lie, then we become something
*  much more valuable. A bullshitter. Yeah. You had the little wink in your eye. I love the distinction.
*  I'm bullshitting myself on that thing. Yep. I'm lying. Therefore, if I call it a lie,
*  I'm admitting a lie. Yep. Well, now, yep. I'm bullshitting. Yep. Now she's out. Didn't judge it.
*  But now I'm bullshitting. That I think we can work with. Well, you're an interesting case study
*  because you're one of the most famous, one of the most charismatic, successful humans in the world.
*  There's a lot, millions of people love you. Hang on every one of your words. That's a hard place to be.
*  How do you call yourself? How do you admit that you've been living a lie? How do you admit
*  yourself in big ways and small ways on lies at this point, given how many people love you,
*  how famous you are? 10 years ago. I don't know.
*  I don't know. Someone was talking about like,
*  yeah, they really admire this so-and-so person because they're not someone who looks in the
*  mirror. And I was like, yeah. And all of a sudden I was like, I gotta catch myself looking in the
*  mirror a lot. And then I go in and I look at my wife's side of her bathroom. How many?
*  Different creams and stuff she has out there. I look at my side, I got a lot more on my side.
*  I'm like, oh, I noticed how if I'm out and public working out, maybe doing push-ups,
*  and maybe I do a few more if there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to
*  impress, then I may even do a few more than I do if I was on my own. I'm like, you are vain, McConaughey.
*  And the kneejerk is, oh, vanity, bad, bad. And all of a sudden I was like,
*  all of a sudden I became a bullshitter. I want to admit it. I'm vain. I was like,
*  well, bravo, vanity. Let's go vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard in the lie section,
*  then I'm vain because that's a debit. No, admit it and then go, what's the value in it?
*  I can look at, yeah, I've actually gotten better shape because of my vanity. Actually, I eat better.
*  Better than that morning. And that led to being a better husband, better dad,
*  doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on.
*  But I know that tomorrow, when they leave town, they're going to remember this time that we had
*  together. That's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids or my wife, even though I'd
*  rather not be doing it at that time, I'd rather be doing something for myself. Because when they
*  leave tomorrow, they'll have this great memory that they spent with their dad right before they went.
*  I could call that vanity. I could group that and say, that's very vain of you. That was for self.
*  Yeah. Because it was also for something and someone that I cared about.
*  Are there people in your life that call you on your bullshit? In the bad sense of the word,
*  bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's either I got a pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with
*  my bullshit. Like what tickles me might bruise others to watch it. That's a good line.
*  Yeah. Tickles me might bruise others. But I also, I go back and talk about the bullshit.
*  That's over there with those mystical successes. It's the, yeah, no, don't go with it.
*  Don't pull a parachute yet. Let's see how far we can go. Let's see how hot it can get. Let's
*  try it one more time. Yes, two more please. Yeah.
*  That's where a lot of great pleasure and stories and successes will come from. Those are mystical.
*  They don't add up. It's like, we're not talking about reason right now. We're not talking logic.
*  Just go with this. Let's talk about the virtual and making it real. The old line of fake it till
*  you make it. I mean, what is that? There's something to that. There's definitely something to it.
*  But I would, where people go fake it, I would go back to Dylan's and create it, recreate it,
*  create and recreate it. Until it becomes, until you make it. So I'll have people call
*  my bullshit and a lot of times they're right. I think when I handle it the most healthy way is
*  I admit yes. And I'm aware. And I'm going to keep going.
*  So you're not like resisting it, denying it. Oh, I will. I will. And I have to watch that where I'm
*  like, no, I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. And usually when it's coming from people that
*  go, no, you are. I wouldn't admit it. And then that's where I'm telling a lie. And that'll come
*  up, get me later. And I'll go, I didn't see it. I didn't see I was doing that.
*  I was either unaware. I wouldn't let myself be aware. I was denying that I was doing that.
*  What would you say that's ego? Has ego been bad or good for you?
*  Gosh, I think it's been, thank you. I'm so thankful for ego.
*  Do, does it get off the bridle for me sometimes and run loose and run places and where it's
*  not of service to others and has it hurt loved ones and even strangers? Yes.
*  Um, but I also, when my ego is really strong,
*  it's, it's in sync with serving. It's in sync with where I serve myself,
*  also serves others. It's those two are part and parcel. They're intertwined. And that's the
*  capital ego that I think it hope we all need more of. And that's what I mean when I talk about
*  selfish. That's the redefining that the real true meaning of that is not doing something for self at
*  expense of your neighbor or harming others. It's
*  for personal profit and pleasure that also is profit and pleasure for
*  a utilitarian sense more of others. And there's a, there's again, back to the paradox that I think
*  there's a place, I know there's a place, I believe there's a place where those are in sync.
*  And when my ego's healthy, I'm able to
*  say, I'm sorry, sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harm somebody. I'm able to be more empathetic
*  because I got the confidence. Yeah. To be so I'm able to be more humble,
*  but still have my chin high and my heart high and look in the eye and go, yep, my bad, bogey,
*  guilty. I shanked that one out of bounds, man. That's beautifully put. So you go can be
*  constructive, not destructive. You won an Oscar for your performance in Dallas buyers club.
*  Can you tell the story of becoming that character Ron Woodruff? What was the toughest part?
*  Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part
*  was getting to know who he was in between the lines. We're based on a life story in an hour
*  and a half of film and script was great. But who was he in between the lines? Who was he before
*  he started a business, before he was on a crusade, before he went to alternative medicines?
*  You know, the obvious thing people always talk about, well, how'd you lose all that weight? That
*  was not hard. That was just a militaristic decision. This is what I can eat each day.
*  And if I do this each day for a week, I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week. So I'm going to give myself
*  five months to do that. 2.5 times as 10, there's 47 pounds. That was like clockwork. So that was
*  easy. That decision was made. I didn't go to the Pizza Hut buffet and have temptation in front of
*  me. I had certain meals. I ate that and the weight just went off like clockwork. It was the,
*  who is Ron Woodruff in between the lines? And the gift I got given that gave me the insight to who
*  that man was was I went to see his family and as I was leaving, his family offered me his diary.
*  And I remember it kind of has it going, wow, yes, but I kind of hesitated because it felt
*  maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have. I felt like it was kind of maybe
*  infringing a bit, but I opened my hand and took it. And what I got in the diary was I got to know who
*  Ron was before he had HIV. And the diary he'd write in and the dreamer he was and getting all
*  set on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning and making sure
*  that his little pager had fresh batteries in it because tomorrow morning he was going across
*  town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever. And then getting up that morning and
*  writing about what kind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was going to take to get over
*  across town to do that job and hook up those speakers. And then on the way over,
*  Paige coming in to say, no, we don't need you. We've gone with somebody else to hook them up.
*  And here he was all buttoned up, two cups of coffee in, hair slicked over, shirt ironed,
*  little less than half a tank of gas, but enough to get back home.
*  Now where's this Monday go?
*  The hope and the disappointment. You have to take all that in. That's part of that, man.
*  I'm just going to go to Sonic and get a double cheese bacon burger because
*  Sheila over there, man, she's kind of cute. She always gives me high price on it.
*  Which leads to rolling the joint, hanging off until Sheila gets off the work,
*  sneaking over to the local motel and shagging up in room 16. That's my lucky number, 16. Sheila!
*  Yeah!
*  Then wandering out that night, getting home one in the morning, no plans for Tuesday.
*  Maybe later in the week, think about what am I going to do about work or job? And these little
*  dreams would get me peak and want to, and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow
*  through or the deal would go south. That, knowing that in there was where I saw who,
*  he was a dreamer and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through. And then I
*  remembered his family said like, oh yeah, he invented it. He got patents on a whole bunch
*  of things, but he never would. He had things to get patent, but never would follow through to get
*  the government patent. And then later on you'd see the product be made or sold on QVC or something.
*  They'd be like, Ron, that was yours! Are they still your idea? Did you patent that? He'd be like,
*  no. There's something beautiful and sad about that, that let me inside who he was
*  in his heart and who he wanted to be and what he was hoping to be and trying to be,
*  couldn't quite pull off. When you go that deep, does a part of him stay in you forever?
*  Are you able to let go? I mean, I hope so. I get, I look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got
*  from him. Look, hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways in any character that I
*  go play. Cause that's, if you, if you, if you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome,
*  a need, I mean, the base one is life and death, whether that's the need to survive or the need
*  to stave off extinction. I'm not talking about what the rules, the laws are, the social mores,
*  the manners and graces. I'm fighting, you, you're going to fight for your own life in a world that's
*  not supporting you to do so. You, there's a wonderful courage of, okay, watch this. What do I got to lose?
*  My life or I'm in charge of extending it and get out of the way and I'll pick your pocket along
*  whatever it takes. So there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary to survive that I,
*  that I'm reminded of, that I learned from wrong. So on that line of survival between life and death,
*  you starred in a true detective, which I think explores some darker aspects of human nature.
*  What did you take from that, from that role, that experience philosophically, psychologically?
*  The freedom of, of, of being on an island. He was such a singular character and of a singular mind.
*  And as you know, it wasn't a dance party up there in his mind. It was some, some heavy stuff.
*  But also existentially for him, always like,
*  death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop out in a way. It'd also be,
*  he was not a man who was going to give himself amnesty and didn't allow it
*  from the rest of the world. It wouldn't give himself an out. And while living in his head
*  and heart and spirit was more of a hell than arguably dying, there was not no alternative.
*  That's not negotiable for that man. And that's why he was such a, that's why he was the best detective
*  that ever walked the earth. That's why he was such a superhero in a way to have that singular. You
*  don't go, Oh, I wish I was him. No, but you like, wow, that constitution, that clarity of identity.
*  Talk about a measure in a man's constitution. He didn't allow anybody off the hook, especially
*  himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty. You wanted him to
*  like, man, it's Saturday, bro. Can you go on a date? You wanted him to like, enjoy something, but
*  he was connected to something in his DNA, who's who he was, and something much
*  more baseline truth. And that's why he was such a good detective. So that, but there's an island,
*  as much as that company can be, as I said earlier on that Amazon trip, but it wouldn't join the
*  company. There's parts, I think that I maybe gave to myself to Rustin Cole and also that Rustin
*  Cole has given back to me that are like, yeah, when you're, when you want to pull the parachute,
*  cause you can't stand the company that you're in McConaughey in your own mind, the Socratic
*  dialogue is driving you fricking crazy. Don't pull the parachute, stick with it, go through it.
*  So you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his?
*  Tormented. I didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk. I didn't have as much patience for
*  small talk. I wasn't tormented. But the character was, and you have to embody him.
*  So is that, I mean, does some of that bleed over? Are you able to
*  separate the man you are from the character? It's not. Look, am I able to separate? Yeah,
*  I came home to my kids and when they walk in the door and greet me and go, what'd you do today?
*  And you got three kids under 10 years old. You don't tell them about the scene where you
*  help someone commit suicide. It's just, you know, so you turn it into a parable.
*  And actually I've always said this, having kids has made me a better actor, a better
*  storyteller because I have to parable-ize certain things, you know? And tell it in ways that go,
*  oh neat, you know? So
*  I, did I go, did I bring it home? I didn't bring torment. Did I bring introspection into my own?
*  The characters for me, and I think this is true for a lot of actors and actresses,
*  we don't, it's not a separation. If I've got, we each have everyone else in us. It's just seeing,
*  diving into Rust and Gold, knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nick Pizzolato,
*  who wrote the character and wrote the whole series, understanding, number one, what the hell am I
*  saying? What's he talking about? Then going deeper into that, well, that this person really
*  believes that. What does that say about how they move? Then I'm going all of a sudden, well, who
*  is that in me? What part of my left brain is locked into that? What part of my reptilian brain is
*  latched onto that? This other stuff is non-negotiable. Then I just live in that,
*  and I always talk like a 70s equalizer. Remember the old Marantz equalizers? You can move up your
*  500 HKZ, you move up your 60, you just rebalance the equalizer. It's just going to those parts of
*  me where I'll turn up the volume, some parts of the bass, the treble, and the equalizer, and turn
*  down other parts of myself. I'm not coming home tormented as Rust and Cole. Am I coming home
*  seeing torment where it should be seen? Am I reading the news differently or things coming
*  out of the news and catching my eye as being bullshit or lies or truth that is just hard and
*  going, yep, yeah, I'm seeing it through a different lens, but I'm seeing my own life through a
*  different lens, a lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through Rust and Cole.
*  I mean, the process of being an actor and actress, I guess, is a really interesting way
*  to be a philosopher of human nature. Yeah. I mean, it's an incredible dive into the humanities
*  and all the ologies and philosophy. As I said, as I opened up that question, being on an island is a
*  vacation. I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rust and Cole that this is an
*  interesting thing. I was as strong spiritually with my relationship with God
*  when I did True Detective as I've ever been. Why is that?
*  Yeah. Okay. Which you would say, wait a minute, in some ways, those are antonyms. No, but my...
*  Pretty safely can say that my own strength of spirit in my own personal life, Matthew's life,
*  that gave me the confidence to go further away, deeper into the torture and deeper into the
*  truth. But he was still always going after truth. That was the thing. He was not an evil man. I don't
*  even know if you can call him a non-believer, but he was always going after the truth and the truth
*  burned and he would take the scar and get burned for it. He'd die for it. Something was actually
*  biblical about that. But I don't think it's coincidence that I had so much
*  jour d'oeuvre of diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that
*  when I go out, I'll come up the other side. It's always like jumping in a pool of water.
*  Can you trust you'll come up the other side and not... You go play a criminal, you trust you're
*  going to come out the other side, a tyrant in real life. He's go, oh, God, I got to go
*  do that. Came out and I'm still alive. Got all my faculties. I'm not in jail. I'm whatever it is.
*  My own spirituality at that time definitely gave me a certain trust and confidence to go further into
*  the dark. It was announced that you'll be starring in a Yellowstone spinoff show.
*  What do you think about the cowboy ethos that permeates Yellowstone and other shows created
*  by Taylor Sheridan? You're a Texan. I am a Texan. Yeah. What do you think about that philosophy and
*  way of life? I admire the simplicity of it. One way you could explain Yellowstone and
*  that and Costner's role is what will man do to protect land and family
*  in a world that's trying to encroach, in a world where
*  there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing more clear earlier than other hats.
*  I admire that simplicity of right and wrong. And that the simplicity of that right and wrong
*  doesn't always correlate coincide with the law. No, it's above the law. You mentioned something
*  earlier. I don't remember where it was in the conversation, but it's a little bit of like,
*  okay, for law, I am handling this. I am. Yeah. And then it is,
*  law's not going to handle this. Therefore, I am. And then it is, I'm handling this.
*  Law, talk to them when you get to them. I'm handling this. There's an honesty to that.
*  It just seems, of course, it's dangerous because it's a slippery slope. Because of the power in
*  that power corrupts, it can be a slippery slope where you completely disregard the law and you
*  can hurt a lot of people. But when done right, there feels to be something really authentic
*  and human about that. Protect family, protect land above all else.
*  This is a broader question, but I'm going to piggyback it off of this.
*  Back to the dreams and reality and evolved species and how long we do in creating a
*  digital god and AI and these communities and friends that challenge us and think like us,
*  we like to hang out with. Do you think we're a less evolved species than we give ourselves
*  credit for? Do you think we give ourselves credit for being more evolved than we actually are?
*  I think we do. I do. I think we need to admit that.
*  I think probably the cowboy ethos is a step towards admitting that.
*  That's why it's so appealing to people. It wakes them up to realize that we're not so far
*  from our ancestors. That the values of loyalty are really important.
*  Do you think we can trust on the basic human level?
*  How do you know if you can trust someone? I don't know if I can trust someone. Well,
*  I don't know a trick to it. I do not know a trick to it, but I do come in
*  as I believe you do with high trust. I come in with a, I'm told, sometimes I think I'm
*  told that I trust too much sometimes. Have you been hurt? Have you been betrayed?
*  If you have, has that hurt your willingness to trust?
*  No, it hurt. I put that person and those people in another category back here and do my best not to
*  let them know that it bothered me at all, but I know when I am with those people.
*  By a new person, you're still willing to trust them?
*  No, I'm not going to do that. I think that's the beginning of cynicism, which I think is a
*  horrible disease of getting older. I'm not going to do that.
*  So you're fighting cynicism off as much as you can?
*  No way. No way. No way. There's no residual in it. There's no win. It's easy. It's clever.
*  Gets the laugh at the party. And if it sleeps well, it shouldn't be.
*  Don't get comfortable in the cynicism. I have to ask you about being a Texan.
*  You're like, when I think Texas, I think Matthew McConaughey. What's it mean to be a Texan to you?
*  I recently moved to Austin, Texas some two years in.
*  All right. All right. Welcome.
*  What's it mean to be a Texan? Educate us.
*  Texans. Educate us. Texas is about independence.
*  Politically, Texas is not about Republican or Democrat. It's about independence,
*  independence of spirit, sovereignty. Texas is about exploration. One of the things I
*  love about Texas is I run into so many Texans around the world. Texans are taught to go
*  be conservative or learn who we are, then go. Go. Explore. Pioneer. Journey. And hopefully,
*  you come on back with some goods and some stories, you Texan.
*  And underneath that is this kind of freedom of being an individual in the full meaning of that
*  word. Yeah. Well, Texas is liberal on your entrance. Very liberal on your entrance.
*  That's regulation. Hey, welcome. High trust. High trust, sir. Welcome to our state. Come on in. Yes.
*  Yes. Yes. But if you light sheet steel, we're conservative on our consequences.
*  Oh, that's a good line. You've briefly pondered running for governor. I don't know if that's in
*  your future. I hope it is. You had a few good lines about it. Do you think about that kind of stuff,
*  about what the future holds in terms of political office? I don't think about it in terms of
*  political office. I've graduated to a broader, larger thought of what's my future hold and where
*  would I be most useful as a leader. I think that's a fair word. Whether that's
*  thought, whether that's the leader of my family right now. It's a parent, it's a father.
*  I'm a leader of people that work with me. Politics, I'm not going to say it's because
*  it's not small. That's why I say that out loud. It's not small. I do think it needs
*  to re-engineer and redefine what its purpose is. It's just chasing its own tail right now
*  with the two parties that seem to me to be completely about just invalidation of the
*  opposition instead of vision of themselves. I think it needs redefinition of what it is,
*  because it is important. That's why I said I don't mean small. It needs to think bigger about what it
*  is and how it's useful. When it seeks to invalidate its small, when it seeks vision,
*  it can be big. Yes. Well, one's affirmative, one's going into that cynicism we were talking about.
*  And invalidation of any opposing thought or maybe that we're even opposing opposition is an arrogant
*  term that's too strong. It's a lot of times not even opposition. Alternative, other than,
*  another way of thinking about it. Oh, could both be true? Oh, how can we parlay those two ideas?
*  One of the challenges with these ideas of a third party or
*  meet you in the middle, it's got this historic notion of being, oh, well,
*  come see, come saw, it's sort of Mr. In-between, kind of go which way the wind blows.
*  I think done in the right way. It doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily,
*  but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now. And it's actually,
*  and I love sports, it's tactically the place with which
*  to move most advantageously. I think of their free safety in the game of football.
*  They're in the middle of the field and they're deep. They choose to defend left or right
*  according to the play that's been called by the offense.
*  Similar to the offense, the running back, you read the defense and then you're going to run
*  right to run left to go away from that opposition. It's a tactical spot.
*  To be truly independent and respond.
*  And respond.
*  So do you think you have a role in that in political office or?
*  I don't know. It's on mind. It's not out of my mental box. And I gave it real sincere thought
*  and discernment for over a year.
*  And it's a wonderful, whether I end up in politics or not, it was a wonderful exercise.
*  One that if anyone else got time to do it, do it. To ask yourself what you would do if you were CEO
*  of a state, CEO of a nation, CEO of the world. That's a great thing to go. You want to get your
*  values in line? You want to admit where you lie and throw yourself some pop quizzes? And what if
*  this phone call comes at 4 a.m.? Who you want to surround yourself with? It's really great
*  questions to ask and I think has helped me at a more micro level be a better father, a better man.
*  Taking considerations that I did not maybe take in as seriously before considering it.
*  I don't know if that's in my future. I got to, useful is a big word. I would have to be useful.
*  I have to be useful in the right way. And is that my lane to be most useful?
*  It's a good question for a leader to ask. How can I be useful?
*  I have to ask you about Interstellar. So I think it's an incredible film. I've seen it
*  inspire so many scientists and engineers. It's just a philosopher, everybody, humans,
*  it explores space travel, physics of space time, human nature, human condition, human connection.
*  How has that film expanded your understanding of the universe and our place in it?
*  Yeah. Well, it's got the old Mr. Mayor on the corner, how big is that cloud metaphor in it?
*  Because that was the character I played, Cooper's, that was the existential question for him.
*  Head down, practical, stay here, be a father to my children.
*  But his dream before his children were to go explore space. So when he's taking that
*  truck out and the countdown's going down, that's the hinge of the existential question
*  that we all face in some form.
*  The sense of time, which I think everyone loves, that sense of where time can run at different
*  speeds. And there's an incredible scene where Cooper's a father getting video feed from his
*  children who've aged and he's realizing he's missed all that.
*  Yeah. Overall, that concept makes me consider and imagine. I'm going to talk about mystical
*  successes instead of engineered ones. Like the engineered ones, there's ethos from that film and
*  what Nolan put into that film and theories that make me go, yeah, what does any of this matter?
*  Maybe we are, maybe we're... It makes me go, maybe this is all, it's already all been written.
*  What's happening right now in this flip of time you're here, 53 years so far, we'll see how many
*  we get. What other parallel timelines are happening out there? Is it small-minded of us to define
*  life on other planets as only something that can live within a climate that has water in this amount
*  of O2? Those terms may be too small. What do you mean? Are we saying only life has to have water in
*  this amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide? Maybe there's a whole redefinition of the ingredients
*  that other life forms need. It's sure in a similar way to Contact, which is a movie I did with Bob
*  Zemeckis, inspires me that the universe is more active and lively and God's backyard is bigger
*  than I thought. And wow, that's exciting. And people go now, you believe in extra-stressful life?
*  I said, yes, man, I think it'd be arrogant not to. I sure hope so.
*  You think there's alien civilizations all out there, intelligent ones, just far on distant stars?
*  I hope so. And I think it's possible. We have many among us right here.
*  Why? And I go for the why not in that, just to keep that train of thought open to learn and
*  consider those existential questions. I think it'd be arrogant not to.
*  There's so many hundreds of billions of planets just in our galaxy.
*  Just in ours.
*  I can't imagine there's not life out there. But I suspect it's very different, like you said,
*  than we are. And we have to have a humility to open our eyes to how different life could be.
*  And if and when we cross it,
*  unlike we've had tendency to do when we try to go with some nation takeovers, I think
*  it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any other life form civilization
*  wants to take over territories, to go into it with thinking that, okay, this is an opposition.
*  I think that's a human trait of ours. And to consider that another life
*  form would have an interest that more land or more territory is good for them, I think is a
*  shallow idea. I think of it more like when I think of heaven, those considerations are not
*  in anyone's mind, heart, or intent in the heaven that I think of. So in other civilizations, these
*  things, I hope that we would just see and learn that it would be the natural side of welcoming.
*  It wouldn't be a primate response to, no, I have fire and you're coming over trying to put it out,
*  or I have food and you're trying to steal my food. I don't think it would be,
*  I think it's a shallow thought to think that, oh, it's going to be about ownership and
*  we'd be trespassing. I don't think they would have a sense of borders as we do.
*  I just hope we humans are smart enough to detect and to see aliens
*  because of how different they are. We often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence.
*  It's very possible that trees are extremely intelligent if we zoom out at a different
*  time scale, a different, like just look at stuff from a bigger perspective that's outside of being
*  so human-centric. It's a great quote that someone told me, this astrophysicist told me this,
*  how accurate it is or not. Someone else can argue the validity of what I'm about to say or not,
*  but I thought it really was a perspective grabber for me. Like, look, see, the universe was created
*  at midnight. Humans came around at 1159 and 36 seconds.
*  I love the little analogies that put that frame like that make it, oh, yeah, pale blue dot. There
*  it is, that perspective, something so relaxing and empowering about that at the same time and humbling
*  but confidence boosting, you know, allows forgiveness, allows ambition. I just love the
*  perspective of that, that picture, to picture it that way in our timeline.
*  Do you hope humans become a multipolitary species as we're trying to do, as SpaceX is pushing
*  forward, traveling out to Mars, potentially colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets?
*  Yeah. I love the ambition of it. I love the pioneering nature of it. I love the extension
*  of what we consider as our backyard becoming more four-dimensional like that, not at the expense of
*  we still got stuff to take care of. We got gardens to tend right here and sure as hell not to go,
*  not to quit on us to go, oh, let's get out of here because this isn't really working.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We got a tithe we're still supposed to pay here.
*  That's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization and species.
*  As a civilization and species, whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that
*  let's figure out how to adapt the best we can. No, not at the expense of quitting here on Earth.
*  But let a few select folks explore. Yeah.
*  Because that's like a... I say go for it, please.
*  One of the coolest things that we humans do is kind of embody the human spirit.
*  Reach out into the unknown. But it's hard. I mean, as interstellar shows and so on, it's...
*  Yeah. Well, and Elon talks about it. It's not going to be a weekend Daisy trip.
*  And he's just speculating how hard it could be. Much harder in different ways that he doesn't
*  understand yet. You know? Yeah. Well, that dance between the impossible and the inevitable,
*  that's definitely there with what SpaceX is doing, what all the folks
*  who are trying to become a multi-person species are doing. It's really hard. It's like...
*  Build rockets that fight off gravity in a cost-effective way is really hard. SpaceX is
*  close to being bankrupt several times. It's just hard. But it's also inspiring that
*  some people are just crazy enough, bold enough to keep trying. Yeah.
*  What advice would you give to young folks? What advice would I give?
*  In high school and college that are thinking of how to make their way in this world.
*  If you haven't already, can you...
*  Can you define what you have an innate ability for and match that with what you're willing to
*  hustle to get? Yeah. Sometimes we have an innate ability, but we don't want to work for it. We
*  take it for granted. And we end up doing something that may work. I pay the bills. It gets by day
*  to day. But we don't really like it. We have trouble finding a way to enjoy it. Definitely
*  don't love it. And then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling
*  and working our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at
*  on an innate level. And that's a good challenge. And you can work and become good at something
*  that you don't have an innate ability for. But if you can match those two, what do you have an
*  innate ability to do? Because we have an innate ability to do. When we do that well, we do enjoy
*  it. And one of the things that requires is to be really honest with yourself at what your innate
*  ability is. Because oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up, people telling you
*  what you're good at and not good at. Really, you have to look at yourself, listen to yourself,
*  that inner, like a deep rigorous self-analysis of what am I actually good at? Not what I hope to be
*  good at, but what I'm actually good at. Right. And then if you look at that and you can define those
*  two, hopefully you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply.
*  You found love with Camila Alves McConaughey. What advice would you give to people on how to
*  do just that? How to find love? This wonderful subject's been discussed since the beginning of
*  time, hasn't it? Love it. So I can tell you what things I've kind of learned and I'm still learning.
*  You know, love is one of those mystical successes. It doesn't make sense.
*  You know, when I was before I met Camila, I was coming on to my
*  late thirties. As much as I'm not a person that is guided by timelines,
*  my life had not really added up to what I thought it was going to be relationship-wise. I thought
*  that by that time I would have met the woman I loved, got married and started a family,
*  and that hadn't happened. And I did find myself doing that thing I was doing at the Amazon,
*  looking around the corner. Any prospective possible female I met that I was attracted to,
*  I was like, maybe it's the one. I make the joke, but it's true. It's like at every red light,
*  I'm like checking out who's next to me in the produce section at the supermarket. I'm like,
*  Joe's in the produce section. You know, it's like looking. When you're in that zone,
*  you can also be a little intrusive. You can trespass on people's… You can get outside
*  of yourself. You can be overly impressed and not as involved and have your own constitution
*  and sit back. And therefore, if you're outside of yourself, you're less attractive to your possible
*  mate. I've got a series of dreams that I've written about, but I had one then that was very
*  spiritual. That was me as an 88-year-old bachelor who never got married, and it was a beautiful
*  dream. Where on paper, I thought that should be a nightmare. It wasn't. What that dream did for me
*  was allow me to go. You may not find the woman for you and get married and have a life with her.
*  That may not be. And for the first time in life, I was okay with that. More than intellectually,
*  spiritually, I was like, okay. Then I'm moving through the world. And on this particular night,
*  as myself, not intruding… I was inviting. I did see her move across the room and did not say,
*  who is that? I said, what is that? And then did move to call her across the room. So I did invite,
*  but I was not outside of myself. I was able to be myself with her, what my eyes saw,
*  everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed in, more details got known,
*  and we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time,
*  became true and then some. But not every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across
*  the room turned out to be true and then some, just the image. We had a similar moral bottom line
*  about life, each other, how we treat ourselves, what we respect, what our own constitutions were.
*  We had similar perspectives on raising children, which is very important.
*  To me and her. And then we just enjoyed each other's company. And we laughed together
*  and we supported each other and we promoted more of each other and we lit each other's fire.
*  And if one was rolling, we kept dishing, go again, take the next shot, more, more, more, more.
*  This was a biggie too. Getting excited for each other's success.
*  Yes. Yes. To be able, I think it's very important. We all have jealousy. I get it.
*  But it's very important to be able, if you can, be happy for your lover when they succeed
*  or are succeeding or are across the room at the party laughing with a stranger
*  to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you.
*  She was, I would be away, she would, the questions and the talks we would have,
*  she was happy for me about how excited I was about my day and my day had nothing to do with her.
*  Yeah. She wasn't there. And I found myself not telling myself to be happy for her, but being
*  really, really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her.
*  And as much as I went through my head, oh, I'd have been great if I would have been there.
*  I was like, no, I don't want to trespass on that. That you had that. Yeah.
*  Independent of me. Bravo.
*  That's a choice you make not to give any time to the jealousy,
*  to the very natural jealousy that we humans have.
*  It sure doesn't have any, I don't see the residuals in it.
*  True. I've got it. I've had it. And I have it. I just don't,
*  you know, I haven't seen where it has any payback.
*  I got to ask you the biggest possible question. What's the meaning of this whole thing?
*  What's the meaning of life? Right? Matthew McConaughey. Why? Why are we here?
*  I don't know why we're here. I prescribed to, in a religious sense, the restoration order.
*  We're here to restore order. In a religious sense, I really purchased that and loved that incentive
*  and loved that view. But I don't really know why we're here. But I do know, to go back to the front,
*  we are here. That part's inevitable. So now let's flip the script and go to the why not.
*  Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything, Eric, and we can argue it out,
*  the base of it, all I can come up with is, well, just keep living, man. I mean,
*  what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do? When we know exactly
*  what we want to do. Make it matter. Even when it doesn't matter, that matters.
*  For what? I don't know. For the fun of it, that matters.
*  Yeah. Our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd, it's kind of cool.
*  And we share it with each other. We get excited. And we create some pretty cool stuff along the
*  way. I mean, I say I'm confident enough, and I might be arrogant, for me to say, but I do believe
*  that we're here to, each generation, have a small ascension.
*  Or else, what's it for? And we're not really sure what the ascension is towards.
*  Just kind of up. No? No? I just think it's up. I do think it's just up. I do think that
*  it is definitely arrogant to think
*  that we as a species or generation or people or humanity are going to reach the top of the
*  ascended staircase and go, ta-da! I think that is not only false, but I think it's full-hearted.
*  And I think it's a recipe for having more angst and even cynicism we talked about, and unrest and
*  lack of seeing beauty and joy in this life while we're in it. I think life's a verb.
*  Live it as best we can. Hopefully. I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I'm just,
*  I don't have a grand plan, man. I'm just trying to connect the damn dot.
*  I'm confused, frustrated. I don't know what, I don't feel any gravity or building or lineage
*  to it towards what I'm doing. And I'm just like going, what's that Peterson line? If you don't
*  believe in having to do what you can to get as far away from hell as possible. Sometimes,
*  it's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying to like, man, just don't sink the ship right now.
*  Just keep your head above water. Maintain, just try and hold on.
*  And hopefully give yourself a chance to notice the magic, the mystical. I try to do that when
*  it gets rough. Because it's there. I do believe it's all around us all the time. Just are we on a
*  frequency to allow ourselves to receive it and see it? We've got to tune the radio. Yeah.
*  Because if we look for it too hard, we see false idols. And if we don't look at all,
*  we become callous and miss it all. Yeah. It's a fun little life we got. Yeah. Matthew,
*  I'm a huge fan. I think you're an incredible person. Thank you for all the, everything you've
*  created in this world. Thank you for being a unique human that inspires millions. And thank
*  you for talking today. I was nervous, but you made me feel at home. That was beautiful.
*  Well, I felt at home talking with you as well. Thanks for sharing that with me. I could go on
*  and on. Just two Texans. That's right. Having a good old chat. Newly moved off in Texas. Here we go.
*  All right. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew
*  McConaughey. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Matthew McConaughey himself. Don't walk into a
*  place like you want to buy it. Walk in like you own it. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you
*  next time.
