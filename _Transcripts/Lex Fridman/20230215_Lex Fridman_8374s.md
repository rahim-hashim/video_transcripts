# Andrew Strominger: Black Holes, Quantum Gravity, and Theoretical Physics | Lex Fridman Podcast #359
**Lex Fridman:** [February 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3cw_9ELpQw)
*  A black hole is a mirror. And the way it's a mirror is if light, a photon, bounces off your face
*  towards the black hole, it goes straight to the black hole, just falls in, you never see it again.
*  But if it just misses the black hole, it'll swing around the back and come back to you.
*  Yeah.
*  And you see yourself from the photon that went around the back of the black hole.
*  But not only can that happen, the black hole, the photon can swing around twice
*  and come back. So you actually see an infinite number of copies of yourself.
*  The following is a conversation with Andrew Strominger, theoretical physicist at Harvard,
*  whose research seeks to shed light on the unification of fundamental laws of nature,
*  the origin of the universe, and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons.
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Strominger.
*  You are part of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative, which has theoretical physicists,
*  experimentalists, and even philosophers. So let me ask the big question. What is a black hole
*  from a theoretical, from an experimental, maybe even from a philosophical perspective?
*  So a black hole is defined theoretically as a region of space-time from which
*  light can never escape, therefore it's black. Now, that's just the starting point.
*  Many weird things follow from that basic definition, but that is the basic definition.
*  What is light? They can't escape from a black hole.
*  Well, light is the stuff that comes out of the sun, that stuff that goes into your eyes.
*  Light is one of the stuff that disappears when the lights go off.
*  This is stuff that appears when the lights come on.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition or physical mathematical definition,
*  but I think it's something that we all understand very intuitively.
*  What is light? Black holes, on the other hand, we don't understand intuitively. They're very weird.
*  And what are the questions is about black holes, which I think you were alluding to,
*  is why doesn't light get out? Or how is it that there can be a region of space-time
*  from which light can't escape? It definitely happens. We've seen those regions. We have
*  spectacular pictures, especially in the last several years of those regions. They're there.
*  In fact, they're up in the sky, thousands or millions of them. We don't yet know how many.
*  But the proper explanation of why light doesn't escape from
*  a black hole is still a matter of some debate. One explanation,
*  which perhaps Einstein might have given, is that light carries energy. You know it carries energy
*  because we have photo cells and we can take the light from the sun and collect it, turn it into
*  electricity. So there's energy in light. And anything that carries energy is subject to a
*  gravitational pull. Gravity will pull at anything with energy. Now it turns out that the gravitational
*  pull exerted by an object is proportional to its mass. And so if you get enough mass in
*  a small enough region, you can prevent light from escaping. And let me flesh that out a little more.
*  If you're on the Earth and you're on a rocket ship leaving the surface of the Earth,
*  and if we ignore the friction from the air, if your rocket accelerates up to 11 km per second,
*  that's escape velocity. And if there were no friction, it could just continue forever
*  to the next galaxy. On the Moon, which has less mass, it's only 7 km per second.
*  But going in the other direction, if you have enough mass in one place, the escape velocity
*  can become the speed of light. If you shine light straight up away from the Earth, it doesn't have
*  too much trouble. It's going way above the escape velocity. But if you have enough mass there,
*  even light can't escape the escape velocity. And according to Einstein's theory of relativity,
*  there is an absolute speed limit in the universe, the speed of light, and nothing
*  makes any sense. Nothing could be self-consistent if there were objects that could exceed light speed.
*  And so in these very, very massive regions of space-time, even light cannot escape.
*  LW And the interesting thing is Einstein himself didn't think that these objects,
*  we call the black holes, could exist. But let me actually linger on this.
*  Yeah, that's incredibly interesting.
*  LW There's a lot of interesting things here. First, the speed limit. How wild is it to you,
*  if you put yourself in the mind in the time of Einstein before him, to come up with a speed
*  limit, that there is a speed limit, and that speed limit is the speed of light. How difficult
*  of an idea is that? You said from a mathematical physics perspective, everything just kind of falls
*  into place, but he wasn't perhaps maybe initially had the luxury to think mathematically, he had to
*  come up with it intuitively, yes? So like what, how common intuitive is this notion to you?
*  Is it still crazy?
*  LW No, no. So it's a very funny thing in physics. The best discoveries
*  seem completely obvious in retrospect. Even my own discoveries, which of course are far lesser
*  than Einstein's, but many of my papers, many of my collaborators get all confused. We'll try to
*  understand something, we say, we've got to solve this problem. We'll get all confused. Finally,
*  we'll solve it. We'll get it all together. And then we'll, all of a sudden everything will fall
*  into place. We'll explain it. And then we'll look back at our discussions for the proceedings of
*  months and literally be unable to reconstruct how confused we were and how we could ever have thought
*  of it any other way. So not only can I not fathom how confused Einstein was before he, when, you
*  know, when he started thinking about the issues, I can't even reconstruct my own confusion from,
*  from two weeks ago. You know, so the really beautiful ideas of physics have this very hard
*  to get yourself back into the mindset. Of course, Einstein was confused about many, many things.
*  It doesn't matter if you're a physicist. It's not how many things you got wrong.
*  It's not the ratio of how many you got wrong, how many you got right. It's the number that you got
*  right. So Einstein didn't believe black holes existed, even though he predicted them. And I
*  went and I read that paper, which he wrote, you know, Einstein wrote down his field equations in
*  1915. And Schwarzschild solved them and discovered the black hole solution
*  three or four months later in very early 1916. And 25 years later, Einstein wrote a paper.
*  So with 25 years to think about what this solution means, wrote a paper in which he said that black
*  holes didn't exist. And I'm like, well, you know, if one of my students in my general relativity
*  course wrote this, you know, I wouldn't pass them.
*  You get a C minus. Oh, you wouldn't pass them. Okay.
*  You get a C minus. Okay. Same thing with gravity waves. He didn't believe-
*  Oh, he didn't believe in gravitational waves either?
*  He went back and forth, but he wrote a paper in, I think, 34, saying that gravity waves didn't exist
*  because people were very confused about what a coordinate transformation is. And in fact,
*  this confusion about what a coordinate transformation is has persisted. And we actually
*  think we were on the edge of solving it 100 years later. 100 years later.
*  Well, what is coordinate transformation as it was 100 years ago to today?
*  Let's imagine I want to draw a map with pictures of all the states and the mountains, and then I
*  want to draw the weather forecast, what the temperatures are going to be all over the
*  country. And I do that using one set of weather stations, and I number the weather stations.
*  And you have some other set of weather stations, and you do the same thing. So the coordinates are
*  the locations of the weather stations. They're how we describe where the things are. At the end
*  of the day, we should draw the same map. That is coordinate invariance. And if we're going to tell
*  somebody at a real physical operation, we want you to stay as dry as possible on your drive from
*  here to California, we should give them exactly the same route. No matter which weather stations
*  we use or how we... It's a very trivial... The labeling of points is an artifact and not in
*  the real physics. So it turns out that that's almost true, but not quite. There's some subtleties
*  to it. The statement that you should always have the same... Give at least the same kind of
*  trajectory, the same kind of instructions, no matter the weather stations. Yeah, there's some
*  very delicate subtleties to that, which began to be noticed in the 50s. It's mostly true, but when
*  you have a space time with edges, it gets very tricky how you label the edges.
*  And space time in terms of space or in terms of time, in terms of everything, just space time?
*  Either one, space or time. That gets very tricky. And Einstein didn't have it right.
*  And in fact, he had an earlier version of general relativity in 1914, which he was very excited about,
*  which was wrong. It wasn't fully coordinate invariant, it was only partially coordinate
*  invariant. It was wrong. It gave the wrong answer for bending light to the sun by a factor of two.
*  There was an expedition sent out to measure it during World War I. They were captured
*  before they could measure it. And that gave Einstein four more years to clean his act up,
*  by which time he'd gotten it right. So it's a very tricky business. But once it's all laid out,
*  it's clear. Then why do you think Einstein didn't believe his own equations and didn't
*  think that black holes are real? Why was that such a difficult idea for him?
*  Well, something very interesting happens in Schwarzschild's solution of the Einstein equation.
*  I think his reasoning was ultimately wrong, but let me explain to you what it was.
*  At the center of the black hole, behind the horizon, in a region that nobody can
*  see and live to tell about it, at the center of the black hole, there's a singularity. And if you
*  pass the horizon, you go into the singularity, you get crushed, and that's the end of everything.
*  Now, the word singularity just means that Einstein's equations break down.
*  They become infinite. You write them down. You put them on the computer. When the computer
*  hits that singularity, it crashes. Everything becomes infinite. There's two.
*  So the equations are just no good there. Now, that's actually
*  not a bad thing. It's a really good thing. And let me explain why.
*  So it's an odd thing that Maxwell's theory and Newton's theory never exhibit this phenomena.
*  You write them down. You can solve them exactly. They're really Newton's theory of gravity. They're
*  really very simple theories. You can solve them. Well, you can't solve the three-body problem, but
*  you can certainly solve a lot of things about them.
*  Nevertheless, there was never any reason, even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps
*  fell for this trap, there were never any reason to think that these equations were exact.
*  And there's no equation. Well, there's some equations that we've written down that we still
*  think are exact. Some people still think are exact. My view is that there's no exact equation.
*  Everything is an approximation.
*  Everything is an approximation.
*  And you're trying to get as close as possible. So you're saying objective truth doesn't exist in
*  this world. The Internet's going to be very mad.
*  We could discuss that, but that's a different thing. We wouldn't say Newton's theory was wrong.
*  It had very, very small corrections, incredibly small corrections. It's actually a puzzle why
*  they're so small. So if you watch the procession of Mercury's perihelion, this was the first
*  indication of something going wrong. According to the first theory, it's a very small thing.
*  Newton's theory, Mercury has an elliptical orbit. The long part of it moves around as other planets
*  come by and perturb it and so on. So this was measured by Le Verrier in 1859, and he compared
*  theory and experiment, and he found out that the perihelion process moves around the sun.
*  Once every 233 centuries instead of every 231 centuries.
*  Now, this is the wonderful thing about science. Why was this guy? I mean, you don't get any idea
*  how much work this is, but of course, he made one of the greatest discoveries in the
*  history of science without even knowing what good it was going to be.
*  So that's how small... That was the first sign that there was something wrong with Newton.
*  So the corrections to Newton's law are very, very small, but they're definitely there.
*  The corrections to electromagnetism, they're mostly... The ones that we see are mostly
*  coming from quantum effects.
*  So the corrections for Maxwell's equations is when you get super tiny, and then the corrections
*  for Newton's laws of gravity is when you get super big. That's when you require corrections.
*  That's true, but I would phrase it as saying when it's super accurate. If you look at the Bohr atom,
*  you know, Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very good approximation to the force between the proton
*  and the electron. The quantum mechanics... If you didn't have quantum mechanics, the electron
*  would spiral into the proton and the atom would collapse. So that's a huge correction there.
*  Sure. So every theory gets corrected as we learn more.
*  There'd just be no reason to suppose that it should be otherwise.
*  How does this relate to the singularity? Why the singularity is uncomfortable?
*  So when you hit the singularity, you know that you need some improvement to Einstein's theory
*  of gravity. And that improvement, we understand what kind of things that improvement should
*  involve. It should involve quantum mechanics, quantum effects become important there. It's
*  a small thing. And we don't understand exactly what the theory is, but we know there's no reason
*  to think... Einstein's theory was invented to describe weakly curved things, the solar system,
*  and so on. It's incredibly robust that we now see that it works very well near the horizons
*  around black holes and so on. So it's a good thing that the theory drives itself,
*  that it predicts its own demise. Newton's gravity had its demise. There were regimes
*  in which it wasn't valid. Maxwell's electromagnetism had its demise. There were
*  regimes in which quantum effects greatly modified the equations. But general relativity, all on its
*  own, found a system which originally was fine, would perversely wander off into a configuration
*  in which Einstein's equations no longer applied. So to you, the edges of the theory are wonderful,
*  the failures of the theory? Edges are wonderful because that keeps us in business.
*  One of the things you said, I think, in your TED talk, that the fact that quantum mechanics and
*  relativity don't describe everything and then they clash is wonderful. I forget the adjective
*  you used, but it was something like this. So why is that? Why is that interesting? Do you mean
*  that same way that there's contradictions that create discovery? There's no question in my mind,
*  of course, many people would disagree with me, that now is the most
*  wonderful time to be a physicist. So people look back at it's a classical thing to say
*  among physicists, I wish it were 1920. Quantum mechanics had been just understood.
*  There was the periodic table. But in fact, that was such a rich thing that
*  a lot of exciting stuff happened around 1920. It took a whole century to sort out the new
*  insights that we got. Especially adding some experimental stuff into the bunch, actually
*  making observations and adding all the data. Computers also help with visualizations and all
*  that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a whole sort of wonderful century. I mean, the seed of
*  general relativity was the incompatibility of Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field
*  with Newton's laws of gravity. They were incompatible because if you look at Maxwell's
*  theory, there's a contradiction if anything goes faster than the speed of light.
*  But Newton's theory of gravity, the gravitational field, the gravitational force, is
*  instantaneously transmitted across the entire universe. If you had a friend in another galaxy
*  with a very sensitive measuring device that could measure the gravitational field, they could just
*  take this cup of coffee and move it up and down in Morse code and they could get the message
*  instantaneously over another galaxy. That leads to all kinds of contradictions. It's not self-consistent.
*  It was exactly in resolving those contradictions that Einstein came up with the general theory
*  of relativity. It's fascinating how this contradiction, which seems like maybe it's
*  kind of technical thing, led to a whole new vision of the universe. Now, let's not get fooled because
*  lots of contradictions are technical things. We run into other kinds of contradictions
*  that are technical and they don't seem to... We understood something wrong. We made a mistake.
*  We set up our equations in the wrong way. We didn't translate the formalisms.
*  As opposed to revealing some deep mystery that's yet to be uncovered.
*  We're never very sure which are the really important ones.
*  But to you, the difference between quantum mechanics and general relativity,
*  the tension, the contradiction there seems to hint at some deeper thing that's
*  going to be discovered in the century.
*  Yes, because that one has been understood since the 50s. Pauli was the
*  first person to notice it. Hawking in the early 70s gave it a really much more visceral form.
*  People have been hurling themselves at it, trying to reduce it to some
*  technicality, but nobody has succeeded. The efforts to understand it have led to
*  all kinds of interesting relations between quantum systems and applications to other fields and so on.
*  Well, let's actually jump around. We'll return to black holes. I have a million questions there,
*  but let's go into this unification, the battle against the contradictions and the tensions
*  between the theories of physics. What is quantum gravity? What is the standard model of physics?
*  What is quantum mechanics? What is general relativity? What's quantum gravity?
*  What are all the different unification efforts? Again, five questions.
*  Yeah. It's a theory that describes everything with astonishing accuracy. It's the most
*  accurate theory in the history of human thought. Theory and experiment have been
*  successfully compared to 16 decimal place. We have that stenciled on the door where I work.
*  It's an amazing feat of the human mind. It describes the electromagnetic interaction,
*  unifies the electromagnetic interaction with the so-called weak interaction, which you need some
*  good tools to even view the weak interaction. Then there's the strong interaction,
*  which binds the quarks into protons. The forces between them are mediated by something called
*  Yang-Mills theory, which is a beautiful mathematical generalization of electromagnetism
*  system, in which the analogs of the photons themselves carry charge.
*  The final piece of this, of the standard model, everything in the standard model has been observed.
*  Its properties have been measured. The final particle to be observed was the Higgs particle
*  observed over a decade ago. Higgs is already a decade ago.
*  I think it is. Yeah. Wow. Time flies.
*  But you better check me on that. Yeah. That's true, but so much fun has been happening.
*  So much fun has been happening. That's all pretty well understood. There are some things
*  that might or might not around the edges of that, dark matter, neutrino masses,
*  some sort of fine points or things we haven't quite measured perfectly and so on. But
*  it's largely a very complete theory, and we don't expect anything very new conceptually.
*  In the completion of that. Anything contradictory by new?
*  Anything contradictory. I'll have some wild questions for you
*  on that front. But yeah, anything that, yeah, because there's no gaps. It's so accurate,
*  so precise in its predictions. It's hard to imagine something completely new.
*  Yeah. And it was all based on something called, let me not explain what it is. Let me just throw
*  out the buzzword, renormalizable quantum field theory. They all fall in the category of
*  renormalizable quantum field theory. I'm going to throw that at a bar later to impress
*  the girls. Good luck.
*  Thank you. They all fall under that rubric. Gravity will not put that suit on.
*  So the force of gravity cannot be tamed by the same renormalizable quantum field theory
*  to which all the other forces so eagerly submit it.
*  What is the effort of quantum gravity? What are the different efforts to
*  have these two dance together effectively to try to unify the standard model and
*  general relativity, any kind of model of gravity?
*  Sort of the one fully consistent model that we have that reconciles,
*  that sort of tames gravity and reconciles it with quantum mechanics,
*  is string theory and its cousins. We don't know what or if in any sense string theory describes
*  the world, the physical world, but we do know that it is a consistent reconciliation of quantum
*  mechanics and general relativity, and moreover one which is able to incorporate particles and
*  forces like the ones we see around us. So it hasn't been ruled out as an actual
*  unified theory of nature, but there also isn't a, in my view, some people would disagree with me,
*  but there isn't a reasonable possibility that we would be able to do an experiment
*  in the foreseeable future which would be sort of a yes or no to string theory.
*  Okay, so you've been there from the early days of string theory. You've seen its developments.
*  What are some interesting developments? What do you see as also the future of string theory?
*  And what is string theory?
*  Well, the basic idea which emerged in the early 70s was that if you
*  take the notion of a particle and you literally replace it by a little loop of string,
*  the strings are sort of softer than particles.
*  What do you mean by softer?
*  Well, if you hit a particle, if there were a particle on this table, a big one, and you hit it,
*  you might bruise yourself. But if there was a string on the table, you would probably just
*  push it around. And the source of the infinities in quantum field theory is that when particles
*  hit each other, it's a little bit of a jarring effect. And I've never described it this way
*  before, but it's actually scientifically accurate. But if you throw strings at each other, it's a
*  little more friendly. One thing I can't explain is how wonderfully precise the mathematics is
*  that goes into describing string theory. We don't just wave our hands and throw strings around.
*  There are some very compelling mathematical equations that describe it. Now,
*  what was realized in the early 70s is that if you replace particles by strings,
*  these infinities go away, and you get a consistent theory of gravity without the infinities.
*  That may sound a little trivial, but at that point, it had already been
*  15 years that people had been searching around for any kind of theory that could do this.
*  And it was actually found kind of by accident. And there are a lot of accidental discoveries
*  in this subject. Now, at the same time, it was believed then that string theory was an interesting
*  sort of toy model for putting quantum mechanics and general relativity together on paper,
*  but that it couldn't describe some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena that pertain to our own
*  universe, in particular, the form of so-called parity violation.
*  Our world is- Ooh, another term for the bar later tonight.
*  Yeah, yeah. Parity violation.
*  So if you go to the bar and- I already got the renormalizable quantum.
*  And you look in the mirror across the bar, the universe that you see in the mirror is not
*  identical. You would be able to tell if you show the lady in the bar a photograph that shows both
*  the mirror and you, if she's smart enough, she'll be able to tell which one is the real world
*  and which one is you. Now, she would have to do some very precise measurements.
*  And if the photograph was too grainy, it might not be possible, but in principle, it's possible.
*  Why is this interesting? Does this mean that there is some
*  not perfect determinism or what does that mean? There's some uncertainty?
*  No, it's a very interesting feature of the real world that it isn't parity-invariant.
*  And string theory, it was thought, could not tolerate that.
*  And then it was learned in the mid-'80s that not only could it tolerate that, but if you did things
*  in the right way, you could construct a world involving strings that reconciled quantum mechanics
*  and general relativity, which looked more or less like the world that we live in. And now,
*  now, that isn't to say that string theory predicted our world. It just meant that it
*  was consistent that the hypothesis that string theory describes our world can't be ruled out from
*  the get-go. And it is also the only proposal for a complete theory that would describe
*  our world. Still, nobody will believe it until there's some kind of direct experiment.
*  And I don't even believe it myself. Sure, which is a good place to be mentally
*  as a physicist, right? I mean, Einstein didn't believe his own equations, right, with the black
*  hole. Okay. Well, then when he was wrong about that, he was wrong about that.
*  But you might be wrong too, right? So do you think string theory is dead if you were to bet
*  all your money on the future of string theory? No. I think it's a logical error to think that
*  string theory is either right or wrong or dead or alive. What it is, is a stepping stone.
*  And an analogy I like to draw is Yang-Mills theory, which I mentioned a few minutes ago in the
*  context of standard model. Yang-Mills theory was discovered by Yang and Mills in the 50s.
*  And they thought that the symmetry of Yang and Mills theory described the relationship between
*  the proton and the neutron. That's why they invented it. That turned out to be completely
*  wrong. It does, however, describe everything else in the standard model. And it had a kind of
*  inevitability. They had some of the right pieces, but not the other ones. They didn't have it quite
*  in the right context. And it had an inevitability to it, and it eventually sort of found its place.
*  It's also true of Einstein's theory of general relativity. He had the wrong version of it in
*  1914, and he was missing some pieces. You wouldn't say that his early version was right or wrong.
*  He'd understood the equivalence principle. He'd understood spacetime curvature.
*  He just didn't have everything. Technically, you would have to say it was wrong.
*  Technically, you would have to say Yang and Mills were wrong. I guess in that sense,
*  I would believe just odds are. We always keep finding new wrinkles. Odds are we're going to
*  find new wrinkles in string theory. And technically, what we call string theory now isn't quite right.
*  We're always going to be wrong, but hopefully a little bit less wrong every time.
*  Exactly. And I would bet the farm, as they say.
*  Do you have a farm?
*  I say that much more seriously because not only do I have a farm, but we just renovated it.
*  Before I renovated, my wife and I spent five years renovating it.
*  You were much looser with that statement, but now it really means something.
*  Now it really means something. I would bet the farm on the
*  guess that 100 years from now, string theory will be viewed as a stepping stone towards a greater
*  understanding of nature. Another thing that I didn't mention about string theory is, of course,
*  we knew that it solved the infinities problem. And then we later learned that it also solved
*  Hawking's puzzle about what's inside of a black hole. And you put in one assumption, you get
*  five things out. Somehow you're doing something right. Probably not everything, but there's some
*  good signposts. And there have been a lot of good signposts like that.
*  It is also a mathematical toolkit. And you've used it. You've used it with Kamranwafa. Maybe
*  we can sneak our way back from string theory into black holes. What was the idea that you and Kamranwafa
*  developed with the holographic principle in string theory? What were you able to discover
*  through this string theory about black holes, or that connects us back to the reality of black holes?
*  Yeah. So that is a very interesting story. I was interested in black holes before I was interested
*  in string theory. I was sort of a reluctant string theorist in the beginning. I thought I
*  had to learn it because people were talking about it. But once I studied it, I grew to love it.
*  First, I did it in a sort of dutiful way. These people say they've claimed quantum gravity. I
*  ought to read their papers at least. And then the more I read them, the more interested I got,
*  and I began to see. They phrased it in a very clumsy way. The description of string theory was
*  very clumsy. Mathematically clumsy or just the interpretation?
*  Mathematically clumsy. It was all correct, but mathematically clumsy. But it often happens
*  that in all kinds of branches of physics that people start working on it really hard,
*  and they sort of dream about it and live it and breathe it, and they begin to see
*  inner relationships, and they see a beauty that is really there. They're not deceived. They're
*  really seeing something that exists, but if you just kind of look at it, you can't grasp it all
*  in the beginning. So our understanding of string theory in 1985 was almost all about
*  weakly coupled waves of strings colliding and so on. We didn't know how to describe
*  a big thing like a black hole in string theory. Of course, we could show that strings
*  theory in some limit reproduced Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  and corrected it, but we couldn't do any better with black holes than
*  before my work with Cormann. We couldn't do any better than Einstein and Schwarzschild had done.
*  Now, one of the puzzles, if you look at the Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's headstone
*  and you put them together, you get a formula for their really central equations in 20th century
*  physics. I don't think there are many equations that made it to headstones.
*  They're really central equations, and you put them together, and you get a formula for the
*  number of gigabytes in a black hole. Now, in Schwarzschild's description,
*  the black hole is literally a hole in space, and there's no place to store the gigabytes.
*  And it's not too hard to, and this really was Wheeler and Bekenstein and Hawking,
*  to come to the conclusion that if there isn't a sense in which a black hole can store
*  some large number of gigabytes, that quantum mechanics and gravity can't be consistent.
*  We've got to go there a little bit. So how is it possible, when we say gigabytes,
*  that there's some information, so black holes can store information. How is this thing that
*  sucks up all light and is supposed to basically be super homogeneous and boring? How is that
*  actually able to store information? Where does it store information? On the inside, on the surface?
*  And what's information? I'm liking this ask five questions to see which one you actually answer.
*  Oh, okay. So if you say that, I should try to memorize them and answer each one in order,
*  just to answer them. No, I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm desperately
*  trying to figure it out as we go along here. So Einstein's black holes, in Schwarzschild's
*  black hole, they can't store information. Stuff goes in there, and it just keeps flying, and it
*  goes into singularity, and it's gone. However, Einstein's theory is not exact. It has corrections.
*  And string theory tells you what those corrections are.
*  And so you should be able to find some way of, some alternate way of describing the black hole
*  that enables you to understand where the gigabytes are stored. So what Hawking and
*  Bekenstein really did was they showed that physics is inconsistent unless a black hole can store
*  a number of gigabytes proportional to its area divided by four times
*  Newton's constant times Planck's constant. And that's another wild idea. You said area, not
*  volume. Exactly. And that's the holographic principle. The universe is so weird.
*  That's the holographic principle. That's called the holographic principle. That is,
*  it's the area. We're just jumping around. What is the holographic principle? What does that mean?
*  What is this? Some kind of weird projection going on? What the heck?
*  Well, I was just before I came here writing an introduction to a paper, and the first sentence was
*  the as yet imprecisely defined holographic principle, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  Nice.
*  So nobody knows exactly what it is, but roughly speaking, it says just what we were alluding to,
*  that really all the information that is in some volume of space-time can be stored on the boundary
*  of that region.
*  So this is not just about black holes, it's about any area space.
*  Any area space. However, we've made sense of the holographic principle for black holes.
*  We've made sense of the holographic principle for something which could be called the anti-desider
*  space, which could be thought of as a giant, as a black hole turned into a whole universe.
*  And we don't really understand how to talk about the holographic principle for
*  either flat space, which we appear to live in, or asymptotically desider space, which
*  astronomers tell us we actually live in as the universe continues to expand.
*  So it's one of the huge problems in physics is to
*  apply or even formulate the holographic principle for more realistic, well, black holes are
*  realistic, we see them, but yeah, in more general context. So we have a more general
*  statement of the holographic principle.
*  What's the difference between flat space and asymptotic desider space? So flat space is just
*  an approximation of the world we live in. So desider space, asymptotic, I wonder what that
*  even means, meaning asymptotic over what?
*  Okay. So for thousands of years, until the last half of the 20th century,
*  we thought space-time was flat.
*  Can you elaborate on flat? What do we mean by flat?
*  Well, like the surface of this table is flat. Let me just give an intuitive explanation.
*  Surface of the table is flat, but the surface of a basketball is curved. So the universe itself
*  could be flat like the surface of a table, or it could be curved like a basketball,
*  which actually has a positive curvature. And then there's another kind of curvature called
*  the negative curvature. And curvature can be even weirder because that kind of curvature I've just
*  described is the curvature of space, but Einstein taught us that we really live in a space-time
*  continuum. So we can have curvature in a way that mixes up space and time.
*  And that's kind of hard to visualize.
*  Because you have to step what? A couple of dimensions up? So it's hard to...
*  You have to step a couple, but even if you have flat space and it's expanding in time,
*  you know, we could imagine we're sitting here, this room, good approximation is flat,
*  but imagine we suddenly start getting further and further apart. Then space is flat,
*  but it's expanding, which means that space-time is curved.
*  Ultimately, it's about space-time. Okay. So what's the Sitter and Antidistinter space?
*  The three simplest space-times are flat space-time, which we call Minkowski space-time,
*  and negatively curved space-time, antidistinter space, and positively curved space-time,
*  distinter space. And so astronomers think that on large scales, even though for thousands of years
*  we hadn't noticed it, beginning with Hubble, we started to notice that space-time was curved.
*  Space is expanding in time, means that space-time is curved. And the nature of this curvature is
*  affected by the matter in it because matter itself causes the curvature of space-time.
*  But as it expands, the matter gets more and more diluted. And one might ask,
*  when it's all diluted away, is space-time still curved? And astronomers believe they've done
*  precise enough measurements to determine this, and they believe that the answer is yes.
*  The universe is now expanding. Eventually, all the matter in it will be
*  expanded away, but it will continue to expand because, well, they would call it the dark energy.
*  Einstein would call it a cosmological constant. In any case, in the far future,
*  matter will be expanded away and will be left with empty distinter space.
*  Okay. So there's this cosmological, Einstein's cosmological constant
*  that now hides this thing that we don't understand called dark energy. What's dark energy?
*  What's your best guess at what this thing is? Why do we think it's there?
*  It's because it comes from the astronomers.
*  Dark energy is synonymous with positive cosmological constant. And
*  we think it's there because the astronomers have told us it's there, and they know what they're
*  doing. It's a really, really hard measurement, but they really know what they're doing. And
*  we have no friggin' idea why it's there. Another big mystery. Another reason it's fun to be a
*  physicist. And if it is there, why should it be so small? Why should there be so little? Why should
*  it have hid itself from us? Why shouldn't there be enough of it to substantially curve the space
*  between us and the moon? Why did there have to be such a small amount that only the crazy best
*  astronomers in the world could find it? Well, can't the same thing be said about
*  all the constants? Can't that be said about gravity? Can't that be said about the speed of light?
*  Why is the speed of light so slow? So fast.
*  So slow. Relative to the size of the universe, can't it be faster?
*  Or no? Well, the speed of light is a funny one because you could always choose units
*  in which the speed of light is one. We measure it in kilometers per second and it's 186,000 miles
*  per second. It's 186,000 miles per second. But if we use different units, then we could make it one.
*  But you can make dimensionless ratios. So you could say why is the time scale set by the expansion
*  of the universe so large compared to the time scale of a human life or so large compared to the
*  time scale for a neutron to decay? Ultimately, the temporal reference frame here is a human life.
*  Maybe. Isn't that the important thing for us descendants of apes? Isn't that a really
*  important aspect of physics? Because we kind of experience the world, we intuit the world
*  through the eyes of these biological organisms. I guess mathematics helps you escape that for
*  a time, but ultimately isn't that how you wander about the world? Absolutely. That's like a human
*  life times only a hundred years. Because if you think of everything, if you're able to think in,
*  I don't know, in billions of years, then maybe everything looks way different.
*  Right. Maybe universes are born and die and maybe all of these physical phenomena become
*  much more intuitive than we see at the grand scale of general relativity.
*  Well, that is one of the little off the track here, but that certainly is one of the nice things
*  about being a physicist is you spend a lot of time thinking about, you know,
*  insides of black holes and billions of years in the future. And it sort of
*  gets you away from the day to day into another fantastic realm.
*  But I was answering your question about how there could be information in a black hole.
*  Yes. So Einstein only gave us an approximate description and we now have a theory that
*  corrects it, string theory. And now sort of was the moment of truth. Well, when we first
*  discovered string theory, we knew from the get-go that string theory would correct what Einstein
*  said, just like Einstein corrected what Newton said. But we didn't understand it well enough
*  to actually compute the correction, to compute how many gigabytes there were.
*  And sometime in the early 90s, we began to understand the mathematics of string theory
*  better and better. And it came to the point where it was clear that this was something
*  we might be able to compute. And it was a kind of moment of truth for string theory because
*  if it hadn't given the answer that Bekenstein and Hawking said it had to give for consistency,
*  string theory itself would have been inconsistent and we wouldn't be doing this interview.
*  Wow. That's a very dramatic statement.
*  That's not the most dramatic thing.
*  Okay. That's very life and death. You mean like that because string theory was centered to your
*  work at that time. Is that what you mean? Well, string theory would have been inconsistent.
*  Yeah. Okay. So string theory would have been inconsistent.
*  But those inconsistencies can give birth to other theories, like you said.
*  The inconsistency. Right. Something else could have happened. It would have been a major
*  change in the way we think about string theory. And it was a good thing that one supposition that
*  the world is made of strings solves two problems, not one. It solves the infinity problem and it
*  solved the Hawking's problem. And also the way that it did it was very beautiful.
*  It gave an alternate description. So alternate description of things are
*  very common. To take a simple example, this bottle of water here is 90% full. I could say
*  it's 90% full. I could also say it's 10% empty. Those are obviously the same statement.
*  It's trivial to see that they're the same, but there are many statements that can be made in
*  mathematics and mathematical physics that are equivalent, but might take years to understand
*  that they're equivalent and might take the invention or discovery of whole new fields
*  of mathematics to prove they're equivalent. And this was one of those. We found an alternate
*  description of certain black holes in string theory, which we could prove was equivalent.
*  And it was a description of the black hole as a hologram that can be thought of a holographic
*  plate that could be thought of as sitting on the surface of the black hole. And the interior of
*  the black hole itself arises as a projection, or the near horizon region of the black hole arises
*  as a projection of that holographic plate. So the two descriptions were the hologram,
*  the three-dimensional image, and the holographic plate. And the hologram is what Einstein
*  discovered, and the holographic plate is what we discovered. And this idea that you could describe
*  things very, very concretely in string theory in these two different languages, of course,
*  took off and was applied to many different contexts within string theory.
*  So you mentioned the infinity problem and the Hawking problem. Which Hawking problem?
*  That the black hole destroys information or which Hawking problem are we talking about?
*  Well, there's really two Hawking problems. They're very closely related. One is, how does
*  the black hole store the information? And that is the one that we solved in some cases. So it's
*  sort of like your smartphone. How does it store its 64 gigabytes? Well, you rip the cover off and
*  you count the chips and there's 64 of them, each with a gigabyte, and you know there's 64 gigabytes.
*  But that does not solve the problem of how you get information in and out of your smartphone.
*  You have to understand a lot more about the Wi-Fi and the internet and the cellular.
*  That's where Hawking radiation, this prediction starts to come in.
*  That's where Hawking radiation comes in. And that problem of how the information gets in and out,
*  you can't, you couldn't have explained how information gets in and out of an iPhone without
*  first explaining how it's stored in the first place. So just to clarify, the storage is on the
*  plate, on the holographic plate, and then it projects somehow inside the- The bulk, the space
*  time is the hologram. The hologram. But man, I mean, do you have an intuitive when you sit late
*  at night and you stare at the stars, do you have an intuitive understanding of what a holographic
*  plate is? Like that there's two dimensions, no projections that store information?
*  How a black hole could store information on a holographic plate,
*  I think we do understand in great mathematical detail and also intuitively, and it's very much
*  like an ordinary hologram where you have a holographic plate and it contains all the
*  information, you shine a light through it, and you get an image which looks three-dimensional.
*  Yeah, but why should there be a holographic plate?
*  Why should there be?
*  Yeah, why?
*  That is the great thing about being a theoretical physicist is anybody can very quickly stump you
*  with going to the next level of why's.
*  Yeah, why's is kind of blue, I can just keep asking.
*  Yeah, you could just keep asking and it won't take you very long to-
*  So the trick in being a theoretical physics is finding the questions that you can answer.
*  So the questions that we think we might be able to answer now and we've partially answered is that
*  there is a holographic explanation for certain kinds of things in string theory.
*  Sure.
*  We've answered that. Now we'd like to take what we've learned and that's what I've mostly been
*  doing for the last 15, 20 years. I haven't really been working so much on string theory proper.
*  I've been sort of taking the lessons that we learned in string theory and trying to apply them
*  to the real world assuming only what we know for sure about the real world.
*  So on this topic, you co-wrote, co-authored a paper with Stephen Hawking called
*  Soft Hair on Black Holes.
*  Yes.
*  That makes the argument against Hawking's original prediction that black holes destroy information.
*  Can you explain this paper?
*  Yes.
*  And the title.
*  Okay. So first of all, the hair on black holes is a word that was coined by the greatest phrase master
*  in the history of physics, John Wheeler, invented the word black hole. And he also said that he made
*  the statement that black holes have no hair. That is every black hole in the universe
*  is described just by its mass and spin. They can also rotate as was later shown by Kerr.
*  And this is very much unlike a star, right? Every star of the same mass is different in a multitude
*  of different ways, different chemical compositions, different motions of the individual molecules.
*  Every star in the universe, even of the same mass, is different in many, many different ways.
*  Black holes are all the same. And that means when you throw some, in Einstein's description of them,
*  which we think must be corrected. And if you throw something into a black hole, it gets sucked in.
*  And if you throw in a red book or a blue book, the black hole gets a little bigger,
*  but there's no way within Einstein's theory of telling how they're different.
*  And that was one of the assumptions that Hawking made in his 1974, 75
*  papers in which he concluded that black holes destroy information. You can throw encyclopedias,
*  thesis defenses, the Library of Congress. It doesn't matter. It's going to behave
*  exactly the same uniform way. Yeah. So what Hawking and I showed, and also Malcolm Perry,
*  is that one has to be very careful about what happens at the boundary of the black hole.
*  And this gets back to something I mentioned earlier about when two things which are related
*  by a coordinate transformation are and are not equivalent. And what we showed is that there are
*  very subtle imprints when you throw something into a black hole. There are very subtle imprints left
*  on the horizon of the black hole, which you can read off at least partially what went in.
*  And so this invalidates Stephen's original argument that the information is destroyed.
*  And that's the soft hair. That's the soft hair. Right. And soft is the word that is used in physics
*  for things which have very low energy. And these things actually carry no energy. There are things
*  in the universe which carry no energy. You said, I think to Sean Carroll,
*  by the way, everyone should go check out Sean Carroll's Mindscape Podcast. It's incredible.
*  And Sean Carroll is an incredible person. I think you said there, maybe in a paper,
*  I have a quote. You said that a soft particle is a particle that has zero energy, just like you said
*  now. And when the energy goes to zero, because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,
*  it's also spread over an infinitely large distance. If you like, it's spread over the
*  whole universe. It somehow runs off to the boundary. What we learned from that is that if you add a zero
*  energy particle to the vacuum, you get a new state. And so there are infinitely many vacua,
*  plural for vacuum, which can be thought of as being different from one another by the addition of soft
*  photons or soft gravitons. Can you elaborate on this wild idea? If you like, it spreads over the
*  whole universe. When the energy goes to zero, because the energy is proportionate to the
*  wavelength, it also spreads over an infinitely large distance. If you like, it's spread over the
*  whole universe. Can you explain these soft gravitons and photons?
*  Yeah. So the soft gravitons and photons have been known about since the 60s. But exactly what we're
*  supposed to do with them or how we're supposed to think about them, I think has been well understood
*  only recently. And in quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle is proportional to Planck's
*  constant times its wavelength. So when the energy goes to zero, the wavelength goes to infinity.
*  Now, if something has zero energy and it's spread all over the universe,
*  in what sense is it actually there? That's been the confusing thing to make a precise statement
*  about when something is and isn't there. Now, the simplest way of seeing,
*  so people might have taken the point of view that if it has zero energy and is spread all over the
*  universe, it's not there, we can ignore it. But if you do this, you'll get into trouble.
*  And one of the ways that you'll get into trouble is that even though it has zero energy,
*  it doesn't have zero angular momentum. If it's a photon, it always has angular momentum one.
*  If it's a graviton, it's angular momentum two. So you can't say that the state of the system
*  with the zero energy photon should be identified with the one without the zero energy photon,
*  that we can just ignore them because then you will conclude that angular momentum is not conserved.
*  And if angular momentum is not conserved, things won't be consistent.
*  And of course, you can have a lot of these things and typically you do get a lot of them.
*  And when you can actually do a calculation that shows that every time you scatter
*  two particles, you create an infinite number of them.
*  Infinite number of the soft photons and...
*  Of the zero energy ones, yeah.
*  And so these are... And they're somehow everywhere.
*  They're everywhere.
*  But they also contain information or they're able to store information.
*  And they're able to store information. They're able to store an arbitrary large amount of
*  information. So what we pointed out is... So what these things really do, one way of thinking of
*  them is they rush off to the edges of the universe. Spreading out all over the space is like saying
*  they rush off to the energy edge of the universe. And that includes if the interior of the black
*  hole is not considered part of the universe, that includes the edge of the black hole.
*  So we need to set up our description of physics so that all the things that are conserved
*  are still conserved in the way that we're describing them. And that will not be true
*  if we ignore these things. We have to keep careful track of these things.
*  And people had been sloppy about that. And we learned how to be very precise and careful about
*  it. And once you're being precise, you can actually answer this kind of very problematic
*  thing that Hawking suggested that black holes destroy information.
*  Well, what we showed is that there's an error in the argument that all black holes are the same
*  because they hadn't kept track of these very subtle things. And whether or not this is the
*  key error in the argument remains to be seen, or whether this is a technical point.
*  Yes. But it is an error.
*  It is an error.
*  And Hawking obviously agreed with it.
*  Hawking agreed with it. And he was sure that this was the... He was sure that this was...
*  This was a critical error.
*  That this was the critical error and that understanding this would
*  get us the whole story. And that could well be.
*  What was it like working with Stephen Hawking on this particular
*  problem? Because it's kind of a whole journey, right?
*  Well, I love the guy. He's so passionate about physics. He just...
*  Yeah. His oneness with the problem and the... I mean, it's...
*  So his mind is all occupied by the world that's...
*  Yeah. And let me tell you, there's a lot of other things with his illness and with his celebrity.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of other things.
*  A lot of distractions pulling at his mind. He's still there.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  I remember him turning down tea with Lady Gaga so we could spend another hour on our paper.
*  That, my friends, is dedication. What did you learn about physics? What did you learn about life
*  from having worked with Stephen Hawking?
*  Well, he was one of my great teachers. Of course, he's older than me and I was reading his
*  textbooks in graduate school. I learned a lot about relativity from him. I learned about
*  passion for a problem. I learned about not caring what other people think. Physics is an
*  an interesting culture. Even if you make a great discovery, like Hawking did,
*  people don't believe everything you say. In fact, people love to disagree. It's
*  a culture that cherishes disagreement. And so, he kept ahead with what he believed in and
*  sometimes he was right and sometimes he was wrong.
*  Do you feel pressure from the community? For example, with string theory,
*  it was very popular for a time. There's a bit of criticism or it's less popular now. Do you feel
*  the forces of the community as it moves in and out of different fields or do you try to stay,
*  like how difficult is it to stay intellectually and mathematically independent from the community?
*  Personally, I'm lucky. I'm well equipped for that. When I started out in graduate school,
*  the problem of quantum gravity was not considered interesting.
*  You still did it anyway.
*  I still did it anyway. I'm a little bit of a contrarian, I guess, and I think that has
*  served me well. People are always sort of disagreeing with me. They're usually right,
*  but I'm right enough. Like you said, the contradiction
*  ultimately paves the path of discovery. Let me ask you just on this tension. We've been
*  dancing between physics and mathematics. What to you is an interesting line you can draw between
*  the two? You have done some very complicated mathematics in your life to explore the laws
*  of nature. What's the difference between physics and mathematics to you?
*  I love math. I think my first love is physics and the math that I've done,
*  I've done because it was needed. In service of physics.
*  In service of physics, but then of course in the heat of it, it has its own appeal.
*  In the heat of it. I like it. Sure.
*  It has its own appeal and I certainly enjoyed it. Ultimately, I would like to think, I wouldn't say
*  I believe, but I would like to think that there's no difference between physics and mathematics, that
*  all mathematics is realized in the physical world and all physics has a firm mathematical
*  basis, that they're really the same thing. I mean, why would there be math that had no physical
*  manifestation? It seems a little odd, right? You have two kinds of math, some that are relevant to
*  the real world. Well, they don't have to be contradictory, but you can have, can't you not
*  have mathematical objects that are not at all connected to the physical world? So I mean, this
*  is to the question of is math discovered or invented? So to you, math is discovered and
*  there's a deep linkage between the two. Do you find it all compelling, these ideas,
*  something like Max Tegmark, where our universe is actually fundamentally a mathematical object,
*  that math is, our universe is mathematical, fundamentally mathematical in nature?
*  My expertise is a physicist doesn't add anything to that.
*  I was once very interested in philosophy and physics. I like questions that can be answered,
*  that it's not obvious what the answer is and that you can find an answer to the question
*  and everybody will agree what the answer is and that there's an algorithm for getting there.
*  Not that these other questions aren't interesting and they don't somehow have a way of presenting
*  themselves, but to me, the interesting thing is motion in what we know, is learning more and
*  understanding things that we didn't understand before, things that seemed totally confusing,
*  having them seem obvious. That's wonderful. So I think those questions are there. I mean, I would
*  even go further, the whole multiverse. I don't think there's too much concrete we're ever going
*  to be able to say about it. This is fascinating because you spent so much time in string theory,
*  which is devoid from a connection to the physical world for a long time. Not devoid, but it travels
*  in a mathematical world that seems to be beautiful and consistent and seems to indicate that it could
*  be a good model of the laws of nature, but it's still traveling independently because it's very
*  difficult to experimentally verify. But there's a promise laden in it in the same way multiverse or
*  you can have a lot of very far out there questions where your gut and instinct and intuition says
*  that maybe in 50, 100, 200 years, you'll be able to actually have strong experimental validation.
*  Right? I think that with string theory,
*  I don't think it's likely that we could measure it, but we could get lucky.
*  In other words, just to take an example, about 10 or 20 years ago, it was thought that they had seen
*  a string in the sky and that it was seen by
*  doubled stars that were gravitationally lensed around the gravitational field produced by some
*  long string. There was a line of double lensed. Now the signal went away, okay? But people were
*  hoping that they'd seen a string and it could be a fundamental string that somehow gotten stretched
*  and that would be some evidence for string theory. There was also BICEP2, which
*  the experiment was wrong, but it could have happened. It could have happened that we got lucky
*  and this experiment was able to make direct measurements. Certainly would have been
*  measurements of quantum gravity if not string theory. So it's a very logical possibility
*  that we could get experimental evidence from string. That is a very different thing than saying,
*  do this experiment, here's a billion dollars and after you do it, we'll know whether or not strings
*  are real. But I think it's a crucial difference. It's measurable in principle and we don't see
*  how to get from here to there. If we see how to get from here to there, in my eyes, it's boring.
*  When I was a graduate student, they knew how to measure the Higgs boson.
*  Took 40 years, but they didn't... Not to say that stuff is boring. I don't want to say that stuff
*  is boring. But what Magellan set out, he didn't know we could get around the world.
*  There was no map. So I don't know how we're going to
*  connect in a concrete way all these ideas of string theory to the real world.
*  When I started out in graduate school, I said, what is the most interesting problem
*  that there might be progress on in 60 years?
*  I think it could be that in another 30 years that maybe we'll learn that we have understood how
*  black holes store information. That doesn't seem wild, that we're able to abstract what we learned
*  from string theory and show that it's operative. The Bose-Einstein Convince, they did. When Bose
*  and Einstein predicted it, when was that? The 30s maybe, early 30s, there were 20 orders of
*  magnitude that were needed in order to improvement, in order to measure it. They did 50 years later.
*  You couldn't have guessed how that had happened, how they could have gotten that.
*  It could happen that we, I don't think we're going to see the heterotic string spectrum at
*  an accelerator, but it could be that things come around in an interesting way and somehow it comes
*  together. The fact that we can't see to the end isn't a reason not to do it. What did they do when
*  they were trying to find the Pacific? They took every route. They just tried everything. That's
*  what we're doing. I'm taking the one that my nose tells me is the best. Other people are taking
*  other ones and that's good because we need every person taking every route. If somebody on another
*  route finds something that looks really promising, I'm going to make a portage over the mountain and
*  get on their stream. The fact that you don't see the experiment now isn't to me a reason to
*  give up on what I view as the most fundamental paradox in 20th century,
*  20th and present physics, 20, 21st century physics.
*  Absolutely. You can see that it's possible. You just don't know the way. That's what I mean
*  why some of the philosophical questions could be formulated in a way that's explorable scientifically.
*  Some of the stuff we've talked about, but for example, this topic that's become more okay to
*  talk about, which is the topic of consciousness. To me as an artificial intelligence person,
*  that's a very practically interesting topic, but there's also philosophers.
*  Sean Carroll loves to argue against them, but there's philosophers that are panpsychists.
*  I'm not against philosophers. It's just not as fun.
*  It's not as fun. All right. They start a little flame of a fire going that some of those flames,
*  I think, eventually become physics. Eventually becomes something that we can really...
*  Having them around is really important because you'll discover something by modeling and
*  exploring black holes. That's really weird. Having these ideas around, like the ideas of panpsychists
*  that consciousness could be a fundamental force of nature. Just even having that crazy idea,
*  swimming around in the background could really spark something where
*  that you were missing something completely. That's where the philosophy done right, I think,
*  is very useful. That's where even these thought experiments, which is very fun in the tech sci-fi
*  world that we live in a simulation, that taking a perspective of the universe as a computer,
*  as a computational system that processes information, which is a pretty intuitive notion,
*  but you can... Just even reframing it that way for yourself could really open up some
*  different way of thinking. Could be.
*  And then you have... I don't know if you're familiar with Stephen Wolfram's work
*  of cellular automata and complexity. Yeah. I did a podcast with Stephen.
*  Stephen? That's awesome. To me, forget physics, forget all that. Cellular automata make no sense.
*  They're so beautiful. They're so... From simple rules, you can create complexity.
*  I just don't think... He wrote a book, A New Kind of Science,
*  basically hinting at, which a lot of people have hinted at, is like, we don't have a good way
*  to talk about these objects. We can't figure out what is happening here. These simple,
*  these trivial rules can create incredible complexity.
*  He's totally right about that. Yeah.
*  And physicists, I guess, don't know what to do with that. Don't know what to do with cellular
*  automata. Because you can describe the simple rules that govern the system,
*  or how complexity can emerge, like incredible complexity.
*  Yeah. Of course, Wolfram's version of that is that physicists will never be able to describe it.
*  Right. Yeah, exactly. He tries to prove that it's impossible. What do you make of that? What do you
*  what do you make about the tension of being a physicist and potentially not being able to...
*  It's like Freud or somebody that maybe, Sigmund Freud, that maybe you'll never be able to actually
*  describe the human psyche. Is that a possibility for you? That you will never be able to get to the
*  core fundamental description of the laws of nature? Yeah. So I had this conversation with Weinberg.
*  Yeah. How'd it go? So Weinberg has this book called Dreams of a Final Theory. Yeah.
*  And I had this conversation with him. I said, why do you think there's ever going to be a final
*  theory? Why should there ever be a final theory? I mean, what does that mean? Do physics departments
*  shut down? We've solved everything. Doesn't it seem that every time we answer some old questions,
*  we'll just find new ones and that it will just keep going on forever and ever?
*  He said, well, that's what they used to say about the Nile. They were never going to find the end.
*  Then one day they found it. Yeah. So I don't know. String theory doesn't look like a candidate to me
*  for a final theory. As it stands now. It doesn't get to the bottom of the world. It doesn't.
*  Yeah. It seems to me that even if we kind of solved it and we did experiments, there still
*  would be more questions like why are there four dimensions instead of six? It doesn't seem to have
*  anything in it that would explain that. You can always hope that there's something that we don't
*  know about string theory that will explain it. But it still doesn't look like it's going to answer
*  every question. And why is there one time, not two? Why is there... It doesn't seem like it's...
*  I don't even know what it would mean to answer every question.
*  Well, to answer every question, obviously. So when you refer to the theory of everything,
*  you'll be able to have a... If it exists, it would be a theory that allows you to predict precisely
*  the behavior of objects in the universe and their movement. Right? What about them? Their movement.
*  Yeah. Like precisely, no matter the object.
*  Right. That's true. So that would be a really interesting state of affairs
*  if we could predict everything but not necessarily understand everything.
*  So for example, let's just forget about gravity. I mean, we're not too far from that situation.
*  If we forget about gravity, the standard model in principle, given a big enough computer,
*  predicts almost everything. But if you look at the standard model, it's kind of a laundry list
*  with neutrino masses and all that stuff. There are hundreds of free parameters. Where do they come
*  from? Is there an organizing principle? Is there some further unification? So being able to predict
*  everything is not the only goal that physicists have.
*  So on the way to trying to predict, you're trying to understand. That's actually probably
*  the goal is to understand. Yeah. But right, we're more interested in understanding than actually
*  doing the predictions. But the predictions are more... Focusing on how to make predictions
*  is a good way to improve your understanding because you know you've understood it if you
*  can do the predictions. Yeah. One of the interesting things that might come to a head with is
*  artificial intelligence. There's an increasing use of AI in physics. We might live in a world where
*  AI would be able to predict perfectly what's happening. And so they'll look... As physicists,
*  you'll have to come to the fact that you're actually not that interested in prediction.
*  I mean, it's very useful, but you're interested in really understanding the deep laws of nature
*  versus a perfect predictor. Yeah. Like you want to play chess. But even within AI, AI people are
*  trying to understand what it is that the AI bots have learned in order to produce whatever they
*  produce. For sure. But you still don't understand deeply, especially because you're not
*  getting... Especially language models, if you're paying attention, the systems that are able to
*  generate text, they're able to have conversations, chat GPT is the recent manifestation of that.
*  They just seem to know everything. They're trained on the internet. They seem to be very,
*  very good at something that looks like reasoning. They're able to generate... You can ask them
*  questions. They can answer questions. It just feels like this thing is intelligent. Right?
*  And I could just see that being possible with physics. You ask any kind of physical question,
*  and they'll be able to... Very precise about a particular star system or a particular black hole.
*  They'll say, well, these are the numbers. It'll perfectly predict. And then sure, you can
*  understand how the neural network is... The architecture is structured. Actually, for most
*  of them now, they're very simple. You can understand what data is trained on. Huge amount of data.
*  You're getting a huge amount of data from a very nice telescope or something.
*  And then it seems to predict everything perfectly. How a banana falls when you throw it.
*  Everything is perfectly predicted. You still don't have a deep understanding of what governs
*  the whole thing. And maybe you can ask it a question. It'll be some kind of Hitchhiker's Guide
*  to the Galaxy type answer. It's a funny world we live in. Of course, it's also possible that
*  there's no such deep, simple governing laws of nature behind the whole thing. There's something
*  in us humans that wants it there to be, but doesn't have to be, right? Again, you already
*  bet the farm, but if you were to have a second farm, do you think there is a theory of everything
*  that we might get at? So, simple laws that govern the whole thing.
*  Honestly, I don't know. But I'm pretty confident that if there is,
*  we won't get to it in my lifetime. I don't think we're near it.
*  The fact that we have the laws we do that are relatively simple already,
*  that's kind of incredible. There seems to be simple laws that govern things, right?
*  By theory of everything, you mean a theory of everything, an algorithm to predict everything.
*  But a simple algorithm.
*  A relatively simple algorithm to predict everything. So, for me, it would be a sad day
*  if we arrived at that without answering some deeper questions.
*  Sure, of course. But one of the questions before we arrived there, we can ask,
*  does such a destination even exist? Because asking the question and the possible answers
*  and the process of trying to answer that question is in itself super interesting.
*  Is it even possible to get there where there's an equals MC squared type of function? Okay,
*  you can have many parameters, but a finite number of parameter function that can predict
*  a lot of things about our universe. Well, okay. But just to sort of
*  throw one thing in, in order to answer every question, we would need a theory of the origin
*  of the universe. And that is a huge task. And the fact that the universe seems to have a beginning
*  defies everything we know and love. Because one of the basic principles of physics is determinism,
*  that the past follows from the present follows from the past, the future follows from the present,
*  so on. But if you have the origin of the universe, you have a big bang, that means before that,
*  there was nothing. You can't have theory in which something follows from nothing. So somehow-
*  It sounds like you don't like singularities.
*  Well- I thought for somebody that works with black holes, you would get used to them by now.
*  No, no, I like this because it's so hard to understand. I like it because it's hard to
*  understand, but it's really challenging us. I don't think we're close to solving that problem.
*  So even- And string theory has basically had nothing,
*  there's been almost nothing interesting said about that in the last many decades.
*  So string theory hasn't really looked at the big bang. It hasn't really tried to get to the origin.
*  Not successfully. There aren't compelling papers that lots of people have read that
*  people have taken it up and tried to go at it, but there aren't compelling. String theory doesn't
*  seem to have a trick that helps us with that puzzle. Do you think we'll be able to sneak up
*  to the origin of the universe, like reverse engineer it from experimental, from theoretical
*  perspective? Okay, if we can, what would be the trajectory?
*  You've already gotten yourself in trouble, because you used the word reverse engineer.
*  So if you're going to reverse engineer, that means forward engineering means that you take
*  the present and determine the future. Reverse engineering means that you take the present
*  and determine the past. Estimate the past, but yes, sure.
*  But if the past was nothing, how are you ever going to reverse engineer to nothing?
*  That's hard to do.
*  Run up against the nothing, right? Until you have mathematical models that break down nicely
*  to where you can actually start to infer things.
*  Let's work on it.
*  No, but do you think that that's...
*  It could, maybe, but people have tried to do things like that.
*  Yeah, and have not succeeded.
*  It's not something that we're getting A pluses in.
*  Sure. Let's pretend we live in a world where in 100 years we have an answer to that.
*  What would that answer look like? What department is that from? What fields led us there?
*  Not what fields, what set of ideas in theoretical physics?
*  Is it experimental? Is it theoretical? What can you imagine could have possibly led us there?
*  Is it through gravitational waves and some kind of observations there?
*  Is it investigation of black holes? Is it simulation of universes? Is it...
*  Maybe we start creating black holes somehow? I don't know. Maybe some kind of high energy
*  physics type of experiments?
*  Well, I have some late night ideas about that that aren't really ready for prime time.
*  Okay, sure. But you have some ideas.
*  Yeah, yeah. And many people do. It could be that some of the advances in quantum information theory
*  are important in that they kind of go beyond taking quantum systems and just replicating them
*  but combining them with others.
*  Do you think since you highlighted the issue with time and the origin of the universe,
*  do you think time is fundamental or emergent?
*  I think ultimately it has to be emergent.
*  Yeah. What does it mean for time to be emergent?
*  Well, let's review what it means for space and time.
*  Well, let's review what it means for space to be emergent.
*  What it means for space to be emergent is that you have a holographic plate
*  and you shine some light that's moving in space and it produces an image
*  which contains an extra spatial dimension and time just goes along for the ride.
*  So what we'd like to do, and indeed there is some rather concrete work in this direction,
*  though again I would say even within our stringing community, we're not getting A pluses on these
*  efforts, but what we'd like to do is to see examples in which the extra space-time dimension
*  is time. In other words, usually what we understand very well mathematically is how to take systems
*  in some number of space-time dimensions and rewrite them as a plate in fewer space dimensions.
*  What we'd like to do is to take systems with one time and some number of space dimensions
*  and to rewrite them as a system that had only space dimensions in it, had no time evolution.
*  And there are some fairly concrete ideas about how to do that, but they're not
*  universally accepted even within the stringing community.
*  But isn't it wild to you?
*  Yes.
*  For it to be emergent?
*  Yes.
*  We intuit these kinds of ideas as human beings for whom space and time seems as
*  fundamentals as apples and oranges.
*  They're both illusions.
*  They're both illusions, even time.
*  You co-authored a paper titled, Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes. First of all,
*  whoever writes your paper titles, you like the soft hair and the term black hole and the big bang,
*  you're very good at coming up with titles yourself. Anyway, you co-authored a paper
*  titled, Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes. In it, you write, quote, recent work has identified
*  a number of emergent symmetries related to the intricate self-similar structure of the photon
*  ring. So what are photon rings? What are some interesting characteristics of a photon ring?
*  That was a paper with Dan Coppets and Alex Lipsaska that just came out.
*  Yes.
*  This paper is kind of a wonderful example of what happens when you start to talk to people who are
*  way out of your comfort zone of no different stuff and look at the world a different way.
*  And some two or three years ago, I'm part of this Black Hole Initiative. I'm also part of this
*  Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that took the famous, though I had nothing to do with the
*  experiment, but that took the famous picture of the donut of M87 and through conversations with them,
*  which started out in an effort to understand the image that they'd seen.
*  So it's a great thing for somebody like me, a theoretical physicist,
*  seemingly lost in string land, to be presented with an actual picture of a black hole.
*  And asked what?
*  What?
*  To be asked what can we learn from this? So with some help from Michael Johnson, Alex Lipsaska,
*  a bunch of other people at Event Horizon collaboration, we came up with a fantastic,
*  beautiful answer using Einstein's theory that is both shaping the future of, now it is shaping
*  the future of improved black hole photographs. What do you want to concentrate on in the photograph?
*  You just point at the sky and click? No, you don't do that. You optimize for various features.
*  And it's both shaping that and in the process of talking to them and thinking about how
*  light behaves around a black hole. Black holes just have so many magic tricks and they do so
*  many weird things. And the photon ring is among the weirdest of them. We understood this photon
*  ring and in the process of this, we said, hey, this photon ring has got to be telling us something
*  about the puzzle of where the holographic plate is outside of an ordinary astrophysical black hole.
*  We nailed it for the stringy black holes, but they have a somewhat different character.
*  What's a stringy black hole? The black holes that describe us?
*  The black holes that are contained in string theory and they have different
*  structure in them. But actually, can we step back? So what was the light in the image taken in 2019?
*  Not taken in 2019, presented in 2019. So here's the puzzle. What they really saw,
*  so the black holes tend to gather stuff that swirls around it. And they don't know what that
*  stuff is made of. They don't know what its temperature is. They don't know what kind of
*  magnetic fields there are around there. So the form of the image has a lot of unknowns in it.
*  It's dependent on many other things other than the geometry of the black hole.
*  So most of what you're learning is about the stuff. Now the swirling stuff, the hot swirling stuff,
*  is interesting as hell, but it's not as interesting as the black hole, which are the most,
*  in my view, the most interesting things in the universe. So you don't want to just learn about
*  the stuff. You want to learn about the black hole that is swirling around.
*  So one of the, at the very first step, at the very primitive level, this is just a big leap
*  for human civilization to be able to see a black hole and the way you can see it is because there's
*  stuff around it. You don't get to learn much about the black hole. You get to learn more
*  about the stuff just from the image. Yeah. But you're not going to learn about the details
*  before you've even seen it. Because there's too many parameters, there's too many variables that
*  govern the stuff. Yeah. So then we found a very wonderful way to learn about the black hole.
*  And here's how it works. A black hole is a mirror. And the way it's a mirror is if light,
*  a photon, bounces off your face towards the black hole and it goes straight to the black hole,
*  just falls in, you never see it again. But if it just misses the black hole,
*  it'll swing around the back and come back to you. And you see yourself.
*  From the photon that went around the back of the black hole. But not only can that happen,
*  the black hole, the photon can swing around twice and come back. So you actually see an
*  infinite number of copies of yourself. Like with a little bit of a delay.
*  With a little bit of a delay, right. This is awesome.
*  Yeah. And in fact...
*  I mean, we're not used to an object that bends light like that, right?
*  Yeah. So you're going to get some trippy effects.
*  And in fact, one of my students has made a really awesome computer animation of this,
*  which I'm going to show at a public lecture in a couple of weeks where the audience will see
*  infinitely many copies of themselves swirling around the black hole. So,
*  so if you... So a black hole is like a hall of mirrors. Like in a department store where you
*  go and there's the three mirrors and you see infinitely many copies of yourself.
*  Think of the black hole as the mirror. And you go in there with your clothes. If you want to know
*  about your clothes, you just look at the direct image. You're not learning anything about the
*  configuration of mirrors. But the relation of the image you see in front of you to the one you see
*  at the side and the next one and then so on, depends only on the mirrors. It doesn't matter
*  what clothes you're wearing. So you can go there a thousand times wearing different clothes,
*  but each time there will be the same relation between the subsequent images.
*  And that is how we're going to learn about the black holes. We're going to take the stuff
*  that is swirling around and we're going to tease out the subsequent images and look at their
*  relation. And there's some very beautiful, really beautiful mathematics, which we were surprised
*  to realize with the volumes and volumes of papers on black holes and their properties,
*  this particular, because it was a physical question that had never been asked in exactly this way.
*  So basically you're looking at the- The relation between the subsequent images.
*  But those are ultimately formed by photons that are swirling around.
*  Photons that are orbiting. So the photon ring are the photons that orbit around.
*  And beyond. So like orbit and lose orbit. Like they are they like, so, wow. And that starts to
*  give you, what can you possibly figure out mathematically about the black hole? Can you
*  the geometry of it? Does the geometry- The spin. And you can verify things behaving. You know,
*  we have never seen a region of space-time with such high curvature. I mean, the region around
*  a black hole is crazy. It's not like in this room, the curvature is everything. You know?
*  You spent probably enough time with the math and the photons. Can you put yourself in that space?
*  So we're like having a conversation in pretty peaceful, comfortable flat space. Are you able
*  to put yourself in the place around a black hole? Yeah, I'm able to imagine that kind of thing. Yeah.
*  So for example, and actually there's a wonderful movie, Interstellar. And in that movie,
*  you know, Kip Thorne, of course, is a great theoretical physicist, experimental, who later
*  won the Nobel Prize for LIGO. And that movie is very accurate scientifically. And there's some
*  funny statements in there that of the, you know, 100 million people who saw that movie,
*  there can't be more than 10 or 20 understood about why Matthew McConaughey is ejecting the
*  trash in a certain direction in order to... But, you know, for example, if I were a spinning black
*  hole right here, if I was spinning fast enough, you wouldn't be able to stay still there.
*  You'd have to be orbiting around like that, you know? You'd have to have your microphone on a...
*  But I wonder what the experience is, what the actual experience is, because I mean,
*  space itself is curved. Well, if space gets very curved, you get crushed.
*  Not...
*  Body gets ripped apart because the forces are different on different parts of your body.
*  Sure. Okay, so that would be...
*  But it can be less curved so that the curvature is very noticeable, but you're not ripped apart.
*  The fact that this was just nonchalantly stated is just beautiful. Like two biological systems
*  discussing which level of curvature is required to rip apart said biological system. Very well.
*  So you propose in the paper that a photon ring of a warped black hole
*  is indeed part of the black hole hologram. A photon ring of a warped black hole is indeed
*  part of the black hole hologram. So what can you intuit about the hologram?
*  Yeah. And the holographic plate from looking at the photon rings.
*  Well, this paper is exploring a new idea. It's not making a new
*  discovery, so to speak. It's exploring an idea and the ins and outs of it and what might work
*  and what might not. And this photon ring, somehow everybody always thought that the holographic
*  plate sat at the horizon of the black hole and that the quantum system that describes
*  the black hole is inside the horizon. And in fact, we think it's plausible and we give
*  some evidence in some soluble examples, in this case in an example in one lower dimension where
*  we can handle the equations better, that the quantum system that describes the black hole
*  should correspond to a region of space-time which includes the photon ring. So it's bigger.
*  So that would be the holographic plate.
*  That would be the holographic plate.
*  All of that.
*  We didn't prove this. We put it out there, it hadn't really been considered previously.
*  It does seem more plausible than the idea that it sits literally at the horizon. And it is a big
*  outstanding problem of how you have a holographic reconstruction of black holes like M87.
*  Do you think there could be further experimental data that helps explore some of these ideas that
*  you have for photon rings and holographic plates through imaging and through high resolution images
*  and also just more and more data?
*  I wish so, but I don't think so. But what I think already has happened and will continue to happen
*  is that there are many different ways that theorists and theorists can use the idea of
*  how theorists and observers can interact. The gold standard is the theorist makes a prediction,
*  the observer measures it and confirms it, or the observer makes a discovery and the theorist
*  explains it. But there's a lot less than that, which is really kind of the bread and butter
*  of those are dramatic moments when that happens. Those are once in a lifetime moments when that
*  happens. But the bread and butter is more when it has already happened. They came to us and said,
*  what is the interesting theoretical things we can understand in this swirl around the black hole?
*  We gave an answer and then that in turn jogged us to think about the holographic principle in
*  the context of M87 a little bit differently. In the same vein, it's useful to talk to the
*  philosophers and it's useful to talk to the mathematicians. We don't know where we're going,
*  we just got to do everything. Let me ask you another philosophical type question,
*  but not really actually. It seems that thought experiments are used. It's not just mathematics
*  that makes progress in theoretical physics, but thought experiments do. They did for Einstein
*  as well. They did for a lot of great physicists throughout history over the years. How's your
*  ability to generate thought experiments or just your intuition about some of these weird
*  things like quantum mechanics or string theory or quantum gravity or even general relativity? How's
*  your intuition improved over the years? Have you been able to make progress? The hard part in physics
*  is most problems are either doable, most problems that a theoretical calculation,
*  that a theoretical physicist would do. There's no end of problems whose answer is uninteresting.
*  It can be solved, but the answer is uninteresting.
*  There's also no end of problems that are very interesting,
*  some of which you've asked me, but we don't have a clue how to solve them.
*  When first presented with a problem, almost every problem is one or the other.
*  It's the jackpot when you find one that isn't one or the other.
*  It seems like there's a gray area between the two, right? That's where you should be looking.
*  Well, I wouldn't describe it as a gray area. I would describe it as a knife edge.
*  It's a very small area.
*  There isn't a huge area with a sign. Here lie problems that are doable,
*  and people want to know the answer.
*  In some deep sense, that's where timing is everything with physics, with science,
*  with discovery.
*  With timing. I think earlier in my career, I erred more on the side of problems that were
*  not solvable.
*  The ambition of youth.
*  What made you fall in love with physics at first? If we can go back to the early days,
*  black holes were there in the beginning.
*  Do you remember what really made you fall in love?
*  I wanted to reach nirvana, and I realized that wasn't going to happen.
*  After that, I wanted to know the meaning of life, and I realized I probably wasn't going to figure
*  that out. Then I wanted to understand
*  the justice, socialism, and world things. I couldn't figure those out either.
*  Smaller and smaller problems.
*  I mean, most of this stuff, I'm talking about adolescence.
*  But it was the biggest problem that I thought that there was a prospect of, but not 100%.
*  I was definitely ready to spend my life in the wilderness knocking my head against the wall, but
*  I haven't had to.
*  I haven't solved them, but I've said enough interesting things that you're interviewing me.
*  Do you remember the early days? Do you feel nostalgic when you think back to the
*  ideas, the circumstances that led you down the path towards black holes, towards theoretical
*  physics, towards the tools of physics, towards this really fascinating world of theoretical physics?
*  Well, I wouldn't add nostalgia to it because
*  it's not like a summer in Italy or something. There are results that are there.
*  Sure.
*  That's what's so gratifying. Of course, one's name disappears from these things.
*  Unless you're Einstein or Newton or something, people are not going to remember my name in 50
*  years. Well, basically every name will be forgotten in hundreds of years.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you able to, by the way, love the exploration of ideas themselves without the names, the
*  recognition?
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I have not. I hope someday, but I have not.
*  There are some experiments now to verify some of my predictions about properties of gravity and
*  so on, but I have not. Most of what I've done is in the, it could happen still. It's still a
*  logical possibility that everything having to do with string theory and, I mean, as we mentioned,
*  I'm betting the farm that it's not, but it is indeed a logical possibility that people would
*  say, can you believe Lex Friedman interviewed Elon Musk and Kenya West and then he interviewed
*  Strominger who was working on this theory that just completely went into the toilet.
*  I'm going to get, with a wife I don't have, I'm going to make a public statement, she'll be on
*  stage, I'll say, I'm really sorry I made this giant mistake of platforming this wild-eyed
*  physicist that believed for decades in the power of theoretical physics. Yes. No, like you said.
*  So that could happen. It could happen. It could happen. It's in the, and of course,
*  if that couldn't happen, it wouldn't be real exploration, right?
*  Absolutely.
*  And so, but I, you know, I do take a lot of satisfaction that some of the things I
*  discovered are at the minimum mathematical truths and they're still, so you don't have that sort of
*  nostalgic feeling of it being something that was
*  gone and I'm still making discoveries now that I'm as excited about. We'll see if they
*  hold the test of time that stand the test of time that these other ones did, but that I'm
*  as excited about as I was about those when I made them. I am easily excitable, as my friends will
*  tell you. Well, one interesting thing about you is, and I have been very excited about things which
*  turned out to be completely wrong, you know? Well, that's the, the excitement is a precondition for,
*  for breakthroughs. But you're also somebody like, just like you said,
*  you don't have a cynical view of the modern state of physics. So there's a lot of people that glorify
*  like the early days of string theory and that, you know, all the, yeah, people are always, yeah,
*  but you're saying like this, this to you, might be one of, if not the most exciting times to be a
*  theoretical physicist. Like when the alien civilizations 500 years from now that visit
*  earth will look back, those, those link the 21st century, some of the biggest discoveries
*  ever were made in the 21st century. Yeah, I mean, when they have a, when they have a measurement of
*  string theory, the fun's over. Then we have to go on to something new, you know? No, there's deep,
*  there's going to be, the fun is over. Oh man. But there is an end to the Nile, right? I mean,
*  there, that there's- Is there? Who told you?
*  Some white bird guy. Let me, let me ask you another trippy out there question now. So again,
*  perhaps unanswerable from a physics perspective, but do you wonder about
*  alien civilizations? Do you wonder about other intelligent beings out there making up their own
*  math and physics, trying to figure out the world? Do you think they're, they're out there?
*  It is hard to understand why there would, given that there's so many planets and of course,
*  there's Drake's formula and we don't exactly know what the, but I mean, I think Fermi's paradox,
*  that, you know, is a real paradox and I, I think there, there probably are and I think it's very
*  exciting that, you know, we might, you know, find some, it's, it's a logical possibility that we
*  could learn about it. I mean, to me, it's super interesting to think about aliens from a perspective
*  of physics because so any intelligent civilization is going to be contending with the ideas,
*  just trying to understand the world around it. So I think that the alien, I think that the universe
*  is filled with alien civilizations. So they all have their physicists, right? They all have their,
*  they're all trying to understand the world around them and it's just interesting to me to imagine
*  all these different perspectives, all these different Einsteins. Yeah. Like trying to make
*  sense of like, though they might be more different than we think. They might be different in a way
*  that we haven't even thought of like smarter or different, just, just different, something that
*  we don't even, we're not even able to describe now. We just haven't thought of that, you know?
*  Yeah. This, this is a really frustrating thing when we think from me as an AI person,
*  you start to think about what is intelligence, which is consciousness. And you start to sometimes
*  again, evening thoughts is how little we understand, how narrow our thinking is about these concepts.
*  Yeah. That it could be intelligence could be, something could be intelligent and be
*  very different, intelligent in a very different way that we won't be able to detect
*  because we're not keeping an open mind, open enough mind. And that's kind of sad because
*  to me, there's also just a strong possibility that aliens or something like alien intelligence or some
*  fascinating, beautiful physical phenomena are all around us. And we're too dumb to see it
*  for now. Or too closed minded to see it. There's something we're just deeply missing,
*  whether it's like fundamental limitations of our cognitive abilities or just because our tools are
*  too primitive right now. Or like the way we, it's like you said, like the ideas seem trivial
*  once you figure it all out, looking back. Yeah. But that kind of makes me sad because there's
*  could be so much beauty in the world we're not seeing because we're too dumb. There surely is.
*  And that's, I guess the process of science and physics is to keep exploring, to keep exploring,
*  to find the thing that will in a century seem obvious.
*  Well, it's something we know for sure. I mean, the brain we don't really understand and that's
*  got to be some fabulously beautiful story that... I'm hoping some of that story will be written
*  through the process of trying to build a brain. So the process of engineering intelligence,
*  not just the neuroscience perspective of just looking at the brain, but trying to create
*  it. But yeah, that story hasn't been written almost at all, or just the early days of
*  figuring that one out. But see, like you said that math is discovered, so aliens should at least have
*  the same math as us, right? I think so. Maybe different symbols? Well, they might have discovered
*  different... They might have discovered it differently and they might have had a different
*  idea of what a proof is. Sure. Yeah. We're very like black and white with the proof thing.
*  Maybe they're a looser. Right. Well, so you can know something is true.
*  To... First of all, you never know something is true with 100% uncertainty. I mean,
*  you might have had a blackout just to be... It's never 100%, right? You might have had a
*  momentary lapse of consciousness, the key step in the proof and nobody read it and whatever.
*  Okay. So you never know for sure. But you can have a preponderance of evidence, which makes it
*  true. And preponderance of evidence is not accepted very much in mathematics. And that was sort of
*  how the famous Ramanujan worked. He had formulas which he guessed at and then he
*  gathered a preponderance of evidence that he was sure they were true. So there might be something
*  completely different. They might function in a very different way.
*  Let me ask you kind of a heavy question for physicists, but one on nuclear weapons.
*  Just in general, what do you think about nuclear weapons where, like philosophical level,
*  where brilliant physicists and brilliant engineering leads to thing that can destroy
*  human civilization? Sort of like some of the ideas that you're working on
*  have power when engineered into machines, into systems. Is there some aspect of you that worries
*  about that? Well, first of all, I don't know what the brilliant had to do with it because of course,
*  Oppenheimer and all that, okay, they did it really fast, but if you didn't have Oppenheimer,
*  I mean, it would all have happened anyway. It had a reality of its own. The possibility of
*  making a nuclear, it didn't depend on the fact that the physicists who built it were brilliant.
*  Maybe that sped it up by a year or two years, but by now we'd have nuclear weapons. It's something
*  that- So the ideas have momentum and that they're unstoppable.
*  Right. The possibility of making nuclear weapons was discovered. It was there before,
*  it's not like somebody made it. Without Picasso, there would never have been a
*  Guernica, but without Oppenheimer, there would surely have still been an atom bomb.
*  But timing matters, right? Timing is very important. There's a guy who must have-
*  Of course, of course, of course. Of course. The timing mattered there.
*  Okay, I mean, you could try to make a case for stopping-
*  No, no, no, no. It's the case of carrying the burden of the responsibility of the power of
*  ideas when manifested into systems. It's not a game. It's not just a game of fun mathematics.
*  Just same with artificial intelligence. You have this, a lot of people in AI,
*  a lot of people in the AI community, it's a fascinating fun puzzle, how to make systems
*  more and more intelligent. You have a bunch of benchmarks, you're trying to make them perform
*  better and better and better. All of a sudden, you have a system that's able to outsmart people.
*  It's now able to be used in geopolitics. It's able to create super intelligent bots that are able to
*  scale control the belief of a population of people. Now you can have world wars. You can have a lot of
*  really risky instabilities- They're incredible. They really are incredible.
*  There is some responsibility. This is not sort of- It's a beauty and a terror to these ideas.
*  Yeah. At that moment, it was certainly a question for Oppenheimer and everybody who participated in
*  that. What is the responsible way to serve society when you're sort of accidentally in this position
*  of being at the forefront of a development that has a huge impact on society? I don't see my work
*  a likelihood of having a huge impact on the development of society itself, but if I were you
*  working on AI, I think that there is a possibility there and that it is as a responsible
*  scientist that it's really not a good thing to say, I'm just the scientist here and I'm figuring
*  out what's possible. Because you're in a role where you have more of a podium to influence
*  things than other people and it's your responsibility as a citizen of the planet.
*  Or let me phrase it a little less shrewdly. You have an opportunity as a citizen of the planet to
*  make the world a better place, which it would be sad to bypass.
*  Yeah, it's a nice world without going. It'd be nice to keep it going for a little bit longer.
*  Andrew, I'm really honored that you sat down with me. Thank you for your work.
*  It was a really great conversation. I really enjoyed it. You really covered a lot. I can't
*  believe you're able to discuss at this level on so many different topics. So it's a pleasure.
*  It was super fun. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Strominger.
*  To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now let me leave you with some words from Werner Heisenberg.
*  Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
