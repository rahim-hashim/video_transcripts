# Manolis Kellis Meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything  Lex Fridman Podcast #142
**Lex Fridman:** [November 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgNzUxyS-kQ)
*  Following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis his fourth time on the podcast
*  He's a professor at MIT and head of the MIT computational biology group
*  Since this is episode number
*  142 and 42 as we all know is the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything
*  According to the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
*  We decided to talk about this unanswerable question of the meaning of life in whatever way
*  We to descendants of apes could muster from biology psychology to metaphysics and to music
*  Quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts related to the episode. Thanks to
*  Grammarly, which is a service for checking spelling grammar sentence structure and readability
*  athletic greens the all-in-one drink that I start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases and
*  Cash app the app I use this and money to friends
*  Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast
*  As a side note, let me say that the opening 40 minutes of the conversation are all about the many songs that formed
*  The soundtrack to the journey of Manolis is life
*  It was a happy accident for me to discover yet another dimension of depth to the fascinating mind of Manolis
*  I include links to YouTube versions of many of the songs we mentioned in the description and
*  Overlay lyrics on occasion, but if you're just listening to this without listening to the songs or watching the video
*  I hope you still might enjoy as I did the passion that Manolis has for music
*  His singing of the little excerpts from the songs and in general the meaning we discuss
*  That we pull from the different songs
*  If music is not your thing I do give timestamps to the less musical and more philosophical parts of the conversation
*  I hope you enjoy this little experiment in conversation about music and life
*  If you do, please subscribe on YouTube review it with five stars and up a podcast follow on Spotify
*  Support on patreon or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now here's my conversation with Manolis
*  Callous
*  You mentioned Leonard Cohen and the song hallelujah as a beautiful song. So
*  What are the three songs you draw the most meaning from about life?
*  Don't get me started. So there's really countless songs that have marked me that have sort of
*  Shaped me in periods of joy and in periods of sadness
*  My son likes to joke that I have a song for every sentence
*  He will say because very often I will break into a song with a sentence. He'll say
*  My wife calls me the radio because I can sort of recite hundreds of songs
*  That have really shaped me. So it's very it's gonna be very hard to just pick a few
*  So I'm just gonna tell you a little bit about my song transition as I've grown up in Greece
*  It was very much about as I told you before the misery the poverty but also overcoming adversity
*  so some of the songs that I that have really shaped me are
*  Harris Alexiu, for example
*  It's one of my favorite singers in Greece
*  And then there's also really just old traditional songs that my parents used to listen to like one of them is
*  ne moon
*  plosios, which is basically oh if I was rich and
*  The song is painting this beautiful picture
*  About all the noises that you hear in the neighborhood in his poor neighborhood
*  The train going by the priest walking to the church and the kids crying next door and all of that
*  And he says with all of that, I'm having trouble falling asleep and dreaming if I was rich and then he was like, you know
*  Breaking to that so it's this juxtaposition
*  Between the spirit and the sublime and then the physical and the harsh reality
*  It's just not having troubles not not not being miserable
*  So basically rich to him just means not out of my misery basically
*  And then also being able to travel being able to sort of be the captain of a ship and you know
*  See the world and stuff like that. So it's just such beautiful imagery
*  So many of the Greek songs just like the poetry we talked about they acknowledge the the cruelty the difficulty of life
*  But are longing for a better life. That's exactly right. And another one is to holo
*  Yeah
*  and this one of those songs that has like a fast and joyful half and a
*  Slow and sad half and it goes back and forth between them and it's like
*  So poor, you know, basically
*  It's the state of being poor. I don't I don't even know if there's a word for that
*  In English and then fast part is the here yes, um, I got
*  So and then it's like oh, you know
*  Basically
*  Like the state of being poor and misery, you know for you
*  I write all my songs etc. And then the fast part is in your arms grew up and
*  Suffered and you know stood up and you know rose
*  men with clear vision
*  this whole concept of
*  taking on the world
*  With nothing to lose because you've seen the worst of it
*  this imagery of
*  Silaki Paris opula haras tako risopula. So it's describing the young men as
*  Cypress trees and that's probably one of my earliest exposure to a metaphor to sort of you know
*  this very rich imagery and I love about the fact that I was reading a story to my kids the other day and it was dark and
*  My daughter who's six is like, oh, can I please see the pictures and Jonathan who's?
*  eight so some of my daughter Cleo
*  Is like, oh, let's look at the pictures and my son Jonathan he's like but but Cleo if you look at the pictures
*  It's just an image if you just close your eyes and listen, it's a video
*  It's beautiful and he's basically showing just how much more the human imagination has
*  Besides just a few images that you know, the book will give you and then another one. Oh gosh
*  This one is really like miserable. It's
*  It's called stop ery gyaly talk before and it's basically describing how
*  Vigorously we took on our life and we pushed hard towards the direction that we then realized was the wrong one
*  And it again these songs give you so much perspective
*  There's no songs like that in English that were basically, you know
*  Sort of just smack you in the face about sort of the passion and the force and the drive
*  And then it turns out we just followed the wrong life. Yeah, and it's like wow
*  Okay, all right, so that that's like before 12th so so, you know growing up instead of this
*  Horrendously miserable, you know sort of view of romanticism of you know suffering
*  So then my preteen years is like, you know learning English through songs
*  So basically, you know listening to all the American pop songs and then memorizing them vocally before I even knew what they meant
*  So, you know Madonna and Michael Jackson and all of these sort of really popular songs and you know, George Michael and
*  Just songs that I would just listen to the radio and repeat vocally and eventually as I started learning English
*  I was like, oh wow this thing I've been repeating
*  I know I now understand what it means without re listening it in but just with re repeating it was like oh
*  Again Michael Jackson's man in the mirror is
*  Teaching you that it's your responsibility to just improve yourself
*  You know if you want to make the world a better place they could look at yourself and make the change this whole concept
*  Of again, I mean all of these songs you can listen to them shallowly or you can just listen to them and say oh
*  There's deeper meaning here and I think there's a certain philosophy of song as a way of touching the psyche
*  So if you look at regions of the brain people have lost their language ability because they have an accident in that region of the brain
*  can actually sing
*  because it's exactly the symmetric region of the brain and that again teaches you so much about language evolution and
*  sort of the the duality of
*  musicality and
*  You know rhythmic patterns and
*  Eventually language do you have a sense of why songs developed?
*  So you're kind of suggesting that it's possible that there is something important about our
*  connection with song and with music on the level of
*  The importance of language is it possible that it's not just possible in my view language comes after music
*  Language comes after song. No, seriously, like basically my view of human cognitive evolution is
*  Is
*  Rituals if you look at many early cultures, there's rituals around every stage of life
*  There's organized dance performances
*  Around mating and if you look at mate selection, I mean that's an evolutionary drive right there
*  So basically if you're not able to string together a complex dance as a bird
*  You don't get a mate and that actually forms this
*  Development for many song learning birds
*  Not every bird knows how to sing and not every bird knows how to learn a complicated song
*  so basically there's
*  birds that simply have the same few tunes that they know how to play and a lot of that is
*  inherent and genetically encoded and others are birds that learn how to sing and
*  the you know
*  if you look at a lot of these exotic birds of paradise and stuff like that like the mating rituals they have are
*  Enormously amazing and I think human mating rituals of you know ancient tribes are not very far off from that
*  And in my view the sequential formation of these movements is a prelude to the cognitive
*  Capabilities that ultimately enable language
*  It's fascinating to think that that's not just an accidental precursor to intelligence. Yeah, it's
*  Actually selected it's well it's actually selected and it's a prerequisite
*  Yeah, it's like it's required. Yeah, and and even as language has now developed
*  I think the artistic expression is
*  Needed like badly needed by our brain
*  So it's not just that oh our brain can kind of you know, take a break and go do that stuff
*  No, I mean, you know, I don't know if you remember that scene from oh gosh, we're setting Jenny Jack Nicholson movie in New Hampshire
*  All all work and no play make Jack a dull boy
*  Shining the shining
*  So there's this amazing scene where he's constantly trying to to concentrate and what what's coming out of the typewriters just gibberish
*  And I have that image as well when I'm when I'm working and I'm like no that basically all of these crazy
*  You know huge number of hobbies that I have they're not just
*  Tolerated by my work they're required by my work this ability of sort of stretching your brain in all these different directions is
*  Connecting your emotional self and your cognitive self and that's a prerequisite to being able to be cognitively
*  Capable, at least in my view. Yeah, I wonder if the world without art and music
*  You're just making me realize that perhaps that world would be not just
*  Devoid of fun things to look at or listen to but devoid of all the other stuff all the
*  bridges and rockets and science exactly exactly creativity is not disconnected from art and
*  You know my kids I mean, you know, I could be doing the full math treatment to them
*  No, they play the piano and play the violin and they play sports. I mean this whole
*  you know sort of movement and
*  going through mazes and playing tennis and
*  You know playing soccer and avoiding obstacles and all of that that forms your three-dimensional view of the world
*  Being able to actually move and run and play in three dimensions
*  It's extremely important for math for you know stringing together complicated concepts. It's the same underlying
*  cognitive machinery that is used for navigating mazes and for
*  Navigating theorems and sort of solving equations. So I can't
*  You know, I can't have a conversation with my students without you know, sort of either using my hands or
*  opening the whiteboard in
*  Zoom and just constantly drawing or you know back when we had in-person meetings just the whiteboard on the whiteboard
*  Yeah, that that's fascinating to think about so that's Michael Jackson man
*  careless whisper with George Michael
*  Which is a song I like you can say careless whisper. I mean I didn't say that I like that one
*  I had recorded I had recorded no no, no, it's an amazing song for me
*  I had recorded a small part of it as it played at the tail end of the radio and I had a tape
*  Where I only had part of that song
*  And I played it over and over and over again. Just so beautiful. It's so heartbreaking. There's that song is almost Greek
*  It's so hard break. No, George Michael is Greek. Is he great? He's great. He's knows George Michael. He is right. I mean he's Greek. Yeah
*  No
*  So sorry to offend you so deeply not knowing this
*  Okay, so anyway, so we're moving to France when I'm 12 years old and now I'm getting into the songs of Gainsbourg
*  So Gainsbourg is this?
*  Incredible French composer he is always seen on stage like not even pretending to try to a please just like with your cigarette
*  Just like we're mumbling his songs, but the lyrics are unbelievable
*  Like basically entire sentences will rhyme he will say the same thing twice and you're like whoa
*  And in fact another speaking of Greek a French Greek George Mustache. This song is just magnificent
*  avec ma gueule de métèque de juif errant de patrie grecque
*  so with my
*  face of
*  Metec is actually a Greek word
*  it's you know
*  it's a French word for a Greek word but met mean comes from meta and then ek from Ikea from ecology which means home so
*  Metec is someone who has changed homes who are migrant
*  so with my face of a migrant and and you'll love this one the juif errant the patrie grecque of
*  Meandering Jew of
*  Greek pastor
*  So again, you know the Russian Greek, you know Jewish Orthodox connection so
*  And mesh over catravo with my hair in the four wings
*  avec mes yeux tout délavé qui me donne l'air de rêver avec with my eyes that are all washed out who
*  Give me the pretense of dreaming but who don't dream that much anymore with my hands of thief of
*  musician and
*  who have
*  Stolen so many gardens with my mouth that has drunk that has
*  Kissed and that has bitten without ever pleasing its hunger
*  with my
*  Skin that has been rubbed
*  in the Sun of all the summers and
*  Anything that was wearing a skirt
*  With my heart and then you have to listen to these first. It's so beautiful
*  Avec mon coeur qui a su faire souffrir autant qu'il a souffert
*  with my heart that
*  Knew how to make suffer as much as it suffered
*  but
*  Was able to that knew how to make in French is actually super
*  That knew how to make yes you fair so freer or tonkila so fair
*  Versus that span the whole thing. It's just beautiful
*  Yeah, on a small tangent, you know Jack Jack bro, of course, of course
*  Yeah, I'm a key to PA. Yeah those songs those that song gets me every time
*  So there's a cover of that song by one of my favorite female artists not Nina Simone. No, no, no, no
*  modern Harold Emerald she's
*  from Amsterdam and
*  She she has a version of numikito power she's actually added some English lyrics and
*  It's it's really beautiful. But again numikito pies is so I mean, it's you know, the promises
*  Yeah, the volcanoes that you know will restart. Yeah, it's just so beautiful and
*  I love so there's not many songs that so
*  Show such depth of desperation for another human being that's so powerful
*  Unapologetic
*  Yeah, they better
*  But on the pay we look look up and then high school now
*  I'm starting to learn English as I moved to New York. So stings Englishman in New York
*  Yeah
*  Magnificent song and again, there's if manners maggots man as someone said then he's the hero of the day
*  It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile be yourself. No matter what they say
*  And then takes more than combat gear to make a man takes more than a license for a gun
*  Confront your enemies avoid them when you can a gentleman will walk but never run
*  It's it again you're talking about songs that teach you how to live
*  I mean this is one of them basically says it's not the combat gear that makes a man
*  Where's the part where he says?
*  There you go
*  Jenna gentleness sobriety are rare in this society
*  Night a candle's brighter than the sun
*  So beautifully basically says well, you just might be the only one
*  Modesty propriety can lead to notoriety. You could end up as the only one it's
*  It basically tells you you don't have to be like the others be yourself show kindness
*  Show generosity don't you know don't let that anger get to you
*  You know the song fragile how fragile we are how fragile we are
*  So again as in Greece, I didn't even know what that meant how fragile we are
*  but the song was so beautiful and then eventually I learned English and I actually understand the lyrics and
*  The song is actually written
*  after the Contras murdered Ben Linder in 1987 and the US eventually turned against
*  supporting these guerrillas and it was just a political song but so such a realization that you can't win with violence
*  basically and
*  That song starts with the most beautiful poetry. So if blood will flow
*  when flesh and still are one
*  drying in the color of the evening Sun
*  Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away, but something in our minds will always stay
*  Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument that nothing comes through violence and nothing ever could
*  For all those born beneath an angry star
*  Lest we forget how fragile we are
*  Damn right. I
*  Mean, that's poetry
*  it was beautiful and
*  He's using the English language. It's just such a
*  refined way with deep meanings, but also words that rhyme just so beautifully and
*  Evocations of when flesh and steel are one I
*  mean, it's just
*  Mind-boggling. Yeah, and then of course the refrain that everybody remembers is on and on the rain will fall
*  Etc but like this year star. Wow. Yeah
*  And again tears from a star how fragile we are. I mean just these rhymes are just flowing so naturally
*  There's something it's it seems that more meaning comes when there's a rhythm that
*  I don't know what what that is that probably connects to exactly what you were saying
*  If you pay close attention, you will notice that the more obvious words sometimes are the second verse and the less obvious
*  Are often the first verse because it makes the second verse flow much more naturally
*  Because otherwise it feels contrived. Oh you went and found this like unusual word
*  Yes in dark moments the whole album of Pink Floyd and the movie just marked me enormously
*  As a teenager just the wall
*  And there's one song that never actually made it into the album
*  that's only there in the movie about when the Tigers broke free and the Tigers are the tanks of the Germans and
*  It just describes again this vivid imagery. It was just before dawn one miserable morning in black 44
*  When the forward commander was told to sit tight when he asked that his men be withdrawn and the generals gave thanks as the other
*  ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while and
*  The Anzio Brigade bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives
*  So that's a theme that keeps coming back in Pink Floyd with us versus them
*  Send them God only knows that's not what we would choose to do
*  For work he cried from the rear and the front rows died
*  From another songs like this whole concept of auspicious them and there's that theme of us versus them again where the child is
*  Discovering how his father died when he finds an old and I found it one day in a drawer old
*  Photographs hidden away and my eyes still grow damp to remember his majesty signed with his own rubber stamp
*  So it's so ironic because it seems the way that he's writing it that he's not crying because his father was lost
*  He's crying because kind old King George
*  Took the time to actually write mother a note about the fact that his father died
*  It's so ironic because it basically says
*  We are just ordinary men. And of course, we're disposable
*  So I don't know if you know the root of the word pioneers
*  But you had a chessboard here earlier a pawn
*  In France the pion
*  They are the ones that you sent to the front to get murdered slaughter
*  This whole concept of pioneers having taken this whole disposable ordinary men
*  To actually be the ones that you know, we're now treating us here is
*  so anyway
*  There's this juxtaposition of that and then the part that always just strikes me is the music and the tonality totally changes
*  And now he describes the attack
*  It was dark all around there was frost in the ground when the Tigers broke free and
*  No one survived from the Royal Fusiliers
*  company Z
*  They were all left behind
*  most of them dead the rest of them dying and
*  That's how the high command took my daddy from me and that song even though it's not in the album
*  Explains the whole movie because it's this movie of misery
*  It's this movie of someone being stuck in their head and not being able to get out of it
*  There's no other movie that I think has captured so well this
*  Prison that is someone's own mind and this wall that you're stuck inside and this you know
*  Feeling of loneliness and sort of is there anybody out there?
*  And you know, hello. Hello
*  Anybody in there just not if you can hear me is there anyone home?
*  Come on, yeah, I hear you're feeling down
*  Just one
*  Again
*  Anyway, so yeah the prison of your mind. So those are the darker moments exactly. These are the darker moments
*  Yeah, it's in the darker moments. The mind does feel
*  Like you're you're trapped in
*  Alone in a room with it. Yeah, and there's this this scene in the movie
*  Which like where he just breaks out with his guitar and there's this prostitute in the room
*  He starts throwing stuff and then he'd like, you know breaks the window
*  He throws the chair outside and then you see him laying in the pool with his own blood like, you know everywhere and then
*  There's these endless hours spent fixing every little thing and lining it up and it's this whole sort of mania
*  Versus you know, you can spend hours building up something and just destroy it in a few seconds
*  one of my turns is that song and it's like I
*  Feel cold as a tourniquet
*  Dry as a funeral drum
*  And then the music bill
*  Run to the bedroom. There's a suitcase on the left. You find my favorite acts
*  Don't look so frightened. This is just a passing phase one of my bad days
*  I need to rewatch it. That's so
*  This is a teenager it like ruins your mind
*  like so many such harsh imagery and then
*  You know anyway, so so there's the dark moment and then again going back to sting now. It's the political songs Russians
*  And I think that song should be a new national anthem for the US not for Russians but for red versus blue
*  Mr. Khrushchev says we will bury you. I don't subscribe to this point of view
*  It'd be such an ignorant thing to do if the Russians love their children, too
*  What is it doing? It's basically saying
*  The Russians are just as humans as we are
*  There's no way that they're gonna let their children die and then it's just so beautiful
*  How can I save my innocent boy from?
*  Oppenheimer's deadly toy and now that's the new national anthem. Are you reading there is a no monopoly of
*  Common-sense on either side of the political fence. We share the same biology
*  Regardless of ideology
*  Believe me when I say to you. I hope the Russians love their children, too
*  There's no such thing as a winnable war. It's a lie. We don't believe anymore. I
*  Mean it's beautiful right and for God's sake America wake up
*  These are your fellow Americans they're your your fellow biology
*  You know, there is no monopoly of common sense on either side of the political fence. It's just so beautiful
*  There's no crisper
*  Simpler way to say Russians love their children to the common humanity
*  yeah, and remember the what I was telling you I think in one of her first podcast about the
*  the daughter who's crying for her husband from for her brother to come back for more and
*  Then the Virgin Mary appears and says who should I take instead this Turk? Here's his family. Here's his children
*  this other one he just got married, etc and
*  That basically says no. I mean if you look at the Lord of the Rings
*  The enemies are these monsters. They're not human and that's what we always do
*  We always say they you know, they're not like us. They're different. They're not humans, etc
*  So there's this dehumanization that has to happen for people to go to war
*  You know if you realize this how close we are genetically one with the other this whole 99.9 percent identical
*  You can't bear weapons against someone who's like that
*  And the things that are the most meaningful to us in our life lives at every level is the same on all sides
*  I'm so sides exactly. So not just that we're genetically the same. Yeah, we're ideologically the same
*  We'd love our children. We love our country. We will you know, we will fight for our family
*  so
*  And the last one I mentioned last time we spoke which is Johnny Mitchell's both sides now
*  So she has three rounds one on clouds one on love and one on life and on clouds. She says
*  Rose and flows of angel hair and ice cream
*  Castles in the air and feather canyons everywhere. I've looked at clouds that way
*  But now they only block the Sun they rain and snow on
*  Everyone so many things I would have done but clouds got in my way
*  And then I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow it's
*  Clouds illusions. I recall I really don't know clouds
*  At all and then she goes on about love how it's super super happy or it's about misery and loss and about life
*  How it's about winning and losing and so so forth. But now old friends are acting strange
*  They shake their heads. They say I've changed
*  Well, something's lost and something's gained in living every day
*  So again, that's growing up and realizing that well
*  The view that you had as a kid is not necessarily that you have an adult
*  You remember my poem from when I was 16 years old of this whole
*  You know children dance now all in row and then in the end
*  Even though the snow seems bright without you have lost their light sound that sang and moon that smiled
*  So this whole concept of if you have love and if you have passion
*  You see the exact same thing from different way you can go out running in the rain or you could just stay in and say
*  Sucks I won't be able to go outside now
*  Both sides anyway, and the last one is last last one. I promise. It's a lot Leonard Cohen. This is amazing, by the way
*  How much joy you have in so many
*  Avenues of life and music is just one of them. That's amazing. But yes Leonard Cohen
*  Going back to Leonard Cohen since that's where you started so Leonard Cohen's dance me to the end of love
*  That's what that was our opening song in our wedding with my wife
*  No, that's as we came out to greet the guests
*  It was dancing to the end of love and then another one which is just so passionate always and we always keep referring back to
*  It is I'm your man
*  and
*  It goes on and on about sort of I can be every type of lover for you
*  Yeah, and what's really beautiful in marriage is that we live that with my with my wife every day
*  You can have the passion you can have the anger you can have the love you can have the tenderness
*  There's just so many gems in that song
*  If you want a partner take my hand or if you want to strike me down in anger
*  Here I stand. I'm your man
*  Then if you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you
*  If you want a driver climb inside or if you want to take me for a ride
*  You know, you can so this whole concept of you want to drive
*  I'll follow you want me to drive. I'll drive
*  And the difference I would say between like that and never keep the pies this song. He's got an attitude. He's like
*  He's proud of this his ability to basically be any kind of man for the only long as opposed to the Jacques Brel like
*  Desperation of what do I have to be for you to love me?
*  Desperation
*  But but but notice there's a parallel here
*  There's a verse that is perhaps not paid attention to as much which says ah, but a man never got a woman back
*  Not by begging on his knees
*  So it seems that the I'm your man is actually an apology song in the same way that number kid top eyes an apology song
*  number kid top I basically says I've
*  Screwed up I'm sorry, baby. Any the same way that the careless whisper is I screwed up. Yes, that's right
*  I'm never gonna dance again
*  Guilty feet have got no rhythm
*  So so this is an apology song not by begging on his knees or I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet
*  They're not how let your beauty like a dog
*  Heat and I'd claw at your heart not tear at your sheet. I'd say please
*  and then
*  The the last one is so beautiful
*  If you want a father for your child or only want to walk with me a while
*  across the sand
*  I'm your man
*  That's the last verses which basically says you want me for a day
*  I'll be there. You want me to walk. I'll be there. You want me for life?
*  You want a father for your child I'll be there too, it's just so beautiful. Oh, sorry
*  Remember how I told you we're gonna finish with a light-hearted song. Yes
*  Last one you ready? So
*  Allison Krauss and Union Station country song believe it or not the lucky one
*  so I I've never identified as much with the
*  lyrics of a song as this one and it's hilarious my friend set up in Batso glue
*  Is the guy who got me to genomics in the first place?
*  I owe enormously to him and he's another Greek. We actually met dancing believe it or not
*  So we used to perform Greek dances was the president of the International Students Association
*  so we put on these big performances for 500 people at MIT and
*  There's a picture on the MIT tech where seraphim who's like, you know
*  Bodybuilder was holding on your shoulder. I was like like doing maneuvers in the air basically
*  So anyway, this guy said a theme
*  We were driving back from
*  a conference and there's this Russian girl who was describing how every member of her family had been either
*  Killed by the communists or killed by the Germans or kill
*  like she had just like, you know misery like death and
*  You know sickness and everything everyone was decimated in her family
*  she was the last standing member and we stop at a
*  Serving was driving and we stopped at a rest area and he can he takes me side. He's like Manolis
*  We're gonna crash
*  Get her out of my car
*  And then he basically says but but but I'm only reassured because you're here with me and I'm like, what do you mean?
*  He's like, you know, he's like from your smile. I know you're the luckiest man on the planet
*  So there's this really funny thing where I just feel freaking lucky all the time and
*  It's an it's a question of attitude. Of course, I'm not any luckier than any other person
*  But if it's something horrible happens to me
*  I'm like and in fact even in that song the the the song about sort of you know
*  Walking on the beach and is you know, sort of taking our life the wrong way and then you know having to turn around
*  At some point he's like, you know in the fresh sand we wrote her name
*  or a poofy six or bad social how nicely that the wind blew and
*  The writing was erased
*  so again, it's this whole sort of not just
*  Saying bummer, but oh great. I just lost this this must mean something
*  Right as horrible thing happened. It must open the door to a new door beautiful chapter
*  So so Allison Krause is talking about the lucky one. So I was like, oh my god, she wrote a song for me
*  And she goes you're the lucky one
*  I know that now as free as the wind blowing down the road loved by many hated by none
*  I'd say you were lucky because you know what you've done not to care in the world or not. They were inside
*  Everything's gonna be alright cuz you're the lucky one
*  And then she goes you're the lucky one always having fun and Jack of all trades a master of none
*  You look at the world with the smiling eyes and laugh at the devil as his train rolls by
*  I'll give you a song and a one-night stand
*  You'll be looking at a happy man cuz you're the lucky one. It's basically says
*  If you just don't worry too much if you don't try to be you know a
*  One whole one trick pony if you just embrace the fact that you might suck at a bunch of things
*  But you're just gonna try a lot of things and then there's another first that says
*  Well, you're blessed I guess but never knowing which road you're choosing
*  Do you the next best thing to playing and winning is playing and losing?
*  It's just so beautiful because he basically says if you try
*  Your best but it's still playing if you lose it's okay you had an awesome game and
*  Again superficially it sounds like a super happy song
*  But then there's a the last verse basically says no matter where you are
*  That's where you'll be you can bet your luck won't follow me
*  Just give you a song and then one night stand you'll be looking at a happy man and in the video of the song
*  She just walks away or he just walks away or something like that. And it basically tells you that freedom comes at a price
*  Freedom comes at the price of non-commitment this whole sort of birds will love a bird's could cry. You can't really love
*  Unless you cry you can't just be the lucky one the happy boy. La la la and
*  Yet have a long-term relationship
*  So it's you know on one hand I identify with the shallowness of the song of you know
*  You're the lucky one jack of all trades a master of none
*  But at the same time I identify with a lesson of well, you can't just be the happy merry-go-lucky all the time
*  Sometimes you have to embrace loss and sometimes you have to embrace suffering and sometimes you have to embrace that
*  If you have a safety net, you're not really committing enough
*  You're not you know, basically you're allowing yourself to slip
*  But if you just go all in and you just you know, let go of your reservations. That's when you truly will get somewhere
*  So anyway, that's like they I managed to narrow it down to what 15 songs
*  Thank you for that wonderful journey. They just took us on the
*  Darkest possible places of Greek
*  song to
*  Ending on this a country song. I haven't heard it before but that's exactly right. I feel the same way
*  Depending depending on the day is this the luckiest human on earth and there's something there's something to that but you're right it
*  it needs to be we need to now return to the muck of life in order to be able to
*  to
*  To truly enjoy it. So it's what do you mean muck? What's muck?
*  the messiness of life the
*  Things that word things don't turn out the way you expect it to yeah the way so like to feel
*  Lucky is like focusing on the on the beautiful consequences
*  Yeah, but then that feeling of things being different than you expected that
*  You stumble in all the kinds of ways that that seems to be it needs to be paired with the feeling
*  There's basically one way the only way not to make mistakes is to never do anything
*  Right
*  Basically you have to embrace the fact that you'll be wrong so many times in so many research meetings
*  I just go off on a tangent and I say let's think about this for a second and it's just
*  Crazy for me who's a computer scientist to just tell my biologist friends. What if biology kind of work this way?
*  yeah, and they humor me they just let me talk and
*  Rarely has it not gone somewhere good
*  It's not that I'm always right, but it's always something worth exploring further that
*  if you're an outsider with humility and
*  Knowing that I'll be wrong a bunch of times, but I'll challenge your assumptions
*  You know and often take us to a better place is
*  part of this whole sort of messiness of life like if you don't try and lose and get hurt and
*  Suffer and cry and just break your heart and all these feelings of guilt and you know, wow, I did the wrong thing
*  Of course that's part of life and that's just something that you know, if you are the doer you'll make mistakes
*  If you're a criticizer, yeah, sure
*  You can sit back and criticize everybody else for the mistakes they make or instead you can just be out there making those mistakes
*  And frankly, I'd rather be the criticized one than the criticize
*  Brilliantly put every time somebody steals my bicycle. I say well, I know my son is like why do they steal our bicycle dad?
*  And I'm like aren't aren't you happy that you have bicycles that people can steal?
*  I'd rather be the person stolen from them. Yeah
*  Critic that counts. Yeah, so that's we've just talked amazingly about life from the music perspective
*  let's
*  Talk about life from human life from perhaps other perspective and its meaning so this is episode
*  142
*  There is perhaps an absurdly
*  Deep meaning to the number 42 that
*  The our culture has has elevated. So this is a perfect time to talk about the meaning of life
*  We've talked about it already. But do you think this question?
*  That's so simple and
*  So seemingly absurd has value of what is the meaning of life? Is it something that?
*  Raising the question and trying to answer it. Is that a ridiculous pursuit or is there some value? Is it answerable at all?
*  So first of all, I feel that we owe it to your listeners to say why 42 sure
*  So, of course the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy came up with 42
*  as
*  Basically a random norm number just you know
*  The author just pulled it out of a hat and he's admitted so he said mile 42 just seemed like
*  Just random numbers any
*  But in fact, there's many numbers that are linked to 42. So
*  42 again just just to summarize is
*  the
*  answer that these
*  Super mega computer that had computed for a million years with the most powerful computer in the world had come up with at some point
*  the computer says I
*  Have an answer and they're like what it's like you're not gonna like it
*  Like what is it? It's 42
*  Then the irony is that they had forgotten of course what the question was. Yes
*  Nothing have to build bigger computers figure out what the question is to which the answer 42
*  So as I was turning 42, I basically sort of researched
*  Why 42 is such a cool number and it turns out that and I put together this little passage that was explaining to all those
*  guests to my 42nd birthday party why we're talking about the meaning of life and
*  Basically talked about how 42 is the angle at which light reflects off of water to create a rainbow
*  And it's so beautiful because the rainbow is basically the combination of sort of it's been raining
*  But there's hope because the Sun just came out. It's a very beautiful number there
*  So 42 is also the sum of all rows and columns of a magic cube that contains all consecutive integers starting at one
*  So basically if you if you take all integers between one and however many vertices there are the sums is always 42
*  42 is the only number
*  Left under 100 for which the equation of x to the cube plus y to the cube plus z to the cube is n and
*  Was not known to not have a solution and now it's the you know, it's the only one that actually has a solution
*  42 is also one zero one zero one zero in binary
*  Again, the yin and the yang the good and the evil one and zero the balance of the force
*  42 is a number of chromosomes for the giant panda
*  Panda I know it's totally random
*  Or is it vicious symbol of great strength coupled with peace friendship gentle temperament harmony balance and friendship
*  Whose black and white colors again symbolize yin and yang the reason why it's the symbol for China is
*  Exactly the strength but yet peace and so on so forth. So 42 chromosomes
*  It takes light
*  10 to the minus 42 seconds to cross the diameter of a proton
*  connecting the two fundamental dimensions of space and time
*  42 is the number of times a piece of paper should be folded to reach beyond the moon
*  Which is what I assume my students mean when they ask that their paper reaches for the stars
*  I just tell them just fold it a bunch of times
*  42 is the number of messier object 42, which is Orion and that's you know
*  one of the most famous
*  Galaxies, it's I think also the place where we can actually see the center of our galaxy
*  42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol in ASCII
*  Which is very useful when searching for the stars and also a reg ex for life the universe and everything so star
*  In Egyptian mythology the goddess Maat
*  Which was personifying truth and justice would ask 42 questions to every dying person and those answering successfully would become stars
*  Continue to give life and fuel universal growth
*  In Judaic tradition God ascribe is ascribed the 42 lettered name and trusted only to the middle-aged pious meek free from bad temper
*  sober and not insistent on his rights
*  And in Christian tradition, there's 42 generations from Abraham
*  Isaac that we talked about the story of Isaac Jacob eventually Joseph Mary and Jesus in
*  Kabbalistic tradition Eloca, which is 42 is the number with which God creates the universe
*  Starting with 25 letter B and ending with 17 good
*  So 25 plus, you know 17
*  There's a 42 chapter sutra, which is the first Indian religious scripture, which was translated to Chinese thus introducing Buddhism to China
*  from India
*  The 42 line Bible was the first printed book making the mark marking the age of printing in the
*  1450s and the dissemination of knowledge eventually leading to the Enlightenment a
*  yeast cell which is
*  Coolest single cell eukaryotes and the subject of my PhD research has exactly 42 million proteins
*  Anyway, so so there's this is your own fire with this. These are really good. I guess what you're saying is just a random number
*  Yeah, basically
*  So all of these are background names, so, you know after you have the number you figure out why that number
*  so anyway, so now that we've spoken about why 42 why do we search for meaning and
*  You're asking, you know, will that search ultimately lead to our destruction and my my thinking is exactly the opposite
*  So basically that asking about meaning is something that's so inherent to human nature
*  It's something that makes life beautiful that makes it worth living and that searching for meaning is actually the point
*  It's not the finding it. I think when you found it, you're dead
*  Don't don't ever be satisfied that you know, I've got it
*  So I like to say that life is lived forward, but it only makes sense backward
*  and I don't remember whose quote that is but the the the whole search itself is the meaning and
*  What I love about it is that
*  There's a double search going on there's a search in every one of us through our own lives to find meaning and
*  Then there's a search which is happening for humanity itself
*  to find our meaning and
*  We as humans like to look at animals and say, of course, they have a meaning like a dog has its meaning
*  It's just a bunch of instincts, you know running around loving everything
*  You know remember our joke with a cat and the dog
*  So so and I'm noticing the yin yang symbol right here with this whole panda black and white and the zero one
*  Do you want fire with that 42? Some of those are gold ASCII value for the star symbol
*  anyway, so so basically in my view that the search for meaning and the act of
*  searching for something more meaningful
*  is
*  Life's meaning by itself big the fact that we kind of always hope that yes, maybe for animals
*  That's not the case
*  But maybe humans have something that we should be doing and something else and it's not just about procreation. It's not just about
*  Dominance it's not just about strength and feeding etc
*  Like we're the one species that spends such a tiny little minority of its time feeding
*  That we have this enormous, you know huge cognitive
*  Capability that we can just use for all kinds of other stuff and that's where art comes in
*  That's where you know, the healthy mind comes in with you know
*  exploring all of these different aspects that are just not directly tied to
*  To a purpose that's not directly tied to a function
*  It's really just the the playing of life the you know, not not for particular reason
*  Do you think this thing we got this this mind is?
*  Unique in the universe
*  In terms of how difficult it is to build
*  So is it possible that we're the?
*  The most beautiful thing that the universe has constructed
*  Both are most beautiful the most ugly but certainly the most complex. So look at evolutionary time
*  The dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135 million years. We've been around for a million years
*  So
*  1 versus 135 so dinosaurs were extinct, you know about 60 million years ago and mammals that had been happily evolving
*  As tiny little creatures for 30 million years then to cover the planet and then you know dramatically radiated about 60 million years ago
*  out of these mammals came the
*  neocortex
*  Formation so basically the the neocortex which is sort of the outer layer of our brain
*  Compared to our quote-unquote reptilian brain, which we share the structure of with all of the dinosaurs
*  They didn't have that and yet the rule the planet. So how many other planets have still you know mindless dinosaurs?
*  Where strength was the only dimension?
*  ruling the planet so
*  There was something weird that annihilated the dinosaurs and again
*  You could look at biblical things of sort of God coming and wiping out his creatures and to make room for the next ones
*  so
*  The mammals basically sort of took over the planet and then grew
*  This cognitive capability of this general-purpose machine and primates
*  Push that to extreme and humans among primates have just
*  exploded that hardware, but that hardware is
*  Selected for
*  survival
*  It's selected for procreation
*  It's initially
*  Selected with his very simple Darwinian view of the world of
*  random mutation
*  Ruthless selection and then selection for making more of yourself
*  If you look at human cognition, it's gone down a weird evolutionary path in the sense that
*  We are expending an enormous amount of energy on this apparatus between our ears
*  That is wasting what 15% of our bodily energy 20% like some enormous percentage of our
*  calories go to function our brain
*  No other species makes that big of a commitment that has basically taken energetic changes for
*  efficiency on the metabolic side for humanity to
*  basically power that thing and our brain is both
*  Enormously more efficient than other brains, but also despite this efficiency enormously more energy-consuming
*  So and if you look at just the sheer
*  Folds that the human brain has again our skull could only grow so much before it could no longer go through the pelvic opening and
*  Kill the mother at every birth. So but yet the folds continued effectively creating just so much more capacity
*  The evolutionary
*  Context in which this was made is enormously fascinating and it has to do with
*  Other humans that we have now killed off or that have gone extinct and
*  That has now created this weird place of humans on the planet as the only species that has this enormous hardware
*  So that can basically make us think that there's something very weird and unique that happened in human evolution that perhaps has not been
*  recreated elsewhere, maybe the asteroid didn't hit, you know sister earth and
*  Dancers are still ruling and you know any any kind of proto human is squished and eaten for breakfast basically
*  However, we're not as unique as we like to think because there was this enormous diversity of other human like forms and
*  Once you make it to that stage where you have a neocortex like explosion of wow
*  We're now competing on intelligence and we're now competing on social structures and we're now competing on larger and larger
*  groups and being able to
*  coordinate and being able to have empathy the concept of empathy the concept of an ego the concept of a self of
*  Self-awareness comes probably from
*  Being able to project
*  another person's intentions
*  To understand what they mean when you have these large cognitive groups large social groups, so
*  Me being able to sort of create a mental model of how you think
*  May have come before I was able to create a personal mental model of how do I think so this introspection?
*  probably came after this sort of
*  Projection and this empathy which basically means, you know passion pathos suffering
*  But basically sensing so basically empathy means feeling what you're feeling
*  trying to project your emotional state onto my cognitive apparatus and I think that is
*  What eventually led to this enormous cognitive explosion that happened in humanity, so
*  you know
*  life itself in my view is
*  Inevitable on every planet inevitable inevitable, but the evolution of life to
*  Self-awareness and cognition and all the incredible things that humans have done
*  You know that might not be as inevitable. That's your intuition. So if you were to sort of
*  Estimate and bet some money on it if we reran earth a million times
*  Would what we got now be the most special thing and how often would it be so
*  scientifically speaking how repeatable is this experiment so
*  This whole cognitive revolution. Yes
*  Maybe not
*  maybe not basically I feel that the longevity of
*  You know dinosaurs
*  Suggest that it was not quite inevitable that we that we humans eventually
*  Made it what you're also implying one thing here
*  You're saying you're implying the humans also don't have this longevity
*  This is the interesting question. So with the Fermi paradox the idea that the basic question is like if
*  The universe has a lot of alien life forms in it. Why haven't we seen them?
*  Yeah, and one thought is that there's a great filter or multiple great filters that basically would destroy
*  Intelligent civilizations like we this thing that we you know, this multifolding brain that
*  Keeps growing may not be such a big feature. It might be useful for survival
*  But it like takes us
*  Down a side road that is a very short one with a quick dead end. What do you think about that?
*  So I think the universe is enormous not just in space but also in time
*  And
*  The the pretense that you know
*  The last blink of an instant that we've been able to send radio waves is when somebody should have been paying attention to our planet
*  Is a little ridiculous
*  So my you know, what I love about Star Wars is a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away
*  It's not like some distant future. It's a long long time ago. What I love about it is that it's a long long time ago
*  What I love about it is that basically says, you know evolution and civilization
*  Are just so recent
*  In you know on earth like there's countless other planets that have probably all kinds of life forms
*  multicellular perhaps and so and so forth
*  but
*  The fact that humanity has only been listening and emitting for just this tiny little blink
*  Means that any of these
*  You know alien civilizations would need to be paying attention to every single insignificant planet out there
*  and
*  You know again, I mean the movie contact and the book is just so beautiful this whole concept of we don't need to travel
*  Physically we can travel as light we can send instructions
*  For people to create machines that will allow us to beam down light and recreate ourselves
*  And in the book, you know, the aliens actually take over
*  They're not as friendly but
*  You know this concept that we have to eventually go and conquer every planet
*  I mean, I think that yes, we will become a galactic species. So you you have hope well
*  You said thanks. Oh, of course, of course
*  I mean now that we've made it so far you we so you feel like we've made it. Oh gosh
*  I feel that you know cognition the cognition as an evolutionary trait has won over in in our planet
*  You know cognition the cognition as an evolutionary trait has won over in our planet
*  There's no doubt that we've made it. So basically humans have
*  won the battle for
*  you know
*  Dominance it wasn't necessarily the case with dinosaurs like I mean, yes, you know, there's some
*  claims of
*  Intelligence and if you look at Jurassic Park, yeah, sure, whatever
*  But you know, they just don't have the hardware for it
*  Yeah, and humans have the hardware
*  There's no doubt that mammals have a dramatically improved hardware
*  For cognition over dinosaurs like basically there's universes where strength won out
*  And in our planet in our you know, particular version of whatever happened
*  in this planet
*  Cognition won out and it's kind of cool. I mean, it's it's a privilege, right?
*  But it's kind of like living in boston instead of I don't know some
*  middle
*  Middle-aged place where everybody's like hitting each other with with you know
*  Weapons and sticks you back to the lucky one song
*  I mean we are the lucky ones
*  But the flip side of that, uh is that this hardware also allows us to develop weapons and methods of destroying ourselves
*  So you again I want to go back to pinker and the better angels of our nature the whole concept that
*  That
*  Civilization and the act of civilizing has dramatically reduced violence
*  Dramatically if you look, you know at every scale
*  as soon as organization comes the state basically
*  Owns the right to violence
*  and eventually
*  the state gives that right of
*  governance to the people
*  But but violence has been eliminated by that state
*  so this whole concept of
*  central governance and people agreeing to live together
*  and
*  share
*  responsibilities and duties and you know
*  All of that is something that has led
*  so much to less violence less death less suffering less
*  You know poverty less
*  You know war I mean
*  Yes, uh, we have the capability to destroy ourselves
*  but
*  The arc of civilization has led to much much less destruction much much less war and much more peace
*  And of course, there's blips back and forth
*  And you know, there are setbacks
*  but again
*  the moral arc of the universe
*  but it's I
*  Probably imagine there were two dinosaurs back in the day having this exact conversation
*  And they look up to the sky and there seems to be something like an asteroid going towards earth
*  so it's while it's it's very true that
*  The arc of our society of human civilization seems to be progressing towards a better better life for everybody
*  In the many ways that you described
*  Uh things can change in a moment
*  And it feels like it's not just us humans. We're living through a pandemic
*  You could imagine that a pandemic would be more destructive or
*  Uh, or there could be asteroids that just appear out of the the darkness of space
*  Which I recently learned is not that easy to uh, let me give you another number to detect them. Yes
*  So 48 what happens in 48 years?
*  I'm not sure 2068 a pofis
*  There's an asteroid that's coming in 48 years. It has very high chance of actually wiping us out
*  Yes
*  We have 48 48 years to get our act together
*  It's not like some distant distant hypothesis. Yes, like yeah, sure. They're hard to detect but this one we know about it's coming
*  How do you feel about that? Why are you still so optimistic? Oh gosh. I'm so happy with where we are now
*  This is going to be great. Seriously, if you look at progress
*  If you look at again the speed with which
*  Knowledge has been transferred
*  What what has led to humanity making so many advances so fast?
*  Okay
*  So what has led to humanity making so many advances is not just the hardware upgrades
*  It's also the software upgrades
*  So by hardware upgrades, I basically mean our neocortex and the expansion and these layers and you know
*  Folds of our brain and all of that. That's the hardware the software hasn't
*  Uh, you know the the hardware hasn't changed much in the last what 70 000 years
*  As I mentioned last time if you take a person from ancient egypt and you bring them up now they're just as equally fit
*  so
*  Hardware hasn't changed. What has changed is software what has changed is that
*  We are
*  Growing up in societies that are much more complex
*  This whole concept of neoteny basically allows our exponential growth
*  The concept that our brain has not fully understood
*  Our brain has not fully formed has not fully
*  Stabilized itself until after our teenage years
*  So we basically have a good 16 years 18 years to sort of infuse it with the latest and greatest in software
*  If you look at what happened in ancient greece
*  Why did everything explode at once?
*  My take on this is that it was the shift from the egyptian and hieroglyphic software
*  To the greek language software
*  This whole concept of creating abstract notions
*  of creating
*  these
*  layers of cognition
*  and layers of meaning and layers of abstraction for
*  Words and ideals and beauty and harmony. How do you write harmony in hieroglyphics?
*  There's no such thing as you know, sort of expressing these ideals of peace and justice and you know these
*  concepts of
*  Or even you know
*  macabre concepts of doom et cetera, like you don't you don't have the language for it your brain
*  has trouble getting at that
*  Concept so what i'm trying to say is that
*  These software upgrades for human language human culture
*  human environment human education
*  Have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge
*  And eventually after the enlightenment and as I was mentioning the 42 line bible
*  And the printed press the dissemination of knowledge. You basically now have this whole horizontal
*  dispersion of ideas in addition to the vertical inheritance of genes
*  so the hardware
*  Improvements happen through vertical inheritance the software improvements happen through horizontal inheritance
*  And the reason why human civilization exploded is not a hardware change anymore. It's really a software change
*  So if you're looking at now where we are today
*  Look at coronavirus. Yes, sir. It could have killed us a hundred years ago. It would have
*  But it didn't why because in january
*  We we published the gena
*  A month later less than a month later
*  The first vaccine designs were done and now less than a year later 10 months later
*  We already have a working vaccine that's 90 efficient. I mean that is ridiculous by any standards and the reason is sharing
*  So, you know the asteroid yes could wipe us out in 48 years, but 48 years
*  I mean look at where we were 48 years ago
*  technologically
*  I mean how much more we understand the basic foundations of space
*  Is enormous the technological revolutions of
*  digitization the amount of compute power we can put on any like, you know,
*  By nail size, you know hardware is enormous
*  So and this is nowhere near ending, you know, we all have our like little, you know
*  Problems going back and forth on the social side and on the political side on on the cognitive and on the sort of human side
*  And the societal side but
*  Science has not slowed down science is moving at a breakneck pace ahead
*  So, you know elon is now putting rockets out from the private space. I mean that now
*  democratization of space exploration
*  Is you know gonna revolutionize thing?
*  Continue in the same way that every technology has exploded. This is the shift to space technology exploding
*  So 48 years is infinity from now in terms of space capabilities, so I'm not worried at all
*  Are you excited by the possibility of a human?
*  well one the human stepping foot on Mars and
*  to
*  Possible colonization of not necessarily Mars but other planets and all that kind of stuff for people living in space
*  Inevitably inevitable. Would you do it? Are you kind of earth?
*  Of course
*  How many how many people will you wait when you wait for I think it was about when the
*  Declaration of Independence was signs about two to three million people lived here
*  So would you move like before it would you be like on the first boat? Would you be on the tenth boat?
*  Would you wait until the Declaration of Independence? I don't think I'll be on the short list because I'll be old by then
*  They'll probably get a bunch of younger people but you're it's the
*  It's the wisdom and the
*  The
*  You are the last person horizontally you I gotta tell you you are the lucky one. So you might be on the list
*  I don't know. Yeah, I mean I I kind of feel like I would love to see Earth from above just to watch our planets
*  I mean, just I mean, you know, you can watch a live feed of the space station
*  watching Earth is
*  Magnificent like this blue tiny little shield. It's so thin
*  Our atmosphere like if you drive to New York, you're basically in outer space. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's just so thin and
*  It's just again such a privilege to be on this planet such a privilege
*  But I think our species is in for big good things. I
*  Think that you know, we will overcome our little problems and
*  Eventually come together as a species. I feel that we were definitely on the path to that and
*  You know, it's just not permeated through the whole universe yet
*  I mean through the whole world yet through the whole earth yet, but it's definitely permeating
*  So you've talked about humans as special
*  How exactly are we special relative to the dinosaurs?
*  so I mentioned that there's
*  You know this dramatic cognitive
*  Improvement that we've made
*  But I think it goes much deeper than that. So if you look at a lion
*  attacking a gazelle in the middle of the Serengeti
*  the lion is
*  smelling the molecules in the environment, it's
*  Hormones and neuro receptors are sort of getting it ready for impulse
*  The target is constantly looking around and sensing
*  I've actually been in Kenya and I've kind of seen the hunt
*  Yes, I've kind of seen the sort of game of waiting and
*  The mitochondria in the muscles of the lion are basically ready for you know
*  Jumping they're expensing an enormous amount of energy
*  Expensing an enormous amount of energy the grass as it's flowing is constantly transforming solar energy
*  into
*  Chloroplasts, you know through the chloroplasts into energy which eventually feeds the gazelle and eventually feeds
*  the lions and so forth so as
*  Humans we experience all of that
*  But the lion only experiences one layer
*  The mitochondria in its body are only experiencing one layer the chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer
*  the
*  You know photo receptors and the smell receptors and chemical receptors like the lion always attacks against the wind so that it's not smelled
*  like all of these things are
*  One layer at a time and we human somehow perceive the whole stack
*  So going back to software infrastructure and hardware infrastructure if you design a computer
*  You basically have a physical layer that you start with and then on top of that physical layer
*  You have you know the electrical layer and on top of the electrical layer
*  You have basically gates and logic and an assembly layer and on top of the assembly layer
*  You have your you know
*  Higher order higher level programming and on top of that you have your deep learning routine
*  And on top of that you eventually build a cognitive system that's smart I
*  Want you to now picture this cognitive system becoming not just self-aware
*  But also becoming aware of the hardware that it's made of and
*  The atoms that they're that it's made of and so on so forth so it's as if your AI system, and there's this beautiful scene in
*  2001 Odyssey of Space
*  Where how after Dave starts disconnecting him is starting to sing a song about?
*  daisies etc and
*  How is basically saying Dave? I'm losing my mind I
*  Can feel I'm losing my mind. It's just so beautiful this concept of self-awareness of
*  knowing that the hardware is no longer there is amazing and
*  In the same way humans who have had accidents are aware that they've had accidents
*  So there's this self-awareness of AI
*  that
*  Is you know this beautiful concept about you know sort of the eventual cognitive leap to self-awareness?
*  But imagine now the AI system actually breaking through these layers and saying wait a minute
*  I think I can design a slightly better hardware to get me functioning better, and that's what basically humans are doing
*  So if you if you look at our reasoning layer, it's built on top of a cognitive layer and
*  The reasoning layer we share with AI it's kind of cool like there is another thing on the planet that can integrate equations
*  And it's man-made, but we share computation with them. We share this cognitive layer of playing chess
*  We're not alone anymore. We're not the only thing on the planet that plays chess now
*  We have AI that also plays chess but in some sense that that particular organism AI's it is now only operates in that layer
*  Exactly exactly and then most animals operate in the sort of cognitive layer that we're all experiencing
*  A bat is doing this incredible integration of signals, but it's not aware of it
*  It's basically constantly sending
*  echo location waves and it's receiving them back and
*  Multiple bats in the same cave are operating at slightly different frequencies and with slightly different pulses
*  And they're all sensing objects and they're doing motion planning in their cognitive hardware
*  But they're not even aware of all of that
*  All they know is that they have a 3d view of space around them
*  Just like any gazelle walking through, you know the desert and any
*  baby
*  Looking around is aware of things without doing the math of how am I processing all of these visual information, etc?
*  We were just aware of the layer that you live in I think
*  If you look at this at humanity
*  We've basically managed through our cognitive layer through our perception layer through our senses layer through our multi organ layer
*  through our
*  genetic layer
*  through our molecular layer through our
*  atomic layer through our quantum layer
*  Through even the very fabric of the space-time continuum
*  Unite all of that cognitively. So as we're watching that scene in the Serengeti
*  We as scientists we as educated humans
*  We as you know
*  Anyone who's finished high school are aware of all of this beauty of all of these different layers interplaying together
*  And I think that's something very unique in
*  Perhaps not just the galaxy, but maybe even the cosmos
*  these
*  Species that has managed to in space
*  cross through these layers from the enormous
*  To the infinitely small and that's what I love about particle physics the fact that it actually unites everything
*  They're very small. They're very small and they're very big
*  It's only through the very big that this very small gets formed like basically every atom of gold
*  Results from the fusion that happened of
*  you know increasingly large particles before that explosion that then disperses it through the cosmos and
*  It's only through understanding the very large that we understand every small and vice versa and that's in space
*  Then there's the time
*  Direction as you are watching the Kilimanjaro
*  Mountain you can kind of look back through time
*  To when that volcano was exploding and you know growing out of the tectonic forces as you drive through
*  Death Valley you see these mountains on their side and these layers of
*  history exposed
*  We are aware of the
*  Eons that have happened on earth and the tectonic movements on earth
*  the same way that we're aware of
*  The Big Bang and
*  The you know early evolution of the cosmos and we can also see forward in time as to where the universe is heading
*  We can see you know apophis in 2068 coming over
*  Looking ahead in time. I mean that would be magician stuff, you know in ancient times
*  So what I love about humanity and its role in the universe is that
*  You know, if there's a God watching he's like finally somebody figured it out
*  Finally somebody figured it out. I've been building all these beautiful things and somebody can appreciate and figured me out
*  Me like become aware of yeah, you know
*  Yeah, so it's kind of interesting
*  So to think of the world in this way as layers and us humans
*  Are able to what convert those layers into ideas that they you can then like combine
*  Right. So we're doing some kind of conversion
*  Exactly exactly and last time you asked me about whether we live in a simulation for example, I mean
*  Realize that we are
*  Living in simulation. We are the reality that we're in without any sort of person programming this is a simulation
*  Like basically what happens inside your skull?
*  There's this integration of sensory inputs which are translated into perceptory signals
*  Which are then translated into a conceptual model of the world around you and
*  That exercise is
*  happening seamlessly and yet
*  You know if you if you think about sort of again this whole simulation and neo
*  analogy
*  You can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix as the matrix, but we've actually broken through the matrix
*  We've actually traversed the layers. We didn't have to take a pill like we didn't make you know
*  Morpheus didn't have to show up to basically give us the blue pill or the red pill. We were able to
*  sufficiently evolve cognitively through the hardware explosion and
*  sufficiently involve
*  scientifically through the software explosion to basically get at breaking through the matrix realizing that we live in a matrix and
*  Realizing that we are this thing in there and yet that thing in there has a consciousness that lives through all these layers
*  And I think we're the only species we're the only thing that we even can think of that has actually done that has sort of
*  permeated
*  space and time
*  Scales and layers of abstraction
*  plowing through them and
*  Realizing what we're really really made of and the next frontier is of course cognition
*  So we understand so much of the cosmos so much of the stuff around us
*  But the stuff inside here
*  Finding the basis for the soul finding the basis for the ego for the self the self-awareness
*  When do when does the spark happen that basically sort of makes?
*  You you I mean that's you know, really the next frontier. So so in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity
*  somewhere between the cognitive layer and the
*  Reasoning layer or the computational layer
*  There's still some stuff to be figured out there and I think that's the final frontier of sort of completing our journey through that matrix
*  It may be duplicating it into in other versions of ourselves through AI
*  Which is another very exciting
*  Possibility what I love about AI and the way that it operates right now is the fact that it is unpredictable
*  There's emergent behavior in our cognitively capable artificial systems
*  That we can certainly model but we don't
*  Encode directly and that's a key difference
*  So we like to say oh, of course, this is not really intelligent because we coded it up
*  And we've just put in these little parameters there and there's like, you know
*  Was six billion parameters and once you've learned them, you know, we kind of understand the layers
*  But that's an oversimplification
*  It's it's like saying oh, of course humans we understand humans
*  They're just made out of neurons and you know layers of cortex and there's a visual
*  area and there's a but but every human is encoded
*  By a ridiculously small number of genes compared to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus
*  20 000 genes is really not that much out of which a tiny little fraction are in fact encoding all of our cognitive functions
*  The rest
*  Is emergent behavior?
*  the rest is the
*  You know the the cortical layers
*  Doing their thing in the same way that when we build, you know
*  These conversational systems or these cognitive systems or these deep learning systems
*  We put the architecture in place, but then they do their thing
*  And in some ways that's creating something that has its own identity that's creating something that's not just oh, yeah
*  It's not the the early ai where if you hadn't programmed what happens in the grocery bags when you have both cold and hot and hard and
*  soft
*  You know the system wouldn't know what to do. No. No you basically now just program the primitives and then it learns from that
*  so even though the origins are humble just like it is for genetic code for ai, even though the origins are humble the
*  The uh the result of it being deployed into the world is infinitely complex
*  and that's
*  And yet there's not it's not yet able to be cognizant of all the other layers in
*  Of its you know, it's not
*  uh, it's not able to
*  Think about the space and time
*  It's not able to think about the hardware in which it runs the electricity on which it runs yet
*  So so if you look at humans
*  We basically have the same cognitive architecture as monkeys as the great apes. It's
*  Just a ton more of it
*  If you look at um gpt3 versus gpt2
*  Again, it's the same architecture just more of it
*  And yet it's able to do so much more. Yeah, so if you start thinking about sort of what's the future of that?
*  GPT-455 do you really need fundamental different architectures or do you just need a ton more hardware?
*  And we do have a ton more hardware like these systems are nowhere near what humans have between our ears
*  so
*  You know, there's something to be said about stay tuned for emergent behavior
*  We keep thinking that general intelligence might just be forever away
*  But it could just simply be that we just need a ton more hardware
*  And that humans are just not that different from the great apes except for just a ton more of it
*  Yeah, it's interesting that in the ai community
*  Maybe there's a human centric fear, but the notion that gpt10 will be
*  Uh will achieve general intelligence is something that people shy away from that there has to be something totally different and new added to this
*  And yet it's not seriously considered that
*  This this very simple thing this very simple architecture when scaled might be the thing that achieves super intelligence
*  And people think the same way about humanity and human consciousness
*  They're like, oh consciousness might be quantum or it might be, you know, some some non-physical thing and it's like
*  Or it could just be a lot more of the same hardware that now is sufficiently capable of self-awareness
*  Just because it has the neurons to do it
*  So maybe the consciousness that is so elusive
*  Is an emergent behavior?
*  Of you basically string together all these cognitive capabilities that come from running from seeing for reacting from
*  Predicting the movement of a fly as you're catching it through the air
*  All of these things are just like great lookup tables encoded in a giant neural network
*  I mean i'm oversimplifying of course the complexity and the diversity of the different types of excitatory inhibitory neurons
*  the waveforms that sort of shine through the
*  You know the the connections across all these different layers the amalgamation of signals, etc
*  The brain is enormously complex. I mean, of course, but again, it's a small number of primitives
*  Encoded by a tiny number of genes
*  which are
*  Self-organized and shaped by their environment
*  Babies that are growing up today are listening to language
*  From conception basically as soon as the auditory apparatus forms
*  It's already getting shaped to the types of signals that are out in the real world today
*  So it's not just like oh have an egyptian be born and then ship them over it's like no that that egyptian would be
*  Listening in to the complex of the world and then getting born and sort of seeing just how much more complex the world is
*  So it's a combination of the underlying hardware
*  Which if you think about as a geneticist in my view the hardware gives you an upper bound of cognitive capabilities
*  But it's the environment that makes those capabilities shine and reach their maximum so we're a combination of
*  nature and nurture
*  The nature is our genes and our cognitive
*  apparatus and the nurture
*  Is the richness of the environment that makes that cognitive apparatus reach its potential?
*  And we are so far from reaching our full potential
*  So far
*  I think that kids being born a hundred years from now
*  They'll be looking at us now and saying what primitive educational systems they had
*  I can't believe people were not wired into this, you know virtual reality from birth
*  As we are now because like they're clearly inferior
*  And so and so forth. So I basically think that our environment will continue
*  exploding
*  And our cognitive capabilities, it's not like oh we're only using 10% of our brain. That's ridiculous
*  Of course, we're using 100% of our brain
*  But it's still constrained by how complex our environment is
*  So the hardware will remain the same but the software
*  In a quickly advancing environment the software will make a huge difference in the nature of
*  Like the human experience the human condition is fascinating to think that humans will look very different a hundred years from now
*  Just because the environment changed even though we're still the same great apes the the descendant of apes
*  At the core of this is kind of a notion of ideas
*  That uh, I don't know if you're
*  There's a lot of people that's including you eloquently about this topic, but richard dawkins talks about
*  the notion of memes
*  and say this
*  notion of ideas
*  You know multiplying selecting
*  In the minds of humans, do you ever think from about ideas from the from that perspective ideas as organisms themselves?
*  They're breeding in the minds of humans
*  I love the concept of memes. I love the concept of these horizontal transfer of ideas and sort of permeating through through
*  you know our
*  Layer of interconnected neural networks so you can think of sort of the cognitive
*  Space that has now connected all of humanity
*  Where we are now one giant
*  Information and idea sharing network
*  Well beyond what was thought to be ever capable when the concept of a meme was created by richard dawkins
*  so but I want to take that concept just
*  You know into another twist
*  which is the horizontal transfer of
*  humans
*  with fellowships
*  and the fact that
*  As people apply to mit from around the world
*  There's a selection that happens
*  Not just for their ideas
*  But also for the cognitive hardware
*  That came up with those ideas
*  So we don't just ship ideas around anymore. They don't evolve in a vacuum
*  the ideas themselves influence
*  The distribution of cognitive systems i.e humans and brains
*  Around the planet. Yeah, we ship them to different locations based on their properties. That's exactly right
*  So so those cognitive systems that think of you know physics for example might go to cern
*  And those that think of genomics might go to the brode institute
*  And those that think of computer science might go to I don't know stanford or cmu or mit
*  And you basically have this coevolution now
*  Of memes and ideas
*  and the cognitive
*  conversational systems that
*  Love these ideas and feed on these ideas and understand these ideas and appreciate these ideas
*  now coming together
*  so you basically have
*  Students coming to boston to study because that's the place where these type of cognitive systems thrive
*  And they're selected
*  based on their cognitive output and their
*  Idea output but once they get into that place
*  the
*  Boiling and interbreeding of these memes becomes so much more frequent
*  That what comes out of it is so far beyond if ideas were evolving in a vacuum
*  Of an already established hardware cognitive interconnection system of the planet
*  Where now you basically have
*  The ideas shaping the distribution of these systems and then the genetics kick in as well
*  You basically have now
*  These people came to be a student kind of like myself who now stuck around and are now professors
*  bringing up our own
*  genetically encoded and genetically related cognitive systems
*  Mine are eight six and three years old
*  Who are now growing up in an environment surrounded by other?
*  Cognitive systems of a similar age
*  With parents who love these types of thinking and ideas and you basically have a whole interbreeding now
*  of
*  genetically
*  selected
*  transfer of cognitive systems
*  Where the genes and the memes?
*  Are co-evolving the same soup of ever-improving knowledge and societal
*  Inter
*  Fertilization cross-fertilization of these ideas so that this beautiful image
*  So these are shipping these actual meat cognitive systems to physical locations
*  They they tend to cluster in the biology ones cluster in a certain building too
*  So like within that there's there's uh, there's clusters on top of clusters top of clusters
*  What about in the online world?
*  Is that do you also see that kind of because people now
*  form groups on the internet that they stick together so they
*  They can sort of uh, these cognitive systems can
*  Collect themselves and uh
*  breed together
*  Uh in in different layers of spaces it doesn't just have to be physical space. Absolutely. Absolutely
*  So basically there's the physical rearrangement, but there's also the conglomeration of the same cognitive system
*  Doesn't need to be a human
*  Doesn't need to belong to only one community
*  Yeah, so yes, you might be a member of the computer science department
*  But you can also hang out in the biology department
*  But you might also go in line online into I don't know poetry department readings and so on so forth or you might be
*  Part of a group that only has 12 people in the world
*  But that are connected through their ideas and are now
*  Interbreeding these ideas in a whole other way. So this um
*  This coevolution of genes and memes is not just physically instantiated. It's also sort of rearranged
*  You know in this cognitive
*  space as well
*  and uh in the sometimes these cognitive systems hold conferences and they all
*  Gather around and there's like one of them is like talking and they're all like listening and then they discuss
*  And then they have free lunch and so on
*  No, but but but then that's where you find students where you know
*  When I go to a conference I go through the posters where i'm on a mission
*  Basically, my mission is to read and understand what every poster is about and for a few of them
*  I'll dive deeply and understand everything but I make it a point to just go poster after poster in order to read all of them
*  And I find some gems and students that I speak to that sometimes eventually join my lab
*  And then sort of you're you're sort of creating this permeation of you know the transfer
*  of ideas of ways of thinking and very often of moral values of social structures
*  of
*  You know just more
*  Imperceptible properties of these cognitive systems that simply just cling together
*  Basically, you know there's
*  I have the luxury at at mit of not just choosing smart people but choosing smart people who I get along with
*  who are generous and friendly and creative and smart and you know excited and
*  Childish in their in, you know uninhibited behaviors and so forth. So you basically can choose yourself to surround
*  You can choose to surround yourself with people who are not only cognitively
*  compatible but also
*  You know
*  imperceptibly through the
*  Metacognitive systems compatible and again when I say compatible not all the same
*  sometimes
*  You know not very different times all the time the teams are made out of complementary components
*  Not just compatible but very often complementary so in my own team I have a diversity of students who come from very different backgrounds
*  There's a whole spectrum of biology to computation, of course, but within biology. There's a lot of realms within computation. There's a lot of realms and
*  What makes us
*  Click so well together
*  Is the fact that not only do we have a common mission a common passion and a common?
*  you know
*  view of the world
*  But that were complementary in our skills in our angles with which we come at it and so so forth
*  And that's sort of what makes it click. Yeah, it's fascinating that the the the stickiness of
*  multiple cognitive systems together
*  Includes both the commonality so you meet because you're there's some common thing but you stick together
*  Because you're different in all the useful ways. Yeah. Yeah, and my wife and I I mean we adore each other like two pieces
*  But we're also extremely different in many ways and that's beautiful
*  She's gonna be listening to this but I love that about about us
*  I love the fact that you know, i'm like living out there in the you know world of ideas and I forget what the eight is
*  And she's like well at 8 a.m. The kids better be to school
*  And uh, you know, I I I do get yelled at
*  But but I need it basically I need her as much as she needs me and she loves interacting with me and talking I mean
*  We you know last last night we're talking about this
*  And I showed her the questions and we were bouncing ideas of each other and it was just beautiful like we basically have these, you know
*  basically
*  Cognitive, you know, let it all loose kind of dates where you know, we just bring papers and we're like, you know
*  Bouncing ideas and etc. So, you know, we we have extremely different perspectives but very common, you know
*  Goals and interests and anyway, what do you make of the communication mechanism that we humans use to share those ideas?
*  because like one essential element of all of this is not just that we're able to
*  Have these ideas, but we're also able to share them. We tend to maybe you can correct me, but we seem to use
*  Language to share the ideas. Maybe we share them in some much deeper way than language
*  I don't know. But what do you make of this whole mechanism and how fundamental it is to the human condition?
*  So some people will tell you that your language
*  Dictates your thoughts and your thoughts cannot form outside language
*  I tend to disagree
*  I see
*  thoughts as
*  Much more abstract as you know, basically when I dream I don't dream in words
*  I dream in shapes and forms and you know three-dimensional space with extreme detail
*  I was describing so when I wake up in the middle of the night, I actually record my dreams
*  Sometimes I write them down in a dropbox file
*  other times i'll just dictate them in you know audio and
*  My wife was giving me a massage the other day because like my left side was frozen
*  And I started playing the recording and as I was listening to it
*  I was like, I don't remember any of that and of course and then the entire thing came back
*  But then there's no way any other person could have recreated that entire sort of, you know, three-dimensional
*  Shape and dream and concept and in the same way when i'm thinking of ideas
*  There's so many ideas. I can't put two words
*  I mean I will describe them with a thousand words
*  But the idea itself is much more precise or much more sort of abstract or much more something, you know
*  difference either less abstract or more abstract and it's either you know
*  Basically the
*  There's just the projection that happens from the three-dimensional ideas into let's say a one-dimensional language
*  And the language certainly gives you the apparatus to think about concepts that you didn't realize existed before
*  And with my team we often create new words
*  I'm like, well now we're going to call these the regulatory plexus of a gene
*  And that gives us now the language to sort of build on that as one concept
*  That you then build upon with all kinds of other other things
*  So there's this co-evolution again of ideas in language, but they're not one-to-one with each other
*  Now, let's talk about language itself
*  words
*  sentences
*  This is a very
*  Distant construct from where language actually begun. So if you look at how we communicate
*  As i'm speaking my eyes are shining and my face is changing through all kinds of emotions
*  And my entire body composition posture is reshaped
*  And my intonation the pauses that I make the softer and the louder and the this and that are
*  conveying so much more information
*  and
*  If you look at early human language
*  and if you look at how
*  You know the great apes communicate with each other. There's a lot of granting. There's a lot of posturing
*  There's a lot of emotions. There's a lot of sort of shrieking etc
*  they have
*  a lot of components of our
*  human language
*  Just not the words
*  So I think of human communication
*  As combining the ape component but also of course the you know gpt3 component
*  So basically there's the cognitive layer and the reasoning layer that we share with different parts of our relatives
*  There's the ai relatives, but there's also the granting relatives
*  And what I love about humanity is that we have both we're not just a conversational system
*  We're a granting
*  emotionally charged, you know
*  weirdly
*  interconnected system that also has the ability to reason
*  And when we when we communicate with each other there's so much more than just language there's so much more than just words
*  It does seem like we're able to somehow transfer
*  Even more than the the body language. It seems that in the room with us is always a giant knowledge base
*  of like
*  shared experiences different perspectives on those experiences, but
*  I don't know the knowledge of who the last three four presidents in the united states was and just all the
*  You know 9-eleven the tragedies in 9-eleven all the all the beautiful and uh, terrible things that happen in the world
*  They're somehow both in our minds and somehow enrich the ability to transfer information
*  What I love about it is that can I can talk to you about 2001?
*  Auditor's face and mention a very specific scene and that evokes all these feelings that you had when you first watched it
*  We're both visualizing that maybe in different ways exactly but in the yeah and not only that but the feeling
*  Uh is brought back up just like you said with the dreams
*  We both have that feeling arise in some form exactly as you bring up the how you know
*  Facing his own mortality
*  Yeah, it's fascinating that we're able to do that, but I don't know
*  Now let's talk about neural link for a second. So what's the concept of neural link?
*  The concept of neural link is that i'm going to take
*  Whatever knowledge is encoded in my brain
*  Directly transfer it into your brain
*  so
*  This is a beautiful fascinating and extremely sort of you know appealing concept
*  But I see a lot of challenges surrounding that
*  The first one is we have no idea how to even begin to understand how knowledge is encoded
*  in a person's brain
*  I mean I told you about this paper that we had recently with leeway tai and uh asaf marco
*  That basically was looking at these n-grams that are formed with combinations of neurons that co-fire when a stimulus happens
*  Where we can go into a mouse and select those neurons that fire by marking them and then see what happens when they first fire
*  And then select the neurons that fire again when the experience is repeated
*  These are the recall neurons and then there's the the memory consolidation neurons
*  So we're starting to understand a little bit of sort of the distributed nature of knowledge and coding and experience encoding
*  in the human brain and in the mouse brain and
*  The concept that we'll understand that sufficiently one day
*  to be able to take a snapshot of
*  What does that scene from Dave losing his mind of how losing his mind and talking to Dave?
*  How is that seen and coded in your mind imagine the complexity of that but now imagine
*  Suppose that we solve this problem
*  And the next enormous challenge is how do I go and modify the next person's brain to now create the same exact neural connections?
*  So that's an enormous challenge right there. So basically it's not just reading it's now writing
*  And again, what if something goes wrong? I don't want to even think about that. That's number two and number three
*  Who says that the way that you encode Dave i'm losing my mind?
*  And I encode Dave i'm losing my mind
*  Is anywhere near each other?
*  Basically, maybe the way that i'm encoding it
*  Is twisted with my childhood memories of running through, you know the
*  Pebbles in greece and yours is twisted with your childhood memories growing up in russia
*  and
*  There's no way that I can take my encoding and put it into your brain because it'll a mess things up
*  And b be incompatible with your own unique experiences. So that's telepathic communications from human to human
*  That's fascinating. You're you're reminding
*  Us that uh, there's there's uh, two biological systems on both ends of that communication
*  The one the easier I guess
*  maybe half as difficult
*  a thing to do and the hope with neural link is that
*  We can communicate with an ai system. So yeah where one side of that is a little bit. Yeah more controllable, but
*  But even just that is is exceptionally difficult. Let's talk about two
*  Two neuronal systems talking to each other suppose that gpt4
*  Tells gpt3. Hey, give me all your knowledge
*  Right. It's ready. It's hilarious. I have 10 times more hardware. I'm ready. Just feed me
*  What's gpt3 gonna do is it gonna say oh, here's my 10 billion parameters
*  No, no way
*  The simplest way and perhaps the fastest way for gpt3 to transfer all this knowledge to its older body that has a lot more hardware
*  is to
*  Regenerate every single possible human sentence that it can possibly yes create just keep talking
*  Keep talking and just re-encode it all together. So maybe what language does is exactly that it's taking one
*  Generative cognitive model
*  It's running it forward to emit utterances that kind of makes sense in my cognitive frame and it's re-encoding. I mean to yours
*  Through the parsing of that same language and I think the conversation might might actually be the most efficient way to do it
*  So not just talking but uh interactive so talking back and forth asking questions interrupting
*  So gpt4 will constantly be interrupting
*  Annoying and annoying
*  Yeah, but but the beauty of that is also that as we're interrupting each other
*  There's all kinds of misinterpretations that happen
*  that you know as
*  Basically when my students speak I will often know that i'm misunderstanding what they're saying
*  And i'll be like hold that thought for a second
*  Let me tell you what I think I understood which I know is different from what you said
*  Then i'll say that and then someone else in the same zoom meeting will basically say well
*  You know, here's another way to think about what you just said and then by the third iteration we're somewhere completely different
*  That if we could actually communicate with full
*  You know neural network parameters back and forth of that knowledge and idea and coding
*  Would be
*  far inferior because
*  The re-encoding with our own as we said last time emotional baggage and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences
*  through
*  our shared
*  experience as distinct encodings
*  In the context of all our unique experiences
*  is leading to so much more
*  Diversity of perspectives and again going back to this whole concept of these
*  Entire network of all of human cognitive systems connected to each other
*  And sort of how ideas and memes permeate through that
*  That's sort of what really creates a whole new level of human experience
*  through this
*  Reasoning layer and this computational layer that
*  Obviously lives on top of our cognitive layer
*  So you're one
*  of these
*  aforementioned cognitive systems
*  mortal but
*  Thoughtful and you're connected to a bunch like you said students, your wife your kids
*  What do you?
*  In your brief time here on earth. This is a meaning of life episode
*  so
*  What do you hope?
*  This world will remember you as what do you hope your legacy will be?
*  I don't think of legacy as much as um, maybe most people
*  No, it's kind of funny i'm i'm consciously living the present
*  Many students tell me, you know, oh give us some career advice. I'm like i'm the wrong person
*  I've never made a career plan. I still have to make one
*  I um
*  It's funny to be both
*  experiencing the past and the present in the future
*  but also consciously living in the present and just
*  You know, there's a conscious decision we can make to not worry about all that
*  Which again goes back to the i'm the lucky one kind of thing
*  Of living in the present and being happy winning and being happy losing and um
*  Um
*  There's a certain freedom that comes with that but again a certain um, sort of
*  I don't know ephemerity
*  of living for the present
*  but if you if you step back from all of that where basically my
*  my
*  current modus operandi is live for the present make you know every day
*  the best you can make and just make the
*  Local blip of local maxima of the universe of the awesomeness
*  of the planet and the town and the family that we live in
*  both academic family and and
*  You know biological family
*  Make it a little more awesome by being generous to your friends being generous to the people around you being, you know kind to your enemies
*  and uh, you know just
*  Showing love all around you can't be upset at people if you truly love them
*  If somebody yells at you and insults you every time you say the slightest thing
*  And yet when you see them you just see them with love
*  It's a beautiful feeling. It's like, you know, i'm feeling
*  Exactly like when I look at my three-year-old who's like screaming
*  Even though I love her and I want her good. She's still screaming and saying no, no, no, no, no
*  And i'm like, I love you. Generally love you
*  But I can I can sort of kind of see that your brain is kind of stuck in that little, you know mode of anger
*  and
*  You know, there's plenty of people out there who don't like me and I see them with love
*  As a child that is stuck in a cognitive state
*  That they're eventually going to snap out of or maybe not and that's okay
*  So there's that aspect of sort of
*  You know experiencing
*  You know life with the best intentions
*  And you know, I love when i'm wrong
*  I I had a friend who was like one of the smartest people i've ever met
*  Who would basically say oh, I love it when i'm wrong because it makes me feel human
*  And it's it's so beautiful, I mean she's really one of the smartest people i've ever met and she was like
*  It's such a good feeling
*  and I love being wrong
*  but
*  There's you know, there's something about self-improvement. There's something about sort of how do I
*  Not make the most mistakes but attempt the most rights
*  And do the fewest wrongs
*  But with the full knowledge that this will happen. That's one aspect
*  so so so through this
*  life in the present
*  What's really funny is and that's something that i've experienced more and more
*  Really? Thanks to you and through this podcast
*  Is this enormous number of people who will basically comment wow
*  I've been following this guy for so many years now or wow
*  This guy has inspired so many of us in computation biology and so on so forth. I'm like, I don't know any of that
*  But i'm only discovering this now through this sort of sharing
*  Our emotional states and our cognitive states with a wider
*  audience where suddenly
*  I'm sort of realizing that wow, maybe i've had a legacy
*  Yes, like basically i've trained generations of students from mit
*  And i've put all of my courses freely online since 2001
*  So basically all of my video recordings of my lectures have been online since 2001
*  so countless generations of people from across the world will meet me at a conference and say
*  Like there was a this conference where somebody heard my voice and it's like I know this voice. I've been listening to your lectures
*  And it's just such a beautiful thing where like we're sharing widely and who knows
*  Which students will get where?
*  From whatever they catch out of these lectures, even if what they catch is just inspiration and passion and drive
*  so
*  There's this intangible
*  You know legacy quote unquote that every one of us has through the people we touch
*  One of my friends from undergrad basically told me oh my mom remembers you vividly from when she came to campus
*  I'm like, I didn't even meet her
*  She's like no, but she she sort of saw you interacting with people and said wow, he's exuding this positive energy
*  and
*  There's there's that aspect of sort of just motivating people with your kindness with your passion with your generosity
*  And with your you know, just selflessness
*  Of of you know, just just just give it doesn't matter where it goes
*  I've been to conferences where basically people will you know, i'll ask them a question and then they'll come back to or like
*  There was a company where I asked somebody a question. They said oh in fact
*  This entire project was inspired by your question three years ago at the same conference. Yes. Wow
*  And then on top of that, there's also the ripple effect
*  So you're speaking to the direct influence of inspiration or education, but there's also like
*  The follow-on things that happen to that and there's this ripple that through from you just this one individual
*  And from every one of us from everyone that's what I love about humanity the fact that
*  every one of us shares genes
*  And genetic variants with very recent ancestors with everyone else
*  So even if I die tomorrow
*  My genes are still shared through my cousins and through my uncles and through my you know
*  Immediate family, and of course, i'm lucky enough to have my own children
*  But even if you don't your genes are still permeating through all of the layers of your family
*  So your genes will have the legacy there. Yeah, every one of us
*  Yeah, number two our ideas are constantly intermingling with each other. So there's no person living in the planet
*  100 years from now who will not be directly impacted by every one of the planet living here today
*  Yeah through genetic inheritance and through meme
*  Inheritance that's cool to think that your ideas manolis callas
*  would touch
*  would
*  Touch every single person on this planet. It's interesting
*  But not just mine joe smith who's looking at this right now his ideas will also touch everybody
*  So there's this interconnectedness of humanity
*  And and then i'm also a professor. So my day job is legacy
*  my day job is training not just
*  The thousands of people who watch my videos on the web
*  But the people who are actually in my class who basically come to mit to learn
*  from
*  Bunch of us like the cognitive systems that were shipped
*  To this particular location and who will then disperse back into all of their home countries
*  That's what makes america the beacon of the world. We don't just export
*  You know goods we export people cognitive systems we we export
*  People who are born here and we also export training
*  That people born elsewhere will come here to get and will then disseminate not just whatever knowledge they got but whatever ideals they learned
*  And I think that's something that's a legacy of the us that you cannot stop with political isolation
*  You cannot stop with economic isolation. That's something that will continue to happen through all the people we've touched through our universities
*  So there's the students who took my classes who are basically now going off and teaching their classes
*  And i've trained generations of computation biologists. No one in genomics who's gone through mit
*  Hasn't taken my class. So basically there's this
*  Impact through I mean there's so many people in biotechs who are like hey I took your class
*  That's what got me into the field like 15 years ago. It's just so beautiful. Yes, and then there's the
*  Academic family that I have so the students who are actually studying with me who are my trainees so this sort of
*  mentorship of ancient greece this
*  So I basically have an academic family
*  and
*  We are a family. There's this
*  Such strong connection this bond of you're part of the kelly's family
*  So I have a biological family at home and I have an academic family on campus and that academic family
*  Has given me great grandchildren already. Yes
*  So i've trained people who are now professors at stanford cmu harvard, you know, what you I mean everywhere in the
*  world
*  And these people have now trained people
*  who are now
*  Having their own faculty jobs
*  So there's basically people who see me as their academic grandfather
*  And it's just so beautiful because you don't have to wait for the 18 years of cognitive
*  You know hardware development to to sort of
*  Have amazing conversation with people that are fully grown humans fully grown adults who are, you know
*  cognitively super ready
*  And who are shaped by and you know, I see some of these beautiful papers and like
*  I can see the touch of our lab in those papers
*  It's just so beautiful because you're like I've spent hours with these people teaching them not just how to do a paper
*  But how to think?
*  and this whole concept of
*  You know the first paper that we write together
*  Is an experience with every one of these students
*  So, you know, I always tell them to write the whole first draft and they know that I will rewrite every word
*  But but the act of them writing it and what I do is these like joint editing sessions where i'm like, let's co-edit
*  And with this co-editing we basically have um creative destruction
*  So I share my zoom screen and i'm just thinking out loud as i'm doing this and they're learning from that process as opposed to like
*  Come back two days later and they see a bunch of red on a page. I'm sort of
*  Well, that's not how you write this. That's not how you think about this
*  That's not you know, what's the point like this morning was having I yes this morning between 6 and 8 am
*  I had a two-hour meeting
*  Going through one of these papers and then saying what's the point here? Why why do you even show that?
*  It's just a bunch of points on a graph. No, what you have to do is extract the meaning do the homework for them
*  and there's this
*  nurturing this mentorship
*  that sort of creates now a legacy which is
*  Infinite because they've now gone off on the you know, and and all of that is just humanity
*  Then of course, there's the papers I write
*  Because yes, my day job is training students, but it's a research university
*  The way that they learn is through the mens and manus mind and hand
*  It's the practical training of actually doing research
*  and that research
*  Is a beneficial side effect of having these awesome papers
*  that will now
*  Tell other people how to think
*  There's this paper we just posted recently on med archive and one of the most generous and eloquent comments about it was like wow
*  This is a master class
*  in scientific writing
*  In analysis in biological interpretation and so so forth
*  It's just so fulfilling from a person i've never met or first say the title of the paper brings in
*  I don't remember the title, but it's single cell dissection of schizophrenia
*  reveals
*  And so the two the two points that we found was this whole transcriptional resilience like there's some individuals who are schizophrenic
*  but whose
*  They have an additional cell type or initial cell state which we believe is protective
*  And that cell state when they have it will cause other cells to have normal gene expression patterns. It's beautiful
*  and then that's that cell is
*  Connected with some of the pve interneurons that are basically sending these inhibitory brain waves through the brain
*  and there basically there's an there's another component of
*  There's a set of master regulators that we discovered
*  Who are controlling many of the genes that are differentially expressed?
*  And these master regulators are themselves genetic targets of schizophrenia
*  And they are themselves involved in both synaptic connectivity
*  And also in early brain development
*  So there's this sort of interconnectedness between
*  Synaptic development axis and also this transcriptional resilience. So I mean we basically made up a title that combines all these concepts
*  You have all these concepts all these people working together and ultimately these minds condense it down into a beautifully written little document
*  That lives on and that document now has its own life. Yeah, our work has a hundred and a hundred and twenty thousand citations
*  I mean, that's not just people who read it. These are people who used it to write something based on it
*  I mean that to me is
*  Is just so fulfilling to basically say wow i've touched people
*  so
*  I I don't think of my legacy as I live every day
*  I just think of the beauty of the present
*  and the power of interconnectedness and just
*  I feel like a kid in a candy shop where i'm just like
*  Constantly, you know, where do I what what package do I open first?
*  and um
*  You're the lucky one
*  A jack of all trades a master of none
*  I think uh for a meaning of life episode, uh, we would be amiss if we did not have at least a poem or two
*  Do you mind if we?
*  Uh end in a couple of poems
*  Maybe a happy maybe a sad one. I would love I would love that. So thank you for the luxury
*  Thank you
*  the first one is kind of uh
*  I remember uh
*  when you were talking with eric weinstein
*  about um
*  This comment of leonard cohen. Yes that says but you don't really care for music do ya?
*  Yeah in hallelujah. That's basically kind of like mocking its reader
*  So one of my poems is a little like that
*  so
*  I had just broken up with
*  You know my girlfriend and there's this other friend who was coming to visit me and she said
*  I will not come unless you write me a poem
*  And uh, I was like writing a poem on demand
*  So this this poem is called write me a poem
*  It goes write me a poem. She said with a smile make sure it's pretty romantic and rhymes
*  Make sure it's worthy of that bold flame that love uniting us beyond a mere game
*  And she took off without more words rushed for the bus and traveled the world
*  A poem I thought this is sublime. What better way for passing the time?
*  What better way to count up the hours before she comes back to my lonely tower?
*  Waiting for joy to fill up my heart. Let's write a poem for when we're apart
*  How does a poem start? I inquired
*  Give me a topic cook up a style throw in some cute words. Oh here and there throw in some passion love and despair
*  Love three eggs one pound of flour three cups of water and bake for an hour
*  Love is no recipe as I understand you can't just cook up a poem on demand
*  And as I was twisting all this in my mind, I looked at the page
*  Pagoli it rhymed
*  Three roses white chocolate vanilla powder some beautiful rhymes and maybe a flower
*  No, be romantic the young girl insisted do this do that. Don't be so silly
*  You must believe it straight from your heart. If you don't feel it, we're better apart
*  Oh my sweet thing, what can I say you bring me the sun all night and all day
*  You're the stars and the moon and the birds way up high. You're my evening sweet song my morning blue sky
*  You are my muse your spell has me caught you bring me my voice and scatter my thoughts
*  To put love in writing in vain. I can try
*  But when i'm with you my wings want to fly
*  So I put down the pen and drop my defenses
*  Give myself to you and fill up my senses
*  The baffled king composing ha
*  That was beautiful
*  What I love about it is that I did not
*  Bring up a dictionary of rhymes. I did not sort of
*  Work hard. So basically when I write poems
*  I just type I never go back. I just
*  So when my brain gets into that mode
*  It actually happens like I wrote it. Oh, wow. So the rhyme just kind of the it's an emergent phenomenon
*  It's an emergent phenomenon. I just get into that mode and then it comes out. That's a beautiful one and it's it's basically
*  Um
*  You know as you as you got it
*  It's basically saying it's no recipe and then i'm throwing three throwing the recipes and as i'm writing it i'm like, you know
*  So it's it's very introspective in this whole
*  concept
*  so anyway
*  There's another one many years earlier
*  that um
*  Is you know darker? It's basically this whole concept of let's be friends. I was like
*  Ugh
*  No, let's be friends just like you know, so the last words are shout out. I love you or send me to hell
*  so
*  The the title is burn me tonight
*  Lie to me baby
*  Lie to me now
*  Tell me you love me break me a vow. Give me a sweet word a promise a kiss
*  Give me the world a sweet taste to miss
*  Don't let me lay here inert ugly cold
*  With nothing sweet felt and nothing harsh told
*  Give me some hope false foolish yet kind make me regret i'll leave you behind
*  Don't pity my soul or torture it right?
*  Treat it with hatred start up a fight
*  For it's from mildness that my soul dies when you cover your passion in a bland friend's disguise
*  Kiss me now, baby. Show me your passion turn off the light and rip off your fashion
*  Give me my life's joy this one night
*  Burn all my matches for one blazing light
*  Don't think of tomorrow and let today fade. Don't try and protect me from love's cutting blade
*  Your razor will always rip off my veins
*  Don't spare me the passion to spare me the pains
*  Kiss me now, honey or spit in my face
*  Throw me an insult i'll gladly embrace
*  Tell me now clearly that you never cared say it now loudly like you never dared
*  I'm ready to hear it. I'm ready to die. I'm ready to burn and start a new life
*  I'm ready to face the rough burning truth
*  Rather than waste the rest of my youth
*  So tell me my lover should I stay or go?
*  The answer to love is one yes or no
*  There's no I like you no, let's be friends
*  Shout out. I love you or send me to hell
*  I
*  Don't think there's a better way to end
*  A discussion of the meaning of life. Whatever the heck the meaning is go all in as that poem

*  the wheel new york
