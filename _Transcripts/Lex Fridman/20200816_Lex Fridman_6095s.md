# Sara Seager: Search for Planets and Life Outside Our Solar System | Lex Fridman Podcast #116
**Lex Fridman:** [August 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jA2ABHBc6Y)
*  The following is a conversation with Sarah Seeger, a planetary scientist at MIT known
*  for her work on the search for exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system.
*  She's an author of two books on this fascinating topic. Plus, in a couple days, August 18th,
*  her new book, a memoir called The Smallest Lights in the Universe, is coming out. I read it and I
*  can recommend it highly, especially if you love space and are a bit of a romantic like me.
*  It's beautifully written. She weaves the stories of the tragedies and the triumphs of her life
*  with the stories of her love for and research on exoplanets, which represent our hope to find life
*  out there in the universe. Quick summary of the ads, three sponsors, Public Goods, that's the new
*  one, PowerDot and Cash App. Click the links in the description to get a discount. It really is
*  the best way to support this podcast. As a quick side note, let me say that extraterrestrial life,
*  aliens, I think represent our civilization's longing to make contact with the unknown,
*  with others like us, or maybe others that are very different from us,
*  entities that might reveal something profound about why we're here. The possibility of this
*  is both exciting and, at least to me, terrifying, which is exactly where we humans do our best work.

*  The Scent of Money is a great book on this history. Debits and credits on ledgers started around
*  30,000 years ago. Time flies. The US dollar created over 200 years ago and the first decentralized
*  cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, cryptocurrency is still
*  very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the

*  conversation with Sarah Seeger. When did you first fall in love with the stars?
*  Sarah Seeger I think I've always loved the stars. One of my first memory is of the moon.
*  I remember watching the moon and I was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced and he
*  was driving me and my siblings to his house for the weekend. And the moon was just following me.
*  Just had no idea why that was.
*  Tim Cynova Yeah. So like looking up at the sky and there's this glowing thing.
*  How do you make sense of the moon at that age?
*  Sarah Seeger At age like age five, there's just no way you can. I think it's one of the great
*  things about being a kid. It's just that curiosity that all kids have.
*  Tim Cynova You know, I was thinking because there's these
*  almost out there ideas of that our earth is flat, floating about on the internet. And it made me
*  think, you know, when did I first realize that the earth is like this ball that's flying through
*  empty space? I mean, it's terrifying. It's awe inspiring. I don't know how to make sense of it.
*  Sarah Seeger It's hard because we live in our frame of reference here on this planet.
*  It's nearly impossible. None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature of earth.
*  Tim Cynova I mean, do you remember when you realized,
*  understood like the physics, like the layout of the solar system?
*  Did you first have to take physics to really like high school physics to really take that in?
*  Sarah Seeger I think it's hard to say. I had this book when I was a child. It was in French.
*  I grew up in Canada where French is supposedly taught to all of us English speaking Canadians.
*  And it was this French book in French was about the solar system. And I just love flipping through
*  it. It's hard to say how much you know, you or I understand when we're kids,
*  but it was really great book. Tim Cynova
*  What about the stars? When did you first learn about the stars?
*  Sarah Seeger I have like, I do have this very incredible
*  distinctive memory. And again, it had to do with my dad, he took us camping. Now my dad was from
*  the UK. And he was the type who you'd find wearing a tie on weekends. So camping was not in his fear,
*  comfort zone. We had a babysitter every summer we got a baby. We every summer we had a babysitter.
*  And one summer we had Tom, he was barely older than we were. He was 14. My brother was 12. I
*  would have been 11 or 10 maybe. And we went camping because Tom said camping is the thing,
*  we should try it. And I just remember, I didn't aim to see the stars, but I walked out of my
*  tent in the middle of the night. And I looked up. And wow, so many stars. The dark night sky and
*  all those stars just like screaming at me. I just couldn't believe that. Honestly, like my first
*  thought was this is so incredible, mind blowing. Like, why wouldn't anyone have told me this
*  existed? Can anyone else see this? Have you have you had an experience like that with anything?
*  Like, yeah, I've had that. I mean, I don't know if maybe you can tell me if it's the same.
*  I've had that with robots. There's a few robots I've met where I just fell in love with this. Like,
*  is anyone else seeing this? Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot is our ability
*  to engineer some intelligent beings, intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us,
*  that we can interact with in some rich ways that we haven't yet discovered? Like almost like when
*  you get a puppy, he needs to have a dog and there's this immediate bond and love. And on top of that
*  ability to engineer it, it was, you know, I had to just pause and hold myself. I imagine I don't have
*  kids. I imagine there's a magic to that as well, where it's a totally new experience. It's like,
*  what? Well, yeah, the stars, though, unlike kids or the puppy, it's only a good thing.
*  So you felt you weren't terrified. Like, to me, when I look at the stars, it's almost paralyzingly
*  scary how little we know about the universe, how alone we are. I mean, somehow it feels alone.
*  I'm not sure if it's a it's just a matter of perspective, but it feels like,
*  wow, there's billions of them out there and we know nothing about them. And then also immediately
*  to me, somehow mortality comes into it. I mean, how did that make you feel at that time? I think as a
*  child without articulating it, I felt that same way. Just like, wow, this is terrifying. What's out
*  there? Like, what is this? What does it mean about us here? Now you you're a scientist, an ex-world
*  class scientist, planetary scientist, astronomer. Now, I'm a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly
*  questions. So some questions are a little bit in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical,
*  because we know so little. And one of the awesome things about your work is you've actually put data
*  and real science behind some of the biggest questions that we're all curious about. But
*  nevertheless, many of the questions might be a little bit speculative. So on that topic,
*  just in your sense, do you think we're alone in the universe, human beings?
*  Do you think there's life out there? Well, Lex, the funny thing is, is that as a scientist,
*  I so don't even want to answer that. You really? I will answer it though. Yeah. But I just love to
*  say- You resisted naturally. Yeah, we naturally resist that because we want numbers and hard facts
*  and not speculation. But I do love that question. It's a great question and it's one we all wonder
*  about. But I have to give you the scientist answer first. Yeah, sure. Which is, we'll have
*  the capability to answer that question. Soon, even starting soon. How do you define soon?
*  How do I define soon? So much happened in the last hundred years.
*  Right, right. And there's a difference, right? If it's 10 years or 20 years or a hundred years. Yeah,
*  there's a difference in that. Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.
*  And the answer- By the way, journalists usually don't like that or the people want like tomorrow,
*  they want the news. But what it's going to take is telescopes, space telescopes, or very sophisticated
*  ground or space telescopes to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away and to look
*  what's in the atmospheres and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it, to look
*  for gases that don't belong that we might attribute to life. So we have to do some really nitty gritty
*  astronomy. So the promising way to answer this question scientifically is to look for hints of
*  life. That's where like many of your ideas come in of what kind of hints might we actually see
*  about this life. Right, right. That's exactly what we need to do. And I like the word you chose,
*  hint, because it's going to be a hint. It's not going to be a 100% yay, we found it. And then it
*  will take future generations to do more careful work to hopefully even find a way to send a probe
*  to these distant exoplanets and to really figure this out for us. I mean, we'll talk about the
*  details. Those are fun, but like, back to the speculation, zoomed out big picture.
*  The zoomed out big picture is yes, I believe absolutely there is life out there somewhere,
*  because the vastness of the universe is incredible. It's so breathtaking. When we look at the night
*  sky, if you can go to that dark sky, you can see, you know, many, many hundred or even if you have
*  good eyesight and you're somewhere very dark, you could see thousands of stars. But in our galaxy,
*  we have hundreds of billions of stars and our universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies.
*  So think about all those stars out there. And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare,
*  just because the number of stars is so huge, things have to come together somewhere,
*  someplace in our universe. Yeah, it's so amazing to think that somebody might be looking up on another
*  planet in a distant galaxy. I have to interrupt your reverie and get back to,
*  in our lifetime at least, the short term. We have to, we only have the nearest stars to look at.
*  It's true that there are so many stars, so many hosts for planets that might have life,
*  but in the practical question of will we find it, it has to be a star quite close to Earth,
*  like a few light years, tens of light years, maybe hundreds of light years.
*  By the way, you've introduced me to a tool of Eyes on Exoplanets, I think,
*  that NASA has put together. Eyes on Exoplanets, so a great software you can download.
*  That's so cool. But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are? You said
*  hundreds of light years. How many stars are close by? What's our neighborhood like? We're talking
*  about five, 10 stars that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on. I'm talking about
*  maybe a dozen or two dozen stars. And those are with planets that look suitable for us to follow
*  up in detail. For life. Right. But one thing that's really exciting in this field is that
*  the very nearest star to Earth, called Proxima Centauri, is part of the Alpha Centauri star
*  system. Cool name, by the way. Yeah, Proxima. Whoever names them. Nearby. Okay, but it sounds
*  cooler. Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it that's about an Earth-mass planet
*  in the so-called habitable zone, or the Goldilocks zone of the host star.
*  So think about how incredible that is. Out of all the stars out there, even the very nearest star
*  has planets and has a planet of huge interest to us. Yeah, okay. So can we talk about that planet?
*  What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable? How does size come into play?
*  What we know about gases and what kind of things are necessary for life?
*  What are the factors that make you think that it's habitable? And by the way, maybe one way to talk
*  about that is people know about the Drake Equation, which is a very high-level, almost
*  framework to think about what is the probability that, correct me if I'm wrong, that there's life
*  out there. And intelligent life, I think. I don't know. But then you have an equation named after
*  you now, which I think nicely focuses in on the more achievable and interesting part of that
*  question, which is on whether there's habitable planets out there, or how many, I guess,
*  habitable planets are. So the funny thing is, was one time I met Frank Drake and I asked if he minded
*  if I took his equation and kind of revamped it for this new field of exoplanet astronomy.
*  He was totally cool with it. He's got total approval. Well, maybe. Okay, so sorry. I'm not
*  sure if you'd actually read the stuff about my equation, but he was cool with it. He was cool.
*  Okay, so I just said like 15 different things, but maybe can you tell from your perspective what
*  is the Drake Equation and what is, sorry, the Seager Equation? Sure. Well, the Drake Equation,
*  as you said, it's a framework. It's a description of the number of civilizations out there,
*  of intelligent beings that are able to communicate with us by radio waves. So if you think of the
*  movie Contact, you've seen Contact, right? We're listening in, actually. It's an active field of
*  research, listening to other stars at radio wavelengths, hoping that some intelligent
*  civilizations are sending us a message. And the Drake Equation came at the start of that whole
*  field to put the factors down on paper to sort of illustrate what is involved to kind of estimating.
*  And there's no real estimate or prediction of how many civilizations are out there,
*  but it's a way to frame the question and show you each term that's involved.
*  So I took the Drake Equation and I called it a revised Drake Equation and I recast it for
*  the search for planets by more traditional astronomy means. We're looking at stars,
*  looking for planets, looking for rocky planets, looking for planets that are the right temperature
*  for life, looking for planets that might have life that outputs gases that we might detect in
*  the future. It's the same spirit of the Drake Equation. It's not going to give us any magic
*  numbers. So I'm going to say, hey, here's exactly what's out there. It's meant to kind of guide,
*  guide of where we're going. Although the Drake Equation did, I mean, the initial equation proposed
*  actual numbers for those variables, right? Oh, yes. The equation proposed numbers and you can still
*  plug your own numbers in. And there's this really cute website that lets you, for both the Drake and
*  my revised equation, plug in some numbers and see what you get. So yeah. So, okay. So what are,
*  I mean, what are the variables, but maybe also what are the critical variables?
*  So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show signs
*  of life by way of gases in the atmosphere that can be attributed to life. If I could just walk
*  through the terms, that's simpler. So the first thing I say is what are the number of stars
*  available? And it's not that those trillions and trillions of stars everywhere. It's what are
*  available to like a specific search. And so for example, the MIT led NASA mission TESS is surveying
*  the sky looking for all kinds of planets, but it can also, it also has stars. It has about 30,000
*  red dwarf stars. So we just take a number of stars that a given survey can access. So that's
*  what the number of stars is. Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are quiet. I called it
*  fraction of those stars that is quiet in the case of TESS, the way it's looking for planets
*  is planets that transit the star. They go in front of the stars seen from the telescope,
*  but it turns out that some stars are very active. They're variable and they brighten and dim with
*  time and that interferes with our observation. I apologize to interrupt. So the transiting planet.
*  So you're really looking for a black blob essentially that blocks the light. We're looking
*  for a black blob that blocks the light. And then trying to say something about the size of the
*  planet from the frequency of that black blobs appearance and the size of that black blob,
*  that kind of thing. Yeah. But let's just say that out of all the stars there are accessible to
*  whatever telescope, some of them are just bad for whatever reason you're not going to be able to
*  find planets around them. So I need to know the fraction of those that are, that are good. So
*  again, we have the number of stars, the fraction of them that we can actually find planets around.
*  And by the way, is our sun one such, is our sun quiet?
*  Our sun is quiet. Okay.
*  So I have actually two terms. One describes how quiet they are and one is if we can find a planet
*  around that star, these transiting planets, for example, not all planets transit because the
*  planet would have to be orbiting that star in this kind of plane as viewed from you. But if a star
*  is, for example, orbiting in the plane of the sky, it will never transit. It will never go in
*  front of the star. So in that case, we have to have a fraction that takes into account
*  of that kind of geometric factor. And hopefully it's right. I mean,
*  you can assume that it's uniformly distributed. Yes, we can assume and there's evidence that it's
*  uniformly distributed. Yes. So then the next, so all of these factors so far, number of stars
*  accessible to whatever telescope you're thinking about, how many stars are quiet, fraction of stars
*  that are quiet, fraction that are observable in this case for the geometric factor. Those are all
*  things we can measure. And there's one more term in the secret equation we can measure.
*  I call it fraction of planets in the habitable zone because believe it or not, we have a handle
*  on that for a certain set of stars. We know from our, the Kepler space telescope that operated for
*  a number of years, we have estimates for how many planets are in the so-called habitable zone of the
*  host star for a certain type of star. So all those we have measurable. And then like the
*  Drake equation itself, there are some terms we can not measure. And those ones, I call them FL,
*  fraction of all those planets that have life on them because we don't know what that is. And FS,
*  I called for spectroscopy, the fraction that have, we can use our telescope and instrument tools
*  to look for light. Actually, FS was the ones that the planets that have life that actually
*  gives off a gas, useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere. So we could eventually observe
*  it. How do the FL and FS interplay? So these are separate terms?
*  Separate terms. And so- So for example, you could imagine, so for example, you could imagine life
*  like us humans, we breathe out carbon dioxide, but our planet earth, we already have a lot of
*  carbon dioxide on it. Well, we have hundreds of parts per million, but it has a really strong
*  signal. So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide, it's not helpful for any intelligent beings that
*  are looking back at earth because there's already a lot of carbon, there's already enough carbon
*  dioxide. We're not adding to it. So if there is life on a planet and it's outputting a boring gas,
*  that's not helpful for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versus just being there anyway,
*  then it's not helpful. So I separated those two terms out. Soon, I think we'll have evidence that
*  planets that can support life at least are common.
*  So, okay, this is such an awesome topic. I have a million questions. What, okay, I know there's a
*  little bit of speculation, but what's your sense about that? I think FS, which is like that life
*  would produce interesting gases that would be able to detect. Like is there, one, is there scientific
*  evidence? And second, is there some intuition around life producing gases with detectable hints
*  in terms of chemistry? So interestingly, and I have that entire question
*  relates to, I'm going to say almost my life's work, the work I'm doing now and the work I'm
*  doing for the next 20 years. And I wish I could give you a concrete number, like 1%.
*  Like on the worst days, it's 1%, let's say in my mind. On the best days, it's like 80%. And I could
*  actually go into a lot of detail here, but I'll just give you the simplest things. So first of all,
*  we make an assumption that like us and our life here on earth, life uses chemistry. So we use
*  chemistry because we eat food, we breathe air, and we have metabolism that to break down food,
*  to get energy, to store energy, and then ultimately to use it. And all life here has some kind of
*  byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product that goes into the atmosphere.
*  So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry. Some people have imagined,
*  let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just getting energy and using it without
*  storing it. And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas.
*  So we make this basic assumption of chemistry. That's the first thing.
*  The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on is what happens to the gas once it
*  is produced by life? It goes into the atmosphere and a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately,
*  actually, by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen. Oxygen is incredibly destructive to a lot of
*  gases. So the gas can be produced by life, but it could be just completely destroyed by its environment.
*  I guess we should pause on that, that you mentioned your life's work. This is just a beautiful idea
*  that it's kind of paralyzing when you look out there and you wonder, is there a life out there?
*  It's the first paralyzing. Actually, before I encountered your work, I feel like an idiot,
*  but it feels like there's no tool to answer that question. And then what you kind of provided
*  is this cool idea that it might be possible to answer that by looking at the gases. I mean,
*  that's a really interesting, that's a beautiful idea. So we could just pause on that as a powerful
*  tool, I think, to build the intuition around it, because that was totally clueless about it.
*  And that was kind of exciting. I mean, I'm sure there's folks probably early on in your life
*  who were very skeptical about this notion. Maybe I'm not sure, but generally you would
*  want to be skeptical. It's like, well, all these kinds of other things could generate gases,
*  all those kinds of things. Oh, that's so true. And a big part of this growing field is how to
*  make sure that this gas isn't produced by another effect. But do you want to, again, pausing on that
*  and going back a bit, it's incredible to think, but at least almost a hundred years ago, there's
*  a record of someone talking about the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.
*  That idea was floating about somewhere. Yes, it was totally floating about.
*  It comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume. And we rely on
*  oxygen to breathe. When you hear about the people in Mount Everest running out of air,
*  well, they're running out of oxygen because the air is getting thinner as they climb up the mountain.
*  But without plants and bacteria, there's bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as
*  a waste product. Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen. Our atmosphere would be
*  devoid of oxygen. So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?
*  Oxygen's a huge indicator. And that's what we're hoping, that there is an intelligent civilization
*  not too far from here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind of telescopes we're
*  trying to build. And they're looking back at our sun and they've seen our Earth and they see oxygen.
*  And they probably won't be like 100.0% sure that there's life making it. But if they go through all
*  the possible scenarios, they'll be left with a pretty strong hint that there's life here.
*  Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases that are on the planet from a distance?
*  And that's going back to that, that's what people were skeptical about.
*  When I first started working on exoplanets, a long time ago,
*  people didn't believe we would ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind.
*  And now dozens of them are studied. There's a whole field of people,
*  hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres actually.
*  Wow. But first there was a point where people didn't even know there was exoplanets, right?
*  When was the first exoplanet detected?
*  The first exoplanet around a sun-like star anyway was detected in the mid 1990s.
*  That was a big deal. I kind of vaguely remember that.
*  Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial.
*  Because in exoplanets, we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system.
*  And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big massive planet, is really far from our star.
*  And this first exoplanet around a sun-like star was incredibly close to its star,
*  its star. So close that people just couldn't believe it was a planet actually.
*  So maybe zoom out. What the heck is an exoplanet?
*  An exoplanet is our name, is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other than our sun.
*  Right. Extrasolar, I guess is another-
*  You can call it extrasolar. Exoplanet is simpler. But I think it's worth pausing to remember that
*  each one of those stars out there in our night sky is a sun. And our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus,
*  Earth, Mars, et cetera. And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or
*  other suns have planets? And they do. And it appears that nearly every star has a planet,
*  has a planet we call exoplanet. And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.
*  So there's already, yeah, like there's so many things about space that it's hard to put into
*  one's brain because it starts filling it with awe. So yeah, if you visualize the fact that
*  the stars that we see in the sky aren't just stars, they're like, they're suns.
*  And they very likely, as you're saying, will have planets around them.
*  There's all these planets roaming about in this dimly lit darkness with potentially life. I mean,
*  it's just mind blowing. But maybe can you give a brief history of discovering all the exoplanets?
*  So there's no exoplanets in the 90s. And then there's a lot of exoplanets now.
*  So how did that come about? So many planets. How did it come about? Well,
*  maybe another way to ask is what is the methodology that was used to discover them?
*  I can say that. But I'd like to just say something else first where, so exoplanets,
*  the line between what is considered completely crazy and what is considered mainstream research,
*  legit, is constantly shifting. This is awesome. Yeah. So before, when I started on exoplanets,
*  it was still sketchy. It wasn't considered a career or a thing, a place where you should
*  be investing. And right now, now today, so many people are working in this field, a good,
*  I don't know, at least a thousand, probably more. I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you,
*  but it's a lot. No, it's a legitimate field of inquiry. Yeah, legitimate field of inquiry.
*  And what's helped us is everything that's helped everyone else. It's software, it's computers,
*  it's hardware. It's like our phones. You have a fantastic detector in there. They didn't always
*  have that. I don't know if you remember the so-called olden days. We didn't have digital
*  cameras. We had film. You take a film camera, you send the film away, and eventually it comes back,
*  and then you see your pictures. And they could all be horrible. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, digital,
*  it just changed everything. Data changed everything. Yeah. And so one thing that really
*  helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive because when we're looking for
*  the transiting planets, what we're doing is we're monitoring a star's brightness as a function of
*  time. It's like click, taking a picture of the stars every few seconds or minutes. And we're
*  measuring the brightness of a star like every frame. And we're looking for a drop in brightness
*  that's characteristic of a planet going in front of the star and then finishing its so-called transit.
*  To make that measurement, we have to have precise detectors.
*  And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from Earth?
*  Are they floating about in space? What kind of telescope?
*  Both. So on the ground, people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost
*  just like a glorified telephoto lens. And they're looking at big swaths of the sky.
*  And from the ground, people can find giant planets like the size of Jupiter. So it's about 10 to 12
*  times the size of Earth. We can find big planets because we can reach about 1% precision. So I'm
*  not sure how technical you want to get. Well, yeah. How many pixels are we talking about?
*  You mentioned phones. There's a bunch of megapixels, I think.
*  So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel. We're not
*  getting any information. But to be more technical, our telescope spreads the light out over many
*  pixels. But we're not getting information. We're not tiling the planet with pixels.
*  It's just like a point of light or in most cases, we don't even see the planet itself,
*  just the planet's effect on the star. But another thing that really helped was computers because
*  transiting planets are actually quite rare. I mean, they don't all go in front of their star.
*  And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once, or we look at
*  tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of stars at one time.
*  And so you're not going to do this by hand, going through a million stars, counting up the
*  brightness. So we have computer software and computer code that does the job for us and
*  counts the brightness and looks for a signal that could be due to a transiting planet.
*  And I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for the MIT-led NASA mission test.
*  And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates, the transiting light curves,
*  out to the community so people could follow them up and figure out if they're actual planets or
*  false positives. So publish the data so that people could just publish the data. All the data
*  scientists out there could crunch and see if they can discover something. They can discover
*  something. And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public as
*  soon as possible. So anyone could act. It's not as easy as it sounds, though, to download the data
*  and look for planets. But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org, and they take the data and they
*  actually crowdsource it out to people to look for planets. Yeah. And they often find signals that
*  our computers and our team missed. So we mentioned exoplanets. What about Earth-like? I don't know
*  what the right distinction is. Is it habitable or is it Earth-like planets? But what are those
*  different categories and how can we tell the difference and detect each? Right, right. So
*  we're not at Earth-like planets yet. All the planets we're finding are so different from
*  what we have in our solar system. They're just easier planets to find. But like-
*  In which way?
*  For example, there could be a Jupiter-sized planet where an Earth should be.
*  We find planets that are the same size as Earth, but are orbiting way closer to their star than
*  Mercury is to our Sun. And they're so close that, because close to a star means they also orbit
*  faster. And some of these hot super-Earths, we call them, their year, their time to go around their
*  star is less than a day. And they're heated so much by their star. They're heated so much by the star.
*  We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock. So instead of running out by the bay
*  or the river, you'll have like liquid lava. There'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets,
*  we think. And life can't survive-
*  Way too hot. The molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able to survive those temperatures.
*  We have some other planets. One of the most mysterious things out there,
*  factoid, if you will, is that the most common type of planet we know about so far
*  is a planet that's in between Earth and Neptune size. It's two to three times the size of Earth.
*  And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet.
*  That is like going outside to the forest and finding some kind of creature or animal that just
*  no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the most common thing out there.
*  And so we're not even sure what they are. We have a lot of thoughts as to the different types of
*  planet it could be, but people don't really know.
*  I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?
*  Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than might be,
*  is that these so-called mini-Neptunes, we call them, that they are water worlds.
*  That they could be scaled up versions of Jupiter's icy moons, such that they are planets that are made
*  of more than half of water by mass.
*  And what's the connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that from a gas
*  perspective? Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water. And so there's been this idea in
*  astronomy or astrobiology for a long time called follow the water. Find water. That will give you
*  a chance of finding life. But we could still zoom out and the community consensus is that we need
*  some kind of liquid for life to originate and to survive because molecules have to react.
*  You don't have a way that molecules can interact with each other. You can't really make anything.
*  And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in
*  terms of planetary materials. There really aren't that many liquids. Like I mentioned,
*  liquid rock, way too hot for life. We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline,
*  like ethane and methane lakes that have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan.
*  That's so cold though. And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets because
*  they're just simply too dark and too cold. So we usually are just left with looking for planets
*  with liquid water. And to your point, remember, as we talked about how planets are less than
*  a pixel in that way to say. So we can't see oceans on a planet. We're not going to see
*  continents and oceans, not yet anyway. But we can see gases in the atmosphere. And if it's a small
*  rocky planet, and this is going into some more detail, if we see a small rocky planet with water
*  vapor in the atmosphere, we're pretty sure that means there has to be a liquid water reservoir
*  because it's not intuitive in any way, but water is broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star
*  or from the sun. And on most planets, when water is broken up into H and O, the H, the hydrogen,
*  will escape to space. Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled
*  balloon, it floats upwards. And hydrogen is a light gas and will leave from the planet.
*  So ultimately, if you have water, unless there's an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing water
*  vapor in the atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.
*  Got it. So there's a need for a liquid. I mean, I guess it was water. Is water essential or are
*  there liquids? I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.
*  Well, it does, but there's not an infinite number of liquids. There's maybe like five
*  liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet. And water is the one that exists
*  for the largest range of temperatures and pressures. And it's also the easiest type of
*  planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor rather than a cold planet that has
*  ethane and methane lakes. What's your personal, in terms of solar systems and planets that you're
*  most hopeful about in terms of our closest neighbors, that you kind of have a sense that
*  there might be somebody living over there, whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us.
*  I'm hopeful that every star nearby has a planet. Because it almost has to for us to make progress.
*  We have to have that dream condition. So the dream condition is like,
*  life is just super abundant out there. Yeah, the dream. Yes. The dream condition
*  is that life is super abundant. And it's based on the thought that if there is a planet with water
*  and continents, that it also has the ingredients for life. And that the kind of base does the base
*  the base kernel thought is that if the ingredients for life is there, life will form.
*  Life will form. That's what we're holding on to.
*  With a relatively high probability. Yes, that's it.
*  Okay, let's go into land of speculation. What about intelligent life? Us humans consider
*  ourselves intelligent, surprisingly, or unsurprisingly. Do you think about,
*  from your perspective of looking at planets from a gas composition perspective, and in general,
*  of how we might see intelligent life and your intuition about whether that life is even out
*  there? I think the life is out there somewhere. The huge numbers of stars and planets. I like to
*  think that life had a chance to evolve to be intelligent. I'm not convinced that life is
*  anywhere near here, only because if it's hard for intelligent life to evolve,
*  then it will be far away by definition. Well, the sad thing is, maybe from the
*  artificial intelligence perspective, is it makes me sad there might be intelligent life out there.
*  The pathways of evolution can go in all these different directions where we might not be able
*  to communicate with it, or even know that it, or even detect its intelligence, or even comprehend
*  its intelligence. I'm convinced cats are more intelligent than humans, that we're just not able
*  to comprehend the measures, the proper measures of their intelligence. My dog is so funny. He's a
*  golden doodle. His name's Leo. We joke that he's either a really dumb dog, and sorry, he's not here
*  to defend himself, but he's either really dumb, or he's a super genius just pretending to be dumb.
*  And it's possible he's a multidimensional projection of alien life here monitoring
*  one of the top scientists in the world trying to find aliens, just to make sure that humans
*  don't get out of hand. That's funny. Oh, I'm definitely going to go in and ask him about that.
*  She's on to something. What might we look for in terms of signs of intelligent life?
*  From your toolkit, do you think there are things that we might be able to use, or maybe in the next
*  couple of decades discover that would be different than life that's like bacteria, that's primitive
*  life? I still love SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. I like to hope that if there is a
*  civilization out there, they're trying to send us a message. I think about it, I don't know,
*  what are your thoughts? If you think about our earth, there's no structure we've built that
*  intelligent civilizations could see from far away. There's literally nothing, not even the Great
*  Wall of China. And so to think, why would this other civilization build a giant structure that
*  we could see? Yeah, so with SETI, the idea is that we're both trying to hear signals and send
*  signals, right? We haven't sent one. They call that METI, messaging, and there's a big fear
*  over METI because do you want to tell them you're here? It's kind of this like, let's wait till they
*  call us. Yeah. It's like the dating game, you have to like, how many days do I wait before I call?
*  Kind of thing. Yes, it is. And so, but the funny thing is if no one's sending us a message, if
*  everybody's only listening, how do you make progress? That's right. And I mean, but there's
*  also, there's the Voyager spacecraft, we have these little pixels of robots flying out.
*  All over the place. Some of them, like the Voyager, reach out really far and they have some stuff on
*  them. Okay, I just- We do. We have the Voyager, but they're not really going anywhere in particular
*  and they're moving very, very slowly on a cosmic scale. Yeah. And me saying they're far is kind of
*  silly because- Yeah, it's all relative in astronomy. It's all relative. Yeah. Yeah. I just, so from a,
*  if you look at Earth from an alien perspective, from visually and from gas composition,
*  I wonder if it's possible to determine the degree of maybe productive energy use. I wonder if it's
*  possible to tell like how busy these Earthlings are. Well, let's zoom out again and think about
*  oxygen. So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago and figured out how to harness the
*  energy of the sun for photosynthesis, they re-engineered the entire atmosphere. 20%
*  of the atmosphere has oxygen now. Like that is a huge scale. You know, they almost poisoned
*  everything else by making this what was apparently very poisonous to everything that was alive.
*  But imagine, so are we doing anything at that scale? Like are we changing anything at like
*  20% of the Earth with a giant structure or 20% of this or 20% of that? Like we aren't actually.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's humbling to think that we're not actually having that much of an impact.
*  But we are because in a way we're destroying our entire planet, but it's humbling to think that
*  from far away, people probably can't even tell. But from the perspective of the planet,
*  when we say we're destroying global warming, all that kind of stuff,
*  what we really mean is we're destroying it for a bunch of different species, including humans.
*  But like, I think the Earth will be okay. Oh, the Earth will be, the Earth will remain.
*  Whatever, whatever happens to us, the Earth will still be here.
*  And it'll still be difficult to detect any difference. Like it's sad to think that
*  if humans destroy ourselves, except potentially with nuclear war,
*  it'd be hard to tell that anything even happened.
*  Yeah. It will be hard to tell from far away that anything happened.
*  What about, what are your thoughts? Now this is really getting into speculation land.
*  You've, you've mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of, you know, this is beautiful edge
*  between science and science fiction that some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk.
*  I think in academia, you were brave enough to do that. I think in some sense,
*  artificial intelligence sometimes walks that line a little bit.
*  I think that there is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life and aliens in this world.
*  I mean, I don't know what, how to comprehend that excitement, but to me, it's great to see people
*  curious because to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens is at the core, a scientific question.
*  And it's almost looks like people are excited about science. They're excited by discovery.
*  Discovery, right?
*  And then the possibility that there's alien life that visited earth or is here on earth now
*  is, is a excitement about discovery in your lifetime, essentially.
*  I mean, what do you make, what do you make of that? There's recent events where DARPA
*  or DOD released footage of these unmanned aerial phenomena they're calling them now, UAP.
*  They got everybody like super excited. Like maybe there is like what, what's, what's here on earth.
*  Do you follow the, this world of people who are thinking about aliens that are already here or
*  have visited?
*  I don't really follow it. They follow me. I'd say because in this field, it's, it's a,
*  if you're a scientist of any kind, you get the people contact us, me. There's a lot of them about,
*  Hey, I have stuff you should see. Hey, the aliens are already here. I need to tell you about it.
*  And I know there are people out there who really believe.
*  There's a psychology to it.
*  There's a psychology to it.
*  And it's fascinating. But okay. So the similar to artificial intelligence.
*  But I still, but like you, I'm still enamored with the point that it is out there and that
*  people believe so strongly and that so many people out there believe.
*  Believe. And, uh, I don't know. I, um, I'm not as allergic to it as some scientists are because
*  ultimately if aliens showed up or do show up or have showed up, uh, you know, these are going to
*  be very difficult to study scientific phenomena. Like in fact, like going back to cats and dogs,
*  I just, I think we should be more open-minded about, uh, developing new tools and looking for
*  intelligent life on earth that we haven't yet found or even understanding the nature of our own
*  intelligence. Cause it's kind of as an alien life form, the thing that's living, you know,
*  in our skull. It's so true. And we don't understand consciousness. Yeah, it's true.
*  We don't understand how biology is hard, you know, unpacking it and working it all out. It's,
*  it's a stretch. And they say too, that our thinking mind is like the tip of a pyramid
*  that everything else is happening under the hood. And, but what is happening?
*  But the thing with, so the typical scientist response to, you know, are there aliens here
*  is that we need to see major evidence, not like a sketchy picture of something.
*  We need some cold heart evidence and we just don't have that.
*  That's exactly right. But from my perspective, I admire people that dream. I think that's
*  beautiful. The thing I don't like, there's two sides of the, uh, of the folks, uh, that probably
*  listened to this, this podcast is, oh, those that dream, I think is beautiful or that, uh,
*  that wander what's out there, what's here on earth. And then the other ones who are very
*  conspiratorial and thinking that stuff is being hidden. Right. It becomes about institutions.
*  Okay. I got, I have a funny thing to talk about that. So one of my colleagues had a really good
*  answer to that. And it's not me saying this, so I can say this, but he said, look, he works with
*  NASA, not at NASA. He works with government, not in the government. It's kind of mean, but he'd say,
*  trust me, they couldn't hide it if they tried. Do you know what I'm saying? Like we're not smart
*  enough or good enough. Not we are not me or not you, but whoever to cover it up. It just,
*  it's sort of a myth. Yeah. It makes it sad because, um, the people at NASA, the people at MIT,
*  the people in academia, the people in these institutions, and yes, even in government are
*  often trying, they're like just curious descendants of apes. They're just, they, they want to do good.
*  They want to discover stuff. They're not trying to hide stuff. In fact, most of them would, in
*  terms of leaks, would love to discover this and release this kind of stuff. And there's a,
*  did you ever watch this show called the X-Files? Yeah. Scully and Mulder. Yeah. And what I love
*  actually, I used to put it up during my talks, my public talks, there's a picture of a UFO or what
*  looks like UFO and it says, I want to believe. So that's, that's where I think a lot of us are
*  coming from. I want to believe. And it's so great. And one time I put that up and this very, very
*  nice couple approached me really nervous afterwards and I said, Hey, can we take you out for lunch
*  sometime? And I said, sure. And they were like the nicest people and just one of many who has an alien,
*  alien abduction story. And the woman, um, could never have kids. They were older, but they didn't
*  have kids, which for them was a real source of regret, but it was because the aliens who had
*  abducted her had made it so that she couldn't have kids. And she had apparently something
*  implanted behind her ear, which was somehow unimplanted later. And they were just so sincere
*  and they're such a lovely couple. And they just wanted to share their story. That's, that's a real,
*  whatever that is, that's the real thing. The mystery of the human mind is more powerful than
*  any alien or, I mean, it's a, as interesting, I think as the universe. And I think they're somehow
*  intricately linked, maybe getting a sense of numbers. How many stars are there in, um,
*  maybe, I don't know what the radius that's reasonable to think about. I don't know if the
*  observable universe is like way too big to think about, but in terms of when we think about how
*  many habitable planets that are, what are the numbers we're working with in your sense? What
*  are the scale? Honestly, the numbers are probably like billions of trillions.
*  Of stars. Yeah. You know, in the UK, I think, I don't know if we do that here, but they will call
*  a billion trillion. We put like 1 billion followed by a trillion. Yeah. It's kind of weird, but here,
*  I don't even know how to say the number 10 to the 20. Like if you know what that is, that's one
*  followed by 20 zeros. That's a big number. And we don't have a name for that number. There's so many
*  per star. I think we kind of mentioned this. Is there a good sense? There's probably argument
*  about this, but per star, how many planets are there? Is there,
*  we don't have that number yet per se. You know, we're not really there, but some people think
*  that there's many planets per star. There's this analogy of filling the coffee cup. Like,
*  you know, you don't usually just pour one drop, you fill it. And that planetary systems,
*  we see stars being born that have a disk of gas and dust, and that ultimately forms planets.
*  So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets, so many planets form too many. And eventually,
*  some get kicked out and you're left with like a full planetary system, a dynamically full system.
*  And so there have to be a lot because so many form and a bunch survive.
*  I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right? Like why wouldn't that happen?
*  Right. Well, there's other thoughts too, though. These big planets that are really close to the
*  star, we think they formed far away from the star where there's enough material to form,
*  and they migrated inwards. And some of these planets migrating inwards due to interaction
*  with other planets or with the disk itself, they may have cleared it out,
*  like kicked other planets out of the system. So there's a lot of ideas floating around.
*  We're not entirely sure. And what about Earth-like planets? Is that another level of uncertainty?
*  It's a level of uncertainty. If we think of an Earth-like planet being an Earth around a sun
*  in the same orbit, an Earth-like planet being an Earth-sized planet in an Earth-like orbit about a
*  sun-like star, we're not there yet. We're not able to detect enough of those to give you a hard
*  number. Some people have extrapolated and they will say as many as one in five stars like our sun
*  could be hosting a true Earth-like planet. Wow. On the topic of space exploration,
*  there's been a lot of exciting developments with NASA, with SpaceX, with other companies,
*  and successfully getting rockets into space with humans and getting them to land back,
*  especially with SpaceX. What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX, Crew Dragon,
*  while working with NASA to launch astronauts? What's your sense about these exciting new
*  developments? Well, SpaceX and other so-called commercial companies are only good news for
*  my field because they're lowering the cost of getting to space. By having reusable rockets,
*  it's incredible and we need cheaper access to space. From a very practical viewpoint,
*  it's all good. About getting people, there's this dream that we have to go to Mars,
*  boots on Mars. Boots on Mars. What do you think about that? You mentioned probes. What's the value
*  of humans? Is that interesting to you from both a scientific and a human perspective?
*  Human mostly. I think it's such in our desire to explore because part of what it means to be human.
*  Wanting to go to another planet and be able to live there for some time, it's just
*  what it means to be human. Oftentimes in science and engineering, big, huge discoveries are made
*  when we didn't intend to. Often this kind of pure exploratory type of research or this pure
*  exploration research, it can lead to something really important like the laser. We couldn't
*  really live without that now. At the grocery, you scan your foods. There's surgery that involves
*  lasers. GPS. We all use our GPS. We don't have GPS because someone thought, hey,
*  it would be great to have a navigation system. I do support, I do, but I really think it comes
*  primarily just from the desire to explore. Do you think something, there's a lot of criticism
*  and a lot of excitement about Mars. Do you think there's value in trying to
*  go to put humans on Mars, first of all, and second of all, colonize Mars?
*  Do you think there's something interesting that might come from there?
*  I'm convinced there will be something interesting. I just don't know what it is yet,
*  but I don't think having some commercial value or value in the metric of something useful is
*  really what's motivating us. So really, you see exploration as a long-term investment into
*  something awesome that eventually will be commercial value. I do actually. Yeah. So what about
*  visiting? Okay, I apologize, but I mean, there's an exciting longing to visit
*  Earth-like planets elsewhere. So what's the closest Earth-like planet you think is worth visiting?
*  How hard is it? Wow, it is very hard. I mean, our nearest, call it Earth-mass planet, it's orbiting
*  a star very different from our own sun, an M-dwarf star, a small red star, Proxima Centauri. It's
*  over four light-years away, and we can't travel at the speed of light. I mean, it would take
*  tens of thousands of years to get there with conventional methods. So you know the movies,
*  like multigenerational. Yeah, this movie, Passenger, have you seen that movie? Passenger.
*  It's about a big spaceship that is traveling to another planet and everyone's hibernating.
*  I won't give you the spoiler alert because one person wakes up and then it's kind of a problem.
*  Okay, got it. But yeah, the multigenerational ships. I mean, when you think about where we're
*  headed as a species, maybe we don't send people. Maybe we end up sending raw biological materials
*  and instructions to print out humans. It sounds kind of far-fetched, but already we're printing
*  liver cells in the lab and beating heart cells. We're starting to reconstruct body parts. I mean,
*  the thing is, it is so hard to get to another planet that this thought of printing humans or
*  printing life forms actually could be easier. Yeah, that's somehow so sad to think of the idea
*  that we would launch a successful spaceship that has multigenerational, like non-human life,
*  and it's going to reach other intelligent life. And by the time they figure out where it came from,
*  the human civilization will be extinct. Wow. Yeah, that is really sad.
*  I mean, that's so that's one. There's a tempting thing to think about. What are the possible
*  trajectories? So, you know, Elon keeps talking about multi-planetary, us becoming multi-planetary
*  species. I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that, but like the dream is to really expand outside
*  the solar system. And it's not clear, just like, as you said, like what the actual scientific
*  engineering steps that are required to take. It seems like so daunting, so daunting. So like,
*  the smart thing seems to be to do the most achievable near daunting task, even if there
*  doesn't seem to be a commercial application, which I think is colonizing Mars. But like,
*  from your perspective, is there some Manhattan project style, huge project in space that we might
*  want to take on? And you've had roles, you had scientist hat roles, and then you also had roles
*  in terms of being on like committees and stuff, determining where funding goes and so on. So like,
*  is there a huge like multi-trillion, we've been throwing the T word around recently a lot,
*  but these huge projects that we might want to take on? Well, first of all, we want to find the
*  planets like Earth first. Like just even finding those Earth-like planets is a billion dollar
*  endeavor, billions of dollars endeavor. And that's so hard because an Earth is so small,
*  so less massive, and so faint compared to our sun. It's the proverbial needle in a haystack,
*  but worse. And we need very sophisticated space-based telescopes to be able to find
*  these planets and to look at them and see which ones have water and which ones have signs of life
*  on them. Yeah, the the Starshade project that your partner- Starshade. Starshade, yeah,
*  it's probably the most badass thing I've ever seen. Right. You know what's interesting?
*  Can you describe what it is first of all? So what's amazing about Starshade is it was first
*  conceived of in the 1960s. Imagine that and revisited every decade until now when we think
*  we can actually build it. And Starshade is a giant specially shaped screen. It is about,
*  there's different versions of it, but think about 30 meters in diameter.
*  So you're blocking out the sun. You're effectively blocking out the star.
*  Yeah. So that you can see the planet directly. And Starshade would have a spacecraft attached
*  to it and it would fly in space far away from Earth's gravity. And it would have to formation
*  fly with a space telescope. So the idea is that Starshade blocks out the star light in a very
*  careful way and it has to block that star light out so that the planet that is 10 billion times
*  fainter than the star, that only the planet light goes to the telescope. Yeah. So in formation,
*  meaning the telescope flies in, you're getting presentation on this, but like it would fly
*  like in, this is extremely high precision endeavor. Yeah. We had this analogy, like asking
*  a friend to hold up a dime five miles away. Yeah. Perfectly. Like at the perfect line of sight with
*  you. Yeah. And the shape of it is pretty cool. I mean, I don't know exactly what the physics of
*  that, like what the optics are that require that shape. I can tell you. It turns out that if you
*  block out a star, imagine blocking out a star with a circularly or a square shape screen.
*  You wouldn't actually be blocking it because the star acts like a wave. The star light can act
*  like a wave and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen. And so instead of blocking
*  out the light, you're expecting to see nothing. You would see ripples. And the analogy that I love
*  to give, it's like throwing a pebble in a pond. You know, you get those ripples, you get these
*  concentric ripples and they go out and light would do something quite similar. You'd actually see
*  ripples of light. And those ripples of light, they're actually way brighter than the planet
*  we'd be looking for. So we can't put a circle. So they would introduce this noise that's-
*  Yeah, noise. And so this star shade, it's like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction,
*  it's called. And this is what the first person who thought about star shape in the 1960s worked out,
*  the mathematical shape or one family of solutions. And the idea is that when the star shade,
*  this very special shape, like a giant flower with petals, when it blocks out the light,
*  the light bends around the edges but interacts with itself in a way to give you a very, very
*  dark image. It would be like throwing a pebble in a pond. And instead of getting ripples,
*  the pond would be perfectly smooth, like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion.
*  And all the waves would be on the outer edges, far away from where you drop that pebble.
*  And so this camera would be able to get some signal from the planet then?
*  Yes. And it would be hard because the planet is so faint. But with the star out of the way,
*  the glare of that bright, bright, bright star, with that out of the way, then it becomes a much more
*  manageable task. So how do we get that thing out there? We're still working with unlimited money.
*  Okay. Working with unlimited money. We have some more engineering problems to solve,
*  but not too many more. We've been burning down our so-called tall pole list.
*  What kind of list?
*  We call it technology tall pole. It's the phrase where you have to figure out what are your hardest
*  problems and then break those down to solve. So the star shade, one of the really hard problems
*  was how to formation fly at tens of thousands of kilometers. It's like, wow, that is insane.
*  And the team broke that down actually into a sensing problem. Because of the star shade,
*  how do you see the star shade precisely enough to control it? Because if you're shining a flashlight,
*  the beam spreads out. So the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser. It's going to spread
*  out so much by the time it gets to the telescope. The problem wasn't how do you tell the star
*  shade how to move around fast enough to stay in a straight line. The problem was how are you able
*  to sense it well enough? So problems like that were broken down and money that came from NASA
*  solve problems is put towards solving it. So we've got through most of the hard problems right now.
*  Another one was that star shade, even though it's looking at a star, light from our own sun
*  could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope, believe it or not.
*  And that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny, tiny signal. So then
*  the question is how do you make a razor thin edge? Those petal edges would have to be like a razor.
*  What materials can you use? So there's a series of problems like that.
*  Wow. So there's a materials problem in there?
*  Some of them. And there's one. So we almost finished solving all those problems. And then
*  it's just a matter of building one and testing it in a full scale size facility. And then building
*  the telescope, it's just a matter of time to build everything and get it up for launch.
*  So this is an engineering project.
*  It's a real engineering project. I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not
*  mine. I like to call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream
*  where that line is constantly shifting. When I started, when I got this leadership role on
*  star shade, I remember telling people about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line.
*  It was on the giggle factor side of the line. And people would just laugh like that's dead.
*  You can never formation fly or they'd say, why are you working on that? That's just so not,
*  it's not. This is so awesome. There's a few things you've done in your life. And that's when I first
*  saw star share. I was like, what, really? And then like it sinks in. I mean, it's the same thing I
*  felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff. And then they actually make it work.
*  If you get star shade information flying together, I mean, how awesome is that if you actually make
*  that happen? Even like from a robot, I'm sorry, from the robotics perspective, even if it doesn't
*  give us good data, that's just like a cool thing to get out there. I mean, it's really exciting.
*  Really cool. So there's two other topics that aren't mine, but I still love them. One of them,
*  let's just talk about it briefly because it's not a probe, but it's the idea to send a telescope
*  very far away to 500 times the Earth-Sun distance. And this is way farther than the
*  Voyager spacecrafts are right now. And to use our sun as a gravitational lens,
*  to use our sun to magnify something that's behind it. It's got to sink in for a minute.
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun.
*  In astronomy, Einstein thought about this initially. We can use massive objects,
*  bend space. And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the
*  warped space. And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification.
*  You have a way to use that for magnification. That's right. There are galaxies that are lens,
*  so-called gravitational lens by intervening galaxy clusters, actually. And there are
*  microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens star passes in between
*  us and that very distant star. It's actually a real tool in astronomy. Yeah, using gravitational
*  lensing to magnify because it bends more raised towards you than normally would you normally see.
*  And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled
*  down to light. It boils down to light. And then you can maybe get more information about
*  well, in this case, you would ask me, let's say if this thing could get built, it would take
*  something like they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years, and then it could
*  send some information back to us. And then you'd say, so Sarah, how many pixels? And I wouldn't
*  say one or less than one. I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, could be 100 pixels,
*  which would be awesome. I mean, it's still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that.
*  Crazy, right. And it's crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the
*  sun and your target. You'd only have one telescope per target because every star is behind the sun
*  in a different way. So it's a lot of complicated things. But what about the second one? It's called
*  star shot. You know, star shot means like big dreams. And it's an initiative by the Breakthrough
*  Foundation. And star shot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft, which they
*  now call star chip. So instead of star ship, it's star chip. And there's a little chip.
*  And the star chip, so like sending like thousands of little turtles being born,
*  they're not all going to make it. Because they just send lots of them. And each of these star
*  chips, once they're launched into, I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail.
*  That's a few meters in diameter. And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of
*  this one is still a bit on the other side of the line. But we'd have a bank of
*  telescopes with lasers, they'd be like a gigawatt power. And these lasers would momentarily
*  shine upwards and accelerate, they'd hit these sails, they'd be like a power source for the sail,
*  and would accelerate the sails to travel at about a 20th the speed of light.
*  Is that as crazy as it sounds?
*  Well, like any good engineering project, it has to be broken down into the crazy parts.
*  And the breakthrough initiative, like to their huge credit, is sponsoring,
*  you know, getting over these, actually, they've listed initially, they listed 19 challenges.
*  It's broken down to concrete things. Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land and make
*  sure the airspace is okay with you sending up that much power overhead. Another one is you have to
*  have material on the sail where the lasers won't just vaporize it. And well, so there's a lot of
*  issues. But anyway, these sails would be accelerated to 20th the speed of light. And their journey to
*  the nearest star would now wouldn't, would no longer be tens of thousands of years, but could be
*  20 years. Okay, 20. So it's not as bad as tens of thousands. And these thousands or whatever,
*  however many make it, they'll go by the nearest star system and snap a few, snap some images
*  and radio the information back to earth. Because they're traveling so fast, they can't slow down,
*  but they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back. Hi, Rez. Yeah. But see, just what I want you
*  to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real concept, and the money given won't
*  make it happen, but what is done is it's planted the seed. And it's shifted that line from what
*  is crazy to what is a real project. It's shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think, to plant
*  the seed that we have to find a way to somehow find a way to get there. That is again, to stay
*  on that, that is so powerful. Take a big crazy idea and break it down into smaller crazy ideas,
*  order it in a list and knock it out one at a time. I don't know. I've never heard anything
*  more inspiring from an engineering perspective, because that's how you solve the impossible things.
*  So you open your new book discussing the rogue planet PSO J318. I never said this out loud,
*  0.522. So a rogue planet, which is just this poetic, beautiful vision of a planet that,
*  as you write, lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual darkness.
*  It's surface swept by constant storms. It's black skies raining molten iron.
*  Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness, the just how not pleasant it is for
*  human life. Just the intensity of that metaphor. I don't know. And the reason you use that is to
*  paint a feeling of loneliness and despair. And why, maybe on the planet side, why does it feel,
*  maybe it's just me, why does it feel so profoundly lonely on that kind of planet?
*  Like what?
*  I think it's because we all want to be a part of something. A part of a family or
*  a part of a community or a part of something. And so our solar system, and by the way,
*  I only, it's sort of like when you treat yourself to like eating an entire tub of ice cream.
*  Like I sometimes treat myself to imagine things like this and not just be so cut and dried. But
*  when you imagine that, this planet's not part, because I don't want to give emotions to a planet
*  per se, but the planet's not part of anything. It's somehow probably, it's just all on its own,
*  just kind of out there without that warm energy from its sun. It's just all alone out there.
*  To me, it was this little discovery that I actually feel pretty good being part of this
*  solar system. It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family, and it felt like it sucked
*  for the rogue planet to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless. By the way,
*  how many rogue planets are there in your sense? We don't know totally. I mean,
*  there's some rogue planets that are just born on their own. I know that sounds really weird to be,
*  how can you be born an orphan? But they just are. Because most planets are born out of a disk of
*  gas and dust around a star. But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars.
*  They're so failed, they're just small planets on their own. But we think that there's probably,
*  honestly, there's another path to a rogue planet. That's one that's been kicked out of its star
*  system by other planets, like a game of billiard balls. It's when it just gets kicked out.
*  We actually think there's probably as many rogue planets as stars.
*  No, flying out there, fundamentally alone. So the book is a memoir. It's about your life,
*  and it weaves both your fascination with planets outside the solar system and the path of your life.
*  And you lost your husband, which is a kind of central part of the book
*  that created a feeling of the rogue planet. By the way, what's the name of the book?
*  The name of the book is The Smallest Lights in the Universe.
*  What's up with the title? What's the meaning?
*  Well, the title has a double meaning. On the face of it, it's the search for other Earths.
*  Earths are so dim compared to the big, bright, massive star beside them.
*  Searching for the Earths is like searching for the smallest lights in the universe.
*  It has this other meaning too. I really hope that you or the other people listening never get
*  to the place where you're just falling off the cliff into this horrible place of huge despair.
*  And once in a while you get a glimmer of a better life, of some kind of hope.
*  And those are also the smallest lights in the universe.
*  Well, maybe we can tell the full story before we talk about the glimmer of hope.
*  What did it feel like to first find out that your husband Mike was sick?
*  It was incredibly frustrating. Like lots of us have had some kind of problem that the doctors
*  completely ignore. Just that they kept blowing him off. It's nothing.
*  Are they paid to just say it's nothing? I mean, it's just insane. I was just so angry.
*  And we finally got to a point where he was really sick. He was like in bed,
*  not able to move basically. And it turned out all the things they ignored and not done any tests,
*  he had like a 100% blockage in his intestine. Like 100%. Like nothing could get out,
*  nothing could get in. And it was pretty, pretty shocking to even hear then that it could be nothing.
*  What was the progression of it in the context of the maybe the medical system, the doctors?
*  I mean, what did it feel like? Did you feel like a human being?
*  I felt like a child. Like the doctors were trying to
*  water down the real diagnosis or treat us like we couldn't know the truth or they didn't know.
*  You know, I felt mixed. Like it's not a good situation if you think the doctor either has
*  no idea what he or she is doing. Or if the doctors purposely, let's just say lying to you to sugar
*  coat it. Like I didn't know which one of it was, but I knew it was one of those.
*  What were the things he was suffering from?
*  Well, initially he just had a random stomach ache. I hate to say that out loud because I know a lot
*  of people will have a random stomach ache. But so he just had a bad stomach ache and then, hmm,
*  this is weird. A few days later, another bad stomach ache, kind of gets worse. It might go away for a
*  few weeks, might come back. And at the time, all I knew was my dad had had that same thing.
*  Not the same identical system, but he had these really weird pains. And he ended up having
*  the worst diagnosis. One of the worst diagnoses you can get from a random stomach ache is
*  pancreatic cancer. Because the time, the pancreas, like you can't feel anything. So by the time you
*  feel pain, it's too late, it's spread already. So I was just like beside myself. I'm like,
*  this is like, wow, this guy, he's got a random stomach ache. All I know is another man I loved
*  had a random stomach ache and it didn't end well.
*  How did you deal with it emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, as a scientist?
*  Because it's not immediate, it's a long journey.
*  It's a long journey and you don't know where the diagnosis is going. So anyone who's suffered from
*  a major illness, there's like always branches in the road. So he had this intestinal blockage.
*  I can't imagine someone in their 40s having that and that be normal. But the doctor is like,
*  it could be nothing, could just cut it out. You don't need most of your intestine, it's a repeating
*  pattern. But it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like,
*  you don't need most of your intestine, it's a repeating pattern. Just cut that out, it could
*  be fine. But it ended up not being fine and he was diagnosed as being terminally ill.
*  Well, it really changed my life in a huge way. First of all, I remember immediately one summer,
*  the summer when this happened, I started asking everyone I knew, I would ask you,
*  I don't know, it's not my job to put you on the spot. I'd say, you have one year to live or two
*  or three. What will you do differently about your life now? Lex, you have one year to live,
*  what would you do? I mean, it's hard. I don't know if you want to answer that.
*  No, no, no, no, I think about it a lot. I mean, that's a really good thing to meditate on.
*  We can talk about maybe how, why you bring that up, what, if it is or not a heavy question. But
*  I get, I think about mortality a lot. And for me, it feels like a really good way to focus in on
*  is what you're doing today, the people you have around you, the family you have,
*  is it, does it bring you joy? Does it bring you fulfillment? And basically,
*  for me, long ago, I tried to be ready to die any day. So like today, I kind of woke up,
*  looking if I was nervous about talking to you, I really admire your work. And the book is very
*  good and super exciting topic. But then, there's this also feeling like, if this is the last
*  conversation I have in my life, if I die today, will this be the right? Am I glad today happened?
*  And it is. And I am glad today happened. So that's the way-
*  And that's so unique. I never got that answer from a single person.
*  The busyness of life, there's goals, there's dreams, there's like planning, plans-
*  And very few people make it happen. That's what I learned. And so a lot of these people-
*  Oh, like you run out of time.
*  It's not so much run out of time, but I'd come back later and be like,
*  okay, why don't you do that? And if that's what you would do,
*  if you're going to die a year from now, why don't you make it real?
*  Simple things, spend more time with family. Like, why don't you do that? And no one had an answer,
*  it turns out, unless you usually, unless you have, you really do have a pressing end of life,
*  people don't do their bucket list or try to change their career. And some people can't,
*  so we can't, like for a lot of people, they can't do anything about it. And that's fine.
*  But the ones who can take action for some reason never do. And that was one of the ways that Mike's
*  death or at the time, his impending death really, really affected me.
*  Because you know, for these sick people, what I learned, he had a bucket list and he was able
*  to do some of the bucket lists. It was awesome. But he got sick pretty quickly. So if you do
*  only have a year to live, it's ironic because you can't do the things you wanted to do because you
*  get too sick too fast. What were the bucket list things for you that you realized like,
*  what am I doing with my life? That was the major concept of him. After he died, I didn't know.
*  Like I was just lost. Because when something that profound happens, all the things I was doing,
*  most of the things I was doing were just meaningless. It was so tough to
*  find an answer for that. And that's when I settled on, I'm going to devote the rest of my life
*  to trying to find another earth and to find out, to find that we're not alone.
*  What is that longing for connection with others? What's that about? What do you think?
*  Why is that so full of meaning? I don't know why. I mean, I think it's
*  power hardwired. Like one of my friends some time ago, actually when my dad died,
*  he never heard someone say this before, but he's like, Sarah, you know,
*  why are we evolved to take death so harshly? Like what kind of society would we be if we just
*  didn't care people died? That would be a very different type of world. How would we as a species
*  have got to where we are? So I think that is tied hand in hand with why do we seek connection.
*  It's just that what we were talking about before, that subconsciousness that we don't understand.
*  Yeah, coupled, you know, the other side, the flip side of the coin of connection and love is
*  a fear of loss. It's like that was again, I don't know, it's what makes you appreciate the moment
*  is that the thing ends. Yeah, it's definitely a hard one. The thing ends, but, and it's hard to not,
*  you wouldn't want to limit like it's like my dog who I love so much, I'll start to cry. Like I
*  can't think about the end. I know he'll age much faster than I will and someday it will end. Right?
*  But it's too sad to think of, but should I not have got a dog? Right. Should I have not brought
*  this sort of joy into my life because I know it won't be forever. It's well, there's a, there's a
*  philosopher and his Becker who wrote a book Denial of Death and just and warm with the cores. And
*  there's another book talks about terror management theory, Sheldon Solomon. I just talked to him
*  a few weeks ago. It's a brilliant philosopher, psychologist that their theory, whatever you make
*  of it is that the fear of death is at the core of everything, everything we do. So like you're
*  that you think you don't think about the mortality of your dog, but you do. And that's what makes the
*  experience rich. Like there's this kind of like in the shadows looks the knowledge that
*  this won't last forever. And that makes every moment just special in some kind of a weird
*  way that the moments are special for us humans. I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love, but
*  what do you make? What did you learn about love from, from losing it, from losing your husband?
*  Well, I learned to love the things I have more. I learned to love the people that I have more
*  and to not let the little things bother me as much.
*  What about the rediscovery or like the discovery of the little lights
*  of the little lights in the darkness. So you, the book, I think you
*  brilliantly describe the dark parts of your journey. But maybe can you talk about how you
*  were able to rediscover the lights? They came in many ways. And the way like to think about it is
*  like grief is an ocean, you know, with tiny islands of the little, like, like the little lights. And
*  eventually that ocean gets smaller and smaller and the islands like become continents with lakes.
*  So initially it'd be like the children laughing one day or my colleagues at work who rallied
*  around me and would take me away from my darkness to work on a project. Later on, it turned out to
*  be a group of women my age, all widows, all with children in my town. And it would be,
*  even though it was a bit morose getting together, still very joyful at the same time.
*  What was the journey of rediscovering love like for you? So refinding, I mean, is there some,
*  by way of advice or insight about how to,
*  how to rediscover the beauty of life? Of life. It's a hard one. I think you just have to stay open
*  to being positive and just to get out there. Do you still think, do you still think about your
*  own mortality? So you mentioned that that was a thing that you would meditate on as a question
*  when it was right there and in front of you, but do you still think about it?
*  I think I will after talking to you. But no, it's not really something I think about. I mean,
*  I do think about the search for another earth and will, will I get there? Will I be able to conclude
*  my search and is there one? I guess time goes by, you know, that window to solve that problem gets
*  smaller. What would bring you, again, I apologize if this makes sense, but I think it's a question
*  again, I apologize if this makes concrete, the fact that life is finite, but what,
*  what would bring you joy if we discovered while you're still here?
*  What would bring me joy? Finding another earth, an earth like planet around a sun like star,
*  knowing that there's at least one or more out there, being able to see water, that it has
*  signs of water and being able to see some gases that don't belong. So I know that the search
*  will continue after I'm gone enough to fuel the next generation.
*  So just like opening the door and there's like this glimmer of hope. What do you think it will
*  take to realize that? I mean, we've talked about all these interesting projects, star shade,
*  especially, but is there something that you're particularly kind of
*  hopeful about in the next 10, 20 years that might give us that, that exact glimmer of hope that
*  there's earth like planets out there? I have to, I stand behind star shade in all cases.
*  So there is this other kind of field that I, that everyone is involved in because star shade is
*  hard, earth's are hard, but there are, there's another category of planet star type that's
*  easier and these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars. They're not earth like at all. Think
*  like earth cousin instead of earth twin, but there's a chance that we might establish that
*  some of those have water and signs of life on them. That's near a term that star shade
*  and we're all working hard on that too. Let me ask by way of recommendations. I think a lot of
*  people are curious about this kind of stuff. What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical
*  or anything really had an impact on your life and, and, or you would recommend besides of course,
*  your book. There's one book I wish everyone could read. I'm not sure if you've read it.
*  It's actually a children's book, like a young adult book. It's called the giver. Yes. I, I,
*  and it is the book that kids in school read now. And I only, sorry, that's not, that's wow. Cause
*  sorry, that, that caught me off guard. So when I first came to this country, I didn't speak much.
*  It's really what made me, uh, it had a profound impact on my life. And I had a really important
*  moment because they, they give it to kids. Like I think middle school, I think, or maybe
*  something like that. I'm so surprised you've even heard of this book. Yeah. So they gave it,
*  but like it's the value of giving the right book to a person at the right time. Uh, I was, I was,
*  cause it's very accessible. Do we want to share what the story is without spoiling it?
*  Uh, yeah, you can, without spoiling, right? It's
*  what follows this boy in this very utopic society. That's like perfect. It's been all clean cut and
*  made perfect actually. And as he kind of comes of age, he starts realizing something's wrong with
*  his world. And so it's part of that question. Are we going to evolve as, I mean, this isn't
*  what's there, but it made me wonder, you know, are we evolving to a better place? Is there a day when
*  we can eliminate, you know, poverty and hunger and crime and sickness in this book? They pretty much
*  have in a society that the boy's in and sort of follows him and he becomes a chosen one to
*  be like a receiver, the givers, the old wise man who retains some of the harshness of the
*  outside world so that he can advise the people as a sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the
*  special role. He finds the world isn't what he expects. And I don't know about you, but it was
*  so profound for me because it jolts you out of reality. It's like, Oh my God, what am I doing
*  here? I'm just going with the flow with my society. How do I think outside the box and
*  the confines of my society, which surely carries negative things with it that we don't realize today.
*  Yeah. And also in the flip side of that is if you do take a step outside the box on occasion,
*  what's the psychological burden of that? Like, is that a step you want to take? Is that the
*  journey you want to take? What is that life like? I don't know. I felt like from the book,
*  you have to take it. I found from the book. I never thought like now that you're saying it,
*  I see what you're saying. The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes,
*  you absolutely want to know what's outside, but you can't do that. It's hard to be objective
*  about your own reality. Yeah. I think it's a very human instinct, but it also, the book kind of
*  shows that it has an effect on you. And it's a really interesting question about our society
*  taking a step out. It's by Lois Lorry, I think is how you pronounce it. I really do hope everyone
*  created it. And it is a young adult book, but it's still, it's incredibly, I'm really glad. I only
*  read it because my kids got it for school. I just thought, okay, well, why don't I just see what
*  this is about? And I just, wow. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's also the value of education. I think
*  I'm surprised you mentioned, I've never really mentioned to anybody. I'm sure a lot of people
*  had similar experience like me and maybe. It's a generational thing though, because like the book
*  came out, I think in the nineties. So if you're older than like me, that book didn't exist when
*  we were in middle school. So I just do think a lot of people won't have heard of it. But it's an
*  interesting question of like those books. I mean, I'm reminded often, I suppose this seems true with
*  other subjects, but books are special at the early age, like middle school, maybe early high school.
*  Those can change the direction of your life and also certainly teachers. They can change
*  completely the direction of life. There's so many stories about teachers of mathematics,
*  teachers of physics, of any kind of subjects, basically changing the direction of a human's
*  life. That's like, not to get on the, the whole, almost like a political thing, but you know,
*  we undervalue teachers. It's a special position that they hold.
*  That's so true. Yeah. Well, I do have two other books or two other things.
*  One is something I came across just a few days ago, actually. It's actually a film called Picture
*  a Scientist. And when you picture a scientist, you probably don't picture the women and women of color
*  in this film. And it is a way to get outside your box. I really think everyone interested in science,
*  even just peripherally, should watch this because it is shocking and sobering at the same time.
*  And it talks about how, well, I think one of the messages across is, you know, we really are like,
*  I don't know if we're hardwired to just like people like ourselves, but we're excluding a lot
*  of people and therefore a lot of great ideas by not being able to think outside of how we're all
*  stereotyping each other. So it's, it's, it's hard to kind of convey that. And you can just say,
*  oh yeah, I want to be more diverse. I want to be more open, but it's a nearly impossible
*  problem to solve. And the movie really helps open people's eyes to it. This book I put third,
*  because unlike The Giver, people may not want to read it. It's not as relevant, but when I was in
*  my early twenties, I went to this big, this like 800 people large conference called, run by the
*  Wilderness Canoe Association in my hometown of Toronto. And there was a family friend there who
*  I met and he said, read this book, it'll change your life. And it actually changed my life.
*  And it was a book called Sleeping Island by an author, P.G. Downs, who just coincidentally lived
*  in this area, lived in the Boston area. And he was a teacher, I think at a private school. And every
*  summer he would go to Canada with a canoe, often by himself. And he wrote this book, maybe in the
*  forties or fifties, about a trip he took in the late 1930s. And I was just shocked that even at
*  that time, although that was a long time ago, there were large parts of Canada that were untouched by
*  white people. And he went up there and interacted like with the natives. He called the book,
*  it had a subtitle that was called, there's something like Journey in the Barren Lands.
*  And when you go up north in Canada, you pass the tree line, just like on a mountain, if you hike
*  up a mountain, you get so far north there aren't any trees. And he wrote eloquently about the land
*  and about being out there. There weren't even any maps of the region in that time. And I just
*  thought to myself, wow, that you could just take the summer off and explore by canoe and go and see
*  what's out there. And it led to me just doing that, that very thing. Of course it's different now,
*  but going out to where the road ends and putting the canoe in the water and just, well, we had to
*  have a plan. We didn't just explore, but go down this river, rivers with rapids and travel over
*  lakes and portages and just really live. So just really explore, screw it. That doesn't,
*  like it doesn't. Or just use from a topo map, from a topographical map
*  from the library. And those days were... There were scary elements about of it, out of it, but
*  part of the excitement or the joy or the desire was to be scared. Like it was to go out there
*  and have live on the edge. And persevere. Yeah. And persevere, yeah.
*  Do you have advice that you would give to a young person today that would like to help you maybe
*  on the planetary science side, discover exoplanets or maybe bigger picture just succeed in life?
*  I do have some advice just to succeed. It's tough advice in a way, but it is to find something
*  that you love doing, that you're also very good at. In some ways the stars have to align because
*  you've got to find that thing you're good at or the range of things. And it actually has to overlap
*  with something that actually you love doing every day. So it's not a tedious job. That's the best way
*  to succeed. What were the signals that in your own life were there to make you realize you're good at
*  something? What were you good at that made you pursue a PhD and made you pursue the search?
*  I mean, that was the one sentence version. In my case, it was a long slog and there were a lot of
*  things I wasn't good at initially. But so initially, I was good at high school math,
*  I was good at high school science. I loved astronomy and I realized those could all fit
*  together. The day I realized you could be an astronomer for a job, it has to be one of my top
*  days of my life. I didn't know that you could be that for a job. I was good at all those things.
*  And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical, where he could be guaranteed I
*  could support myself, was another option. But initially I wasn't that good at physics. It was
*  a slog to just get through school and grad school for a very, very long time. But ultimately,
*  when faced with a choice and I had the luxury of choosing, knowing that I was good at something
*  and also loved it, it really carried me through. Now I asked some of the smartest people in the
*  world the most ridiculous question. We already talked about it a little bit, but let me ask
*  again, why are we here? So I think you've raised this question in one of your presentations as
*  like one of the things that we kind of as humans long to answer and the search for
*  exoplanets is kind of part of that. But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?
*  I wish I had a good answer for you.
*  I think you're the first person ever who refused to answer the question.
*  It's not so much refusing. I just, yeah, I mean, I wish I had a better answer.
*  It's why we're here.
*  It's almost like the meaning is wishing there was a meaning that we wish and wishing we knew.
*  I love that. That's a great way to that's a great way to say it.
*  Like I said, the book is excellent. I admire your work from afar for a while. And I think you're one
*  of the great stars at MIT and makes me proud to be part of the community. So
*  thank you so much for your work. Thank you for inspiring all of us. Thanks for talking today.
