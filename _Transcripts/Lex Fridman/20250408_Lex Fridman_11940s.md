# Dave Smith: Israel, Ukraine, Epstein, Mossad, Conspiracies & Antisemitism | Lex Fridman Podcast #464
**Lex Fridman:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4)
*  All the people who sold the war in Iraq, they lied us into war after a war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=0.0s)]
*  They've bankrupted the country, damn near destroyed the dollar. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4.2s)]
*  I'd like no one loses their job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7.84s)]
*  No one even gets in trouble over any of this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10.24s)]
*  If you make everybody monsters and they're not human beings, well, you can't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=12.6s)]
*  do diplomacy with monsters. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=16.56s)]
*  You can't make a deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=18.52s)]
*  You can't negotiate with monsters, but you can with humans. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=19.36s)]
*  Maybe there are times where you're not, you shouldn't negotiate or you [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=23.16s)]
*  can't negotiate with humans, but it's better if you can. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=25.44s)]
*  And we could use a lot more of that thinking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=29.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has put a lot of political capital chips into the middle of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=33.0s)]
*  table that I can end this war, you know, and he's going to look very, very bad [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=39.24s)]
*  if he can't, so he's very highly incentivized to get this thing done as quick as possible. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=43.92s)]
*  You are fighting in a way that produces more of the thing that you're fighting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=49.0s)]
*  And so the first step is to stop doing that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=53.96s)]
*  Like your cure is making the patient more sick. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=56.8s)]
*  So stop doing that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=60.04s)]
*  And then let's see if maybe we could heal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=61.32s)]
*  Where are the tapes? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Why is everyone talking about the flight logs and the files? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=65.52s)]
*  Where are the tapes? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=68.28s)]
*  This guy was clearly taping people to blackmail them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Like, why does anything need to be redacted for national security? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=72.68s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, you're telling me there's a pedophile ring and we can't tell [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=76.28s)]
*  you everything about it for national security. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=79.72s)]
*  Why would that be related to national security? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=81.68s)]
*  The following is a conversation with Dave Smith, an outspoken and at times [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  controversial anti-war libertarian, comedian and podcast host. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=88.16s)]
*  This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=93.64s)]
*  Please check out our sponsors in the description. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=96.48s)]
*  And now dear friends, here's Dave Smith. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=99.12s)]
*  You are a long time libertarian, perhaps an anarcho-capitalist. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=103.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=108.76s)]
*  Talk about that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain the different, different aspects of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=109.76s)]
*  libertarianism and where you stand among those variants? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=112.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=117.8s)]
*  So there's almost like anything like with left-wing schools of thought or [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=118.28s)]
*  right-wing schools of thought, there's many different camps and different [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=122.0s)]
*  thinkers and so within the kind of broader theme of libertarianism, there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  was a lot of influence from people like Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, Thomas [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=131.12s)]
*  Soule, those were, I think some of the more mainstream figures. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  And then there's kind of like the Ron Paul brand of libertarianism, which [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=139.92s)]
*  is kind of distinct from that other camp where they're much more of an [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=143.72s)]
*  emphasis on foreign policy, all of them kind of fall into the radical [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=147.24s)]
*  minarchist points of view. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=152.0s)]
*  And then there's Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=154.32s)]
*  Then there's also like David Friedman, who's an anarcho-capitalist, but from [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=158.12s)]
*  a completely different perspective than Murray Rothbard, I would probably be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=161.8s)]
*  most, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get into that, but I think [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=165.6s)]
*  most closely like with the Rothbard school, which is very similar to Ron [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Paul, but even maybe a little bit further in that, you know, the very [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=174.12s)]
*  little bit of government that Ron Paul might support. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=178.24s)]
*  You've been a big fan of Ron Paul. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=180.84s)]
*  Can you explain what you admire about him? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  A big fan is an understatement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=184.84s)]
*  I think Ron Paul is like the greatest living American hero. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=186.56s)]
*  I revere him on the level of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson or [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  George Washington. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=197.0s)]
*  Number one, I mean, all of the major issues that he, he was correct in his [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=198.4s)]
*  understanding of them, his diagnosis of what caused these problems and his [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=205.72s)]
*  solutions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=209.96s)]
*  And in hindsight, there's just like a million different examples of where [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=210.72s)]
*  almost everybody today would agree, even though his ideas were very [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=216.44s)]
*  controversial at the time, be like, Oh my God, if we had just listened to Ron [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Paul about that, we'd be so much better off. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  But I think there's something almost deeper than that about why. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=224.96s)]
*  So why Ron Paul inspires so much love from so many people is okay. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=229.24s)]
*  So number one, the guy, he was a champion of these views for decades when there [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=235.56s)]
*  was no payoff for it at all, where he was just kind of alone in the woods being, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=243.72s)]
*  you know, they used to call him Dr. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  No, because well, he was a medical doctor and then he was, he would be the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=249.56s)]
*  lone no vote in Congress like all the time, like on the, on the bills that the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=253.16s)]
*  entire Congress bipartisan agreement, everything is, and there's one vote [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=257.36s)]
*  against it, you know? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=262.28s)]
*  Um, and that he would be that guy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=263.76s)]
*  He clearly kept doing what he was doing simply because he believed it was right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=265.92s)]
*  Not because there was any benefit for him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=270.68s)]
*  In fact, he dealt with a lot of headaches for the views that he had. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=272.68s)]
*  And then he was just a genuine person of integrity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=276.12s)]
*  You know, he's the only, uh, congressman who I've ever heard this about. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=278.88s)]
*  And, and like DC insiders, people on the Hill will say this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=282.52s)]
*  He was the only congressman of my lifetime who the lobbyists simply stopped visiting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=285.48s)]
*  He was the only one who they just stopped going to his office because they were just [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=292.24s)]
*  like, there's just no getting through to this guy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  He was just not playing politics like that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=298.52s)]
*  And he was, you know, you, you imagine what it must've been like from like the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=300.68s)]
*  lobbyist perspective when they first tried to go there, you know, and they'd [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=303.68s)]
*  be like, all right, listen, we really need you to vote yes on this or that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=307.04s)]
*  And he was like, the constitution doesn't authorize us to do that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=310.16s)]
*  And they're like, what? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=313.56s)]
*  Like who, who in this town even talks like that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=314.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=317.24s)]
*  And so there was just, he's also just, I've, I've met him, uh, many times at this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=317.92s)]
*  point and he is just genuinely, he's like one of those guys who's just from like [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=322.12s)]
*  an older, better generation, just he's the sweetest guy, but he's like, uh, but [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=327.72s)]
*  he's not a pushover. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=334.24s)]
*  Like he was a tough guy in his day and he was an athlete and he was in the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=335.68s)]
*  air force and is married to the same woman for, I think over 60 years at this [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=339.48s)]
*  point has like a big, beautiful family. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=344.16s)]
*  He was a country doctor. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=346.24s)]
*  He was a baby doctor who delivered thousands of babies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=347.88s)]
*  Like he's just, it is, he's like this kind of classic American figure. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=350.92s)]
*  And, um, you know, I just think, uh, you know, at the risk of, of falling [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=357.44s)]
*  into like hero worship or something like that, I do think he's a, I think [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=362.2s)]
*  he's a genuinely great man and I think great men are to be revered. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=366.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=370.52s)]
*  As you said, there's integrity there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=371.0s)]
*  Can you speak to the ideas that Ron Paul represents? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=373.32s)]
*  Like you said, some of the things he's been right about, maybe can you speak [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=375.48s)]
*  about the economics, the fed and maybe war and being anti-military intervention? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=378.68s)]
*  Well, I think it comes, it all came from kind of the same central thesis, which [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=383.84s)]
*  is that the highest political value ought to be Liberty. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=389.56s)]
*  Um, and, and that, you know, the government by its very nature is an [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=393.24s)]
*  instrument of force and tyranny and that therefore the more government you have, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=398.12s)]
*  the less Liberty you have. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=403.52s)]
*  Um, I think he also was, he was way ahead of his time in, in like really [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=405.16s)]
*  calling out the corruption in DC. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=412.76s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that's kind of that it's a common [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=415.16s)]
*  throughline between the federal reserve and, um, government spending. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=418.32s)]
*  And of course, this crazy war industry that our country has. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=422.64s)]
*  Um, there, so there, there's a lot of components to that, but essentially [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=427.36s)]
*  Ron Paul was talking about draining the swamp way before it was like [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=431.84s)]
*  this dominant mass message. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=435.28s)]
*  And I think Ron Paul in many ways laid down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=438.28s)]
*  He laid the groundwork in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns for not, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=443.92s)]
*  not saying that he leads to Donald Trump, but he laid the groundwork for [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=451.16s)]
*  Donald Trump to be able to get up at the South Carolina Republican primary [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=455.24s)]
*  debate and look at Jeb Bush and say, your brother lied us into war. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=459.72s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=463.36s)]
*  And, and, and to have the Republicans agree with him, you know, the same, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=464.24s)]
*  these were a lot of the same people who had voted for George W. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=467.48s)]
*  Bush twice and supported the war and even mocked their liberal, you know, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=470.16s)]
*  fellow countrymen for not being on board with it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=475.52s)]
*  And, and a lot of that was the work that Ron Paul did and people waking up to, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=478.68s)]
*  um, the, how, how messed up all these wars were. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=483.2s)]
*  And I think that at least from there were a couple of major things [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=487.04s)]
*  for me, okay, at the time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=490.48s)]
*  So I was like, I was a young man when I first found Ron Paul. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=491.52s)]
*  I was, I was in a 2007 was when I first saw him and then started [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=495.24s)]
*  obsessively reading all of his books. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=499.76s)]
*  And so I was young. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=501.76s)]
*  I I'm born in 83. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=504.0s)]
*  So what would that mean? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=505.2s)]
*  23, 24, uh, when I first found him. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=505.84s)]
*  So I was a young guy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  And at least from me at the time, there were like kind of two categories in my, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=509.4s)]
*  you know, naive mind where, okay, there were like the liberals who supported [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=514.76s)]
*  big government at home, but were skeptical about, you know, big government [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=521.0s)]
*  abroad or they're skeptical about wars. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  And then there were the conservatives who said that they supported small [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=528.92s)]
*  government, limited government at home, but we're always on the side of whatever [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=532.84s)]
*  the next war is. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=536.2s)]
*  And at least for me, and I think for a lot of people of my generation, Ron Paul [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=537.12s)]
*  was the first guy who came along and said like, no, I'm for limited government [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=540.88s)]
*  here and abroad. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=545.2s)]
*  And it was kind of like a portal where you could like access a different [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=546.96s)]
*  perspective on the world. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=550.64s)]
*  And then once you saw that you were like, wait, that's actually what makes sense. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=552.0s)]
*  It makes, it doesn't make sense to like, what are, what is it exactly that like, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  um, all the Ronald Reagan and George W. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=559.8800000000001s)]
*  Bush and, and even like Milton Friedman and guys like that and Tom Sowell and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  it's like, you want a constitutionally limited world empire? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=566.84s)]
*  Like that's what you guys stand for. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=571.72s)]
*  Cause that doesn't, that doesn't fit together at all. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=573.32s)]
*  And so why is it that we took, we were taking this as a given. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=575.6400000000001s)]
*  And then of course, the more you, you look into it, you realize that like, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=578.6s)]
*  okay, there, those two things do make sense together. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=581.6s)]
*  And then also that kind of like the, in the initial wave of like the original [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=585.72s)]
*  progressives, you know, look, people like Woodrow Wilson or FDR, these were people [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=589.48s)]
*  who were pushing big government at home and big government abroad. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=595.0s)]
*  And that actually made much more sense as a cohesive worldview. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  And to oppose that would be the Ron Paul worldview. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=601.68s)]
*  And then the other thing for me, and this was actually, this was my [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=605.6s)]
*  introduction to Ron Paul. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=608.04s)]
*  And this too, to me was like kind of a portal in a way it was, it was a way, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=609.4s)]
*  at least in my naive, not fully functioned brain or a fully developed brain at 24 [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=614.52s)]
*  years old or whatever. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=620.32s)]
*  Um, it was a way for me to kind of get like, like I tapped into something that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  was outside the empire and I had, um, I had heard a lot, you know, I was already [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=626.48s)]
*  against George W. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=632.28s)]
*  Bush and I didn't like the war. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=633.2s)]
*  I could, I, I had already figured out, you know, I think this, I think this [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=634.4s)]
*  war in Iraq is bullshit. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=637.88s)]
*  And I think that we were lied into it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=639.44s)]
*  And so I kind of got that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=641.2s)]
*  And then there were, there were liberals and, and left wingers who I knew, I grew [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=642.28s)]
*  up in New York city, so I was very familiar with the left wing perspective [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=646.2s)]
*  and who are critical of, of George W. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=649.6s)]
*  Bush and, and for fighting the war and, and, you know, signing the Patriot Act [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=652.36s)]
*  into law and things like that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=657.32s)]
*  But I had never really heard anybody break it down the way Ron Paul did. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=659.4s)]
*  When he was, when he basically was like, look, there's a reason why these [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=664.08s)]
*  terrorists hate us and it's not what they're telling you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=668.84s)]
*  They don't hate us for our freedom. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not as if I remember the way Pat Buchanan put it, which I always loved was [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=673.76s)]
*  he goes, uh, uh, he said Dick Cheney makes it sound like Osama bin Laden [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=677.12s)]
*  stumbled on like in the deserts of Afghanistan. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  He stumbled onto a copy of our bill of rights somewhere. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=684.44s)]
*  And he was like, Oh my God, they're free to look at this speedy trial. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=687.52s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=692.4s)]
*  Like this is like, what is going on here? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=693.32s)]
*  They can own guns and their women can wear mini skirts. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=695.6s)]
*  And that, and that just made people so angry that they were ready to, you [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=698.32s)]
*  know, like suicide bomb themselves. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=701.44s)]
*  Or like that makes no sense at all. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=703.32s)]
*  And then Ron Paul was just like, no, look, here's the thing. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=705.36s)]
*  If we think we can just go around the world, killing people, propping up [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=708.7600000000001s)]
*  dictatorships, putting our military bases in the Muslims, holy land, and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=712.44s)]
*  not engender hatred from that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  Then we do that at our own peril. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=720.12s)]
*  And I thought that was, it was such an interesting kind of, you know, it had [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=722.0s)]
*  always been, I'm an eighties and nineties kid. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  And to me, it was always kind of a given that like America's number one, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=728.48s)]
*  we're the force for good in the world. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=732.88s)]
*  And w and it was like an interesting introduction to the idea that there are [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=734.72s)]
*  people outside of that who are dominated by that, who don't care for it very much. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=739.36s)]
*  And like that, that's what nine 11 was actually about. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=746.12s)]
*  And for me, I was living in New York city. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=748.44s)]
*  I was 18, I think when nine 11 happened, and that was like the moment of my [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=750.32s)]
*  childhood, it was a huge thing to live through. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=755.44s)]
*  I mean, we were attacked. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=758.48s)]
*  This seemed like something that could only happen in a history book that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=759.84s)]
*  didn't happen to America in the nineties. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=762.0s)]
*  2001 was basically the nineties. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=764.84s)]
*  Um, and, uh, and it was just like, Oh, finally it clicked. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  It was like, that makes sense. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  It was the first time I had ever heard like an explanation and an understanding [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  of this whole thing that we're involved in now from nine 11 to the terror wars [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=777.84s)]
*  that actually just made perfect sense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=784.36s)]
*  We should also say that there's some degree of truth that the battle is [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  not just militaristic, it's also cultural. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=789.36s)]
*  And then many of those parts of the world don't want other people's [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=792.96s)]
*  values forced onto them. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=798.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=801.0s)]
*  But the way that George W. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=801.2s)]
*  Bush and Dick Cheney and every right-wing host in America and Sean [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=802.6s)]
*  Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and like everybody, what they were saying is that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  they hate that we're free. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=810.52s)]
*  Whereas it was much closer to saying like, they don't like us imposing on them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=813.08s)]
*  Even like all the hardcore neocons, Brett Stevens, the New York Times, he [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=819.64s)]
*  wrote this piece on the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=824.16s)]
*  So, uh, 2023 to cheer lead the war in Iraq. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  And he goes through the whole piece and there's not one mention of the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=831.24s)]
*  million people who died in the war. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=835.32s)]
*  You know, he literally just goes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=837.6s)]
*  The piece is just measure life under Saddam Hussein versus life under the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=839.4s)]
*  Shiite parliamentary system that they have now, which one's better. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=845.16s)]
*  And I, he's arguing this one's better. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=849.12s)]
*  Therefore it was worth it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=850.6800000000001s)]
*  But there's like no mention. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=851.92s)]
*  It's like, okay, but what about the 20 plus million people who were displaced? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=852.84s)]
*  What about the million people who were killed? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=856.04s)]
*  What about all the millions of people who were injured? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=857.6s)]
*  What about the tens of thousands of our soldiers who have blown their brains [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=860.04s)]
*  out in the aftermath of the thing? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=863.72s)]
*  Like, it's like so, so many times this true and with government policy in [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=865.2s)]
*  general, people talk about like the end result that they want, but you're like, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=868.6s)]
*  yeah, but what about the process by which you get there and how much hatred, you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=873.64s)]
*  know, could you, I mean, like I, you know, it's, it's not that hard for me to like [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=878.12s)]
*  put myself in, in other people's shoes. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=881.24s)]
*  And like, I have two little kids and a wife. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=883.6s)]
*  And if anybody were to ever try to argue to me that they have to be the eggs that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=887.12s)]
*  get broken to make some bigger omelet. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=892.28s)]
*  Like it's okay. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=894.76s)]
*  Like, you know, we're ultimately going to impose something on your society. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=895.7199999999999s)]
*  That's better than what you have right there. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=898.8s)]
*  It sure does suck that your wife and kids got to be the one who get taken out. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=900.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm as I'm just saying this to myself, and this is not real. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=903.64s)]
*  This is just a thought experiment I'm making up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=908.52s)]
*  I'm already pretty close to being a terrorist. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=910.8399999999999s)]
*  Like my next thought is kind of like, well, okay. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=913.64s)]
*  Well, I hope you're going to like it when you watch your family die in front of you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=916.56s)]
*  You know, now I'm not, hopefully, even if that happened to me, I wouldn't go [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=920.16s)]
*  kill that guy's family. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=924.16s)]
*  But like, maybe I'd just go after him or something, but I could understand. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=925.28s)]
*  I think most people who have kids could understand going to a level of like the, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=930.2s)]
*  the most evil dark place you could imagine if something ever, anyone ever [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=935.52s)]
*  threatened or actually did something to your kids. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=940.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=943.4s)]
*  We'll have to remember the thing that's difficult to measure that you just [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=943.64s)]
*  mentioned, which is the hate that's created by every bomb that's dropped. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=947.44s)]
*  It was a general McChrystal who, you know, was the general running [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=950.6s)]
*  the war in Afghanistan. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=955.36s)]
*  He wasn't like, he wasn't Ron Paul. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=956.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=958.84s)]
*  Like he was a sir. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=959.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  How do we fight and win this war general? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=961.48s)]
*  And he's the one who coined the term insurgent math, 10 minus two equals 20. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=963.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like the more you, the more you keep, I was just reading, I was [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=968.6800000000001s)]
*  rereading about this the other day, um, because of the, uh, you know, Trump's [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=972.0s)]
*  been bombing, uh, the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=977.0s)]
*  And, you know, it was like when, when we first, I think it was in, in, at least [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  in 2009 is when Obama really stepped up the drone campaign with the then secret [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=984.96s)]
*  drone bombing campaign and the Yemen was one of the major theaters. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=989.32s)]
*  And even back then when it really was just a, it was a war on terrorism. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=993.96s)]
*  Like the main targets were always Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=999.84s)]
*  and their presence in Yemen. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1003.48s)]
*  Even then, like, so before the Saudis invaded, so like from 2009 through [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1005.1600000000001s)]
*  2015, AQAP just kept growing. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1009.24s)]
*  It was doing all these targeted bombing campaigns or they call them targeted. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1013.12s)]
*  96% of the people are innocent who get killed, but they call them targeted [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1016.36s)]
*  drone bombings and they, and, and Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula just [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1020.24s)]
*  kept getting bigger and bigger because you know, it's like, yeah, every time [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1024.32s)]
*  you go in there, it's like, okay, you took out one target and then you took out [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1027.48s)]
*  three little girls and you know, and every one of those little girls had [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1030.76s)]
*  brothers and uncles and fathers and you know, and all of them just signed up to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  join the fight now because you know, and I, Ron Paul was the first one who really [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
*  made this click for me, but it's in a way, and I'm not like, I'm not a leftist. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1045.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm not an egalitarian. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1050.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not a cultural relativist. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1051.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying that all cultures are the same or that we all look at the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1054.08s)]
*  world the same way there's enormous differences between all of us. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1057.52s)]
*  And I personally think some are better than others, but there are things [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  that unite all of us and in a weird way. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1065.2s)]
*  It's, I remember one time I was arguing with a Democrat guy on a SC cup show. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1068.16s)]
*  I used to be a contributor on her show and we were arguing and it was after, it [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1074.0s)]
*  was after a terrorist attack here in New York, a fairly minor one. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1078.4s)]
*  It was like a guy like, I think he hit someone with his car and then jumped out [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1081.76s)]
*  with a gun and then the cops lit him up and killed him. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1084.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, this is like back in 2017, I think. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1087.56s)]
*  And he, he claimed to be ISIS inspired. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1090.52s)]
*  I don't, I don't remember if there was like a direct connection or not, but [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1093.68s)]
*  they were at the time they were like, doesn't this mean we got to step up the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1096.68s)]
*  war in Iraq or in Syria where ISIS is stronghold is, and I remember the guy [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  saying to me, he goes, uh, you know, I went off on how these wars have been [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1104.52s)]
*  disasters and he goes, yeah, yeah, but Dave, what you're saying here is we're [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1108.92s)]
*  supposed to do nothing like this just happened and now we're supposed to do [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1111.64s)]
*  nothing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1115.1200000000001s)]
*  And so like, even though this guy had a suit and tie on and we're in a cable [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  news studio and we're in a first world country, we're in the United States of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1118.96s)]
*  America and we're having the basic thing that he's saying is like, what do [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1122.36s)]
*  you say? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1127.04s)]
*  You're saying we're not going to go kill some motherfuckers. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1127.28s)]
*  You know, like, I mean, he's, he was just putting it as like, do something, but [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1129.6s)]
*  what's something something is dropping bombs on human beings, you know, when [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1133.04s)]
*  like, yes, some innocent people are going to die, but okay, but it's the same [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1140.7199999999998s)]
*  It's the same after nine 11, we're like, we got to go fucking invade some [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  countries right now. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1144.4799999999998s)]
*  That's the same impulse. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1145.4399999999998s)]
*  It's like they killed some of our people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  You think we're not going to show them who the real killers are. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  You think there's a chance that you could come here and, and that is like the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1151.76s)]
*  most human instinct ever. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1154.8s)]
*  It's like some other tribe just came in here and killed some people in our [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1157.24s)]
*  tribe. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1161.04s)]
*  So what do you want to do about that? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1161.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1163.1999999999998s)]
*  It's not going to take me too long to figure out we're going to go kill a bunch [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1163.76s)]
*  of people in their tribe. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  And I do think that like that is, I think that's the major motivating factor for [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1167.84s)]
*  both sides of the Israel Palestine conflict. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1172.8s)]
*  I think that's the major motivator for both sides of the war on terror conflict. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1175.24s)]
*  And it's like that's it's in a way when you look at it like that, there's [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1178.92s)]
*  something, even though it's so dark and tragic, there's something almost beautiful [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1182.6000000000001s)]
*  about it where you're like, oh, we're all caught in this same cycle. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1185.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1191.2s)]
*  It's deeply human. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  The, the worrying between tribes, but you know, especially in the recent years, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1192.52s)]
*  but more and more through human history, there's almost like a third party, which [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1197.4s)]
*  is this military industrial complex, which is making money from the two tribes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  So if you just have two tribes, one, I've been reading a lot about Janus Khan. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1206.76s)]
*  If, uh, this is why Janus Khan banned this, it was very common in, uh, in [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1210.88s)]
*  Mongolia before Janus Khan to steal people's wives, like you're my wife now. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1216.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1221.64s)]
*  And he, he realized that that creates a lot of conflict. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1222.32s)]
*  That seems natural and human, that kind of conflict. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1227.04s)]
*  But when, whenever you, uh, third party rolls in and starts making money on the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1229.56s)]
*  whole thing and then driving that forward, then the escalation of the conflict. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1233.56s)]
*  Comes with this whole machine that makes deescalation really difficult. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1239.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1243.6s)]
*  The military industrial complex in America, it's so big and it's so [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1244.12s)]
*  sophisticated and it's so, so it's not just that there's, you know, um, you [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1249.56s)]
*  know, there's this, there's the intelligence agencies, there's the weapons [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1254.76s)]
*  manufacturers, then there's the like people in the media who are either [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1258.24s)]
*  directly or indirectly just parroting, you know what I mean? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  All of their talking points. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1268.0s)]
*  And so it's not just that you can kind of like, like you make money when [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1269.56s)]
*  there's a conflict, but you have this entire apparatus to like create the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1273.76s)]
*  conflict and then create the public sentiment for that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  And then we're, and it's interesting. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  We're, we're in an interesting place because we're kind of in this like new [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  frontier of now where shows like this can happen and there's a lot of them. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1288.12s)]
*  And a lot of them are humongous like yours. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1292.84s)]
*  Um, but for so long, this just didn't exist. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1295.56s)]
*  And it was just like, Oh, like for so long, it was the case that like the [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1300.9599999999998s)]
*  New York times and NBC and CBS and ABC and the Washington post and the, the [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1305.8s)]
*  Associated press, I guess they could just move the nation. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1312.08s)]
*  I mean, if they wanted to be like, Hey, there is the idea that forget [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1315.76s)]
*  even like after nine 11, the idea that in 1990, 1991, that there was any [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1319.6799999999998s)]
*  organic movement from the American people going, you know, we really got to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  see about the Saddam Hussein guy. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1331.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, uh, the, uh, dictator in Iraq is having a slant drilling [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1333.8s)]
*  dispute with the, uh, Amir of Kuwait. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1337.9199999999998s)]
*  We really got to do something about that. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1341.12s)]
*  Like that is not something that organically came from any, that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1342.7199999999998s)]
*  was not like a few soccer moms hanging out, you know, watching their kids [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1346.32s)]
*  game being like, I really do think I think in a couple of years, we're [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
*  going to have to send these boys over to Iraq to get like, that's not, they [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1353.1599999999999s)]
*  just from the top down, we're able to create this feeling that like, Hey, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1356.56s)]
*  there's a new Adolf Hitler on the rise over here in Iraq. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1362.9599999999998s)]
*  We got to go see about this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1365.84s)]
*  There are these poor people in Kuwait. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1367.4399999999998s)]
*  We have to do that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1368.84s)]
*  You know, like there's, they were able to create this desire for war. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1369.8s)]
*  Um, that was, it's really incredible when you think about it, because there's [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1375.68s)]
*  for, I think for the most part in human history, you would have had to have [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1380.72s)]
*  some type of plausible threat, some type of plausible reality to convince [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1384.84s)]
*  people that we actually have to go to war, um, in order to deal with this. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1390.68s)]
*  Whereas like, you know, the United, the idea that in 1991, the United States [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1395.68s)]
*  of America would feel threatened by Iraq was just ridiculous and yet they were [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1400.4s)]
*  able to do it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1405.72s)]
*  Well, so to push back a little bit throughout human history, there was [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1406.24s)]
*  also a thing you look at the Roman empire, where just the cultural values [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1409.72s)]
*  were different, where military conquest was seen as a good thing. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1413.3200000000002s)]
*  So like, we just almost assume in the United States, war has been framed in [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1418.16s)]
*  a defensive sense, like where offensive war, we're not doing that anymore. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1424.56s)]
*  You make a fair point. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1429.84s)]
*  It's certainly true that throughout human history, there's been, um, there's [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1431.0s)]
*  been like overt, um, empire building and wars of conquest and things like that. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1435.48s)]
*  But I guess I'm just saying at least even there, you would have some type of [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1442.84s)]
*  cell of like, why we're going to go take these resources and why that will be [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1446.72s)]
*  good for us. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1450.76s)]
*  Whereas the idea that they're like Kuwait just needed to be defended by the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1451.64s)]
*  Americans seems so, it seems so hard to convince anybody and yet they were able [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1457.68s)]
*  to do it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1463.24s)]
*  If you read like neocon writing in the nineties, it was very interesting, um, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1464.08s)]
*  because they would, they would tell the truth a lot more. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  Uh, and they were essentially, I think. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1472.08s)]
*  There was the Soviet union had just collapsed. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1477.16s)]
*  It was what, what Charles Krottenheimer dubbed the unipolar moment. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1479.72s)]
*  There was like a lot of, there was excitement. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1483.28s)]
*  There was a feeling of invincibility. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1485.48s)]
*  Um, and also the neocons weren't in power. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1487.44s)]
*  And after 92, really, I mean, they had a little, they were in the George HW [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1490.52s)]
*  Bush administration, but after 92, they really weren't. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1493.96s)]
*  So they're just writing at these think tanks and it just didn't seem as, you [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1496.36s)]
*  know, like they weren't as guarded. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1500.24s)]
*  There weren't like these accusations of Euro war criminal or something like that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1501.56s)]
*  But what he said, uh, with Jonah Goldberg agreed with was that every, uh, I think [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1505.28s)]
*  the statement was every 10 years or so, America's got to find a puny little [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1511.12s)]
*  country and put them up against the wall just to let the rest of the world know [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1514.96s)]
*  that we mean business. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  And that was actually their mentality. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1519.84s)]
*  I'm sure there's people that agree with that. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1522.52s)]
*  I happen to disagree with that, but the drums of war beating a little bit over [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1524.12s)]
*  Taiwan and China more than a little bit. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1528.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1531.0s)]
*  But there, I can't even see a justification of a just war. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1531.36s)]
*  What is the long-term benefit to society? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1534.0s)]
*  If you do military intervention. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1537.2800000000002s)]
*  I will. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1539.0800000000002s)]
*  I also think this, and I've been saying this for a while, but I do think there is [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1539.4s)]
*  this like, um, there there's like this empire mentality that Americans have. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1543.16s)]
*  Got a shake off, like as if it's even a question of whether we should allow it or [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1549.5200000000002s)]
*  not, like, are we in a position to allow or not allow that? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1555.68s)]
*  Why do we have it's, it's almost like if you were, um, you know, like I, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1560.0s)]
*  I don't, I hope China doesn't invade Taiwan. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1563.88s)]
*  I hope Taiwan remains as free as possible. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1565.8000000000002s)]
*  I hope China becomes free. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1568.1200000000001s)]
*  I root for freedom and prosperity for everyone, you know, but I also root for [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1569.8000000000002s)]
*  like everybody to have a healthy marriage. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  But if you were like, if you were talking to me and you were like, Hey, the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1575.96s)]
*  guy down the street is cheating on his wife. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1579.5600000000002s)]
*  Like, I don't think we can allow this. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1583.64s)]
*  I'd immediately be like, that's really not my place. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1586.3200000000002s)]
*  And then on top of that, I also have no power. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1588.96s)]
*  I have no authority over what they do in their marriage. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1590.8400000000001s)]
*  Like I have to be concerned with my marriage and the idea that like, imagine [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1593.6s)]
*  if there were the political will to, uh, invade Mexico, like if DC decided we're [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1598.76s)]
*  taking Mexico city, like that's w that's going to be part of America now and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1605.8s)]
*  we're taking it by force. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1609.8s)]
*  And then China was like, we're not sure if we can allow this. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1611.28s)]
*  I think immediately most Americans would be like, allow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1615.6399999999999s)]
*  Like, how the fuck do you think you're going to stop us from taking Mexico city? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1624.76s)]
*  China? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1625.64s)]
*  You're going to send your Navy ships over here to fight us off the coast of Mexico. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1631.0400000000002s)]
*  And at least from my understanding in almost all the war games that they've run, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1632.68s)]
*  if we did militarily, even if it doesn't come to nuclear weapons being used, in [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1636.88s)]
*  which case the whole world gets blown up. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1640.88s)]
*  But even if we go to militarily, try to stop China from invading Taiwan and no [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1643.32s)]
*  one, everyone agrees to not use nukes and we just fight a conventional war, we [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1649.4399999999998s)]
*  lose that war every time. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1653.04s)]
*  I think what you said applies to a lot of the wars we've been involved in, but [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1655.1999999999998s)]
*  China and Taiwan is a little bit different because, because of TSMC, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  because there's an economic dependence. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1663.76s)]
*  If that was the concern, then the response would be, we need some type of [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1665.6799999999998s)]
*  Manhattan project and I'm not supporting a government project here, but there [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1669.56s)]
*  would be, we need some type of Manhattan project to say, we're going to make these [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1672.88s)]
*  things here. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1676.0800000000002s)]
*  We can't. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1676.72s)]
*  And look, I was running that experiment before saying like, what if we all pinky [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1677.3200000000002s)]
*  promise not to use nuclear weapons or something like that? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1681.0800000000002s)]
*  But that's not the reality of the situation. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  The more reality, look, even in, in Ukraine, everybody, the biggest talks, the [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1686.24s)]
*  biggest pushers of this policy and Joe Biden and a policy to fund Ukraine. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1691.24s)]
*  No one's suggesting we send in the 82nd airborne, which is really the only thing [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1696.0400000000002s)]
*  that could repel the Russians right now and restore, you know, Ukrainian, the, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1700.2s)]
*  the original sovereignty of the Ukrainian borders. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1704.48s)]
*  But no one's suggesting we send in the 82nd airborne because we all know, well, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1708.0800000000002s)]
*  we can't have a direct war with Russia. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1711.48s)]
*  That's the end of the world. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1713.52s)]
*  And same thing with China. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1714.96s)]
*  So, you know, I'm not saying microchips or whatever aren't important, but there's, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1716.3600000000001s)]
*  we can find other ways to, Taiwan is not magical. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1722.72s)]
*  Like we can produce these things in other places. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1726.28s)]
*  No. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1728.24s)]
*  So you have the humility to say that you don't really know much about the [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1728.72s)]
*  situation. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1731.6399999999999s)]
*  It sounds ridiculous to say, but there's something magical about not Taiwan, but [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1732.56s)]
*  TSMC is incredibly difficult to manage the supply chain and manufacture at such a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1735.96s)]
*  low cost that they are. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1741.32s)]
*  And to add to that, China has been signaling about the one China policy, but [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1742.56s)]
*  you're absolutely right that you shouldn't be doing the Washington thing of [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1746.32s)]
*  beating the drums of war. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1751.52s)]
*  That's like completely the counterproductive thing. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1752.96s)]
*  There should, you should actually try to find partnerships with China, build [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1755.8000000000002s)]
*  friendships and cooperation. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1759.96s)]
*  Like India is doing a good job of this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  Like build friendships. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1763.0400000000002s)]
*  This is the 21st century. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1764.2800000000002s)]
*  Conflict. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1766.8400000000001s)]
*  This cold war thinking is going to be destructive to the economy, destructive to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1767.88s)]
*  humanity, to the flourishing of the individual nations of the world. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1772.8400000000001s)]
*  There's just nothing positive except making money for the military. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1776.24s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  And it was totally destructive during the original cold war too. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1780.24s)]
*  Um, and almost led to nuclear war on a couple of different occasions, but like I [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  would just say, and I really, I'm no defender of the Chinese regime. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1787.28s)]
*  I hate communism and fascism, whatever they are, some hybrid mix of the two. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1791.8s)]
*  They're paying you, aren't they? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1797.24s)]
*  That, yeah, no, fuck them. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1799.92s)]
*  By the way, I get a lot of people speculate online, but I am not, I'm not [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1800.6s)]
*  getting any of these checks, man. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1803.84s)]
*  And I'd really like them to start coming in. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1805.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1806.6s)]
*  Um, but there's like, even when it's like China, you say China is asserting the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1806.96s)]
*  one China policy, but the one China policy is the policy of the United [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1811.44s)]
*  States of America and has been for 50 years now, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  So it's not, I think what's happening there a lot of times is that essentially, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1819.6000000000001s)]
*  even though officially the one China policy is the policy of the United [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1824.88s)]
*  States of America, all of these American politicians, um, and, and, you know, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1828.6000000000001s)]
*  different figureheads across powerful centers in America are saying that China [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1834.48s)]
*  doesn't have the right to go into Taiwan. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1840.2s)]
*  And then China's in the position of being like, well, Hey, wait a minute. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1842.52s)]
*  No, that's not actually the policy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1845.24s)]
*  We maintain this one China policy, but we allow them to kind of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1847.48s)]
*  do what they want to do. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1851.24s)]
*  And, you know, the, the most obvious example of this was when Joe Biden [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1852.56s)]
*  actually said like, Oh, we wouldn't allow that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1858.2s)]
*  And we would militarily intervene if they went into China. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1861.2s)]
*  And then, and this was so bizarre. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1863.92s)]
*  Then the White House, whoever that was, came out to correct the president of the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1865.96s)]
*  United States and say, no, the policy of the White House is the one China policy. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1872.48s)]
*  Which look, I mean, again, I think the whole point of this is that the reason [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1878.64s)]
*  why whoever the hell was able to overrule Joe Biden and his administration, I don't [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1883.48s)]
*  know who that is. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1888.2s)]
*  Um, but the whole point is that if you say, and this is why there is some wisdom [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1889.44s)]
*  in America, accepting the one China policy is that if you tell China that we recognize, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1895.48s)]
*  uh, Taiwan's independence and that they're not a part of China, that might be the type [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1902.92s)]
*  of thing that would make China invade and say, no, we're not accepting that. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1907.6s)]
*  And so at least right now it's like, kind of like, okay, here's the, look, this is [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1911.76s)]
*  the reality. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1915.88s)]
*  It's something that you kind of run up against with the war in Ukraine a lot. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1916.44s)]
*  And, and with the situation in China and Taiwan is that there are, um, there are [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1921.12s)]
*  constraints placed on us by reality. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1928.4s)]
*  It's not all just, how would you like the world to be? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1931.76s)]
*  How would you like it to work? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1934.24s)]
*  Obviously, I think we would all like that bigger countries don't invade smaller [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1935.28s)]
*  countries and bigger countries don't bully smaller countries around. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1938.92s)]
*  That is not the way of the world. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1942.16s)]
*  We are a big country that is the biggest bully in the world. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1943.88s)]
*  So we're in no position to let, but what we're kind of in the position is just [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1947.06s)]
*  like, you're like, Hey, we'd sure love if you don't do that, you know, you can do [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1950.98s)]
*  it and you can get away with it, but we would sure love it if you don't. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1955.26s)]
*  And so the goal would be to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1959.22s)]
*  When Vladimir Putin starts talking about like, Hey, if you keep pushing the idea [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1964.5s)]
*  of Ukraine, joining your military Alliance, I'm going to invade that country. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1968.46s)]
*  The goal there that, or the move there would be to be like, okay, we'll stop [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1972.46s)]
*  talking about that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1976.46s)]
*  Is there something else that we can agree on? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1977.26s)]
*  You know, like, is there, is there a way that you will promise you won't do [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1979.06s)]
*  anything to them and we'll promise we won't bring them in our military? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1983.06s)]
*  Like, that's the goal. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1986.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't just go like, no, fuck you. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1987.22s)]
*  We're doing it anyway, over and over and over again until they do the thing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1989.1799999999998s)]
*  I think we got to this discussion from the military industrial complex and [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1994.1399999999999s)]
*  military intervention and Ron Paul before that, if you can like rewind a little [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=1997.1s)]
*  bit, uh, is there any amount according to you and according to various flavors of [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2001.4199999999998s)]
*  libertarianism, is there any amount of military intervention that's justified? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2007.38s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2013.9s)]
*  Um, well, I would say, okay, so at least to me in, in terms of like pure [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2015.74s)]
*  libertarian theory, or just in terms of like what I think is right or wrong, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2023.8200000000002s)]
*  like there is such things as adjust war. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2027.8200000000002s)]
*  Um, the most obvious, uh, example of that would be like you're invaded by a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2030.0200000000002s)]
*  military and fighting them off. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2035.66s)]
*  Um, so in, in that sense also, like, even if you want to, if you want to kind of [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2037.38s)]
*  isolate from everything else, uh, from, you know, all of the awful U S policy [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2042.42s)]
*  toward Russia, post Soviet union to all of the, you know, NATO expansion and color [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2048.3s)]
*  coded revolutions and all of these things. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2053.82s)]
*  If you want to, you know, Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2056.58s)]
*  I do think the Ukrainians have a right to fight and, and protect their land. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2059.3s)]
*  Like there, the, there's an aggressive, there's an aggressor there and you have [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2063.94s)]
*  a right to defend yourself. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2067.5s)]
*  Uh, so certainly in that sense, I think, um, the American revolution was a just [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2068.82s)]
*  war, uh, I think there are, you know, there, there can be just wars in terms of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2073.38s)]
*  pure libertarian theory, I think. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2078.9s)]
*  I would say that, look, you, you don't, you never have a right to kill innocent [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2083.06s)]
*  people that's never morally okay. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2088.58s)]
*  Now there could be a scenario just like this is true in life in general, right? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2091.94s)]
*  Like there's lots of things that you don't have the right to do, but you could [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2096.1000000000004s)]
*  come up with some scenario where you might be in a position where you have to [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2100.02s)]
*  do it because there were all of these extenuating circumstances, you know, like [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2103.78s)]
*  for, you know, you could think of something where like, you remember the, uh, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2106.78s)]
*  the saw movies where they used to, you know, these crazy, like horror scenarios, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2110.1800000000003s)]
*  but it's like, um, okay, so there's a person, you know, uh, evil bad guy has [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2115.1000000000004s)]
*  buried a key inside this person and you have to kill that person in order to get [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2120.82s)]
*  the key in order to unlock these 20 people, to let them out of a cage. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2125.62s)]
*  Now, look, you still don't have a right to kill people. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2129.02s)]
*  It's horrible and wrong. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2131.94s)]
*  And what you did there was still evil. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2133.34s)]
*  But if you were taken to trial over it, you could probably explain to a judge [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2135.5s)]
*  and a jury be like, I know, but the situation I was in was either these 20 [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2139.94s)]
*  people were going to die or this one person was going to die. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2143.38s)]
*  And under that situation, I chose to save the 20. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2146.1s)]
*  So like, in other words, by perfect theory, no, you never have the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2149.14s)]
*  right to kill innocent people. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2153.22s)]
*  There could be a scenario where you were like, look, we had to take this military [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2155.26s)]
*  action and some innocent people did die. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2160.02s)]
*  And it's so tragic and awful that we had to do this, but we are certain that many [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2162.54s)]
*  more people would have died had we not done this. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2167.7s)]
*  Now, in that case, I would look at that as like, um, number one, it's much like [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2170.62s)]
*  killing the one person to save the 20. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2176.98s)]
*  It's still wrong. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2178.54s)]
*  It's still an immoral thing that you were forced into doing. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2179.74s)]
*  It's not justified. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2182.18s)]
*  I would say that the overwhelming onus should have to be on you to demonstrate [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2184.62s)]
*  that you absolutely needed to do that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2190.38s)]
*  And that's how I feel about all these, these wars. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2193.38s)]
*  You know, it's not like, um, you know, I think that like, let's just say, like, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2195.74s)]
*  if you could make world war two, like. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2200.22s)]
*  You could reduce it down to the simplest caricature of what world war two is. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2204.42s)]
*  And say there's no Joseph Stalin. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2207.98s)]
*  We're not even partnering with him. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2209.42s)]
*  Like there was a good guy in Russia who we were partnering with and there's, and, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2210.62s)]
*  and the British empire had never done anything wrong. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2213.98s)]
*  They were just nothing but good guys. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2216.06s)]
*  And of course, FDR was nothing but a good guy and Hitler was even worse than the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2217.3s)]
*  real Hitler, you know what I mean? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2220.46s)]
*  And in order to stop them, we had to go on this bombing campaign and we only got [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2221.78s)]
*  Nazis, we only killed the bad guys and we were able to take out the third Reich. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2227.3s)]
*  But one eight year old girl died. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2231.98s)]
*  And you did this thing that stopped the whole world from falling into subjugation. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2234.54s)]
*  So I think almost everybody would agree. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2237.98s)]
*  Jesus, man, you have to do that. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2241.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2243.7400000000002s)]
*  This is, um, you have to do that because the whole world is going to be subjugated. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2244.1800000000003s)]
*  There's nothing but good guys here. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2247.06s)]
*  The Nazis are so evil and there's one, I still would say that every single time [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2248.7400000000002s)]
*  world war two came up, we should all just be somber and we should all just think [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2253.94s)]
*  about that little eight year old girl who died and what a horrible thing it is [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2258.1s)]
*  that we had to do that, you know? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2261.42s)]
*  And so that like, when there are these campaigns where like, you know, like [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2262.94s)]
*  where tens of millions of people are killed, the fact that anybody's ever like [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2267.1000000000004s)]
*  spiking the football or this kind of like rah rah, we were the good ones. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2272.26s)]
*  And then also when you add in all those other complicated factors, like that [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2277.1800000000003s)]
*  this wasn't the scenario at all. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2279.98s)]
*  Um, but I do. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2281.9s)]
*  So, so I guess essentially I'd say, no, you don't ever, ever right to kill innocent [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2283.1800000000003s)]
*  people, it's never self-defense to be killing innocent people. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2287.9s)]
*  I mean, short of like, you know, some type of scenario where like, you know, if [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2291.34s)]
*  you're holding a baby and coming at me shooting and I shoot back at you and, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2295.58s)]
*  okay, I was acting in self-defense and it happened to kill a baby. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2299.02s)]
*  But I'm talking about like what the scenarios where you're dropping bombs on [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2301.7400000000002s)]
*  cities, um, it's never justified. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2305.5s)]
*  And the overwhelming onus should be on you to demonstrate that you [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2309.9s)]
*  absolutely have to do it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2313.46s)]
*  And that that should be the standard. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2315.1400000000003s)]
*  Cause there's so many other standards that I see thrown out that I just think [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2316.58s)]
*  are make no moral sense at all. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2319.58s)]
*  You know, people will argue about like, uh, in Gaza, they'll argue about, um, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2322.34s)]
*  the civilian to combatant ratio, which I like that to me doesn't really, that's [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2327.14s)]
*  not what counts. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2333.82s)]
*  That's not the measure that's important. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2334.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, and also no one knows what the numbers are. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2336.62s)]
*  They are all just kind of like pretend to, uh, and then the other thing will be, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2338.42s)]
*  um, that people who says someone just recently argued with me about, they'll [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2341.86s)]
*  say like, uh, well Hamas has to go. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2346.1s)]
*  That's the starting point. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2349.02s)]
*  Hamas has to go. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2350.1800000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I don't think you get to say that. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2351.6200000000003s)]
*  Cause the truth is that look, you can make an argument that Hamas has to go. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2353.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2357.9s)]
*  You can make an argument that the Likudniks have to go. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2358.7400000000002s)]
*  You can make an argument that Kim Jong-un has to go or that G has to go, or that [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2360.86s)]
*  Putin has to go, or that Zelensky has to go. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2364.38s)]
*  Or certainly I would make an argument that Joe Biden had to go, but just because [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2366.34s)]
*  the government has to go, that doesn't mean you could just go kill all their people. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2369.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2373.58s)]
*  That should not be the starting point. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2373.7000000000003s)]
*  Like the assumption, the axiom of the discussion. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2375.8599999999997s)]
*  The question is, is it, is there no other option than doing it this way? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2378.58s)]
*  It's like, okay, like October 7th happened. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2385.18s)]
*  We can all agree. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2387.2599999999998s)]
*  This was like a horrific tragedy. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2387.8999999999996s)]
*  Um, and, uh, you know, an indefensible act of terrorism. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2390.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2393.9399999999996s)]
*  Can, is it guaranteed that another one of those is going to happen tomorrow? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2395.66s)]
*  Or was this the biggest security failure in, in, you know, Israeli history? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2398.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2403.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, if it's the biggest security failure, let's just say, not even [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2403.7799999999997s)]
*  going down the inside job rabbit hole or anything like that, but just saying [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2406.58s)]
*  is a giant security failure. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2409.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2411.2599999999998s)]
*  Then put a bunch more men at that fence first of all. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2411.54s)]
*  And now you got to talk about how can you achieve your goal while [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2414.22s)]
*  inflicting the minimum amount of devastation on innocent people? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2417.7s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2422.8599999999997s)]
*  Let's just bring it up. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2424.1s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2425.18s)]
*  So what exactly do you think about the October 7th attack by Hamas on Israel? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2426.8999999999996s)]
*  Um, well, I mean, like what I just said, that it was, uh, horrible and, you know, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2432.58s)]
*  uh, it's always by the same logic that I'm giving you now, it's always, it's [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2437.18s)]
*  always evil to target innocent civilians. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2442.38s)]
*  I don't believe, uh, you know, civilians can be held responsible for the, uh, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2445.22s)]
*  the crimes of their government. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2449.46s)]
*  Um, this was by the way, the Osama bin Laden logic, which I think would also be [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2451.3s)]
*  the logic of like Bill Clinton or George W. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2455.78s)]
*  Bush or Barack Obama, but Osama bin Laden very explicitly said, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2458.18s)]
*  when he was asked like, well, are you just going to target like [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2461.8999999999996s)]
*  us military sites or are you targeting us civilians? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2465.3399999999997s)]
*  It was an interview in the nineties before nine 11. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2468.62s)]
*  Um, and he goes, no, civilians are fair game too, because you guys have [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2472.02s)]
*  regular elections and you guys vote for your government and therefore you're [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2476.3399999999997s)]
*  responsible for the crimes that they commit. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2480.22s)]
*  Now, I think that's the logic of a fanatic like Osama bin Laden. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2481.8999999999996s)]
*  And that's not the logic that any of us should follow. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2486.7799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2489.8199999999997s)]
*  And it's not true that people are responsible for the crimes of their government. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2491.66s)]
*  Um, I think that that same argument is used quite a bit by people on the pro [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2495.86s)]
*  Israeli side when they say like, oh, they, they had an election in 2005 and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2500.46s)]
*  Hamas won a plurality, therefore 20 years later, they have no rights. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2504.7s)]
*  I think that's insane. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2510.3s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2511.5s)]
*  So Hamas had no right to go after, um, civilians. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2512.1s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's horrible. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2516.42s)]
*  And you see, you know, the, um, these, you know, teenagers being killed and the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2518.34s)]
*  people, the, um, you know, you see the images of people, uh, who were, who are [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2524.02s)]
*  held hostage for all this time. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2527.94s)]
*  So it's like your heart breaks for those people. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2529.7400000000002s)]
*  It's truly tragic. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2532.02s)]
*  Um, I, I do think. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2533.5800000000004s)]
*  That it was in many ways. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2536.82s)]
*  An indictment of so many different things, you know, like October 7th happening [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2542.6200000000003s)]
*  was an indictment of, um, the entire occupation slash siege of, of Gaza and [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2547.98s)]
*  the West bank, you know, for that matter. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2555.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, it was, I think, um, should have probably forever destroyed the legacy [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2557.1400000000003s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu, um, who is, you know, I mean, this isn't like George W. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2564.98s)]
*  Bush, you know, was, I mean, he was on the job for almost a year when 9 11 happened, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2570.1400000000003s)]
*  but it was still kind of new. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2575.34s)]
*  You know, like it was still kind of in his first year of being president. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2577.3399999999997s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was the longest serving prime minister in Israeli history [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2580.7799999999997s)]
*  and had explicitly been like, I'm the tough right winger who's going to be [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2586.2999999999997s)]
*  tough on these Palestinians who's going to like move away from the idea of coming [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2590.2999999999997s)]
*  to a two state solution, because this is what we need to keep us safe. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2594.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the justification is like, I'm going to be hard on these motherfuckers [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2598.8199999999997s)]
*  because that's because I know what it takes to keep us safe. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2603.3s)]
*  And that culminates in the worst massacre in Israeli history. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2606.46s)]
*  Um, and then, I mean, the other big one is that, I mean, and it's not like a, I [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2612.5s)]
*  wouldn't even say an open secret at this point, it's just out in the open. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2617.2200000000003s)]
*  And he had this strategy of propping up Hamas for years. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2620.5800000000004s)]
*  And so he had this strategy of propping up Hamas, um, for a myriad of reasons. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2623.9s)]
*  Um, but a major part of it was that look, man, as long as there's terrorists in [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2630.06s)]
*  power there, there's never going to be any pressure on us to give the Palestinians [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2634.5800000000004s)]
*  a state because look, what are you telling me? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2638.1000000000004s)]
*  I got to negotiate with them. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2641.1800000000003s)]
*  He was allowing Qatar money to float, insisting that Qatar money float to them. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2642.6600000000003s)]
*  When the Qatar money dried up, sent the Mossad in to insist that it gets back to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2647.86s)]
*  them hundreds of millions of dollars, briefcases in cash. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  And he said in his own words that the reason for doing this was to keep to his [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2656.02s)]
*  words were prop up Hamas bolster Hamas to keep them in power so that the West [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2661.46s)]
*  bank and the, and the Gazans were divided and that the international community, as [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2667.3s)]
*  well as the liberal Jewish community in Israel, wouldn't be able to put pressure [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2672.2200000000003s)]
*  on them to make a deal. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2676.5s)]
*  But what are the options? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2677.86s)]
*  So if he doesn't allow the money in, it also looks really bad for him because if [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2679.1s)]
*  he's not allowing the money in, that means he's not allowing the quote unquote aid [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2685.38s)]
*  in to help the Palestinians. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2689.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2691.82s)]
*  But Lex, I mean, the, the dynamic here, right, is from 2007 to today, Israel's had [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2692.06s)]
*  a full blockade around the country. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2700.34s)]
*  They won't let potatoes in. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2703.1400000000003s)]
*  They won't let sugar in. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2705.6600000000003s)]
*  They won't, they, they, and the, the justification is because they're dual [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2707.46s)]
*  use, you know, they can be used to make rockets as well as they can be used to, you [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2712.98s)]
*  know, feed starving children. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2719.34s)]
*  So we can't let that in because it's dual use, but cash to Hamas, does that not have [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2721.6600000000003s)]
*  dual usage? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2730.94s)]
*  Like, is there, is there nothing else that they can, so yeah, it's like, yes, when [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2731.94s)]
*  you have a full blockade around the country, you take on certain responsibilities. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2735.34s)]
*  And I think this is, you know, this is the, the essence of really the, the whole [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2739.82s)]
*  struggle here, which is very tough, I think, for the pro Israel side to grapple with. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2743.7000000000003s)]
*  But the bottom line is that Israel hasn't occupied Palestine for like a few months [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2748.9s)]
*  after a war or even a couple of years after a war while they're figuring out what [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2754.02s)]
*  we're going to do with them. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2758.1800000000003s)]
*  It's been over 60 years. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2759.2200000000003s)]
*  The, the, we're talking about a one week long war or a day short of a week long war [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2760.9s)]
*  in 1967. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2765.9s)]
*  Israel's had control of them ever since. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2767.58s)]
*  And much like in the same way that like, if you kidnap someone and you lock them in [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2769.46s)]
*  your basement and you don't feed them, you murdered that person. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2774.34s)]
*  So in other words, uh, um, stated differently, you're not allowed to kidnap [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2778.78s)]
*  people and lock them in your basement. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2783.94s)]
*  But once you do, you take on a responsibility to feed those people. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2785.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2790.14s)]
*  Like you can't, you're not allowed to keep someone and not feed them. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2790.7400000000002s)]
*  That is a worse charge than just keeping them. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2793.38s)]
*  And so yet anyway, I guess my point is the solution to that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2796.18s)]
*  If, if you go like, well, I'm a bad guy. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2801.46s)]
*  If I fund a mass, I'm a bad guy. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2803.46s)]
*  If I don't let the aid in was to let the reputable international aid organizations [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2804.98s)]
*  bring aid in to the people of Gaza. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2810.1s)]
*  Don't have, uh, don't, don't pressure the Qataris to send in briefcases full of [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2812.58s)]
*  cash, allow internationally recognized reputable human rights organizations who [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2817.94s)]
*  are lining up, trying to do it, stop turning them away and let them in. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2823.7s)]
*  And, and, and this is just, it's so long past due. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2828.06s)]
*  I mean, like it's, it's just, I'm not like defending, uh, Arab terrorism. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2831.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a, I think it's really, it's, it's a tragedy that the Arabs embraced [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2836.9399999999996s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2841.54s)]
*  Uh, I don't think it's unique to them. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2842.5s)]
*  And in fact, you know, I think it was the, um, the Zionist militias who [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2844.7799999999997s)]
*  introduced terrorism to that part of the world. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2849.7s)]
*  But there was also like there, look, terrorism persists because it works. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2852.58s)]
*  And this is true with state terrorism and with non-state terrorism. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2857.34s)]
*  You know, it's like there, it, terrorism has often worked for people. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2860.5s)]
*  The, I think the thing like early, I think early Yasser Arafat, I know [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2864.58s)]
*  was very influenced by, um, the Algerians who, you know, successfully kicked the [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2869.62s)]
*  French out at embracing terrorism. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2875.86s)]
*  And it was almost like the major miscalculation of the, the, those Palestinian [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2879.22s)]
*  Arabs who did embrace terrorism was that this isn't the French. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2886.54s)]
*  This isn't the French hanging out in some colony with their home country back [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2891.7s)]
*  home, where maybe a few acts of violence could work enough to, you know, your, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2895.54s)]
*  the liberal population back home is like, Oh, I really didn't like the response [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2899.9799999999996s)]
*  to that terrorist. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2903.2999999999997s)]
*  We killed so many people. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2903.9799999999996s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2905.02s)]
*  This is too much of a headache. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2905.58s)]
*  Let's get out of here. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2906.58s)]
*  The Zionist settlers were there to stay. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2907.54s)]
*  They weren't going anywhere. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2909.82s)]
*  They weren't going back to Eastern Europe. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2911.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2913.54s)]
*  They weren't, they were just that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2914.14s)]
*  And so it's a tragedy that this whole thing went the way it did. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2915.38s)]
*  But you always, whenever you're talking about like a conflict like this, the [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2921.06s)]
*  person who has the, or the, the party who has the power is the one who needs [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2925.62s)]
*  to make concessions, you know, and the, it's just indefensible that the status [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2930.42s)]
*  quo of the Palestinian people having no rights, literally no rights being ruled [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2936.58s)]
*  by a government that they do not get to vote for or against, no right to do [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2942.46s)]
*  commerce with the outside world, no freedom of travel, no freedom of movement, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2947.46s)]
*  no basic property rights can be kicked out of your home at any time. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2950.9s)]
*  No right to a fair trial, no right to a lawyer, no right to a jury of your peers. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2954.1s)]
*  I mean, the fact that that has been the status quo since 1967 is just [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2959.06s)]
*  indefensible and if, and then in the context that that has been the status [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2965.7s)]
*  quo, I guess I'm just not, even though I'm against it, it's kind of like when [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2970.3799999999997s)]
*  you're just lecturing about the way in which they resist this, I think it's very [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  tough to be on a strong moral footing. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2981.62s)]
*  You know? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2984.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2985.8599999999997s)]
*  You have to, you have to really empathize with the decades of suffering in the [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2986.14s)]
*  region. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2991.1s)]
*  I suppose my question was grounded in how can the Israeli government, how can the [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2992.22s)]
*  world help the Palestinian people flourish? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=2996.54s)]
*  So you suggested allowing reputable aid organizations in, but you know, that's [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3000.7799999999997s)]
*  kind of almost a patching. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3010.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3013.42s)]
*  Just helping humans who are suffering, but that's not how you have a nation [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3013.66s)]
*  flourish. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3019.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to build up the infrastructure. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3020.2200000000003s)]
*  You have to build up a culture of the education system, the, the, you know, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3021.5s)]
*  democratic processes of electing and regular elections and so that the people [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3027.3s)]
*  are represented and you have to have foreign partnerships, friendships, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3032.54s)]
*  normalization of relations with the Arab world, with Israel, you can travel back [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3035.98s)]
*  and forth and lessen the choke hold. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3041.6600000000003s)]
*  Like the security choke hold, you know, that you could say is justified in a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3046.82s)]
*  militaristic situation, but why is it a military situation? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3051.98s)]
*  The question is there like, where do we go from, from here? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3057.34s)]
*  If we, you know, we'll talk about Netanyahu some more. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3061.42s)]
*  He is, you know, he's very criticized inside Israel as well. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3065.78s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3070.3s)]
*  Maybe less so after October 7th, because, you know, again, in the same way you can [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3071.14s)]
*  empathize with the Palestinian people, you can empathize with Israelis where [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3077.66s)]
*  October 7th touched just like it did for Americans with 9-11. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3083.02s)]
*  It touched some kind of primal thing of fear of like, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3086.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3091.34s)]
*  And like the same thing I said before, like I could also very easily go if my, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3091.7s)]
*  if one of my kids was like at that rave or something like that and just got [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3097.02s)]
*  gunned down or kidnapped by, I could understand being like level the whole [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3101.3s)]
*  goddamn place and I'm sure I would feel that way if that was one of my kids, you [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  know? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3108.82s)]
*  So yeah, no, that's, that's exactly right. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3109.9s)]
*  I mean, there's lots of examples in the world of, you know, like France and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3112.14s)]
*  Germany are right next to each other and Ireland and England are right next to [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3117.58s)]
*  each other and they're just totally living in harmony right now. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3121.66s)]
*  Like there is just no, the thought of them going to war is like inconceivable [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3124.46s)]
*  right now, not saying it could never happen in the future, but it seems, it [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3130.18s)]
*  seems pretty hard to imagine. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3133.14s)]
*  And that being the case would have been very hard to imagine for a very long [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3134.9s)]
*  time, you know, like there, I mean, there's some serious levels of brutality [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3140.26s)]
*  between those two societies and even more directly involved, you know, Egypt [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3144.3s)]
*  and Israel went to war four times in a couple of decades. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3150.18s)]
*  They went to war and then in the late seventies, they made a land for peace [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3155.18s)]
*  deal and they haven't been to war since, you know, and like, I do at least try to [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3158.7s)]
*  hold out that like, that is, you know, it's not like Egypt is, you're not going [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3164.42s)]
*  to say they don't have an issue with radical Islam in Egypt, you know what I [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3168.7s)]
*  mean? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3172.22s)]
*  Like that's, that's not the answer. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3172.46s)]
*  It's just that they made a land for peace deal and once there wasn't, you [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3174.14s)]
*  know, once that wasn't the, that was solved, it was kind of easier to avoid [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3178.14s)]
*  the war. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3182.2999999999997s)]
*  And I do like to think that there, there could be a solution to the, the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3182.66s)]
*  Israel Palestine question, but the, it's going to have to, it's going to have to [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3188.7s)]
*  involve Israel taking their boot off of the Palestinians neck. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3194.22s)]
*  And I know that that's scary. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3197.74s)]
*  And I understand that there are like legitimate concerns about that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3199.3399999999997s)]
*  There's, um, it was a great, uh, Thomas Jefferson quote about slavery, which [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3202.54s)]
*  was, um, we, we have the wolf by the tail and we can neither afford to hold on to [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3208.54s)]
*  him nor risk letting them go. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3215.14s)]
*  Um, which is like, you could see where that would have been like a real concern [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3217.46s)]
*  of people like right toward the end of slavery or, or, you know, whatever in the [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3221.66s)]
*  early 1800s, say the first half of the 19th century, where you'd be like, okay, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3227.26s)]
*  okay, okay, we recognize this is wrong now, but we've had these millions of [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3231.38s)]
*  people enslaved for all these years. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3236.5s)]
*  If we let them go, they're going to fucking kill us. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3238.06s)]
*  And what are you saying? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3240.5s)]
*  They're citizens now, meaning the second amendment applies to them, meaning that [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3241.2200000000003s)]
*  the guy who I enslaved now can get a gun. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3244.86s)]
*  You know what? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3248.7000000000003s)]
*  And, and so, okay, there are these, but I think in hindsight, looking back at it, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3249.34s)]
*  we would all just go, yeah, but you can't enslave people. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3252.42s)]
*  So like whatever risks come with the next phase of this, unfortunately, you know, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3257.02s)]
*  like you're going to have to just deal with that and, and move. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3262.34s)]
*  You have to start with abolishing slavery. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3266.7400000000002s)]
*  And it is good to also remember in the hopeful message you send, like at any day [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3269.6600000000003s)]
*  you can make a deal, right? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3274.94s)]
*  That's one of the frustrating things I had with a, I hosted a debate on Israel [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3276.7000000000003s)]
*  and I was like, it just felt hopeless. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3280.34s)]
*  And a lot of people I talked to, it feels hopeless, but like I have a lot of, I [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3282.6200000000003s)]
*  I maybe naively see a lot of possibilities of peace there. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3287.1400000000003s)]
*  I see, for example, normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3290.42s)]
*  And then Saudi Arabia taking some ownership over Gaza, something like that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3294.02s)]
*  Some interesting, uh, where a big major player in that region takes ownership [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3297.78s)]
*  and steps as the middleman. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3306.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3308.06s)]
*  I like, I agree with you and you're 100% right that, and even before October [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3308.42s)]
*  7th, I think many steps had been taken away from, you know, the peace process [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3312.54s)]
*  and the feeling of that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3317.14s)]
*  I mean, really, I think since the second Intifada, uh, is when like the, the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3317.74s)]
*  appetite for peace, I think in Israel was greatly diminished, um, there, but to [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3321.82s)]
*  your point, I mean, it's going to take really painful concessions on all sides [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3327.7s)]
*  in, in order to get there. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3336.74s)]
*  Um, and I think that the, the personally, I think, and I don't know if I say this [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3338.26s)]
*  for the, not necessarily like the Arab world, um, but at least the nation states, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3344.7400000000002s)]
*  like their, their governments, I think are, are pretty much there. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3351.5s)]
*  Like, like Saudi Arabia and UAE and Jordan and Egypt, like if the Israelis, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3355.86s)]
*  they're almost like, look, these are American sock puppets, you know, for [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3362.3s)]
*  the most part, right? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3366.06s)]
*  And so their, their thing is that like, okay, 100% of my population is completely [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3367.38s)]
*  opposed to what Israel is doing to Palestine right now. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3375.38s)]
*  And they just hate that Israel, that the nation was created at all, that all the, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3377.86s)]
*  the Arabs were kicked out of what is, you know, very important land to them [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3381.58s)]
*  religiously and, um, and so the governments there are like, look, we want [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3385.9s)]
*  to continue to have us tax dollars flooding in here and we'd love to make a [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3390.3399999999997s)]
*  deal with Israel, but like, you gotta stop doing this to the Palestinians. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3396.18s)]
*  So my own people don't, you know, rise up against me. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3399.46s)]
*  So I think as long as the Israelis were like, fine, we'll do a two state [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3403.22s)]
*  solution or something like that. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3405.98s)]
*  I think Saudi Arabia couldn't wait to broker. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3407.06s)]
*  In fact, they proposed a two state solution just a few years ago. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3409.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, they're, they would love to be a part of that normalized relations. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3413.1s)]
*  Um, amongst the Palestinians. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3417.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, which again, I think this, I think this had been accepted multiple [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3421.66s)]
*  times, at least by their leadership. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3425.86s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you're going to have to accept that like you lost in 48. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3427.6600000000003s)]
*  You're going to have to accept that you lost in 47. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3431.38s)]
*  You're gonna have to accept that the state of Israel does exist. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3433.7000000000003s)]
*  And you're going to have to accept that like the right of return is not going [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3436.02s)]
*  to literally mean that everybody can go back to where they were. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3438.94s)]
*  And what Israel's going to have to concede is that it was awfully fucked up [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3445.1s)]
*  that they kicked a lot of people out of their land and that the whole, um, a [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3450.1s)]
*  land for people for people without land was never true. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3454.5s)]
*  That was just a slogan that made that felt good to avoid what you guys actually [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3457.86s)]
*  did and the fact that it was inexcusable that you guys occupied these people for [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3461.62s)]
*  60 years and that has to end immediately. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3465.86s)]
*  I interviewed Douglas Murray recently. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3469.62s)]
*  He just wrote a book on Israel and Hamas called on democracies and death cults. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3472.46s)]
*  He makes what I think is a strong pro-Israel case, focusing on Hamas as a, an [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3477.06s)]
*  evil organization, you know, evil for its corrupt leadership, who's essentially [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3482.74s)]
*  stealing money, uh, from the Palestinian people and allocating the money that is [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3487.7799999999997s)]
*  there towards terrorists, militaristic operations versus like building up, uh, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3492.8199999999997s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3498.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh, can you still man the case for and then against this perspective sort of [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3499.7799999999997s)]
*  centering we've been talking about the people about, uh, centering around Hamas, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3504.14s)]
*  which is like this extremist religious organization, uh, the perspective being [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3511.18s)]
*  like they need to be, as you mentioned before, eliminated before any progress [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3516.94s)]
*  can be made. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3520.94s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3522.06s)]
*  So if I were, so a steel man, Douglas Murray's case, um, I would say, well, I [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3522.7400000000002s)]
*  guess the case is right. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3530.58s)]
*  Look, Hamas is a fanatical death cult, essentially, which I do think is a fair, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3531.66s)]
*  uh, description of them. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3539.2599999999998s)]
*  There is no question that they have pursued. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3541.54s)]
*  They have, they have pursued a path that was just devastating to their own people. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3545.74s)]
*  And there's no question they have not spent the resources they have on their [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3553.06s)]
*  priority has not been uplifting their own people. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3558.38s)]
*  Their priority has been, I think, essentially antagonizing Israel into this [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3560.98s)]
*  overreaction so that they can turn world opinion against Israel. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3566.78s)]
*  I think they've been very effective at doing that. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3570.42s)]
*  Um, and, and okay. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3573.1400000000003s)]
*  Again, I think the argument would come back to something like, and the people [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3576.5s)]
*  kind of voted for this in 2005 and the people sure do, we sure do see a lot of [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3578.98s)]
*  people cheering when Hamas is doing some pretty horrific stuff. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3583.2200000000003s)]
*  And so, Hey, you got that on one side and you have a kind of, uh, a country [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3587.38s)]
*  that's much more similar to Western societies on the other side. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3593.1800000000003s)]
*  If we can just like linger on that steel, man, what do you, what do you make [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3596.66s)]
*  of the celebrations in, in, uh, Gaza after October 7th? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3599.54s)]
*  I think it's sickening and incredibly disturbing. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3604.1s)]
*  Um, I just, I guess the way I look at it, I always, and maybe there is a degree [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3607.98s)]
*  of like naivete to this, or perhaps it's just that I just don't want to allow [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3613.8199999999997s)]
*  myself to go down a certain path because I think it leads to such dark outcomes. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3618.8599999999997s)]
*  But I just always, I always try to be kind of like against the government for the [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3624.6200000000003s)]
*  people against the powerful sympathetic to the powerless. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3629.86s)]
*  Um, I think that. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3633.98s)]
*  Look, it's, it's sickening. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3636.02s)]
*  You see big crowds cheering on, you know, people who have been, you know, that [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3637.38s)]
*  with these people who have been in captivity for, for, uh, I think some of [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3641.1000000000004s)]
*  them for over a year and a half. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3645.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, I also thought when Nikki Haley and other Israeli politicians are [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3647.9s)]
*  signing the bombs before they're launched into Gaza, I found that sickening. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3654.28s)]
*  Um, I think there's all types, I think like mission accomplished [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3658.28s)]
*  banners and flying on jet. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3661.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think all of the, I think having Bob Hope specials at the end of [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3663.44s)]
*  the Persian Gulf war was sickening. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3667.28s)]
*  I just think all of it is like. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3669.32s)]
*  Horrific. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3671.36s)]
*  Um, I just, I look at it and I try to say to myself, okay, we had one 9 11 in this [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3672.44s)]
*  country and we all like collectively, we lost our minds as a society, you know? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3679.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, we were ready to go bomb whoever the hell our politicians told us to bomb. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3685.3599999999997s)]
*  And we didn't care how many people it killed. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3688.9199999999996s)]
*  And we killed a lot more than, than a lot more than Israel or [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3690.7999999999997s)]
*  Hamas has killed doing it. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3694.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, and. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3696.9599999999996s)]
*  Try to, I try to think to myself, okay, imagine being trapped in what is it? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3700.68s)]
*  You know, people would call it whatever they want to. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3705.3999999999996s)]
*  I do think Papua can and that these guys were right to call it a concentration [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3707.96s)]
*  camp, but you're trapped in a five mile by 25 mile area where you cannot leave. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3711.08s)]
*  You are stuck there. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3718.68s)]
*  You don't have an airport because the Israelis bombed it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3720.0s)]
*  You don't have a seaport because they won't allow you. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3722.44s)]
*  You have no access to trade with the outside world and you're not suffering [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3724.6s)]
*  through a 9 11, you're suffering through a thousand nine 11s your whole life is [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3727.76s)]
*  better. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3733.7200000000003s)]
*  The, these are people, the, the people in Gaza are their entire life has been [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3733.92s)]
*  being refugees. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3739.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3739.92s)]
*  Their entire life, there's generations of people have been in this status now. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3740.44s)]
*  And so, you know, if my society lost its mind after one nine 11, I just have a [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3745.6800000000003s)]
*  tough time like judging the people who, who came up in this environment, but [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3750.92s)]
*  there's no question it is. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3756.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, profoundly disturbing, but I wonder how much of the [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3757.32s)]
*  indoctrination is really made the software of their mind permanently anti [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3762.08s)]
*  peace, like extremify them and that, you know, it doesn't justify anything, but [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3773.2799999999997s)]
*  it's more concerning for the prospects of peace. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3781.08s)]
*  Well, I'd say I get your point. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3784.16s)]
*  I get, it's an interesting question that I don't, I don't know if any of us know [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3785.56s)]
*  exactly the answer to, but I would say that like, um, you know, even after was [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3788.56s)]
*  80 years of the Soviet union, you know, it's like, and there were real debates [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3796.12s)]
*  back then about like the new communist man and whether the minds had been so [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3800.8s)]
*  warped of people that they would never even want, they would never even care [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3806.16s)]
*  about these things like Liberty or national identity or independence. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3809.08s)]
*  And, and then yet at the end, it was all still there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3813.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, it was, it was very repressed and it went underground and people [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3816.2799999999997s)]
*  weren't allowed to talk about it, but they all still had it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3819.64s)]
*  Um, and in fact, I was just listening the other day to this Murray Rothbard, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3822.68s)]
*  uh, speech from like the early nineties. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3826.6s)]
*  And he was talking about how there was something where there was like a, like a [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3829.8399999999997s)]
*  camera crew interviewed, like a Chinese family under, uh, um, like a real deal [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3833.6s)]
*  Chinese communism, um, I believe it was before Mao Zedong died and they were [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3839.8399999999997s)]
*  like, uh, they were just saying all these crazy shit to the camera. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3845.44s)]
*  Like they were like, would you rather, you know, your, your sons are like [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3848.48s)]
*  healthy and live good lives or would you rather they suffer, but be loyal [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3853.08s)]
*  obedience to the state? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3856.36s)]
*  And they were like, we would rather they be obedient to the state and blah, blah, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3857.48s)]
*  blah, and all these things. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3860.04s)]
*  And the Murray Rothbard was saying he saw this interview and he, uh, he, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3860.92s)]
*  he was talking to his friend. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3865.56s)]
*  He was like, Oh my God, this is horrible. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3866.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's hopeless. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3868.2400000000002s)]
*  These people's minds have been warped. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3869.12s)]
*  And then he was talking to his friend. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3870.8s)]
*  He was like a China expert who had been there a lot. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3871.96s)]
*  And he was like, no, they're not. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3874.0s)]
*  That's what they say when the cameras are around, soon as the cameras go, like [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3875.28s)]
*  they're so anyway, I'm just making the point there that like, there, there is [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3878.52s)]
*  like, look, even in the situation with Israel and Gaza, specifically Gaza, not [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3882.1600000000003s)]
*  even the West bank, um, when you could look at it, when the peace talks were [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3887.76s)]
*  going on, support for Hamas plummeted. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3892.28s)]
*  When the peace talks fell apart, support for Hamas went way back up, you know, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3895.28s)]
*  at every time there's an aggressive military campaign, support for Hamas [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3899.76s)]
*  goes back up. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3903.4s)]
*  So I just think that like, I'm more hopeful than not that like you could get [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3904.12s)]
*  to a place where like, but it requires, like you have to, like, if you do [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3910.12s)]
*  understand the Ron Paul point about blowback, the general McChrystal point [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3914.7999999999997s)]
*  about insurgent math, that you just realize that it's like, you're, you're [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3920.0s)]
*  like, you're, you're fighting in a way that produces more of the thing that [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3923.8399999999997s)]
*  you're fighting. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3930.16s)]
*  And so the first step is to stop doing that. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3931.1200000000003s)]
*  Like your cure is making the patient more sick. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3933.96s)]
*  So stop doing that. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3937.2000000000003s)]
*  And then let's see if maybe we could heal. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3938.52s)]
*  What about the case against the, the, the Douglas Murray case of the death [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3941.2400000000002s)]
*  cults and that a fundamental part of this process Hamas needs to be eliminated? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3945.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I would just say that, and I'm not, I'm not saying [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3950.6400000000003s)]
*  this as a fan of democracy. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3955.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, I'm not like a big believer in democracy. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3957.36s)]
*  I believe in liberty and I think, uh, democracy is often, um, uh, not [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3960.44s)]
*  in line with liberty. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3967.1200000000003s)]
*  The Chinese government paid you to say that as well. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3968.6400000000003s)]
*  That was all I had to get out. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3971.04s)]
*  I get to say that what I want the rest of the body, but there's just that I had [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3974.32s)]
*  that, no, I'm well, I don't, well, no, I mean, my beef with the Chinese [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3977.0s)]
*  government would not be that they don't hold regular elections. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3980.1600000000003s)]
*  My beef with them would be that they silent speech, that they, that they [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3982.56s)]
*  people in camps and things like that, the surveillance, that stuff. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3986.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, I think. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3989.0800000000004s)]
*  Look, when you call Israel a democracy, which I guess is right in the title of [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3991.6400000000003s)]
*  his book, um, and I, you know, full disclosure, I haven't read the book, but [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=3997.76s)]
*  I have, I have listened to some of his thoughts on this stuff. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4001.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you've run up against a real problem, which is that the creation of [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4005.28s)]
*  the state of Israel, even though he tried to walk away from those comments, as [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4010.1200000000003s)]
*  Norm Finkelstein called out Benny Morris, uh, for writing in his book, 1948, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4013.84s)]
*  which is a great book. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4018.5600000000004s)]
*  His words were design his project always knew it was going to involve transfer. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4020.0s)]
*  That was Benny Morris's words. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4025.0s)]
*  Now, when, when Finkelstein was grilling him on this, on your podcast, he kind of [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4027.0s)]
*  said like, yeah, but that doesn't mean ethnic cleansing that could be voluntary [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4031.2000000000003s)]
*  transfer that, you know what I mean? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4034.0s)]
*  Like, but the point is the Zionist settlers and they all, they spoke about [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4035.36s)]
*  this openly, they all knew they had a major problem, which is like, well, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4040.0s)]
*  you can't create a Jewish state if it's like 50 50, which is, and in all of [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4043.76s)]
*  Israel, it was much less than 50 50, but even in like the, the Israeli portion [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4049.0400000000004s)]
*  of the partition recommendation, it was very close to 50 50. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4054.5200000000004s)]
*  Now you can't really have a Jewish state with a 50 50 voter base because now [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4057.96s)]
*  you're just kind of in a breeding war for the next generation and, or, you know, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4063.1600000000003s)]
*  like, or like who, who turns out the vote any more than we could hope it, it [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4066.2000000000003s)]
*  would be the prospect right now of making America in official Republican [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4070.44s)]
*  state or an official Democrat state. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4076.44s)]
*  Well, how are you going to do that, man? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4078.96s)]
*  It's like 50 50 between the two. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4080.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I think what Benny Morris was saying was that they always knew some of [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4082.6s)]
*  these Arabs are going to have to get moved out of here so that we could have [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4087.08s)]
*  more of something, which ultimately where they got to like an 80 20, which is [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4090.36s)]
*  pretty much what Israel's maintained the whole time. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4093.6s)]
*  Now, Benny Morris could quarrel about whether that necessarily meant [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4097.04s)]
*  voluntary, but when it happened, it wasn't voluntary. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4099.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4102.04s)]
*  So like when it actually happened in effect, it involved a massive amount, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4102.52s)]
*  something somewhere between 700 and 800,000 Arabs being forcefully [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4106.4400000000005s)]
*  evicted out of this area. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4110.36s)]
*  Now that's one thing, you know, a lot of nations are started on some things like [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4112.04s)]
*  that. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4116.16s)]
*  I suppose if you just did that and then you were left with your 80 20 split and [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4116.4s)]
*  you go, but we have elections from here on out, I guess you could claim it's a [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4120.4s)]
*  democracy still seems like kind of gaming the democratic system a little bit. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4123.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4127.52s)]
*  Like, like if I just, if I just deported 80% of Democrats and then say, look, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4128.24s)]
*  Republicans win every election. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4132.599999999999s)]
*  You might be like, yeah, dude, but you didn't exactly get there [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4134.12s)]
*  democratically. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4136.36s)]
*  You got there through force, but forget that. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4137.24s)]
*  I'll let that one go and just say, I'll call you a democracy. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4139.599999999999s)]
*  If you just kept being a democracy like that moving forward, the real problem is [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4143.24s)]
*  the occupation that starts in 1967 because what, look, when you've occupied [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4147.4s)]
*  an area since 1967, you can't even really call it an occupation anymore. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4152.76s)]
*  It's an annexation. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4160.360000000001s)]
*  You know, you took these lands, you have control that you are what the definition [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4161.84s)]
*  of the government is, and you could call Hamas the government all you want to, but [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4166.4400000000005s)]
*  they're not the sovereigns. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4170.68s)]
*  They're not the final decision makers. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4172.240000000001s)]
*  Israel's the final decision maker. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4174.08s)]
*  Hamas does not meaningfully in any way, decide the biggest questions about God's. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4175.76s)]
*  I'm talking before this war, not, not even, you know, pre October 7th. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4180.4s)]
*  And so the problem Israel has in order to call themselves a democracy is that [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4184.16s)]
*  there's somewhere between five and 6 million people less now, cause they've [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4189.28s)]
*  killed a lot of them, but there's somewhere between five and 6 million people who [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4194.5199999999995s)]
*  live under Israeli control, who do not have voting rights. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4198.719999999999s)]
*  And I just, by any other like reasonable, commonly held standard of democracy, we [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4203.839999999999s)]
*  would not call that a democracy. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4210.16s)]
*  I mean, like I'm not, again, I'm not even saying this to try to be inflammatory [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4212.12s)]
*  or try to pick on the Israelis. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4215.24s)]
*  There's things about Israeli society. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4216.84s)]
*  I like, I don't hate the people there. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4218.28s)]
*  I'm Jewish. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4220.08s)]
*  I love Jewish people. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4220.72s)]
*  It's not, but the fact is that that's not a democracy. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4221.76s)]
*  That's an apartheid state. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4226.88s)]
*  Like, and that's just, I'm not even trying to be inflammatory. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4228.36s)]
*  When I say this, it's just literally describing what's in front of you. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4230.96s)]
*  If we in America right now said black people no longer get to vote and black [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4233.76s)]
*  people can only live in these few neighborhoods, we don't get to call [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4239.08s)]
*  ourselves a democracy anymore then. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4242.8s)]
*  You know, and like, I'm not even coming at this from a pro democracy point of view. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4244.76s)]
*  I'm just saying like, if your defense of them is like, well, we're a democracy, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4247.92s)]
*  which seems to be the case so much. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4251.36s)]
*  Well, no, you're really not. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4253.16s)]
*  You're, you're really not. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4255.0s)]
*  As long as you got millions of people who have no say in their own government, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4256.04s)]
*  like then, then you're really not a democracy. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4259.4s)]
*  And so again, so you could frame it as democracy versus death cult was [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4262.28s)]
*  his language for Hamas. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4266.96s)]
*  And it's like, all right. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4269.28s)]
*  You know, it's a little bit difficult to accuse another group of being a death [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4270.48s)]
*  cult when the group you're supporting has killed so many more people than them. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4274.5599999999995s)]
*  Now I'm not saying that's the only metric. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4279.8s)]
*  Like there's other things that are factors too, but the fact is that like [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4281.2s)]
*  you have, I mean, I don't know to look over the numbers for the whole [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4285.28s)]
*  history of the conflict, but the amount killed by the Israelis on the [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4289.72s)]
*  Palestinian side versus the amount killed by the Palestinians, 20 to one [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4293.2s)]
*  Israel's faith, you know, killing more people, maybe more than that. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4298.0s)]
*  I don't exactly, you know, I'd have to look at the numbers, but Israel's [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4301.96s)]
*  called far, far, far more Palestinians than Palestinians have ever killed [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4304.32s)]
*  Israelis. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4307.84s)]
*  And so it just, it rings a little hollow to me to just call them a death cult. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4308.5199999999995s)]
*  Like we're the democracy, even though none of, you know, there's millions of [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4313.24s)]
*  people who can't vote over, you know, who rules them, but they're the death cult. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4316.32s)]
*  I mean, look, they kill people in a more primitive, barbaric way, I guess you [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4321.12s)]
*  could say, you know, there's something a little bit cleaner about like, you [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4325.24s)]
*  know, when it's done by a government and it's collateral damage and it was done [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4329.04s)]
*  with sophisticated weaponry, you know, okay, still innocent people on the end [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4334.32s)]
*  of those bombs. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4339.599999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4340.4s)]
*  But there, there is, I think a powerful ethical difference when you mentioned [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4340.88s)]
*  about the eight year old girl, right? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4346.96s)]
*  If you're in your stated goals of the war is to do everything you can to avoid [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4349.8s)]
*  the death of that girl versus saying, you know, we love death more than we love [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4354.48s)]
*  life and Israelis democracy or not are pro life for life. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4360.44s)]
*  There's a little, I mean, okay. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4366.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't, I don't want a hundred percent disagree with you, but I think if I would [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4367.959999999999s)]
*  say like the degree to which that matters, you know, like at a murder trial [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4372.839999999999s)]
*  after somebody has been convicted and before sentencing, sometimes the judge [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4378.08s)]
*  will allow them to give a statement. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4383.08s)]
*  And like, if their statement is like, I'm very sorry for what I did. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4385.08s)]
*  And I'm so sorry to the family and this or that, or that like that might be like [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4388.12s)]
*  life without parole rather than the death penalty. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4392.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4395.48s)]
*  Like it might make that bit of difference in that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4396.04s)]
*  And if you get up there and you're like, Hey, I'm happy for what I did. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4398.36s)]
*  Screw the family blow that that might make a judge who was going to give you [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4401.12s)]
*  life with that parole, give you the death penalty or something like it's like that [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4404.6s)]
*  type of margin around the edge. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4407.56s)]
*  Let's say like, you're a really bad guy and I want to kill you and you're at [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4409.32s)]
*  home with a bunch of women and children. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4414.96s)]
*  And I know there's women and children there. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4417.72s)]
*  Like, I know for a fact that if I blow up this building, it's [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4420.08s)]
*  gonna kill all those babies. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4423.48s)]
*  But you know, what I, what I would be charged with is murder in the first [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4425.24s)]
*  degree and the fact that I went in there and said like, well, listen, hold on. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4430.28s)]
*  It's a shame that I had to kill those babies. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4434.96s)]
*  I really just wanted to kill that one guy. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4437.68s)]
*  I wish the babies weren't there. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4439.4s)]
*  And they'll be like, yeah, but you knew they were there and you did it anyway. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4441.12s)]
*  You get murder in the first degree. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4444.48s)]
*  Maybe it would make some little difference tinkering around with the [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4446.28s)]
*  sentencing at the end of it, but it doesn't like in kind change what the crime is there. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4449.36s)]
*  And so I just think at a certain point when you're, if you're doing something [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4455.04s)]
*  like, you know, look, I'll say maybe with a little bit of an edge, you know, let's [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4460.72s)]
*  say Barack Obama wants to drone bomb, you know, this place to kill a terrorist. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4464.44s)]
*  And he thinks he can do it without killing any innocent civilians does it. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4468.879999999999s)]
*  And then it ends up killing some innocent civilians. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  That's one thing, but once you've done it over and over and over again, and [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4474.759999999999s)]
*  every single time it kills innocent civilians, and then there's a wedding and [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4478.679999999999s)]
*  you order a drone bomb strike on a wedding, like, no, you murdered those people. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4482.599999999999s)]
*  That's murder in the first degree. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4487.36s)]
*  Like I just don't. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4489.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, yes, like, you know, like whether you say out loud, oh, it sure is a shame [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4490.5199999999995s)]
*  that we got to kill all these kids when you're doing it over and over and you [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4497.36s)]
*  know, the action you're taking is going to kill more kids. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4501.04s)]
*  I just don't think it like it's yeah, it's a little bit different, but really not [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4504.599999999999s)]
*  that much, it's still pretty much. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4508.36s)]
*  And then also when you mix in with that, the fact that like, you know, I mean, if [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4510.32s)]
*  you go and I'm not taking an opinion on the word genocide, I don't even like to [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4514.08s)]
*  get into that conversation. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4517.4s)]
*  I feel like it just derails it anyway. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4518.76s)]
*  What Israel's doing, whether you think it's a genocide or not, it's certainly [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4521.08s)]
*  not what most people envision when they hear the word genocide. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4523.8s)]
*  Um, but. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4527.16s)]
*  You know, if you could look at South Africa's case that they promoted at the [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4529.280000000001s)]
*  international court of justice, the whole thing is just quotes from Israeli leaders. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4532.320000000001s)]
*  And so, and I'm just saying like, by the way, it's not like they're always saying, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4536.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, it sure is a shame that we had to kill that eight year old girl. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4540.280000000001s)]
*  They're like half the time they say that when they're talking to the international [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4542.92s)]
*  community and then the other half of the time they seem to basically be saying [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4545.96s)]
*  there's no such thing as an innocent eight year old girl. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4549.28s)]
*  And so I just, I guess I just don't find that argument to be very compelling, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4551.6s)]
*  especially when the thing has been going on for so long. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4555.44s)]
*  There is some disagreement I have with you there. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4558.88s)]
*  I think the thing you're implying is when, whenever they state it, it's not. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4562.28s)]
*  Quite genuine to some degree. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4567.88s)]
*  Not just say it might be, it might be genuine by some people. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4569.28s)]
*  I'm not saying it's necessarily not. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4572.12s)]
*  I'm saying that when there's a lot of people who are saying the opposite, it [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4573.599999999999s)]
*  doesn't seem like it's consistently genuine from, from the entire, you know, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4577.5599999999995s)]
*  Israeli leadership class and that even if it is genuine, when some people say it, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4582.28s)]
*  that that's, that's kind of not enough to get away from the fact that it's, you [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4587.44s)]
*  know, when, when Tucker was on, um, Pierce Morgan, he said the thing, he goes, you [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4592.639999999999s)]
*  know, I don't like my tax dollars being used to intentionally kill children. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4596.599999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people really objected to that word intentionally. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4599.959999999999s)]
*  Because I think so many of the defenders of Israel fall behind this, like, no, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4603.639999999999s)]
*  no, no, that's not intentional. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4606.919999999999s)]
*  We're just trying to kill Hamas. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4608.5199999999995s)]
*  But again, like I said, we would never accept that standard in like a domestic [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4609.919999999999s)]
*  murder case. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4614.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like, no, like the, the thing is that if you know, there are kids there and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4615.719999999999s)]
*  you know, they're going to die, then that's intent. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4620.679999999999s)]
*  I think I agree with you fundamentally because war is hell and that's why I'm [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4623.639999999999s)]
*  against war, but there is a difference. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4628.919999999999s)]
*  So like, I think you're, we're like mixing in a lot of things. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4632.8s)]
*  I think you're fundamentally against war and that's why to you, it really [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4637.4s)]
*  doesn't, it doesn't matter. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4641.72s)]
*  It is murder. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4643.68s)]
*  It's just murder and we shouldn't do murder. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4645.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of democracies with colorful flags and that justify murder [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4647.48s)]
*  because they're trying very hard not to kill civilians. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4655.4s)]
*  And then when you say you look at the reality of the Obama administration, the [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4658.16s)]
*  entirety of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, you're, you're, you're [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4662.48s)]
*  murdering civilians. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4665.84s)]
*  Yes, you're trying to kill bad guys, but you're murdering civilians. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4667.12s)]
*  That said on, on a ethical consideration on which kind of ideals, ideologies you [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4671.0s)]
*  can build a society after the war. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4678.24s)]
*  One that even on the surface levels states that the value of every life, of [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4682.2s)]
*  every civilian life is equal and high in value. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4689.04s)]
*  That's a good society. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4693.0s)]
*  That's the concern with extremist ideology that, uh, that basically is very [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4694.4s)]
*  difficult to build a flourishing society on, but then the argument against that [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4700.96s)]
*  is the one you said, which is like, yeah, well Hamas is really supported now [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4706.4s)]
*  because of the war. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4710.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4713.040000000001s)]
*  But by the way, I don't disagree with the first part of your statement there. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4713.76s)]
*  I just don't think it's in conflict with what I'm stating. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4716.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, look, I understand first of all, that like, um, there is a difference [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4718.72s)]
*  between the way you're going to say, prosecute crime domestically within your [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4724.52s)]
*  own country and the way you can prosecute crime or what a war between two [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4728.68s)]
*  different countries, right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4735.0s)]
*  Like maybe it's, it's not exactly the same. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4736.080000000001s)]
*  You don't have cops that you can just send in. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4738.160000000001s)]
*  You can't arrest somebody and put them on trial. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4740.0s)]
*  It's not the same. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4742.16s)]
*  So like, fine. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4742.96s)]
*  You could say, but the point I'm making is more like, I'm just saying how we [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4743.6s)]
*  would think about these things in a domestic setting, we're talking about [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4747.88s)]
*  like morality here and morality by its very nature is something that rises [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4752.16s)]
*  above, you know, the, um, it rises above logistics, it rises above like [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4756.68s)]
*  nationalities or governments or borders or any of those things, like what's [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4762.52s)]
*  right or wrong. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4766.84s)]
*  Like if it's, if it's wrong to rape somebody in New Jersey, it's also wrong [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4767.88s)]
*  to rape somebody in central Africa. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4772.4800000000005s)]
*  Like it does. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4774.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I'm just saying you're committing the same act that we would consider [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4775.12s)]
*  murder in the first degree here. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4778.8s)]
*  And then just to go one step further, I think particularly like part of the [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4780.64s)]
*  reasons why people have different attitudes about the way two nations fight. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4786.56s)]
*  Like what, what we think of as war versus what we think as, as like, say like a [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4791.56s)]
*  policing issue, like we would never accept the idea that like, you know, if, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4795.28s)]
*  um, if, if whatever the same, the logic that's used in wars used in world war [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4800.8s)]
*  two, even used in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially used in the war in Gaza. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4806.44s)]
*  If, if, you know, if there was a bad guy, even a guy who had done something like [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4810.96s)]
*  October 7th, you know, at which we have school shooters and things like that [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4814.32s)]
*  here, you know, if there was an active duty school shooter and he's in a school [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4817.5199999999995s)]
*  shooting people and we know he's already killed like 25 people, blow up the school. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4821.5599999999995s)]
*  He's, Hey, he's using them as human shields. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4825.28s)]
*  No, it's not our fault. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4827.4800000000005s)]
*  You see, listen, those deaths, those deaths, Lex, while tragic were the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4828.76s)]
*  school shooters fault because he used all these people as human shields. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4832.72s)]
*  We would never, for a goddamn second, if those were our kids in there, we'd [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4836.0s)]
*  never accept that excuse by what? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4839.68s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was bad. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4842.04s)]
*  You still had an obligation to do something else that was never accepted. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4843.64s)]
*  Now that we may look at things differently in the context of a war, but [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4847.4800000000005s)]
*  also by the way, I'm not sure I completely do. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4852.32s)]
*  But typically speaking, when people think of wars, they're thinking of this [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4854.96s)]
*  government versus this government, this military versus this military. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4860.04s)]
*  That's not the situation here. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4864.04s)]
*  You know, so like while Israel is saying, Hey, they're using human shields. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4866.0s)]
*  It's also like, and that is true. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4869.4s)]
*  I think to some degree, I think the Israelis overplay it a little bit, but [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4871.72s)]
*  there have been, I think, clear instances where Hamas is using human shields. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4874.68s)]
*  But it's kind of a flip side of a different point. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4878.96s)]
*  And like the other point is like, Oh, well, why aren't they using their army [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4885.4s)]
*  or their air force or their Navy? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4888.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4890.2s)]
*  Cause they don't have any of those. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4890.48s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4892.36s)]
*  So you're fighting a war against a people that don't have a government [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4892.839999999999s)]
*  because you've denied them their right to have one. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4897.639999999999s)]
*  And so that's, that's the thing where I do think if you've occupied the place [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4900.639999999999s)]
*  since 1967, you almost now take on an obligation that you kind of have to [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4904.76s)]
*  almost conduct this as a police matter. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4910.88s)]
*  You know, you're not allowed to just cause otherwise, cause now we are getting [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4913.68s)]
*  awfully close to the scenario that we just laid out where like, Oh, there's [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4916.72s)]
*  a school shooter blow up the school. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4920.12s)]
*  It's difficult to have a discussion about ethics when you're talking about [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4922.52s)]
*  war is really at the core of it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4926.68s)]
*  All war is immoral. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4929.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4931.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, by its very definition, it's innocent people dying almost always. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4931.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4936.0s)]
*  Like it's, it's difficult to pick, which is the just war and even world war [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4936.360000000001s)]
*  two, because of the complexities that you mentioned is difficult. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4941.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4945.16s)]
*  Cause it's Stalin. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4945.320000000001s)]
*  Well, as my, as my buddy, uh, Darrell Cooper demonstrated, I think we can have [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4946.96s)]
*  a reasonable civil discussion about these things without anybody blowing their lid. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4950.72s)]
*  Um, we can all just talk. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4955.24s)]
*  No, but like, I mean, look, there's so many. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4956.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, world war two is just, it's the third rail, like nothing else. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4959.88s)]
*  I really, world war two and the civil rights movement, I think are the like [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4965.56s)]
*  third rails of American politics that if you like, if, if you have any type of [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4970.84s)]
*  view, that is not the, the approved authorized view of how these events went. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4976.08s)]
*  You're in a lot of trouble. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4982.28s)]
*  If you wanted to compare Hitler to Stalin's body count at that time. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4984.24s)]
*  Stalin was already a genocidal maniac and Hitler had not gone genocidal yet. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4989.52s)]
*  So there is a weird dynamic that now in hindsight, it looks a little bit better [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4994.24s)]
*  because you go, yeah, yeah, but he went so genocidal at the end there, you know? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=4998.08s)]
*  But like, that's a weird decision at the time to ally with, with Joseph Stalin [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5001.2s)]
*  w when he had already done the worst things that Joseph Stalin had done, or at [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5007.12s)]
*  least a lot of the worst things he had done, I guess there were a lot more in [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5011.04s)]
*  the war as well, but [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5015.8s)]
*  I was curious though. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5017.6s)]
*  You didn't mention Mao is that funding again? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5018.320000000001s)]
*  Cause he did even worse than Stalin. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5020.72s)]
*  So is that the second thing? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5022.68s)]
*  I'm not sure that's officially known. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5023.76s)]
*  Do we actually know that Mao killed anybody? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5025.76s)]
*  I mean, all right, I'll come, I'll say it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5028.04s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5030.360000000001s)]
*  I'm going to blow my funding. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5030.8s)]
*  Bad guy. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5032.16s)]
*  That Mao Zedong do not care for him. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5032.72s)]
*  I think the Chinese government officially says they have like an actual [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5035.2s)]
*  percentage that he was 70% correct. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5039.04s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5042.28s)]
*  They actually broke it down to that 70%. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5043.0s)]
*  But the 30% was being the worst mass murder in human history. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5045.24s)]
*  That's such a communist thing to do. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5048.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5051.08s)]
*  We measured it. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5051.2s)]
*  We measured it and scientifically figured it out. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5051.92s)]
*  Since you mentioned Darrell Cooper, you're friends with him. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5055.36s)]
*  Can you tell me about him and tell me about the whole saga about where he got [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5058.64s)]
*  attacked after the talker interview? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5061.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5064.12s)]
*  So, well, Darrell, uh, I was just a big fan. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5064.76s)]
*  I'm still, I'm really just a big fan of him. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5069.96s)]
*  I, uh, we've, we chatted like a few times and I interviewed him on, on my podcast [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5072.16s)]
*  and I consider us friends. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5078.16s)]
*  Martyr made podcast is his show and it's just phenomenal. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5079.68s)]
*  I found out about him from my guy is a Scott Horton, who is a very close friend [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5083.5199999999995s)]
*  of mine and I think the best, um, the best person on war in the country. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5090.88s)]
*  He's a, just a genius. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5098.84s)]
*  Uh, he runs the libertarian Institute and he's also been the editor at [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5100.8s)]
*  antiwar.com for many years now. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5104.280000000001s)]
*  So he first, uh, told me about Darrell and that I, what I knew of Darrell was just [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5106.88s)]
*  that, uh, he did a podcast with Jaco and so like they did their show together and [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5113.120000000001s)]
*  I listened to a couple episodes of it and really enjoyed it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5117.96s)]
*  And then it was Scott who was like, dude, you gotta check out his podcast, Martyr [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5120.64s)]
*  made, it's like the best history podcast you got. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5125.6s)]
*  And I ended up listening to his, uh, the first thing I listened to of his was the [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5127.92s)]
*  fear and loathing in the new Jerusalem. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5132.360000000001s)]
*  He's done a few things on Twitter where he's kind of like shit posting and stuff [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5134.4800000000005s)]
*  like that, but when you listen to his work, like when he lays down, like, I'm [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5137.6s)]
*  going to put together this, this thing, I'm going to take years to put together [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5140.96s)]
*  like a long presentation on the history of this conflict or the history of this. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5145.64s)]
*  He is, has like the utmost responsibility in the way that he tells the story and [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5149.360000000001s)]
*  the way he presents it. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5155.6s)]
*  I cannot understand how anyone would listen to his work and come away with the [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5156.64s)]
*  feeling that this guy is any type of like Jew hater or Nazi apologist or anything [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5161.200000000001s)]
*  like that. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5166.120000000001s)]
*  It's just, it's just not who he is. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5166.56s)]
*  What Darrell said on Tucker's show was that he goes, you know, I'll say this to [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5168.6s)]
*  be provocative sometimes to kind of rib my buddy Jaco who's like Anglo-Saxon. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5173.6s)]
*  So this kind of gets to him and goes, and I'm being a bit hyperbolic when I say [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5177.92s)]
*  this, but I'll, I'll sometimes say that, uh, Winston Churchill was the chief [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5181.200000000001s)]
*  villain of world war II. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5185.16s)]
*  Now he didn't commit the most atrocities. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5186.76s)]
*  He wasn't like the worst person there, but he was a guy who was hell bent on kind [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5188.44s)]
*  of this thing becoming what it ultimately became, whereas like it, this might've [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5193.0s)]
*  just been an invasion of Poland. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5197.68s)]
*  This may not have been this whole cascade of like the worst thing that ever happened [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5199.12s)]
*  in human history. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5202.5199999999995s)]
*  Now the retelling of that is always people go, he said Churchill was the chief [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5203.5199999999995s)]
*  villain of the war, but it's like, no, not exactly. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5207.04s)]
*  Like he, you know what I mean? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5210.96s)]
*  He's making a point and I think he's, he's putting out right now, a long [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5212.4400000000005s)]
*  series on world war II. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5216.8s)]
*  He just put the prologue to it out, which was excellent by the way. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5218.12s)]
*  Um, and I really just have, you know, listen, if after it's out, maybe I'll [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5221.84s)]
*  come back and regret saying this, but I don't think I will. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5227.0s)]
*  I really have like trust that Daryl will handle this like responsibly. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5229.64s)]
*  And in fact, I think that he might be. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5235.08s)]
*  And not because he's like involved at like, this is his angle or what he's [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5238.959999999999s)]
*  attempting to do, I think just that he's going to tell the truth and the truth [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5244.0s)]
*  will take you where it takes you. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5247.48s)]
*  I think he's actually going to probably serve a function of bringing a lot of [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5248.759999999999s)]
*  those types kind of back to reality and bringing them back to being like, like [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5253.4s)]
*  he, if you think he's going to be excusing the atrocities of the Nazis in this thing, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5257.959999999999s)]
*  I just don't, I don't think you're going to be happy with the end product. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5262.959999999999s)]
*  If that's what you are coming into it for. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5266.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5268.4s)]
*  One thing I want to say is I think calling Darrell Nazi Nazi sympathizers [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5269.04s)]
*  is just wrong and it does a lot of damage. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5272.64s)]
*  I think he's, he has a lot of value to his podcast. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5274.92s)]
*  I think we're like, there's several things to sort of make very clear. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5277.88s)]
*  I think as a really interesting guy, I'm sure I'll talk to him in the future, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5282.68s)]
*  but I just want to lay on the table that I think what he's saying about [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5285.96s)]
*  Churchill is just dead wrong. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5290.72s)]
*  I think legitimately that statement removing the trolling from it is the [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5293.32s)]
*  revisionist history statement that I think is wrong. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5297.8s)]
*  And the invasion of the Soviet union would have happened no matter what. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5301.08s)]
*  And possibly, which I'm actually learning a lot more, Stalin could have [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5304.320000000001s)]
*  gone the other way as well. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5308.28s)]
*  That that was going to be a global war, no matter what Churchill, the [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5309.64s)]
*  role of Churchill we can debate. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5313.92s)]
*  And I still don't think he was a main instigator of that expansion there. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5316.28s)]
*  There's a lot of historical documentation of that. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5320.92s)]
*  Well, look, that's a, that's a fair debate to have, and it'd be interesting [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5323.12s)]
*  to see you two kind of talk about that. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5326.4s)]
*  Or maybe not even debate it, but just like have a conversation about that. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5328.32s)]
*  I think the broader point you're making is a lot of, I mean, there's just a lot [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5330.639999999999s)]
*  of trivialization of the world war two that happens in the West, uh, in the [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5334.44s)]
*  United States, especially, and that's used by neocons by, by warmongers to sort of. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5340.2s)]
*  Oh, I constantly, I mean, I've never, I don't think I've done a bunch of like [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5346.4s)]
*  Israel, Palestine debates. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5351.92s)]
*  I don't think I've ever done one where world war two wasn't invoked and where [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5354.12s)]
*  that wasn't like, well, I mean, Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5357.72s)]
*  So you're going to tell me it's not okay. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5362.64s)]
*  And immediately just, if you just look at it like that, like, let's say the official [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5364.12s)]
*  narrative is 100% true in world war two. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5368.400000000001s)]
*  Let's let's even say every aspect of the official narrative is really true. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5370.4800000000005s)]
*  Like the lesson of world war two is that we should have gone to war sooner, which [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5374.12s)]
*  is essentially right, like the, the dominant mainstream narrative that, um, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5377.4400000000005s)]
*  Chamberlain is the failure. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5382.96s)]
*  That was the problem. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5384.56s)]
*  The appeasement Churchill was the solution. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5385.4400000000005s)]
*  If only Chamberlain had been Churchill or if only we had gone to war with Germany [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5387.72s)]
*  and you know, whatever in 1933, we would have just, it would have been better. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5391.96s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5396.56s)]
*  Let's say all of that's true. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5396.96s)]
*  It still doesn't follow from that, that therefore in every situation, appeasement [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5398.36s)]
*  is wrong and aggression is good. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5402.92s)]
*  It doesn't follow from that. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5404.76s)]
*  That's the only lesson of history. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5405.68s)]
*  And that now it's just okay to slaughter civilians. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5407.72s)]
*  Like it's okay to go to total war against a civilian population because this one [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5410.28s)]
*  time it was necessary. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5414.5199999999995s)]
*  Like it's, and the idea that Bobby Kennedy said this to me, again, somebody [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5415.84s)]
*  who I really do love and, uh, admire in many ways, and I'm glad he's the health [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5419.8s)]
*  secretary, but I remember him saying to this, invoking the Nazis and making a [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5424.36s)]
*  comparison between Hamas and the Nazis. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5428.24s)]
*  And you're like, dude, Hamas doesn't even control Gaza. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5430.48s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5433.639999999999s)]
*  The Nazis had most of Europe at one point. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5434.5199999999995s)]
*  This is just not an apples to apples conversation. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5437.2s)]
*  This is not, you can't even compare the two in terms of what type of menace or [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5440.08s)]
*  threat they are to the world. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5444.08s)]
*  I mean, like, sure. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5445.68s)]
*  Maybe if Hamas had a lot of power, they'd use it in a bad way, but like, that's [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5446.84s)]
*  true with like some homeless guy on the street too, but he doesn't have that [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5451.5199999999995s)]
*  power. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5454.48s)]
*  So like, what are we talking about here? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5454.84s)]
*  And so the way I do think that the way the world war two narrative is weaponized [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5457.0s)]
*  has been even if world war two itself was necessary and just the way that that's [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5463.5599999999995s)]
*  been weaponized over the years has led to just like countless catastrophes. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5468.48s)]
*  And like, you know, it's, and it's always, it's always, it's not just like, you [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5473.879999999999s)]
*  know, I mean, I guess it's just in some ways, there might be something positive [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5478.599999999999s)]
*  about the fact that everybody's always called Hitler if they're bad. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5482.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5486.04s)]
*  But we, we make Hitler the, you know, the face of what is evil eternally or [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5486.759999999999s)]
*  something. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5492.24s)]
*  He really does play the role of the devil in our society in a, in a strange way. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5492.919999999999s)]
*  Um, but there is like, you know, Saddam was the next Hitler and Gaddafi was the [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5497.599999999999s)]
*  next Hitler and Bashar al-Assad was the next Trump. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5504.72s)]
*  Trump is Hitler. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5507.92s)]
*  Hamas is Hitler, except the problem is that like none of them are Hitler. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5509.28s)]
*  None of them are even close. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5512.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just totally different. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5514.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5516.0s)]
*  And, uh, the amount of power is really important. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5516.48s)]
*  The good matters, how much destructive power you have within you, the [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5518.28s)]
*  capabilities, but like every, every major superpower with nuclear weapons. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5520.96s)]
*  Has the potential to be that destructive. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5527.36s)]
*  It's just unproductive. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5529.04s)]
*  And yet the only ones who ever have dropped them are us. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5530.28s)]
*  I was arguing with one guy on a podcast, uh, and he said that he goes, you can't [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5533.679999999999s)]
*  allow dictators to have nuclear weapons because they might use them. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5538.4s)]
*  And I was like, but we are the only ones who ever used them. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5541.36s)]
*  And he goes, ah, come on, that's naive or something. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5544.36s)]
*  And they're like, wait, what? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5547.24s)]
*  Why shouldn't that be pointed out? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5548.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, and I don't know. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5550.8s)]
*  I mean, I, I'd prefer Iran not get nuclear weapons. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5551.88s)]
*  Um, I, you know, I think we're pushing them to probably want to pursue that. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5555.36s)]
*  Um, and I also think there's been a lot of propaganda about the nuclear, um, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5562.48s)]
*  program in, in Iran, I know at least since the nineties, according to Netanyahu, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5566.4s)]
*  they've been five years away. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5571.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5572.96s)]
*  I think there's a lot of warmongering going on about all parts of the world. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5573.2s)]
*  Iran, especially I do. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5577.28s)]
*  I have a lot of friends in Iran from Iran. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5579.04s)]
*  It's one of the most beautiful cultures in the world. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5581.84s)]
*  Like this just super, super power of intellect and culture. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5583.8s)]
*  And it's really sad and disappointing that the regime is basically [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5587.92s)]
*  suppressing that culture. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5592.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5593.64s)]
*  You have to always remember like, uh, there's parts of the world where the, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5594.240000000001s)]
*  the people are beautiful and we don't get to see it because of the suppression. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5599.0s)]
*  The lack of freedom. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5603.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5604.84s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5605.56s)]
*  So all that said, there does seem to be a lot of hatred of Jews on the X. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5607.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5614.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, how much of it do you think is actual hate of Jews and how much of it is just [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5614.64s)]
*  trolls and grifters and, uh, conspiracy nerds, just, you know, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5620.320000000001s)]
*  cosplaying as a Nazis. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5625.88s)]
*  It's really hard to tell. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5629.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5632.04s)]
*  I don't know how you even figure it out. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5633.280000000001s)]
*  And I think this is one of the problems with. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5636.160000000001s)]
*  Outrage culture. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5640.360000000001s)]
*  It's kind of one of the unintended consequences of it is that now you just [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5641.48s)]
*  have no way of knowing who's saying this just to get a rise out of you or who [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5646.959999999999s)]
*  really sincerely means it or who's some version of both. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5652.2s)]
*  Um, then there's also, it's like, there's so many weird dynamics because there's [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5655.719999999999s)]
*  no question, like I see it all the time. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5659.959999999999s)]
*  I mean, I see a level of like Jew hatred on Twitter that I've never seen before [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5662.04s)]
*  in my own replies and other people's things like it's. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5666.16s)]
*  And that's interesting. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5670.12s)]
*  Like first off, you're like, okay, so what's going on here? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5672.280000000001s)]
*  Interesting sociological phenomena. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5675.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5677.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5677.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, um, yeah, concerning and troubling and all of that stuff. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5677.8s)]
*  But then you also see people who will be asking like completely legitimate [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5681.68s)]
*  questions or making completely legitimate points that are called antisemitic. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5685.84s)]
*  And then that I think does not help the dynamic at all, because now you're almost [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5689.72s)]
*  like, oh, there's number one, you just kind of, you make the word meaningless. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5693.88s)]
*  You take away the disincentive for anybody else to actually be a Jew hater. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5700.04s)]
*  Um, I mean, I think there's a lot going on. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5705.24s)]
*  You know, one of the things is that for young white men in America today, they've [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5707.92s)]
*  lived through the years of, of real insane progressive wokeism. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5714.4800000000005s)]
*  And so, you know, which is something like, like I'm 42. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5720.04s)]
*  It's just a different thing for me. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5723.88s)]
*  Like I come from a different culture and a different time that is just simply was [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5725.200000000001s)]
*  not the case that when I was a teenager or when I was in college or when I was in [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5728.6s)]
*  my early twenties, that the school, the faculty, the politicians, Hollywood, all [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5733.240000000001s)]
*  of them embraced racialism, you know, they all said we're playing identity politics [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5740.240000000001s)]
*  and it is okay to dice people up along these racial lines and have that first [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5744.64s)]
*  and foremost in your mind, you know, and there is this weird feeling over this [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5749.0s)]
*  last year and now with Trump being reelected that like we snapped our fingers [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5754.48s)]
*  and wokeism went away or something like that, but these guys still came up in [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5758.0s)]
*  this, in this era and there was, it was always the case that like one of the, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5763.24s)]
*  the dangerous elements of playing this game was like, well, you think you're [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5769.36s)]
*  going to play this and that like young straight white men aren't going to start [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5773.8s)]
*  playing this game too. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5777.12s)]
*  Why the hell would they not like, why, why would they just accept we'll just [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5778.5599999999995s)]
*  sit here while everybody else is allowed to have a racial identity and a grievance [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5782.799999999999s)]
*  about it and yet will be the one group you could just stomp all over us. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5786.799999999999s)]
*  We're the bad guys. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5791.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why I always opposed the woke insanity. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5792.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, first and foremost, just cause I think it's wrong. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5796.96s)]
*  I think it's wrong to like be shitty to people based on their racial group. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5798.96s)]
*  And that includes white people too. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5802.48s)]
*  Um, but then also you're like, you don't see that this is going to result in [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5804.5599999999995s)]
*  something bad. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5807.8s)]
*  So there's, there's that. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5808.6s)]
*  Um, but I mean, I, you know, clearly. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5810.2s)]
*  And, and it was weird to me is that. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5814.64s)]
*  I guess it's because a lot of the people who are the most upset about the [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5816.88s)]
*  antisemitism also happen to be supporting Israel. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5820.0s)]
*  Like there's a big correlation between that, but clearly that's a huge factor [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5822.92s)]
*  in this, like it's, it's not a coincidence that all of this rose up while Israel is [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5827.320000000001s)]
*  just conducting this brutal campaign with our weapons and money. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5831.88s)]
*  And so I always think with these things, whether it's with Putin or with [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5836.12s)]
*  Al Qaeda or with whoever, and I'm not saying like the guy who posts like Jew [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5840.52s)]
*  Haiti stuff on Twitter is the same as them. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5845.12s)]
*  I'm just saying in all of these situations, you always kind of got to [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5846.68s)]
*  separate like what are legitimate grievances and what are like, okay, that [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5849.56s)]
*  you're wrong on that and you shouldn't be doing that, you know, like, so it's, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5854.36s)]
*  it's pretty easy for me to like, if I listened to like the Putin interview with [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5857.96s)]
*  Tucker, I thought his whole 30 minute opening thing was like horrible and [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5861.5199999999995s)]
*  just like kind of stupid, especially when you're talking to Tucker Carlson. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5867.639999999999s)]
*  You know, this is like for an American audience. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5871.2s)]
*  You know how much that does not resonate with Americans being like, we have a [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5873.36s)]
*  historic claim over another, our entire society is founded on we think that's [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5876.839999999999s)]
*  bullshit, like that's the entire history of ours is like, nah, it doesn't matter. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5883.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5886.839999999999s)]
*  Like literally read the declaration of independence. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5887.639999999999s)]
*  It just refutes everything Vladimir Putin said in the first 30 minutes. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5889.68s)]
*  Like our view of the world is that God wants us to be free and we get to [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5892.64s)]
*  overthrow governments if they're infringing on our rights, like that's. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5896.96s)]
*  So that was stupid. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5899.88s)]
*  But then when he's talking about like NATO enlargement and bringing Ukraine into [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5900.84s)]
*  the American military Alliance, you're like, ah, okay, he's got a legitimate point [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5905.4400000000005s)]
*  there. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5909.12s)]
*  We would not allow one of our neighbors to be brought into China or Russia's [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5909.56s)]
*  military Alliance. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5913.6s)]
*  And so likewise, when it comes to those guys, I do think that like you almost [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5914.8s)]
*  look, it is, it is just true. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5919.4s)]
*  It is the case that America has fought many wars over the last seven years with [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5922.72s)]
*  Israel playing a very influential role in us fighting those wars. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5931.0s)]
*  And you know, these were, uh, this was like a scheme that was cooked up by the [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5936.8s)]
*  neoconservatives and the Likudniks in Israel that we would go through this [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5941.16s)]
*  path, but there's been confirmed by four star general Wesley Clark. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5945.16s)]
*  He literally said it was a study paid for by the Israelis that we were going [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5948.16s)]
*  to topple seven countries in five years. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5952.44s)]
*  And we didn't get there in five years, but we've been made attempts to topple [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5954.5199999999995s)]
*  all of those countries since then. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5957.4s)]
*  You know, you see Trump's bombing the Houthis because they're pissed off about [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5958.92s)]
*  Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5963.72s)]
*  And so they're trying to shut down their Straits or whatever. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5965.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's like, so we're just bombing another group on behalf of Israel. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5967.8s)]
*  And if you really are concerned about the rise of Jew hatred, I would say like, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5971.2s)]
*  look, it's much like, you know, sometimes people argue where, you know, the thing [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5976.280000000001s)]
*  I said in the beginning about the terrorists don't hate us for our freedom. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5981.4400000000005s)]
*  They hate us because we're over there. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5983.52s)]
*  And people would say, that's just what Osama bin Laden says. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5985.08s)]
*  He just says he hates us for our military, but he really just hates us [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5987.88s)]
*  because he's an Islamist and we're free people or whatever. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5990.84s)]
*  And you'd be like, okay, well, even if that's what's in his heart, that sure [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5993.400000000001s)]
*  is his recruiting stick, that sure is how he gets other people to blow themselves [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=5996.240000000001s)]
*  up. And so even if you want to say, which is, which might very well be the case [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6000.280000000001s)]
*  that some of these people just hate Jews and it wouldn't matter if Israel was at [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6004.12s)]
*  war with Gaza or not. It's like, okay, but that sure is their recruiting stick. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6007.88s)]
*  That sure is how they get other people to go look at what these Jews are doing [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6011.84s)]
*  in our foreign policy. So I would, I don't know, there's a lot going on. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6014.92s)]
*  I do think, I think racialism of all different forms is stupid and wrong. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6019.76s)]
*  It always just leads to sloppy thinking and bad results. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6028.32s)]
*  It's always kind of ugly. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6031.84s)]
*  And then weirdly, it also always ends up hurting the person. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6033.24s)]
*  Like it's not good for you. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6036.320000000001s)]
*  It's not good for your soul. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6037.360000000001s)]
*  So I don't like seeing that stuff. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6039.28s)]
*  But then I also think, you know, like I was saying before about, there's like [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6041.04s)]
*  this hierarchy of outrages that you got to have in order to think and act. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6045.68s)]
*  You have to kind of put these together. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6050.08s)]
*  And, you know, I just hear a little bit. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6051.88s)]
*  It's something that, you know, despite being described as a self-hating Jew, I [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6054.04s)]
*  am really not. I love Jewish people. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6057.96s)]
*  I love Jewish culture. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6060.0s)]
*  I've benefited a lot from it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6061.12s)]
*  It's, it's in many ways made me the person I am. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6062.599999999999s)]
*  And I think made, I think it's influenced some of the best parts of me. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6065.64s)]
*  But there is like a whininess and a hysteria about this stuff that I think is [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6070.84s)]
*  just like not healthy. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6076.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it's not good. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6078.28s)]
*  I've told many Jewish friends and family this privately, but it's like, the way I [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6079.76s)]
*  look at it is like, I'm an American. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6086.0s)]
*  This has been a wonderful country to be Jewish. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6088.599999999999s)]
*  Jews are doing exceptionally well in this country. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6090.76s)]
*  We are 2% of the population or so, and we are thriving by any metric. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6093.8s)]
*  And if mean stuff on Twitter is our great burden to bear, I don't think we should be [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6099.400000000001s)]
*  talking about it like we're in the middle of Nazi Germany or something like that. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6106.4800000000005s)]
*  So I do think people get hysterical about it. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6110.240000000001s)]
*  In a way that's completely not productive. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6112.72s)]
*  But to me, I think, I think of the Jew hating nerds and trolls on Twitter is just [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6114.32s)]
*  the other side of the woke. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6122.0s)]
*  I kind of get that. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6124.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6125.48s)]
*  It's almost like a response. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6125.8s)]
*  Like you were saying, it's just that the, the woke weren't censored and the [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6126.8s)]
*  response to the woke was censored. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6132.44s)]
*  And now that our next, they're less censored or not censored. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6134.16s)]
*  You just get to see it and they're both annoying. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6139.28s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6143.2s)]
*  They don't really help the discussion on Israel. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6144.24s)]
*  They don't help the discussion on anything. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6146.4s)]
*  In fact, I, um, one of the reasons I stay away from that discussion of Israel, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6147.84s)]
*  which I think is nuanced and really complicated in the way that we've been [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6152.639999999999s)]
*  discussing in order to have an intellectual like exploration of ideas, you [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6156.4s)]
*  have to be able to misstep and try ideas for size. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6161.44s)]
*  And if I'm going to be punished severely by these, I'm okay being criticized, but [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6165.719999999999s)]
*  but when there's like low brain takes that are just lying about me on mass, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6170.64s)]
*  like you get a huge amount of engagement just because you're like thinking out [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6177.52s)]
*  loud and reading history and it's just annoying. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6181.76s)]
*  And by the way, I'm really interested about World War II, probably in the way [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6185.120000000001s)]
*  that Dan Carlin and, uh, Darrell Cooper are interested, cause it's such an [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6189.72s)]
*  interesting stage on which human nature was explored in all its forms, the [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6193.96s)]
*  geopolitics of it, everybody on that stage was complicated. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6199.64s)]
*  There's a lot of, also there's a lot of fascinating military taxes and [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6203.68s)]
*  strategy and military technology. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6207.280000000001s)]
*  Plus the nuclear bomb, all of that. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6209.84s)]
*  That's like a moment in human history. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6212.68s)]
*  Listen, I love Genghis Khan, Roman Empire, Alexander the Great. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6215.52s)]
*  Those are all interesting studies of human history of military tactics, of, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6218.88s)]
*  of brutality of human nature, all of that. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6222.92s)]
*  That's why I want to be able to discuss that. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6225.56s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6227.96s)]
*  Like that humans are able to do that kind of thing. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6229.400000000001s)]
*  What causes them to do it? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6232.96s)]
*  What were the dynamics involved? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6234.76s)]
*  The propaganda on all sides could have, could have been avoided or not. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6236.240000000001s)]
*  You know, plus Stalin is part of this picture. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6241.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6244.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6244.8s)]
*  What? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6246.320000000001s)]
*  Like you don't get characters, this, you don't get care after the nuclear bomb. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6247.64s)]
*  You just not going to get characters like that. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6251.12s)]
*  You're not going to get a global war of that kind. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6252.72s)]
*  It might be a different one. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6254.8s)]
*  Maybe a cyber war or maybe a war in space, but we're not going to get [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6255.76s)]
*  this kind of war ever again. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6259.64s)]
*  That was the last, the biggest and the last global war we're going to get. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6261.08s)]
*  So I want to be able to like mouth off and explore and yeah, argue with Darrell [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6264.68s)]
*  Cooper, Bob Churchill and say stupid shit in the process. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6269.04s)]
*  And Darrell says stupid shit in the process too. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6272.0s)]
*  And like together come up to the, so anyway, the, the trolls on the left [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6274.08s)]
*  and the right just make everything worse. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6278.04s)]
*  And it's annoying. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6279.52s)]
*  No, I agree with that. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6280.52s)]
*  And I'm sure like, I'm, I'm sure I'm not without my own bias in this because I [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6281.92s)]
*  like, but from my own like self-interested perspective, I'm not saying like this is [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6288.64s)]
*  the main reason to be annoyed with them or anything like that, but I, what I [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6295.4400000000005s)]
*  personally get is all types of like self-hating Jew, Nazi apologists, all [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6299.4400000000005s)]
*  this literally just because I criticize the way Israel's conducting this war. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6305.16s)]
*  I think that's like insane. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6310.0s)]
*  But then I also feel like, and I'm not, I'd want to be clear, just clean this. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6311.72s)]
*  I'm not saying this is the worst thing about people who are Jew haters on Twitter, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6316.0s)]
*  but just from a personal perspective, I'm like, guys, you are not helping me, man. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6320.36s)]
*  Like it's like, I'll get people in my comments who I think are trying to like [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6325.8s)]
*  catch my back who just don't know I'm Jewish and they're like, I'll say [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6329.76s)]
*  something critical of Israel. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6333.16s)]
*  And then someone argue with me and they'll be like, Oh, look, a Jew came [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6334.52s)]
*  in here to defend Israel. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6337.8s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, first of all, do you, you're like, literally you might [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6339.04s)]
*  as well be working for Masad. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6344.2s)]
*  You literally make the entire, you make the movement who's criticizing [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6346.0s)]
*  Israel look terrible, dude, like you are literally the enemy that they would like [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6350.4s)]
*  to have. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6355.88s)]
*  And so it's, it, there's a very weird dynamic in the Israel Palestine conflict [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6356.92s)]
*  where all of there's so many of the loons on both sides who almost seem like [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6362.12s)]
*  they're secretly working for the other side. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6368.68s)]
*  Like if you, when you see the Palestinian protests and they're chanting [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6371.12s)]
*  death to America and all this stuff, you're like, what are you, what are you [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6375.360000000001s)]
*  doing? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6379.84s)]
*  Are you trying to make people more sympathetic to Israel? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6380.200000000001s)]
*  Cause that's the, if, if Rabbi Shmueli was working for Adolf Hitler or something [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6383.08s)]
*  like that, it would all make perfect sense. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6389.72s)]
*  You were like, Oh, I get it. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6391.68s)]
*  You sent this guy out to make everyone hate Jewish people. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6393.12s)]
*  And then like, it's just, there's just a very, and then [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6396.200000000001s)]
*  with the, um, with the, the Jew hating post too, it's just, yeah, it's, it just [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6398.5199999999995s)]
*  feeds right into the, the opposition side of how to caricature, you know, it's like, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6403.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, so their game is they'll smear everybody who's a critic of Israel as, as [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6409.4s)]
*  being a Jew hater. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6414.04s)]
*  So your answer is to just really be a Jew hater. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6415.24s)]
*  Like, all right. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6417.799999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's helping. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6419.0s)]
*  Uh, so maybe this is a good time to ask for your advice because these folks are [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6420.4s)]
*  the reason why I'm hesitant. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6425.759999999999s)]
*  Uh, so I've interviewed several world leaders recently. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6428.0s)]
*  Uh, it's looking likely that I'll interview Vladimir Putin and several other [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6432.48s)]
*  similar level major world leaders. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6439.839999999999s)]
*  I've previously interviewed Benjamin Netanyahu for an hour. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6443.48s)]
*  One of the biggest regrets I have about that interview is it was only an hour. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6446.48s)]
*  I realized that, uh, I mean, I learned a lot, but I think he's a really important [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6449.96s)]
*  historical figure and I think it's impossible to have a, an effective [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6457.04s)]
*  conversation with him that's shorter than three hours. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6461.76s)]
*  So, uh, it looks like he's interested now to do round two with me for three or [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6464.64s)]
*  more hours and I've personally, uh, so this is a bit of a therapy session, but [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6471.8s)]
*  I've personally been leaning against doing it and I hate that I'm leaning [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6478.64s)]
*  against doing it because the reason I'm leaning against doing it is because the [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6484.8s)]
*  very people you're talking about, cause I just don't want them to on either side. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6489.12s)]
*  Pro is zero pro. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6494.12s)]
*  It doesn't really matter, but the chanting sheep of animal farm, do [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6495.240000000001s)]
*  hating or otherwise just make your life. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6500.280000000001s)]
*  They follow you around everywhere on online and make it difficult to think. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6504.08s)]
*  I think whenever I come across these crowds, the woke left or the, whatever [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6510.52s)]
*  you call the Jew haters, the woke, right. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6516.28s)]
*  Let's call them. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6518.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, they just. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6519.6s)]
*  Like decrease the quality of my thoughts for the rest of the day. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6522.96s)]
*  I feel dumber. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6527.96s)]
*  It's like Rogan talks about when he hears a bad comedian, he feels [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6529.2s)]
*  like nothing is funny anymore. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6532.72s)]
*  This is what I feel like when I read their thoughts. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6534.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like, I can't. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6537.52s)]
*  I'm going to go read a book now. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6539.0s)]
*  Cause I need to like recover. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6540.320000000001s)]
*  It's a dangerous kind of poison to let in your mind because then you're like, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6542.12s)]
*  it's like, Hey, I can't be thinking about you when I'm doing what I want to do. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6546.72s)]
*  Like, I can't be thinking about what your reaction to this is going to be. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6551.0s)]
*  The way I always thought about it was like, when I'd get like, you know, hate [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6554.4400000000005s)]
*  online, which I'm, you know, always get, um, it's always just kind of like, I [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6558.4800000000005s)]
*  look at it like this, like I got, um, I got a great family and a great career. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6565.24s)]
*  And I really love what I do. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6572.08s)]
*  I make really good money at what I do. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6574.679999999999s)]
*  And I go, I do shows all the time. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6577.12s)]
*  I get crowds of people who love what I do. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6579.4s)]
*  I got a lot of people who listen to my podcast, who love what I do. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6581.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's like, so if I get all that and then the price that comes along with it, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6584.88s)]
*  is there some people who would talk shit online? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6589.08s)]
*  It's like, that's a very, that's a very good price to pay for all of this. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6591.08s)]
*  Like, it's just, and I just like, I just kind of made a decision at a certain [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6595.72s)]
*  point that it's like, I'm just going to accept that that's the price of business [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6599.68s)]
*  here, that's what it costs and then, okay, fine. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6602.8s)]
*  And then sometimes I try to have fun with it or mock them or whatever, to go back. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6606.24s)]
*  But to me, now, again, I, I can never tell you what to do because this is a, it's a [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6610.6s)]
*  very personal price that you have to pay. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6615.76s)]
*  And it's a very weird psychological dynamic. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6618.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's just not, it's almost something like that. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6621.48s)]
*  We, we were not evolved to deal with and is very artificial and it's very, you [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6623.719999999999s)]
*  know, like if you're, if there's a group of like thousands of people who hate your [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6628.839999999999s)]
*  guts and are furious at you, we're almost like hardwired to be like, well, I'm [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6633.16s)]
*  going to be killed now. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6637.32s)]
*  Like that's the next thing that happens. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6638.96s)]
*  You know, you, you're not supposed to get to know what just someone in Arkansas [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6640.5599999999995s)]
*  thinks about you right now, you know? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6645.4s)]
*  But so that's a very personal like decision to make, but I kind of feel like [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6647.4s)]
*  guys like me and you have already made the decision that we're in the arena and [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6654.24s)]
*  we're going to deal with that, that price. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6660.44s)]
*  And so I just, from my perspective, I'm like, yeah, but how could you turn down [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6663.4s)]
*  get in three hours with Netanyahu? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6668.08s)]
*  Like that would just be so interesting. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6670.28s)]
*  And I'm not even saying, you know, like I hate the guy, but I'm not saying you [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6671.8s)]
*  should interview him like you hate the guy, or I'm not saying you even have to [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6675.52s)]
*  like grill it, but just if you get three hours with somebody, something interesting [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6678.52s)]
*  is going to be revealed there. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6683.64s)]
*  There'll be a benefit to that. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6684.96s)]
*  It'll be interesting to just see him talk that way. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6686.64s)]
*  There's also something about, as we kind of saw with, with Trump doing the [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6689.4400000000005s)]
*  podcasts and even with JD Vance doing some of the podcasts, there is something [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6694.080000000001s)]
*  really interesting about this format. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6698.96s)]
*  The long form podcast where it just gets people to let down their guard and [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6701.96s)]
*  reveal themselves a little bit more. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6707.84s)]
*  Like it is, it's not just the time factor. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6709.68s)]
*  Like that's a big one. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6711.92s)]
*  That's a huge, huge one. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6713.240000000001s)]
*  But it's like, there's something about like, if me and you were just like, if [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6714.88s)]
*  you, we were having this conversation right now, but in back of us was like a [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6719.400000000001s)]
*  cable news, you know, background of red and blue and sparks and a ticker at the [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6722.96s)]
*  bottom of the show. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6727.56s)]
*  And then you just start interviewing someone. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6728.48s)]
*  It's just a different thing. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6730.24s)]
*  Whereas this, you just kind of like fall into conversation mode and I'd be [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6732.5599999999995s)]
*  interested to see him fall into that Putin too. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6737.24s)]
*  Like I just think it's great. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6740.2s)]
*  First of all, thank you for the encouragement. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6742.48s)]
*  Um, but to push back on the complexity of a little bit, I think everything you [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6746.24s)]
*  said about your life is also true about my life, except family. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6751.0s)]
*  I want to have a family. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6753.92s)]
*  You son of a bitch, you braggy. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6754.88s)]
*  Uh, on the podcast side, I can have a lot of incredible conversations. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6756.679999999999s)]
*  Some of my favorite is talking to programmers or video game designers or, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6760.16s)]
*  uh, or to you about Netanyahu versus talking to a world leader is a very [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6765.28s)]
*  specific thing and people don't understand that, for example, you and I [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6770.5599999999995s)]
*  can mouth off, we can be super supportive of Netanyahu is super critical in a way [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6774.639999999999s)]
*  that you can't do in front of the guy. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6779.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6781.48s)]
*  You, you have, there's a, if you want to reveal something, you can do it. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6782.32s)]
*  There's a different skill involved there in order to reveal how they think, who [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6786.759999999999s)]
*  they are as a human being, you have to just like we said with Darrell Cooper, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6792.92s)]
*  you have to humanize the person to a degree in order to let their mind [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6796.719999999999s)]
*  flourish in front of you in order for them to break, to let, let down the [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6801.28s)]
*  berries that they've put up and Benjamin Netanyahu has put up a lot of barriers. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6806.88s)]
*  The internally in Israel, he gets attacked insanely. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6811.759999999999s)]
*  There's a, there's a game of Thrones constantly going on and this guy has [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6815.84s)]
*  maintained power for a very long time. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6819.5599999999995s)]
*  So he's very good at putting up those barriers. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6821.32s)]
*  Plus, you know, globally gets attacked a lot. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6823.72s)]
*  So the task there is difficult. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6826.72s)]
*  And so each one is a puzzle and you have to make a decision. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6828.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you want to take this on as a project, which might become a lifelong [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6832.5199999999995s)]
*  project because of the consequences. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6836.64s)]
*  And you don't need to, it's, it's there. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6838.92s)]
*  There's a calculation there. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6842.24s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not so like self evident that there is a [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6843.32s)]
*  correct and incorrect answer. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6846.0s)]
*  Um, and I do think that we've probably all had things like certain type of [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6848.04s)]
*  ventures in life where you're like, all right, no, I don't want to do that. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6853.4s)]
*  But then you have to have a moment and be like, well, why is it you don't want it? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6857.28s)]
*  Oh, is it just cause it's going to be a lot of work? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6860.04s)]
*  Is it just because you're scared of it? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6861.799999999999s)]
*  Is it just because this and those typically are not good reasons to not do [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6863.28s)]
*  something like, you know what I mean? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6867.16s)]
*  And then now there might be, there is a reasonable, I think, point that [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6868.679999999999s)]
*  you made in there where it's like, when it is a different game to [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6873.28s)]
*  interview a world leader, that is a very different thing. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6876.16s)]
*  Like talking to some, uh, comedian about his thoughts on all this stuff is a [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6878.679999999999s)]
*  very different thing than talking to a world leader and especially one who's [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6883.0s)]
*  conducting a brutal war as you're talking to them, you know, like that's a, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6885.96s)]
*  and I don't know exactly what the way to navigate that is. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6890.32s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6893.16s)]
*  It's not just to be like hostile and be like, I've got you here for three hours. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6894.04s)]
*  I'm going to grill the shit. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6898.12s)]
*  It's like, probably not the best way to do it. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6899.24s)]
*  There's probably to like have a conversation to talk to the guy, probably [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6902.36s)]
*  try to get some important questions in, but also give him a chance to [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6906.44s)]
*  breathe and be a person. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6910.679999999999s)]
*  Um, I just, from my perspective, but again, it's a very personal thing for me. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6912.48s)]
*  I just do think that I like, I'm going, I hope you do it because I'd [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6917.44s)]
*  love to see that podcast. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6921.32s)]
*  Well, see, this is why it's part of the reason I asked you is cause I get a [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6922.5199999999995s)]
*  Dave Smith endorsement on the, um, so that completely ruined. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6925.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6930.599999999999s)]
*  At least there's another guy who thought there's a chance that might be a good [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6932.16s)]
*  idea because I don't know. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6935.2s)]
*  I see. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6936.92s)]
*  That's the cool thing about the things we do. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6937.28s)]
*  You've been through a lot of battles. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6939.639999999999s)]
*  You, you walked into a lot of tough debates and it's like, you don't know. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6941.639999999999s)]
*  This could be the conversation that like ends you. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6945.72s)]
*  I know. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6948.48s)]
*  I, well, I'll say that I think that's one of the things that I love about doing [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6948.96s)]
*  debates. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6952.96s)]
*  Um, and there is something about that where it's, I, I do kind of feel this, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6953.96s)]
*  like I'm a little bit of, of like an adrenaline junkie. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6959.48s)]
*  I mean, not like really, you know, I don't like skydive or do stuff like that, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6962.84s)]
*  but like doing standup is kind of like, you know, there's always something about [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6966.4s)]
*  that. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6969.96s)]
*  That's like, you're risking a lot by doing it. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6970.32s)]
*  You're like, you feel alive, you know, like not, and not like the way you do [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6972.84s)]
*  when you first start, but there is something about that and there's something [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6976.2s)]
*  about, well, first of all, I just kind of, I feel there's kind of two things. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6979.68s)]
*  Like number one, I feel like I'm obligated. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6983.2s)]
*  And I wouldn't say this for you, but I think this is true for me. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6987.84s)]
*  I think I'm obligated to do like at least several debates a year. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6991.12s)]
*  Um, and I think that, I think that if I'm going to go on shows like your show [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6995.08s)]
*  and Rogan show and, and Tucker's show and you know, Candice or whoever else, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=6998.56s)]
*  you know, Patrick, but David and Tim pool, I go on these big shows for long form [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7002.92s)]
*  things and I'm sitting there and I'm being like, okay, it's like this, like, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7007.36s)]
*  and this is, and I think it's like this and that then if I'm going to do that, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7010.56s)]
*  I kind of have an obligation to like test myself against someone being like, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7013.96s)]
*  no, it's not like that. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7018.24s)]
*  And then, you know, like showing that I think I can stand up to these, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7019.64s)]
*  these kinds of challenges. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7024.52s)]
*  So I feel like I'm kind of obligated, but then I do like, there is a feeling to [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7026.16s)]
*  it where you're like, Hey man, like this is not, my career is not a joke. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7029.68s)]
*  Like I got little kids. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7033.68s)]
*  This is how I support them, you know? [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7035.0s)]
*  And like, I am kind of taking my career in my hands every time I go do one of [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7036.88s)]
*  these debates. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7042.12s)]
*  Like if I just get smoked and this guy's just totally beats me up, it's like, [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7042.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7048.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7048.84s)]
*  How are you? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7049.36s)]
*  How's anyone going to look at me again? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7049.88s)]
*  After that, you'd be like, Oh, you acted like you had such a good point. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7051.24s)]
*  And then this guy just totally destroyed your point. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7054.8s)]
*  So, but that then kind of motivates me to be like, okay, I got to really be on [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7057.12s)]
*  point. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7064.44s)]
*  I got to really make sure I've done my homework. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7064.76s)]
*  I got to make sure my arguments really tight. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7066.599999999999s)]
*  I got to think about this thing from all ends. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7068.599999999999s)]
*  And then on the other level, it's like, if someone can do that to me, then kind [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7070.88s)]
*  of that's the way the movie is supposed to end. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7074.72s)]
*  You know, like if you, if I, if there is some hole in my argument that I'm just [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7077.320000000001s)]
*  not thinking of, and then someone else can point it out to me and I got no [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7081.360000000001s)]
*  response to it, then I kind of deserve to be humiliated publicly for that. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7084.400000000001s)]
*  So, all right. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7088.56s)]
*  And I don't know that it's kind of exciting in a way. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7090.320000000001s)]
*  Cause the movie ends at some point. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7092.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7094.400000000001s)]
*  Unless you and your genius friends can figure out how to, you know, give us [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7095.96s)]
*  eternal life or something. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7099.04s)]
*  I don't think I want to live. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7100.04s)]
*  I don't think I want to live forever. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7101.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, I think, I think flirting with that idea too much is dangerous. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7103.36s)]
*  This kind of a trans humanism kind of idea. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7108.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7112.0s)]
*  It's not a good way of thinking. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7113.4s)]
*  And of course I do want to heal diseases and extend human life, especially [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7115.64s)]
*  high quality of human life. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7121.76s)]
*  But yeah, if we could live, if we could be in like much better shape and much [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7123.64s)]
*  healthier and like extend life by a few decades, I think that would be great. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7128.04s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7132.96s)]
*  I think there's supposed to be an expiration date on it. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7133.92s)]
*  I think we're supposed to, we're supposed to, um, there's something about like, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7136.4s)]
*  uh, scarcity being a necessary component in a lot of different fields. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7140.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7146.04s)]
*  Where it's like, uh, the life itself. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7146.68s)]
*  Having a finite amount of time on it, I think makes it more precious. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7151.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7155.44s)]
*  At the individual level and then at the societal level, it just does seem like [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7155.92s)]
*  death is the way you get new ideas. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7160.92s)]
*  It's like people kind of solidify their ideas and are unwilling to change their [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7163.92s)]
*  mind and the only way you get ideas, right. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7167.88s)]
*  The next generation has to take them over. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7170.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7172.68s)]
*  You have to keep turning. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7173.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7175.24s)]
*  Speaking of the trolls and, uh, Israel, I got to ask you about this. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7175.56s)]
*  Let's talk about Jeffrey Epstein. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7180.04s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7181.88s)]
*  I recently got attacked, uh, because a conversation, a couple of conversations [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7182.4s)]
*  I had with Tim Dillon three and four years ago, I loved him done. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7186.16s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7191.36s)]
*  I loved him too. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7192.16s)]
*  I've known, I've known Tim for many years. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7193.2s)]
*  Love that guy. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7195.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7197.0s)]
*  So we, I bring up Jeffrey Epstein often because, uh, there's a, there's a [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7197.599999999999s)]
*  fascinating study of evil to me, uh, whichever angle you take on it. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7202.599999999999s)]
*  And I think they're partially to talk shit, but, uh, I showed some skepticism [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7207.92s)]
*  that he's connected to Mossad. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7213.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, so to me, there's three and I've evolved on that since then. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7217.0s)]
*  Uh, by the way, I'm not actually sure it's massage. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7222.2s)]
*  It could be any intelligence agencies. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7224.96s)]
*  It could be CIA, but I was wondering if you could educate me. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7226.5599999999995s)]
*  I did a little research on this last night. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7229.32s)]
*  I looked into it a little more and then I saw that you said he's definitely [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7231.0s)]
*  massage. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7233.76s)]
*  Well, I don't know if I'd say, I didn't say he was definitely [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7234.4s)]
*  massage. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7236.8s)]
*  I don't know my exact. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7237.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I made one kind of jokey posts as is the case with almost any, um, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7238.28s)]
*  intelligence operation. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7244.68s)]
*  It. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7247.4800000000005s)]
*  Look, I don't want to like poo poo anybody's hopes here because I guess like [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7249.2s)]
*  the JFK files, uh, just got released and supposedly the rest of the Epstein [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7252.4400000000005s)]
*  files are coming out and there's a lot of, um, there's a major yearning right [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7256.6s)]
*  now to get to the end of the movie where we find out everything that happened, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7261.76s)]
*  you know, and that I think it's great that people have that desire and I hope [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7266.04s)]
*  more and more does come out. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7270.88s)]
*  I think the truth is that with any intelligence operations, we're probably [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7272.36s)]
*  never going to know all of the details of exactly what happened. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7276.48s)]
*  The funny thing about intelligence agencies and I've been regularly accused [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7280.12s)]
*  of being CIA, FSB or massage, depending on the group that's attacking me. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7283.64s)]
*  Uh, but I think it's a fascinating topic and it's very difficult to know [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7288.68s)]
*  somebody's intelligence. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7293.0s)]
*  But if you have any nuance, I want to discuss the nuances, then the, the, the, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7294.44s)]
*  the, the common is going to be that guy for sure. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7299.2s)]
*  If we're talking about massage or so on. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7302.76s)]
*  But yeah, that's one of the things I didn't know. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7305.24s)]
*  And I saw the, what is it? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7307.08s)]
*  Alex Acosta said that, uh, basically mentioned that Epstein is intelligence. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7308.5199999999995s)]
*  That to me is like, okay, that's the piece of evidence. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7314.92s)]
*  That's a really valuable piece of evidence that he's intelligence. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7317.48s)]
*  And that was very, uh, not just intelligent, but a massage because that, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7320.839999999999s)]
*  before that I thought it might be CIA. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7324.719999999999s)]
*  Cause that's, I kind of heard. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7326.879999999999s)]
*  Quite possible that he was working with elements of both. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7329.36s)]
*  I mean, as I think is, is often the case. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7331.759999999999s)]
*  I also think that's something that people get a little bit wrong. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7334.0s)]
*  Like when they think like, okay, this guy was CIA or this guy was massage. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7336.719999999999s)]
*  And then there's also, I think there's the possibility that there are rogue [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7340.96s)]
*  elements within those organizations. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7344.0s)]
*  Like this is not necessarily coming from the director or, or what, you know, I, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7346.2s)]
*  I don't know, but you look at the guy, the way his, his career trajectory tracks [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7350.36s)]
*  is like completely unexplainable outside of being connected to intelligence. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7358.16s)]
*  Like, it's not just like the one or two people saying that he's intelligence. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7362.08s)]
*  It's like, dude, the idea that you're just like, you have no experience [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7365.32s)]
*  and you're a teacher at Dalton, which is like this incredibly elite, uh, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7368.8s)]
*  New York city private school. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7374.12s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're at Bayer Stearns and like, within two years [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7375.84s)]
*  you've like made partner and you've made, you're worth hundreds of millions of [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7379.08s)]
*  dollars and nobody knows where you made your money for this just doesn't happen. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7382.32s)]
*  And then you're just in, you're just inserted into this world with all of the [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7386.16s)]
*  most like highest level political leaders and cultural figures and stuff. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7389.76s)]
*  But the thing that's amazing about the Jeffrey Epstein story is that it's like [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7394.0s)]
*  the level of evil and the level of corruption that it exposes no matter what [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7399.0s)]
*  the answer is, like no matter what the answer is, it's, you're going to, you, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7405.08s)]
*  you're going to tell me that there was a pedophile ring in our country that [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7408.88s)]
*  involved, I mean, listen, dude, if you had said this shit before it came out, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7416.6s)]
*  this would have been the wildest conspiracy theory, but a pedophile ring [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7419.92s)]
*  that involves the most powerful people in the United States of America and in [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7424.76s)]
*  the world to some degree, touching the royal family, the Clintons, like all [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7429.4800000000005s)]
*  these people and that this was known and covered up and then allowed to continue. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7433.96s)]
*  I mean, like the, there's a blackmail operation that relies on [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7440.88s)]
*  raping American children. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7446.6s)]
*  And, and like, if this is, uh, you know, whether it's CIA or Mossad doesn't [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7449.08s)]
*  make one less, you know, it's equally horrible, but then there's like these [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7454.8s)]
*  elements where like, you're like, okay. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7459.2s)]
*  So when it, when he first got arrested and then he was given a slap on the wrist, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7461.16s)]
*  a slap on the wrist, and then the prosecutor says, well, I was told by the [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7469.08s)]
*  intelligence community that he's intelligence and to go easy on him. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7472.76s)]
*  It's like, oh, okay. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7475.68s)]
*  Okay. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7476.8s)]
*  And, and you didn't resign and discussed that day. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7477.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7481.16s)]
*  Like, I don't think that's too much to ask for. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7481.68s)]
*  You know, there was the, um, the ABC reporter who said that she had the [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7483.72s)]
*  whole story, she was on the hot mic saying she had the whole story. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7487.2s)]
*  And then the network told her to squash it. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7489.8s)]
*  It's like, and you stayed working there. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7491.68s)]
*  Like that's, I'm sorry. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7494.04s)]
*  Like, I'm not asking for, I'm not saying like we're all imperfect and none of us [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7495.360000000001s)]
*  are heroes, but like you're at a news network and you uncovered a child raping [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7499.08s)]
*  ring that implicated the most powerful people in our society and your news [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7504.320000000001s)]
*  network told you, we will not run this story because of our relationship with [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7509.4400000000005s)]
*  the Royal family and you did not resign in disgust that day and take this story [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7514.04s)]
*  to every single independent, independent, you know, outlet that would maybe publish it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7520.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7524.32s)]
*  It's like the thing it's so damning to the entire apparatus that we did not see [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7525.16s)]
*  at the very least see mass resignations over this, forget even like at the very [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7532.6s)]
*  least expect that it would have been prosecuted and shut down and then, you [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7536.64s)]
*  know, still to this day, you know, even it's like, and I think Tucker Carlson [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7540.4s)]
*  just said this recently, but like, and I guess it's a little bit of a weird area [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7544.5599999999995s)]
*  when you're filming people raping children, but what, where are the tapes? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7548.24s)]
*  Why is everyone talking about the flight logs and the files? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7554.679999999999s)]
*  Where are the tapes? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7557.48s)]
*  This guy was clearly taping people to blackmail them. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7558.88s)]
*  Where are those? [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7562.0s)]
*  Is, I don't know what the legal process of this is, but like, cause I think [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7562.679999999999s)]
*  technically it's child porn. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7566.16s)]
*  So like, yeah, okay. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7567.72s)]
*  You can't just like distribute it out and let everybody watch it, but isn't there [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7568.72s)]
*  a way that like somebody has to sit down and watch it and see who is implicated [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7572.12s)]
*  in this and see who, like, I just don't, and there seems to be, there's even, I [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7576.52s)]
*  think there's a lot of LARPing with this administration going on right now on this [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7581.4400000000005s)]
*  topic, but does anybody really expect that we're actually going to get to the bottom [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7584.96s)]
*  of this? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7589.0s)]
*  Cause I don't. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7589.240000000001s)]
*  And that in itself just tells you what a sham this whole goddamn system is. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7590.360000000001s)]
*  One of the things that's so amazing about the Jeffrey Epstein story, right? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7594.96s)]
*  This is, I mean, you have all of that. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7597.52s)]
*  And then of course the end of it, which is just like, wait a minute. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7598.8s)]
*  Wait, what? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7601.76s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7602.64s)]
*  He's in like the most secure, like prison. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7603.0s)]
*  And then he gets the cameras go out and the correctional officers don't fill out [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7606.76s)]
*  the log and he's found dead. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7612.84s)]
*  I mean, it's the most like, it's just, but when you look at it in totality, there's [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7614.68s)]
*  just like no getting around the huge indictment it is of this entire, like [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7618.84s)]
*  everything. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7624.080000000001s)]
*  And I mean, even the fact that even the Trump administration, when Pam Bondi [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7625.16s)]
*  goes, we're going to release all of this information. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7631.8s)]
*  We've only redacted what needs to be redacted for national security. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7634.08s)]
*  Like, why does anything need to be redacted for national security? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7637.92s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, you're telling me there's a pedophile ring and we can't tell you [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7641.4800000000005s)]
*  everything about it for national security. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7645.04s)]
*  Why would that be related to national security? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7646.88s)]
*  I mean, there's just, it's like, and I do think there's something and it's very [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7649.2s)]
*  interesting because, you know, like we talked briefly, was that on air before we [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7653.04s)]
*  were talking about, we were talking about Sam Harris kind of like criticized me a [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7657.28s)]
*  little bit for not having the credentials to talk about some of this stuff, which [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7659.84s)]
*  you know, like I even said, okay, he's got a point. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7662.76s)]
*  But it's like, one of the things that like guys like Sam Harris will talk about a [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7665.36s)]
*  lot is that like, look, we need trust in institutions. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7669.64s)]
*  And this is his big thing where he goes, you know, these people like Joe Rogan [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7674.6s)]
*  and Dave Smith are just tearing down the institutions. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7677.52s)]
*  And while I recognize that's an issue, I also think we need trust in these [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7679.72s)]
*  institutions. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7682.84s)]
*  It's like, well, it's like, yeah, but what? [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7683.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7685.400000000001s)]
*  Well, if you talk in that tone, then it means you're not being emotional and [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7685.64s)]
*  you're only being logical and rational, which is like, I actually don't think is [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7688.360000000001s)]
*  appropriate when you're talking about a child rapist ring, but whatever. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7691.56s)]
*  Um, that's my take on it, but it's like, okay, so where, where are these [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7695.16s)]
*  institutions I'm supposed to trust, man? [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7698.64s)]
*  You're telling me there's a pedophile ring that is at least in some degree [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7701.360000000001s)]
*  associated with national security. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7704.92s)]
*  Like what the, and how could you possibly have this story? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7707.32s)]
*  Like if you did care about, um, the trust in institutions, then you should be even [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7711.16s)]
*  louder than me talking about like, you gotta tell the truth on this story. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7716.2s)]
*  Otherwise we'll never have trust in these institutions. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7719.72s)]
*  I'm the same, actually. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7721.6s)]
*  I believe in institutions. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7722.32s)]
*  Like I, I think they have out. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7723.92s)]
*  So this is where you and I probably disagree on the libertarian side. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7725.72s)]
*  I think it's, I think institutions, if they're run efficiently can, right. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7729.08s)]
*  Who's the utopian now? [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7734.84s)]
*  That's right. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7736.16s)]
*  I mean, there is a utopian notion to it for sure, but, uh, because it's very [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7736.64s)]
*  possible that bureaucracies always destroy the productivity and the [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7740.44s)]
*  effectiveness of institutions as possible. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7743.24s)]
*  It's a Lord Atkin kind of power corrupts type deal. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7745.16s)]
*  And it's, you're absolutely right. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7748.16s)]
*  If you believe in institutions, you should be, you should want to [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7749.96s)]
*  release everything about Epstein. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7753.04s)]
*  You should want to be transparent, uh, as much as possible. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7754.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7758.599999999999s)]
*  I, but the one thing I'm, and it is very suspicious, so I'm more and more [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7758.839999999999s)]
*  becoming convinced that there's some intelligence agency connected to it. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7763.599999999999s)]
*  But I also want to like setting that aside, just comment on one thing where, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7767.84s)]
*  again, it's super entertaining, but people say about me that I came out of [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7775.320000000001s)]
*  nowhere and that's proof that I'm intelligence. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7779.88s)]
*  So first of all, there is a track record of where I came from, quote unquote. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7784.6s)]
*  There's just people are too lazy. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7788.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7790.200000000001s)]
*  And there is something sexy about like just saying fog and massage. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7790.64s)]
*  Oh, he's denying it. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7794.68s)]
*  Fogging massage. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7796.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7797.32s)]
*  By the way, the massage thing is a new thing. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7797.88s)]
*  It used to be a FSB and CIA. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7799.4s)]
*  Uh, what do I want to say about that? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7802.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7804.48s)]
*  I've been gradually growing in popularity over the past 10 years. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7804.8s)]
*  I've been doing, uh, interviews, lectures, podcasts, and they've been just, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7811.08s)]
*  it's actually very gradual and I don't know what else to say. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7816.88s)]
*  There's something I know I've experienced this too, right? [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7821.32s)]
*  Like there's such a difference in perspective because like, if somebody, [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7823.32s)]
*  like if somebody just found me and they just found out who I am and they go, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7826.92s)]
*  this guy's brand new and he's doing like all these shows, but you're like, yeah, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7831.84s)]
*  well, I don't know, dude, not from my perspective, I'm not brand new. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7835.2s)]
*  Like, dude, I've been doing, I've been doing standup comedy for 19 years and [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7838.36s)]
*  I've been podcasting for like 15 years. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7841.84s)]
*  And you're like, and then when it like starts taking off, everybody's like, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7844.0s)]
*  this guy just came out of nowhere. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7847.0s)]
*  And you're like, I mean, all right. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7848.4400000000005s)]
*  I wish, I wish I had been aware that it was all this quick, but look, a lot of [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7850.04s)]
*  this stuff with, with so much of this too, it's just laziness and people searching [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7854.88s)]
*  for confirmation bias and people searching for a simpler story because that's easier. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7859.88s)]
*  So if you're, if they believe that Epstein was Massad and there's a clip of you [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7865.84s)]
*  where you're like, ah, I don't know about that. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7870.400000000001s)]
*  Then they go see he's Massad too. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7872.24s)]
*  And now that fits perfectly into my little story. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7874.0s)]
*  And I know the truth is that it's quite possible that people just aren't convinced. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7876.4400000000005s)]
*  However, given enough time, Tim Dillon is always right about everything. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7880.8s)]
*  So you got that. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7884.8s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7885.6s)]
*  Eventually you'll have to admit that he got it right. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7886.08s)]
*  Uh, and you know, not to say the cliche cheesy thing, but it is true that the [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7889.56s)]
*  comedian sometimes say, say the obvious thing that people are a little resistant [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7894.4400000000005s)]
*  to say, then as I'm being, uh, being true, now we just landed some more credibility [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7899.88s)]
*  to Tim Dillon's insanity. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7904.0s)]
*  Great. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7906.400000000001s)]
*  Now I do want to comment on the, there's the other aspect of me that came out of [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7907.2s)]
*  nowhere fine, but I do get to talk to world leaders, which I have to really [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7912.72s)]
*  admit, I don't understand why. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7918.84s)]
*  So the experience I've had is you basically gain a reputation. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7920.88s)]
*  Like I talked to a lot of scientists early on, you get a reputation like that. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7929.360000000001s)]
*  This is, this is a interesting person to talk to and that travels. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7932.68s)]
*  And then over time you just, you get fans and world leaders are humans too. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7938.320000000001s)]
*  Like they listen to this stuff and sometimes it's their family that listen. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7945.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7948.64s)]
*  Oftentimes, right? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7948.76s)]
*  Like their kids, it seems to be a big one. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7949.4800000000005s)]
*  And so that's just how it happens. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7951.76s)]
*  And so you sent an email, Hey, you want to talk? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7953.84s)]
*  And then the, their team or them directly in several cases, they just respond. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7956.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7961.76s)]
*  And then that's it. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7962.4800000000005s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7963.400000000001s)]
*  And they're like, they're, they're human beings. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7964.84s)]
*  And I think a lot of them as human beings are exhausted by journalists, but [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7966.52s)]
*  shitty journalists, I should say that. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7972.8s)]
*  And it's hard for them to know which is the good journalist by good. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7974.4800000000005s)]
*  There's the cynical view that they want. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7979.240000000001s)]
*  They want somebody who's just going to spot propaganda that [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7982.120000000001s)]
*  aligned with their propaganda. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7985.4800000000005s)]
*  No, they just want a good faith person in front of them. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7986.72s)]
*  Now, like, and I should also say that there, no single world leader has [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7989.56s)]
*  told me which questions to ask. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7993.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no, there's this meme about my conversation with Modi that's scripted. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=7995.52s)]
*  Nope. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8001.08s)]
*  There was zero oversight. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8001.76s)]
*  I have full control. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8003.52s)]
*  Well, it's also like, there's, I mean, obviously one of the major dynamics, which [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8004.92s)]
*  is just like one of the most interesting kind of themes in the world, I think right [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8009.56s)]
*  now, but it's particularly true in America is that like the corporate media is just [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8015.76s)]
*  shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and this whatever this is, which is so weird [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8023.68s)]
*  that we still all call them podcasts because that's just not the right name [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8030.0s)]
*  for them at all. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8033.88s)]
*  And none of us have had an iPod in quite a long time. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8034.72s)]
*  And like, I don't know. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8037.6s)]
*  It's just such a, like the first thing a person came up with it. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8038.44s)]
*  It's a cast on an iPod. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8041.04s)]
*  It's a podcast. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8042.44s)]
*  And we all still use that term, even though it's, but whatever these, these [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8043.6s)]
*  shows on the internet have the audience. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8047.08s)]
*  And so that's a big factor, just that it's like, Oh, this is where you can go to [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8049.84s)]
*  the audience. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8052.68s)]
*  And then I would say, and I don't know exactly, like, I have no idea. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8053.320000000001s)]
*  I should say the motivations inside any individual's heads, but I would say, like [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8056.68s)]
*  in the case of Vladimir Putin, he is completely blacked out in American media. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8060.92s)]
*  And to the point that even RT has been blocked out, they, they never play any of [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8067.56s)]
*  his speeches. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8071.320000000001s)]
*  They never allow you to hear like, look, this is what this guy's perspective is. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8071.92s)]
*  It's a, it's very interesting in the same way that they kind of all flipped out [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8076.84s)]
*  when Osama bin Laden's letter to America went viral on, on Tik TOK and, um, you [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8081.12s)]
*  know, then all the talks of banning Tik TOK increased and stuff. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8086.72s)]
*  So for him, say like when he did the Tucker interview, or if he does an [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8089.88s)]
*  interview with you, well, that's a way for him to do an end around and allow [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8093.12s)]
*  his perspective to be hurt, which I personally think is like, obviously a [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8097.04s)]
*  good thing, like if you're going to go into war and we're kind of at a war with [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8102.16s)]
*  Russia right now, you should know what is the other guy's perspective is not that [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8105.16s)]
*  you should take it as gospel, but, and then from Netanyahu's perspective, I [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8109.96s)]
*  would imagine, you know, they, Israel has a lot of control in a lot of different [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8113.92s)]
*  areas, but they have been losing the internet battle very, very badly. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8121.24s)]
*  And it's a major problem for Israel. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8128.36s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8130.12s)]
*  I still think, I think, you know, very strange way. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8131.04s)]
*  Everybody seems to be under underestimating how grave the implications of all of [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8134.64s)]
*  this are, but Israel, the view of Israel from the world is never going to be the [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8139.48s)]
*  same at what it was before the entire, and the generational divide on it is so stark. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8143.599999999999s)]
*  Like everybody, you know, 40 and under who very quickly, you know, the time [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8148.4s)]
*  goes by quickly, pretty soon that's, you know, the, the 40 and over crowd gets [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8153.32s)]
*  aged out pretty quickly, and this is just, it's never going to be the perception of [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8157.36s)]
*  Israel that my parents' generation had ever again because of this war. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8162.12s)]
*  And, you know, I'm sure to some degree, at least Netanyahu is like, feels like [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8166.4s)]
*  he has to try to get his perspective into that internet conversation area. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8171.72s)]
*  And so I think a lot of different people, you know, obviously it was a [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8178.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's it's in a way it's kind of shocking. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8180.84s)]
*  And, and I guess kind of, um, Bobby Kennedy, when he was running for president [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8184.24s)]
*  and Vivek Ramaswamy, when he was running for president, they kind of were doing [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8188.0s)]
*  some of it even before Donald Trump was. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8191.72s)]
*  But it is kind of crazy in a way that it took this long for politicians to figure [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8193.72s)]
*  out that it's like, Oh, well, I guess we got to go where the audience is. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8199.0s)]
*  That's the point of doing shows. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8203.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8204.92s)]
*  I mean, like, would you rather do a show, you know, like with a million [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8205.279999999999s)]
*  people or with 10 million people? [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8209.439999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, okay, you guys do CNN all the time. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8211.039999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do Joe Rogan's podcast? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8213.76s)]
*  It's just a bigger audience and those people get to vote too. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8215.92s)]
*  You reminded me with Netanyahu that one of the goals I have with the podcast is [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8220.08s)]
*  to have the kind of conversation that a historian would find useful 20 years from [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8225.640000000001s)]
*  now, which is tough to do because you're going to get punished for it. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8230.800000000001s)]
*  Cause it's mostly, I want to reveal as much information as possible without [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8238.16s)]
*  the signaling, without the issue. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8241.24s)]
*  I want to know who was this person. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8243.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think, I think that's, that's exactly right. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8245.16s)]
*  And I think this was kind of what Daryl was saying. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8247.880000000001s)]
*  I think that the part of the awful thing of always using world war [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8250.6s)]
*  two as the next example for the next war is that it's almost like you're never. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8255.08s)]
*  This is, you know, they hate us for our freedom or Vladimir Putin's just mad and [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8261.16s)]
*  he wants to reconstitute the Soviet union. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8265.36s)]
*  It's like you, they always insist that we can never treat our enemies as people [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8267.52s)]
*  and be like, this is a real person with real grievances and even they [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8272.48s)]
*  might be a fanatic also. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8275.64s)]
*  Like I'm not saying they're not, but it's just like that there, there are these [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8276.96s)]
*  like human qualities to it. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8280.519999999999s)]
*  And it's always like, you know, whatever, even when they were going, um, before [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8282.56s)]
*  they did the, uh, Obama and Hillary Clinton did the regime change war in Libya. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8286.359999999999s)]
*  It was like, oh, this propaganda, he's buying up Viagra to rape all the women [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8291.279999999999s)]
*  and he's going to go genocide. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8296.24s)]
*  This guy would been in power for decades. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8297.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8299.48s)]
*  Like it hadn't done that. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8300.119999999999s)]
*  And it was just like, oh, it's like the way you're supposed to think about war [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8301.64s)]
*  is almost like these people have been possessed by pure evil. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8305.84s)]
*  They are monsters and there's no talking to them. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8309.76s)]
*  There's no dealing with them. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8312.8s)]
*  It's just simply this, but well, a good example, just this recent conflict with [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8313.84s)]
*  the Houthis where you have the Houthis in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia invaded in [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8319.199999999999s)]
*  2015 with the full backing of the United States of America, the Houthis maintain [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8325.039999999999s)]
*  power for eight years through that. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8329.64s)]
*  They maintain power until this, until the Saudis finally gave up. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8331.4s)]
*  And it was literally like the Saudis were just killing hundreds of thousands of [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8334.68s)]
*  people and then the Houthis would like, get like a drone off at one of their oil [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8337.24s)]
*  refineries or something like that. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8341.6s)]
*  And then eventually they were just doing enough damage that it was like, ah, shit. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8342.960000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8346.44s)]
*  This isn't worth it anymore. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8346.880000000001s)]
*  And so they end it. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8348.28s)]
*  And so anyway, you have this thing, you're like, okay, so if they did, if they [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8349.640000000001s)]
*  went through a total war for eight years, we think Trump sent in a few Tomahawk [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8352.6s)]
*  missiles over there is gonna stop them from doing this. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8356.6s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8359.92s)]
*  But then they didn't do anything. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8360.36s)]
*  And there's according to all reporting on it, they didn't do [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8364.0s)]
*  anything during the ceasefire. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8366.44s)]
*  It was only once the ceasefire broke down that they went back to attacking ships [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8368.32s)]
*  again that were coming through. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8372.119999999999s)]
*  So you just see this thing where you're like, it's not saying right or wrong or [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8373.32s)]
*  who's good or bad. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8377.28s)]
*  It's like, look, sometimes there's a diplomatic solution and there's not a [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8378.28s)]
*  military solution. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8382.119999999999s)]
*  And like, in this case, you're like, it just shows you, okay, if there was a [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8383.48s)]
*  ceasefire here, these guys will chill out. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8386.24s)]
*  What do you want to do again? [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8388.44s)]
*  Do you want to go to total war with it? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8389.720000000001s)]
*  Cause like, okay, we could overthrow the Houthis. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8391.2s)]
*  If the U S invades Yemen, like that's kind of what it would take. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8394.36s)]
*  It's like, does anyone here really have the appetite for another catastrophic war [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8398.32s)]
*  in the middle East against the poorest country in the middle East, you know, or [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8402.04s)]
*  we could pursue this diplomatic route, which seemed at least, I mean, I'm just [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8406.4s)]
*  saying based on the evidence that they weren't attacking ships during the [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8409.92s)]
*  ceasefire seems like there could be a diplomatic solution here. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8412.92s)]
*  And so there's just like a lot. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8416.4s)]
*  And the problem is when you don't like. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8417.400000000001s)]
*  If you make everybody monsters and they're not human beings, well, you can't [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8421.560000000001s)]
*  do diplomacy with monsters. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8425.52s)]
*  You can't make a deal. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8427.480000000001s)]
*  You can't negotiate with monsters, but you can with humans. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8428.28s)]
*  And like, you know, I'm sure there are, you know, like to our earlier discussion, [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8432.16s)]
*  like maybe there are times where you're not, you shouldn't negotiate or you can't [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8435.720000000001s)]
*  negotiate with humans, but it's better if you can. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8438.28s)]
*  And we could use a lot more of that thinking. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8441.92s)]
*  Can we take that idea and move to the war in Ukraine? [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8446.28s)]
*  Sure. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8449.640000000001s)]
*  What do you think is the path for peace there? [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8450.04s)]
*  Well, I think what Trump is pursuing is like infinitely preferable to what [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8452.52s)]
*  Biden was doing, you know, what puts Donald Trump and, and I don't think [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8459.04s)]
*  everything he's done has been perfect. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8463.32s)]
*  Um, and I really did not like that mineral deal that he was floating out for a while [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8465.6s)]
*  there, and I think maybe that might be the best thing that came out of that oval [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8470.76s)]
*  office thing is that maybe that, you know, Donald Trump was going to be very [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8474.16s)]
*  tough to do business like this. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8477.16s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, we shouldn't be doing this business deal anyway. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8478.32s)]
*  Um, but, and by the way, I don't think we should do it on a few re number one, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8481.32s)]
*  principally, I think it is kind of like bullying Ukraine out of resources. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8486.48s)]
*  And from what I understand, they don't even have that many like fine [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8490.88s)]
*  minerals, but whatever. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8493.96s)]
*  Um, but it's also like, well, look, if he's, he was selling it to the [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8495.36s)]
*  Lewinsky is that's kind of a security guarantee, you know, cause like, Hey, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8499.84s)]
*  if we're in business, then if Putin messes with you, he's messing with us. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8503.28s)]
*  But from my perspective, like that's the whole point is you don't want to get [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8506.28s)]
*  into the business of giving out security guarantees. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8509.08s)]
*  I mean, this is a real, this is why George Washington was against [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8511.6s)]
*  entangling alliances. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8514.52s)]
*  Like you give out war guarantees to too many places. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8515.800000000001s)]
*  You might have to fight a lot more wars than you otherwise would have fought. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8518.68s)]
*  And also like there's simply, we're in this weird position where America [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8521.52s)]
*  postures like they're so tough, but really when it comes down to it, we're [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8525.320000000002s)]
*  not going to war in Ukraine. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8528.880000000001s)]
*  There's no political will here. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8530.76s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8532.12s)]
*  It tried to convince the American people. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8532.880000000001s)]
*  We should send our boys to get, like, I understand you're from the region, but [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8534.720000000001s)]
*  like for you, or you have roots from there, but like to the average American, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8538.240000000002s)]
*  the idea of going to war over whether Luhansk is ruled by Kiev or Moscow is [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8543.04s)]
*  just, they don't even know what Luhansk is. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8548.04s)]
*  And if they met someone from there, we'd probably just assume they were Russian. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8551.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8554.160000000002s)]
*  Like they were, and they might be, but whatever. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8554.720000000001s)]
*  I think the first step to a path to peace is that you have to want to get a path to [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8556.640000000001s)]
*  peace. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8560.800000000001s)]
*  So I think Trump's doing a good job in that. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8561.64s)]
*  Do you think all three sides want peace from what you understand? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8563.800000000001s)]
*  Obviously Trump legitimately fully with an urgency wants peace. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8566.44s)]
*  I think for sure Trump wants peace. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8571.0s)]
*  I also think Putin wants to wrap the conflict up. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8573.64s)]
*  And I think that Putin has, Putin has been willing to deal for the entire lead [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8577.2s)]
*  up to the war and pretty much throughout the war. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8583.960000000001s)]
*  And there's been a lot of solid reporting on this. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8586.72s)]
*  And I mean, the sources on it are pretty impeccable. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8589.04s)]
*  The, the head of NATO, Stoltenberg, I always mess up his name, but he literally [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8591.24s)]
*  said that in late 2021 that Vladimir Putin actually sent a draft agreement to [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8597.2s)]
*  NATO and that his condition for not invading is like, I will not invade, but [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8604.96s)]
*  you have to put it in writing. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8609.96s)]
*  Like he sent a draft treaty to them. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8611.24s)]
*  You have to put in writing that Ukraine will not join NATO. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8613.36s)]
*  And then Stoltenberg bragged about how he said, no, because we, we won't let [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8616.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin dictate to us whether we can expand NATO or not. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8622.96s)]
*  And then he was bragging. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8626.56s)]
*  He was like, and look what he got more NATO expansion, Finland and this and that. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8627.24s)]
*  So look at that. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8630.76s)]
*  It didn't even seem to notice like that. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8631.88s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8634.16s)]
*  You're admitting that you could have just promised not to bring Ukraine into NATO [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8634.68s)]
*  and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8638.84s)]
*  Seems like it would have been a much better deal. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8641.0s)]
*  It's gonna be a much better deal than what Ukraine will ultimately end up getting. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8642.84s)]
*  So I do think, I think also the Joe Biden's CIA director, who was a CIA, CIA [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8646.72s)]
*  directors whole four years, uh, uh, William Burns, uh, when he was ambassador [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8652.56s)]
*  to Russia, he wrote the net means yet. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8657.199999999999s)]
*  And in the memo, and again, this was dumped by Julian Assange. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8659.24s)]
*  This wasn't for the public. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8662.32s)]
*  This was just him writing to Condoleezza Rice to tell the secretary of state, his [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8663.76s)]
*  assessment, and he said that his exact words were a decision Russia does not [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8667.8s)]
*  want to have to make. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8672.84s)]
*  And this was the decision about whether to invade Ukraine or not. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8674.439999999999s)]
*  And he was like, they say, if you keep pushing for Ukrainian entry into NATO, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8677.439999999999s)]
*  this could lead to a civil war and even worse. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8681.759999999998s)]
*  And in that situation, Russia would have to decide whether or not to intervene a [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8684.439999999999s)]
*  decision Russia does not want to have to make. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8688.759999999998s)]
*  So essentially it's like, I think it's pretty clear from all sides that Putin [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8691.439999999999s)]
*  didn't want it to come to this. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8695.679999999998s)]
*  And, and look, I mean, even after the coup in 2014, he, he took Crimea. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8697.359999999999s)]
*  But he didn't invade the country. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8703.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, he sent, he may have sent special forces in, but I mean, not the full [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8704.92s)]
*  scale 2022 invasion and even the civil war going all that, you know, he did. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8708.16s)]
*  It seemed like he, I'm not defending the decision. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8713.679999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying it seemed like he reluctantly, uh, debate, you know, what [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8716.64s)]
*  was it in 2014 or 15 when they had the plebiscites in Crimea and in the Donbass [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8720.4s)]
*  region and they voted to be independent. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8726.679999999998s)]
*  He didn't take them then. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8729.759999999998s)]
*  I mean, he could have used that as a pretense for like, Hey, they [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8731.28s)]
*  voted to be with us and he didn't. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8734.44s)]
*  I think he wants to end the war. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8736.48s)]
*  Zelensky from everything he said publicly seems like he still feels like, uh, I [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8738.32s)]
*  mean, I'm just taking them at his word here that it's like, well, no, look, like [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8747.0s)]
*  we could end the war, but we got to end the war. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8750.800000000001s)]
*  It seems like he's moved from his position being like, no, we have to reclaim, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8753.68s)]
*  reclaim all of our territory to now his position is kind of like, all right, maybe [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8757.960000000001s)]
*  we don't reclaim all of it, but we got to be given some type of security [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8762.16s)]
*  guarantee in the future. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8765.04s)]
*  I think the problem with that is just again, like, I don't mean to be cruel [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8767.28s)]
*  about this because like it sucks that there's little countries that are next [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8773.48s)]
*  to big countries that kind of get bullied around about them, but there also is a [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8776.24s)]
*  bit of an entitlement to demanding a security guarantee. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8779.68s)]
*  Like what exactly do you mean? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8783.24s)]
*  The from America, what that will go to war if you're invaded. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8786.199999999999s)]
*  Why are, why do we owe that to anybody? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8789.68s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8792.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8793.279999999999s)]
*  You can just sign up to say that we'll go to war if anybody invades anybody. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8794.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, I hope nobody invades anybody, but that I don't want us to get dragged [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8798.4s)]
*  into that. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8802.92s)]
*  That's a recipe for always being at war, you know, and I don't think [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8803.48s)]
*  that's right for our country. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8807.039999999999s)]
*  So essentially I think Trump and Putin want peace. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8809.08s)]
*  And if that's the case, I think we'll ultimately get to an end of this war. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8812.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff to say here. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8816.279999999999s)]
*  Let's say you started the, at the beginning of the foundation of this, I [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8817.88s)]
*  think the thing that we left unsaid, uh, that's important to say is that Putin [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8820.92s)]
*  invaded Ukraine in, uh, February 24th, 2022. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8827.199999999999s)]
*  And I think he is at least from my perspective, the person who started the [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8833.92s)]
*  war, you could talk about NATO expansion. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8839.039999999999s)]
*  You could talk about any other thing that led to it. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8842.08s)]
*  You could start at the collapse of the Soviet union. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8847.84s)]
*  You can go all the way back as he did a thousand years. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8850.44s)]
*  The reality is, and this goes to our deep discussion about the morality of war. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8853.36s)]
*  No matter the reasons, the guy that like pulls the trigger first, non- [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8858.84s)]
*  accidentally and keeps pulling the trigger. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8864.720000000001s)]
*  That's the guy who's a fault. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8866.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8868.64s)]
*  I agree. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8869.08s)]
*  I'll say one standard, like one standard for everybody. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8869.68s)]
*  The standard that I laid out before is the same one I said, it's like, did [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8873.08s)]
*  you absolutely have to do that? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8876.16s)]
*  You know, once you start killing people by the hundreds of thousands, it's [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8878.519999999999s)]
*  like, was there any other option? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8881.32s)]
*  Are you telling me like you absolutely had to do this? [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8883.16s)]
*  Um, and I don't think that's right. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8886.199999999999s)]
*  You know, my, my friend Scott Horton, who I was talking to you about, um, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8888.199999999999s)]
*  who just totally brilliant guy, even in his book, there's a whole chapter of all [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8891.56s)]
*  the other options of what Vladimir Putin could do. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8895.16s)]
*  So you're absolutely right. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8897.48s)]
*  And there's a weird thing where like people say, um, like if you say that the [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8898.8s)]
*  West provoked this conflict, that is a very different thing than saying that [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8903.68s)]
*  this conflict is that this invasion was justified and in the same way that like, [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8908.32s)]
*  you know, if you, if, if you were at a bar and someone goes and spits in another [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8913.519999999999s)]
*  guy's face and then he pulls out a gun and murders them right there, like he's [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8918.76s)]
*  not justified in doing that, that is not okay. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8922.519999999999s)]
*  You don't get to murder someone because they spit in your face. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8925.4s)]
*  Also, if you were talking about like, why did he murder that guy? [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8928.88s)]
*  I'd be like, Oh, cause he walked up and spit in his face. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8932.24s)]
*  That's why it happened. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8934.24s)]
*  And that, that is essentially my contention about this war. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8935.24s)]
*  And it is, I think it's just crystal clear that that's why it happened. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8938.039999999999s)]
*  And listen, it may be right or it may be wrong. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8941.76s)]
*  Um, but if China or Russia ever like backed a street putch to overthrow the [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8944.68s)]
*  democratically elected government in Mexico and then install a pro Chinese or [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8953.720000000001s)]
*  a pro Russian government, and then started pumping arms into that conflict. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8958.720000000001s)]
*  And then kept floating out the idea that they were going to bring them [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8963.880000000001s)]
*  into their military Alliance. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8966.44s)]
*  DC would simply not allow that. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8968.2s)]
*  You cannot do that. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8970.56s)]
*  Any more than the Soviet union could put nukes in Cuba. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8972.32s)]
*  Like, sorry. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8975.08s)]
*  That should be said that that's really cold war, 20th century [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8975.880000000001s)]
*  and Neocon thinking, right? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8979.28s)]
*  It is the way the world works, but like that's, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8980.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think you should still punish. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8983.320000000002s)]
*  I don't think outside of the neoconservatives. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8985.6s)]
*  I listen, whether you're talking about the neoconservatives or going way before [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8988.04s)]
*  the near any other group that has ever had control of us foreign policy, going [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8992.84s)]
*  back to the, um, the cold warriors, the Truman administration, the Eisenhower [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=8997.92s)]
*  administration, I think you could take this back to Thomas Jefferson. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9006.2s)]
*  If this happened in 1801, there is simply no way that they would allow a foreign [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9009.560000000001s)]
*  great power to come bring our neighbor, overthrow their government, and then [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9015.6s)]
*  bring our neighbor into their military Alliance. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9019.84s)]
*  I think there's no great power that would ever tolerate that. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9022.640000000001s)]
*  First of all, we're in a post nuclear world, right? [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9025.32s)]
*  So meaning post there's nuclear weapons. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9027.32s)]
*  So the threat of somebody being on your border is just not the same kind of [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9030.44s)]
*  threat when you're in nuclear power, which is why, you know, you look at Finland. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9034.76s)]
*  No, I think in some ways it's more, it's more of a threat in some ways. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9038.880000000001s)]
*  Well, I think he's not, there's Putin is not upset about Finland joining [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9041.960000000001s)]
*  NATO nearly as much. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9045.48s)]
*  I'm just saying to Vladimir Putin in his own words, what his issue always was, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9047.56s)]
*  was the military hardware that comes along with NATO membership. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9052.960000000001s)]
*  So it's not just that you get into NATO, but then you get all that military [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9056.72s)]
*  hardware there and he made a huge deal about the dual use rocket launchers in [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9059.64s)]
*  Poland, which George W. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9064.2s)]
*  Bush put there after nine 11. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9066.16s)]
*  So I think all of those things are factors. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9068.72s)]
*  I think Ukraine, the Crimea being their only year long warm water port, I think [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9071.24s)]
*  there's like several, you know, like elements to it, but I do think a huge part [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9075.96s)]
*  of it is that they're also the country has been invaded through Ukraine, uh, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9080.0s)]
*  multiple times. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9083.84s)]
*  And so there's just, yeah, it's, it's he, I think very reasonably within the [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9085.0s)]
*  grading on a curve of how reasonable governments are, he saw that as a security [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9091.64s)]
*  threat. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9096.36s)]
*  But I should make very clear cause the way that comes across the full [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9096.6s)]
*  responsibility of the invasion of Ukraine lays at the hands of Vladimir Putin. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9100.960000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9106.56s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9107.04s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is a Vladimir Putin launched a war where again, I don't know [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9108.44s)]
*  exactly what the numbers are. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9114.640000000001s)]
*  I've read a whole bunch of estimates, some that contradict each other, but the [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9115.84s)]
*  consensus seems to be it's at least in the hundreds of thousands, possibly well [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9118.960000000001s)]
*  north of a million. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9124.2s)]
*  If you're talking about the casualties on both sides and Vladimir Putin launched [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9125.320000000002s)]
*  a war that led to that. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9128.92s)]
*  And he's responsible for that. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9130.28s)]
*  That being said, you can also point out that the, you know, really what we're [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9132.08s)]
*  talking about here is the George HW Bush administration, the Clintons, Bush [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9137.52s)]
*  again, Obama, and then Trump and the people who were in charge of the foreign [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9143.720000000001s)]
*  policy in that, in those administrations, the same ones who gave us Iraq, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9148.400000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9152.8s)]
*  They were also in charge of our European foreign policy and they had the most [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9155.24s)]
*  reckless far, the most reckless policy of all was their NATO policy and that they, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9159.359999999999s)]
*  they drove up to this conflict with Russia with nothing but off ramp after [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9165.4s)]
*  off ramp after off ramp and consciously decided that we're not going to take any [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9170.16s)]
*  of those, we're going to drive it all the way up to this point. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9175.24s)]
*  And Thomas Friedman for the New York times interviewed George Kennan in 1998 [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9177.92s)]
*  and this is George Kennan was the, the, um, like the cold warrior. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9182.68s)]
*  He was, he's, he's credited as founding the containment strategy in the cold war. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9187.359999999999s)]
*  And he was talking about, uh, the first round of NATO expansion, which he and [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9193.08s)]
*  many other foreign policy graybeards opposed. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9198.24s)]
*  And he was talking and he was like, this is the worst thing we could possibly do [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9201.4s)]
*  after the fall of the Soviet union to now say that we had this Alliance in NATO. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9205.24s)]
*  That was an anti-Russian military Alliance. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9209.88s)]
*  And now that the Soviet union isn't there anymore and it's Boris Yeltsin's Russia [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9212.679999999998s)]
*  that now we're going to expand NATO because of that. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9217.279999999999s)]
*  And he literally said in 1998, he goes, the people advocating that we expand [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9220.72s)]
*  NATO are going to continue advocating it and advocating it and advocating it. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9225.32s)]
*  And then there will be a Russian reaction. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9229.4s)]
*  And then they'll say, see, that's why we were right to expand NATO, but [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9231.84s)]
*  they'll get this completely wrong. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9235.96s)]
*  When do you think a deal is reached? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9238.199999999999s)]
*  I really have no idea what the timeline is going to look like. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9240.32s)]
*  I'm hoping sooner rather than later. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9242.96s)]
*  I think, like, um, I think Donald Trump would love nothing more than to have some [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9245.44s)]
*  type of like big spectacle of ending this war, some type of big press conference [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9250.8s)]
*  or some type of, you know what I mean? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9256.72s)]
*  And so I'm sure like, if I, my guess would be that's where Trump's mind is, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9258.039999999999s)]
*  is how to do this in the best way that sells him the best. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9262.72s)]
*  And, and, you know, um, but I, I think that already we're in a position where [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9266.160000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has put a lot of political capital chips into the middle of the [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9274.160000000002s)]
*  table that I can end this war, you know, and he's going to look very, very bad [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9280.480000000001s)]
*  if he can't, so he's very highly incentivized to get this thing done as [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9285.160000000002s)]
*  quick as possible. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9289.240000000002s)]
*  And so hopefully, um, that can, that can happen soon. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9290.400000000001s)]
*  It would be great if it could happen in the next month. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9295.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9298.04s)]
*  Um, people on both sides outside of Donald Trump are telling me that it's a, [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9298.32s)]
*  it's a process. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9301.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9303.28s)]
*  There's a kind of implication that's going to, it's going to take a while, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9303.92s)]
*  which I really hate. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9306.6s)]
*  I really love, love Donald Trump's urgency. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9308.0s)]
*  Well, it's also terrible. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9310.6s)]
*  There's something really awful, like, you know, look when innocent people dying [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9311.56s)]
*  in war at any time is, is terrible, but there is something profoundly awful. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9317.16s)]
*  And I've, I'm old enough now that I've seen this a few times happen, or I've [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9321.560000000001s)]
*  lived through it a few times. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9325.32s)]
*  I've read about it happening earlier, but it's like, once you've kind of [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9326.2s)]
*  already decided the war's over and people still die, you know what I mean? [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9328.800000000001s)]
*  There's something almost like sadder about that. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9333.2s)]
*  Cause it's always like, come on, you already know, you know, like when there'd [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9335.04s)]
*  be like a big, you know, there'd be like a bombing campaign in, in, uh, in [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9337.880000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan, like when we all already knew we were a few months away from ending [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9341.880000000001s)]
*  the war, you're like, you gotta kill more people like on the way out. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9346.800000000001s)]
*  We already know we're leaving. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9349.28s)]
*  We already know that because there's something, at least in the beginning, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9351.0s)]
*  they could kind of hide behind this justification or they could be like, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9354.28s)]
*  listen, we're going to overthrow the Taliban and we're going to install [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9357.4s)]
*  our new government, they're going to be a democracy. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9359.92s)]
*  It's going really good. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9361.880000000001s)]
*  We have to do this in order to do this bigger project. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9363.08s)]
*  But then by the end, you're like, we're not even pretending anymore that we're [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9365.36s)]
*  doing anything more positive. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9368.64s)]
*  It's just someone dying in a senseless thing we never should have been in. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9370.04s)]
*  Well, in the spirit of that, that's why I traveled to Moscow and we'll travel to [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9373.84s)]
*  Moscow again in the near future to likely interview Vladimir Putin and, uh, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9376.560000000001s)]
*  hopefully travel back to Ukraine, which I did to, uh, talk again with, with, uh, [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9381.640000000001s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky or, uh, with whoever the future president is. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9387.76s)]
*  You'll be the only guy who's interviewed both of them, I think, during this war. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9393.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9397.76s)]
*  And I have to say the border crossing is getting increasingly more intense. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9398.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, I went, I went to Canada last week and I didn't care for that. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9402.76s)]
*  So I'm sure. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9405.92s)]
*  Primarily it's the nations of war as it was in Ukraine. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9406.960000000001s)]
*  And it's fucking, it's like, it's dangerous to do both. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9410.16s)]
*  It's also like, I think something that, um, I think something that's a little [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9413.960000000001s)]
*  bit foreign, no pun intended to America is, you know, like we've fought in a lot [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9418.32s)]
*  of wars over the last day, 25 years, you know, 50 years, whatever, but all of them, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9425.44s)]
*  um, including in a way, the, the world wars even in the 20th century was like, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9432.16s)]
*  but it's been since 1812 that we fought one on our shores and none of the other [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9438.28s)]
*  ones, I mean, I guess Pearl Harbor, but even Pearl Harbor, that was a one-off [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9445.08s)]
*  and it was only kind, you know, it was America technically, but it wasn't [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9449.08s)]
*  mainland America, you know, and so we're fighting wars like halfway across the [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9452.84s)]
*  world, but it's a very different thing for two neighboring countries to fight. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9459.160000000002s)]
*  And even though most of the fighting has been done on the Ukrainian side, not all [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9463.560000000001s)]
*  of it, like there have, you know, there, I think there still are areas in Russia, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9467.12s)]
*  like inside Russia's borders where there's action. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9471.2s)]
*  And so it's just like, there's something so much more real about that. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9473.640000000001s)]
*  That's not just like, you know, the wars we're used to are we, we send a military [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9477.04s)]
*  that is a hundred thousand times more sophisticated than anything it'll be [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9483.0s)]
*  meeting on the ground over to a third world country to go do that. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9486.44s)]
*  Now, as we've found out over the years, there's still a lot of challenges to that. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9490.2s)]
*  Even when your side has night vision goggles and the other one doesn't and your [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9493.76s)]
*  side can call in airstrikes and the other one can't and your side has all the [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9496.800000000001s)]
*  sophisticated training and the other side's practicing on monkey bars, still [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9500.32s)]
*  very hard to occupy a people and dominate them and defeat an insurgency. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9503.44s)]
*  But that's very different than like two nations states on right next to each [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9507.800000000001s)]
*  other on the border. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9513.8s)]
*  Like there's just a real feeling of like survival in that moment. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9514.64s)]
*  And I do think that probably I don't understand this as well as you do. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9518.92s)]
*  And probably you don't even understand it as well as maybe like an older [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9523.16s)]
*  generation of, of Russians and Ukrainians would, but like, there's also something [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9526.759999999998s)]
*  about like both Russia and Ukraine in their own ways got so absolutely fucked [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9532.48s)]
*  over in the 20th century, multiple times in a way that Americans just, it is just [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9542.0s)]
*  too foreign to us to even understand anything like that, like millions of [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9547.679999999998s)]
*  people starving to death, being invaded, the entire nation collapsing and the [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9551.519999999999s)]
*  Russian government collapsed twice in a hundred years, right? [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9556.599999999999s)]
*  And that's, that's pretty like, that's traumatic. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9560.48s)]
*  And we just simply have never been through anything like that. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9563.279999999999s)]
*  And so if you, when you have that kind of like trauma as a society, and then [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9565.96s)]
*  there's a war on your border, I'm sure there's a whole lot of different kind [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9571.2s)]
*  of feelings that we just can't relate to. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9575.0s)]
*  Plus a history in both nations of super sophisticated and [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9577.68s)]
*  expansive intelligence agencies. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9581.720000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9583.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9584.320000000002s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9584.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9585.28s)]
*  You host a podcast called part of the problem. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9587.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9591.480000000001s)]
*  What have you learned through that whole process of, um, interviewing [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9592.2s)]
*  some interesting people and are there topics you cover that make you sweat? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9595.68s)]
*  Still to this day, it feels like going into the fire. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9600.92s)]
*  What I, what I've learned just from the podcast is that there is, um, there's [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9604.76s)]
*  something, there's an interesting like relationship that you build with your [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9611.32s)]
*  audience. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9614.68s)]
*  Um, and you know, I, I travel a lot and I do shows a lot. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9615.92s)]
*  So like I'll, I meet people who listen to the show and I know, like I've had [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9619.72s)]
*  this experience before I kind of had this experience with you, um, where like [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9624.68s)]
*  me, you know, me and you met once, I think before today we were me and you [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9628.400000000001s)]
*  actually met on a very interesting night. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9633.6s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this, but we were at, um, is before the comedy [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9635.36s)]
*  mothership was built, you came by a Joe Rogan and friends show at the vulture. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9640.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9646.0s)]
*  And it was the, it was while Joe was going through the storm of cancer [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9646.52s)]
*  culture and he was on the phone with Dana White and stuff in the back. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9650.76s)]
*  It was a wild night. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9653.640000000001s)]
*  What a wild night. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9655.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9655.92s)]
*  But then at the same time, right? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9656.32s)]
*  Like, even though we just kind of met that one time and then we talked on the [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9657.56s)]
*  phone and now we're doing this show, I kind of, I know you already. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9661.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9663.72s)]
*  Like I already know you. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9664.12s)]
*  And it's not just that we have friends of friends, but I've just like seen so [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9665.0s)]
*  much of your stuff that it's like, I know who you are. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9667.32s)]
*  And then, and then it's weird cause people come up to you and they're like that. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9670.0s)]
*  It's like, they know you. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9672.96s)]
*  And I've had this experience, I had this experience with, with Joe, like I, I [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9674.16s)]
*  knew him before I knew him. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9676.92s)]
*  And so that was kind of like one of the things that I really learned from doing [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9678.32s)]
*  the podcast over the years was like how much that's actually a relationship. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9681.64s)]
*  Like you actually have a relationship with your listeners and, and almost like [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9685.6s)]
*  in the same way, in the same way that like, you know, you can't lie to people [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9689.08s)]
*  like in your life, you also can't lie to your, like they're a relationship too. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9695.08s)]
*  Like you can't lie to your, your audience. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9699.24s)]
*  And that I think that there's like, there's, there's often almost like kind [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9701.28s)]
*  of shortcuts that are presented before you, but there is a payoff to not taking [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9707.92s)]
*  the shortcuts and to like kind of doing it the way you want to do it. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9712.68s)]
*  What do you think is the number of hours it takes to form a relationship? [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9716.08s)]
*  Cause I absolutely agree with you. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9720.36s)]
*  First of all, I should say I'm a huge podcast fan. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9721.84s)]
*  I've listened to you as a guest and your own show a lot. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9724.76s)]
*  So yeah, there's, I think with you, I've already crossed the threshold of hours [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9727.44s)]
*  where, like, I feel like we're friends one way and I guess, because you [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9731.800000000001s)]
*  listened to me, it's the other way. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9736.64s)]
*  We should have like separate parallel. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9738.08s)]
*  It's very strange in a way. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9740.32s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9741.56s)]
*  And it's also, there's something there, which is more your area of expertise [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9742.8s)]
*  than mine, but there's something there where like technology is playing this [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9746.439999999999s)]
*  wild role, like we could have two, a two way friendship without actually having [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9749.24s)]
*  to meet each other, all facilitated by the machines that we built. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9754.4s)]
*  It's very trippy. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9757.519999999999s)]
*  I think it's probably like, I'll say it's like 50 hours, maybe 20, 20 to [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9759.32s)]
*  50 hour ranges when you're like, okay. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9764.16s)]
*  It's kind of interesting in a way, right? [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9766.4s)]
*  Because like the thing before, like the Joe Rogan experience and what was like [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9767.8s)]
*  kind of the thing that made comedians big, the things before that used to be [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9775.72s)]
*  like Letterman and Leno and Conan, like comedians would get like a seven minute [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9780.08s)]
*  set on there. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9786.279999999999s)]
*  And even if you do great, like if you're just like, you killed and someone [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9788.279999999999s)]
*  watching is like, I love that comedian. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9792.199999999999s)]
*  That comedian's amazing. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9793.84s)]
*  First of all, unless they were like on social media and then went and like, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9795.24s)]
*  shoot you out, there was no, um, there was no way to connect. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9798.64s)]
*  It just be like, love that guy. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9802.4s)]
*  Anyway, back to my life. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9804.08s)]
*  And then maybe you'll remember him and maybe when he's coming to town, you'd see, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9805.48s)]
*  Oh, that same guy I saw on Conan is going to be at the local comedy club or something. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9810.56s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9814.2s)]
*  But, but then like Rogan became the main thing. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9814.76s)]
*  And now they didn't just see you do seven minutes of standup. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9817.76s)]
*  They sat and listened to you for three hours. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9821.72s)]
*  So even let's just say, even off that one off the one three hour podcast, you come [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9824.0s)]
*  away knowing a lot more about that person. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9829.48s)]
*  I it's not like just a little taste. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9832.4s)]
*  You know a lot about it, but there is, I probably would put the threshold at, at. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9834.04s)]
*  40 to 50 hours. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9840.92s)]
*  Like if you've consumed 40 to 50 hours of somebody, especially when they're doing [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9842.36s)]
*  what we do on these shows where you just, you're speaking very, um, you're speaking [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9846.96s)]
*  in a very unguarded manner. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9852.28s)]
*  Uh, even though like this is your show and you asked like a lot of questions, you [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9854.4s)]
*  don't know exactly where this is going to go. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9860.199999999999s)]
*  You know, you're, you're then, then you're seeing what I say and then go, huh, okay. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9862.119999999999s)]
*  Well, let me ask something based off that. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9866.199999999999s)]
*  Let me make a point based off that we're both kind of like unguarded. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9867.72s)]
*  And when you consume somebody like that for, for like 40, 50 hours, you do see into [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9871.0s)]
*  their soul, I think there's almost no way, there's no way to avoid that. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9875.88s)]
*  And also I would say if they're not letting you see into your, their soul, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9879.68s)]
*  you'll notice that and you know that about them. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9883.68s)]
*  You know, this is a guarded person. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9886.2s)]
*  This, this was ultimately Kamala Harris's issue, right? [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9887.800000000001s)]
*  And this is why she was probably, you know, correct not to do Rogan, even though [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9890.16s)]
*  everyone looks back at that and says like, no, no, no, this is, this was the [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9894.800000000001s)]
*  big disaster of her campaign. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9897.76s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, you know, she was so guarded in every single [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9899.08s)]
*  interview that she ever did. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9904.28s)]
*  She was always constantly not trying to let you see who she really was. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9906.12s)]
*  And if she was going to try that on Rogan, that would have, that would have been [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9909.76s)]
*  so apparent to everybody involved. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9914.48s)]
*  So you've had a lot of intense conversations on JRE. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9918.0s)]
*  Uh, what do you appreciate most about Joe as a human being, as a conversation [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9921.12s)]
*  partner? [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9927.0s)]
*  I can't overstate how, how much I love Joe and how much I admire him. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9928.12s)]
*  Not as much as Ron Paul, just let's be clear. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9935.24s)]
*  There's like a hierarchy here. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9937.800000000001s)]
*  He's, he's close. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9940.04s)]
*  They're both like, they're both like, you know, there's like very few. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9942.2s)]
*  That means a lot. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9946.68s)]
*  Well, there's Ron, like Ron Paul and Joe Rogan. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9947.28s)]
*  I'd like our views. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9950.56s)]
*  Those are like my generals. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9951.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9952.960000000001s)]
*  Like an, I'm a soldier and those are my, those are my guys. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9953.28s)]
*  Like if, if Joe Rogan pointed to some guy and said, you got to go fight that guy [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9956.44s)]
*  right now, I'd be like, all right, I gotta go fight that guy or what, you know, Ron [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9960.0s)]
*  Paul too. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9962.960000000001s)]
*  I just think it's both very personally for me, you know, like Ron Paul, like [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9963.720000000001s)]
*  introduced me to like a set of ideas that like changed my life. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9967.320000000002s)]
*  And, um, and, um, just enormously grateful for that. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9970.92s)]
*  Joe Rogan was like, I was a huge Joe Rogan fan before the Joe Rogan experience. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9975.560000000001s)]
*  Like I'm an old school Joe Rogan head. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9980.480000000001s)]
*  I used to go on joerogan.net before the, when websites used to end with that. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9982.68s)]
*  Jerry before like whatever it is. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9987.52s)]
*  Before everything. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9988.92s)]
*  I remember, I mean, I was a fan of his before he confronted Carlos Mencia and [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9990.0s)]
*  the day he confronted Carlos Mencia, I watched the video on his website and was [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9993.84s)]
*  like, oh shit, Joe Rogan called him out, dude, this is the craziest thing ever. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=9997.599999999999s)]
*  And then, and then when I was a fan that like, when he started the podcast, I [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10001.08s)]
*  remember going, this is going to be big. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10006.359999999999s)]
*  Cause he's going to be so good at this. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10008.679999999998s)]
*  Cause he's got so much interesting shit to say. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10010.64s)]
*  And, um, I didn't realize it was going to be quite what it became, but I did think [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10013.08s)]
*  like, oh, this is going to be an awesome thing. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10017.119999999999s)]
*  And then, so there's like that. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10019.119999999999s)]
*  So like, I always really admired him and I was always a huge fan of his. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10020.76s)]
*  And then he literally, not only did he like change my life, but he changed [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10024.8s)]
*  like all of my friends lives. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10030.88s)]
*  Like it's like a very weird situation. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10033.4s)]
*  Like he's like the, he's the Santa Claus of my world. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10035.48s)]
*  Like he's literally just, and, and there was something like, I don't know, man. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10039.119999999999s)]
*  He's just, he's just a very like genuine person and he's really loved. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10042.92s)]
*  I think he really, um, derives a lot of pleasure out of the fact that he gets [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10048.76s)]
*  to help the people who he sees as like the good guys, like the guys worth helping. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10054.68s)]
*  And I just think that's like such an unbelievable thing. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10061.24s)]
*  You know, I had the first time Rogan had me on his podcast was I believe in 2016. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10064.16s)]
*  And I had like, I might've had like 5,000 followers or something like that. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10070.800000000001s)]
*  Like I was really completely unknown. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10076.8s)]
*  And like, it was like, I did nothing for him. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10078.96s)]
*  It was just the fact that he heard me on Ari's show and it was like, Oh, I like [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10082.039999999999s)]
*  what this guy's got to say. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10085.32s)]
*  I think this is cool. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10086.359999999999s)]
*  Like, let's talk about it. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10087.359999999999s)]
*  And, um, yeah, I mean, he's just like, you know, like I, again, he's just been [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10088.84s)]
*  such a great guy to me, um, and, and, and at every little angle, like everything, [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10093.56s)]
*  you know, you open for him, he takes care of you better than anybody else does. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10098.48s)]
*  You'd work his club, his club pays better than anybody else does. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10101.679999999998s)]
*  He, you know, like just everything is always like, it, he's always great to the [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10104.640000000001s)]
*  people who are around him. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10109.720000000001s)]
*  And, you know, again, like this is, it's, it's just hard to over, like, you know, [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10111.32s)]

*  where I can like provide a great life for them. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10121.6s)]
*  And like, don't get me wrong. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10124.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, like I did something with the opportunity. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10124.76s)]
*  It's not like he just gave me, you know, like it's like he gave me the opportunity [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10127.12s)]
*  and I did something with it, but still, I mean, he didn't have to give me that [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10130.640000000001s)]
*  opportunity and I will always, I will go to my grave being enormously grateful [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10134.12s)]
*  for his friendship and his, um, his, you know, the platform that he's given me. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10138.92s)]
*  And also just, he is like, and I try not to abuse this, but there's been like a [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10144.12s)]
*  few points, like over the years where I was like, I really need advice on this. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10149.0s)]
*  And I've gone to him and he's been like the absolute best at literally every [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10154.28s)]
*  single time I followed it a few times, a few times I didn't follow his advice. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10159.160000000002s)]
*  And I really regret not following his advice, but he was the absolute best [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10162.52s)]
*  like guy to be like, all right, let's talk about this. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10165.960000000001s)]
*  Um, which, and the last thing I'll say is that it was freaking crazy. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10168.800000000001s)]
*  Is that cause I, he's like, you know, got more shit going on than anybody else [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10172.560000000001s)]
*  in the world and is still very interested to take time out to like discuss some [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10176.48s)]
*  thing that I'm asking him about, which is a really, really great quality. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10180.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10185.04s)]
*  Always takes a phone call. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10185.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10186.640000000001s)]
*  You're right about the advice. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10187.04s)]
*  He's, uh, his advice is spot on. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10188.2s)]
*  And it's, um, it's often the ones for me personally, uh, what's needed is like, [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10191.160000000002s)]
*  he's been through so many fires that he's really good at like making you feel [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10198.2s)]
*  like, don't fucking worry about it. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10202.76s)]
*  Just move on. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10204.2s)]
*  It's the, don't read the comments thing, but generally, yeah, that's right. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10205.880000000001s)]
*  Just like, fuck it. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10210.28s)]
*  And there's, he has a whole, that whole vibe, which kind of looks effortless, but [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10212.2s)]
*  I think when you look at it seriously, especially in contrast with journalists, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10218.400000000001s)]
*  there's a fearlessness there. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10223.720000000001s)]
*  100%. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10225.800000000001s)]
*  Like that not giving a fuck. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10226.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, he says it's like fuck because of fucking money or any of that. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10230.04s)]
*  I don't, I don't think so. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10233.560000000001s)]
*  I think it's more than that. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10234.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure that's a component of it, but there's people who have that, [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10236.6s)]
*  who still don't have a lot. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10239.24s)]
*  Most people who have money, a lot of money are actually become more scared [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10240.68s)]
*  because they like the comfort of just like normal life. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10245.04s)]
*  Cause when you're taking risks, you're going to pay for it. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10249.56s)]
*  Even if you have money, not just financially, just like it's going to, it's [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10252.8s)]
*  going to hurt, it's going to disturb your life. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10256.6s)]
*  It's going to create turbulence. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10258.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10259.64s)]
*  The guy is fearless and follows just his genuine curiosity. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10259.88s)]
*  It's like an inspiration to me. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10264.44s)]
*  Friendships aside, just inspiration of how great of a conversationalist he is [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10265.92s)]
*  and not. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10271.039999999999s)]
*  He generally didn't give a fuck if like he talks to any of the presidential [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10273.039999999999s)]
*  candidates or not, if he, he'll just talk to friends just cause he wants to. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10277.32s)]
*  And there's no like click baitiness to it. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10283.039999999999s)]
*  There's no like giving a shit about views or like, I mean, during the [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10285.4s)]
*  COVID stuff, man, I mean, he was like interviewing Dr. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10289.84s)]
*  McCullough and who's the other one? [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10293.92s)]
*  Malone, Dr. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10295.359999999999s)]
*  Malone and had Bobby Kennedy, all these people, like at this time when it was [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10296.359999999999s)]
*  like so, and he's had it with me before too, like talking about Ukraine and [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10300.64s)]
*  Israel, like at the times when it's really white hot, you know what I mean? [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10304.92s)]
*  And like, there's this huge penalty on not going along with the [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10309.0s)]
*  regime's talking points. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10312.519999999999s)]
*  And he's like, like, it's really hard to overstate it. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10314.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, there was, there used to be nothing like this. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10317.32s)]
*  It used to be that if, if CNN and Fox news agreed, well, then that was it. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10321.16s)]
*  That was the line now. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10325.16s)]
*  And now we got the biggest show in the country will actually allow the other [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10326.64s)]
*  perspective on and allow people to like challenge the regime. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10331.0s)]
*  I think it's been historic. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10333.8s)]
*  I think also there are shows, there are people that just are constant [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10335.439999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theorists, which is fine also. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10339.16s)]
*  But I sometimes feel that those lack genuineness is that they kind of put [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10342.72s)]
*  themselves in a bin or everything. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10348.32s)]
*  Like you question everything to a point where like, I don't know, I feel like [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10350.16s)]
*  you're not getting closer to the truth when you question everything. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10354.12s)]
*  There is something that some people in the conspiracy world do, which is like, [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10357.36s)]
*  they, they speak about something with certainty when they're really not [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10362.72s)]
*  certain about it. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10367.08s)]
*  And it's like, um, it's, it's fine to like ask questions and it's fine [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10368.12s)]
*  to speculate about things, but you also have to like, um, you just, it's true [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10372.32s)]
*  in general in life, you gotta be really careful about like presuming your [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10376.72s)]
*  conclusion and then working backward from there. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10380.2s)]
*  And then sometimes when you have one or like, it's just, it's a matter of being [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10382.880000000001s)]
*  sloppy versus not being sloppy. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10385.76s)]
*  And like sometimes people, like I remember for a long time, back in the day [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10387.880000000001s)]
*  in the, in the nine 11 truth movement, there was this, one of the huge smoking [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10392.2s)]
*  guns that they would point to was that in the nineties, there was this one [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10396.76s)]
*  document I'm blanking on the title of it, but it was from PNAC, the project for [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10400.92s)]
*  a new American century. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10404.52s)]
*  And this was the think tank or one of the think tanks of the neoconservatives. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10405.76s)]
*  Um, like all the big neoconservatives were involved in PNAC from Dick [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10409.12s)]
*  Cheney to Rumsfeld, uh, Richard Pearl, David Worms are all the big neocons. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10412.6s)]
*  And there was this one document where they basically, they were like, you know, [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10417.68s)]
*  their project for the new American century was how we're going to have hegemony [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10421.16s)]
*  for another hundred years. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10425.6s)]
*  Now that we won the 20th century, how are we going to win the 21st century? [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10426.76s)]
*  And they were like, okay, well, here's what we want to do. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10429.68s)]
*  We want to start multiple wars in the middle East. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10431.2s)]
*  And we want to like go like all the plans that they had NATO expansion [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10433.48s)]
*  in Europe was a big part of it too. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10436.640000000001s)]
*  And then there was one line where they said, um, it's going to be tough to work [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10438.64s)]
*  up popular, uh, uh, support for these multiple wars. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10443.6s)]
*  We want to fight in the middle East short of another Pearl Harbor style event. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10447.84s)]
*  And the nine 11 truthers would point to this and go see clearly they did it. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10452.36s)]
*  They did nine 11. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10457.24s)]
*  They even say in their own words here that they want another Pearl Harbor [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10458.44s)]
*  events, they can do this. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10462.16s)]
*  And it's like, well, look, that doesn't actually prove anything. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10462.8s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's, it might just be the case that they were like, Oh, we [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10466.720000000001s)]
*  wouldn't get this without a pro and then when nine 11 happened, they went, Hey, [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10471.800000000001s)]
*  we got our Pearl Harbor style event. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10474.640000000001s)]
*  And, you know, and, and even if you like that story of nine 11 was an inside job, [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10476.4s)]
*  you know, cause it's kind of sexy and exciting and like, Oh my God, what a [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10480.84s)]
*  crazy world we're living in, if that's true. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10483.44s)]
*  Um, and I'm not even saying it's not true. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10485.720000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying if you're not sloppy and you're scrupulous, you go, [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10487.16s)]
*  that's not really evidence. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10490.56s)]
*  It's it sounds like evidence. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10492.28s)]
*  It's evidence. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10494.16s)]
*  See, you know, but it's not actually a piece of evidence because that doesn't [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10494.72s)]
*  in any way demonstrate that they actually were in on the thing. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10498.279999999999s)]
*  And there's just a lot of things like that. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10501.039999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of things I even see like, cause it's a very popular [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10503.359999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theory online now that, um, that Israel did nine 11. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10506.32s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm open, you know, what do you got? [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10510.8s)]
*  What's the evidence? [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10514.56s)]
*  And they'll be like, well, did you see that Larry Silverstein took out a huge [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10515.519999999999s)]
*  insurance policy on the world trade center? [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10518.8s)]
*  How did he know? [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10520.92s)]
*  And you're like, how did he know that the number one terrorist target in the world [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10521.960000000001s)]
*  might need a big insurance policy on it? [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10525.68s)]
*  You realize that the same guy's attempted to knock those towers down in 1993. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10527.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10531.36s)]
*  And so there's just little things like that where like, if you're being sloppy [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10531.84s)]
*  and you already really want this conclusion, I see where you could see [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10534.88s)]
*  these things as, as evidence. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10538.4s)]
*  But if you're just being a little, if you're critically thinking about them, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10540.04s)]
*  it's actually, it's not as strong a case as you think it is. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10542.68s)]
*  And I, I like to, again, I'll speculate every now and then, you know, things, but [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10545.64s)]
*  I like to take on something where I feel like I can prove this case. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10549.800000000001s)]
*  Like I really have enough evidence that I think I can prove this. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10553.28s)]
*  I think I can prove that the neocons didn't invade Iraq because they were [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10556.12s)]
*  worried about weapons of mass destruction. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10559.84s)]
*  And they actually had this agenda for at least a decade before the war broke out. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10561.6s)]
*  You know, like there's, there's strong, tangible evidence for that. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10566.6s)]
*  It's just some, sometimes the constant conspiracy guys, not always, but sometimes [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10570.52s)]
*  they just get sloppy when it comes to actually analyzing how strong the case [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10575.76s)]
*  is. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10580.76s)]
*  I mean, there's several psychological effects. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10581.039999999999s)]
*  I think there's a certain drug to the dogmatic certainty that you were mentioning. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10583.359999999999s)]
*  It really annoys me that there's something about human psychology, because [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10587.679999999998s)]
*  I usually, when I say stuff, I usually, uh, show doubt and show the humility that [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10594.199999999999s)]
*  I might not have the right answer. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10603.08s)]
*  And I sometimes look at multiple perspectives and that's seen as weakness [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10604.88s)]
*  and lack of intelligence. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10612.039999999999s)]
*  Often it just sounds like when I even like, listen back to people that do that [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10613.56s)]
*  kind of thing, that certainty sounds like intelligence to people. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10616.72s)]
*  Like if you say something with a lot of certainty, it sounds like this, this is [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10621.72s)]
*  smart motherfucker. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10627.72s)]
*  And I hate that about myself and about human psyche that that's seems to be the [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10629.279999999999s)]
*  case because then like the dumb dogmatists are going to be like the ones [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10633.36s)]
*  that are driving agenda. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10640.84s)]
*  It is true. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10642.6s)]
*  I've noticed that for a long time though. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10643.32s)]
*  It's almost like in a weird way, it's kind of like a prerequisite for leadership [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10644.84s)]
*  in a way you kind of have to be certain about things. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10650.12s)]
*  But then there's a real problem with that, which is that a lot of times you're [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10652.76s)]
*  just bullshitting or you're just, or you're, or you're not right. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10656.560000000001s)]
*  You're not correct to be this certain about this. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10659.640000000001s)]
*  It's at least debatable. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10661.720000000001s)]
*  And, you know, so you always try. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10663.76s)]
*  And then the thing, like I feel like at least for me is, which I try to do, I'm [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10665.56s)]
*  sure I fail at the, at this a ton, but you try to at least go like, you got to almost, [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10670.24s)]
*  you got to work on training your brain and you have to be conscious about it. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10676.28s)]
*  And so you have to go like, Hey, if there's something here that is confirming my bias [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10680.720000000001s)]
*  that I get that, you know, you start getting that little sense of pleasure of [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10687.36s)]
*  like, Oh, great. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10690.6s)]
*  Here's another point that proves the thing I want to be true. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10691.36s)]
*  Then you have to like be 10 times as, you know, like, uh, you know, uh, skeptical [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10694.0s)]
*  about this, you have to really examine this one and be like, okay, am I sure [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10701.08s)]
*  that this one, you know, cause sometimes you'll hear people even throw out things [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10705.24s)]
*  where it's like, Oh, I know you liked that cause it was helping your case, but [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10709.2s)]
*  come on, think about this. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10712.800000000001s)]
*  This doesn't even make sense. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10713.880000000001s)]
*  It's like, okay, I want to make this argument. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10715.24s)]
*  And then everything that would support that just gets sucked in like a, like a [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10717.480000000001s)]
*  force of gravity or something. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10720.76s)]
*  And you're like, you have half of these are bad data points. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10722.2s)]
*  I mean, like for me, there's something definitely about my brain that is [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10725.36s)]
*  attracted to conspiracy theories. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10728.92s)]
*  So I'm very well aware that that gravitational pull is there. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10730.800000000001s)]
*  Well, it's, it's, if nothing else, it's a crazy story. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10736.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10739.6s)]
*  It's like a movie. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10739.92s)]
*  So it's like, Oh, that's crazy. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10740.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10742.84s)]
*  Every fucking, yeah, you don't need to work on Epstein. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10742.960000000001s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10744.960000000001s)]
*  I don't, that's one of the big mysteries of like our modern era is like, how the [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10746.400000000001s)]
*  fuck did this guy get an Island, this pedophile and got like smart, smart, I [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10752.240000000002s)]
*  think really smart people to like hang out with them. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10762.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10765.240000000002s)]
*  And what the fuck. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10766.6s)]
*  And has anybody, I mean, obviously, uh, uh, just lane, however you say, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10767.44s)]
*  Galeen Maxwell. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10774.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10775.48s)]
*  She went, she went to jail. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10775.880000000001s)]
*  It's like, is anybody else, has anybody, has anybody anywhere been forced to resign? [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10778.12s)]
*  I mean, like just even like, say like, I don't know, like at the FBI or something, [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10784.800000000001s)]
*  just for not like catching the thing sooner, like even if you weren't in on it, [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10788.720000000001s)]
*  it was like, no, there's a real problem with the American system. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10792.0s)]
*  And, and it's that, that like, that I think this just went on for too long [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10795.28s)]
*  before like the American people just wouldn't put up with it anymore. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10800.92s)]
*  And this is why trust in every institution and the corporate media and [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10804.359999999999s)]
*  Congress and all of it is evaporated is that it's like, is he just saying of all [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10807.48s)]
*  the people who sold the war in Iraq, no one's so much as like, got kicked out of [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10811.679999999998s)]
*  polite society, you know, like I'm not even saying like, oh, they went to jail [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10818.08s)]
*  for war crimes for life, but was just like, yeah, you can't, we're not looking [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10821.24s)]
*  to you for advice on the next war. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10825.72s)]
*  Thanks. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10827.32s)]
*  Go home. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10828.0s)]
*  Like none of that. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10828.759999999998s)]
*  It's like all these like crazy things. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10829.84s)]
*  Nobody goes down for it. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10831.84s)]
*  I mean, like they freaking, they lied us into war after a war. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10833.36s)]
*  They've bankrupted the country, damn near destroyed the dollar. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10837.92s)]
*  They locked down the country on the basis of pseudoscience. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10841.52s)]
*  Then, then lied through their teeth about what this vaccine would do as they [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10846.28s)]
*  were forcing it on people and like, no one loses their job. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10850.800000000001s)]
*  No one even gets in trouble over any of this. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10854.32s)]
*  And look in any, in any area of life, a business or a relationship or whatever, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10856.8s)]
*  you can't, you cannot screw up that catastrophically and face no repercussions [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10864.039999999999s)]
*  for it and think that your business or relationship isn't going to fail as a [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10870.0s)]
*  result of that. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10873.96s)]
*  I think ultimately there's been a lot of wake up calls and I think we're going [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10875.279999999999s)]
*  to build a better society from it. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10879.119999999999s)]
*  The like better institution. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10880.72s)]
*  I believe I hope you're right. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10882.039999999999s)]
*  My, you know, more transparency, more like authenticity. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10883.6s)]
*  I think also the democratic party has learned the lesson of like, you have to [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10887.2s)]
*  have candidates that do, I don't give a shit about podcasts, but do podcasts like [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10890.84s)]
*  things, meaning reveal themselves as human beings. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10895.32s)]
*  I think it's one of the best things that happened in this last election. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10899.08s)]
*  And I'm not saying, like I did think they were great, but I'm not saying that [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10903.36s)]
*  like any of the Trump podcasts were perfect or like maybe there'd be a better [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10906.68s)]
*  way that they could be done. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10910.56s)]
*  But I will say that I always, I used to say this for a while. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10912.08s)]
*  Um, like as of, you know, like the last few years, but I'd be like, so it's like, [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10917.24s)]
*  so I'm, I'm me, you know, and for me to do what I do, it's kind of expected that [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10923.039999999999s)]
*  I'll probably like, I don't know, I get like at least like maybe 15, 10 to 15 [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10930.759999999998s)]
*  times a year, I'll come do a show like this, like a long form show on a big [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10938.640000000001s)]
*  platform where I'm going to, you know, like my ideas will be poked and prodded [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10945.16s)]
*  and tested and there'll be pushback questions and there'll be that sometimes [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10950.44s)]
*  they're more, you know, adversarial, sometimes they're more friendly, but [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10953.6s)]
*  like you're going to, and then yet our standard for who is the commander in [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10956.68s)]
*  chief was like, you show up to these debates that are like 90 minutes long [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10960.6s)]
*  with these really, really stupid questions and you give a 90 second [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10965.76s)]
*  answer to it or blah, and at least for the first time now, it does seem like, [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10969.68s)]
*  oh, the standard is kind of, you're going to have to do a long form show where [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10973.800000000001s)]
*  people, you really have to have, you know, and, and that, that I think is long term [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10978.92s)]
*  a real positive development, you know, like you, you just kind of know going [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10984.32s)]
*  forward, the Democrats, right? [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10988.32s)]
*  Which I think is kind of what you were saying, right? [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10989.68s)]
*  You can't run a Kamala Harris if she can't do a long form interview. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10991.52s)]
*  You gotta run somebody who's able to sit down and express themselves and have real [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10994.56s)]
*  genuine thoughts, or at least try to convince people they have real genuine [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=10998.56s)]
*  thoughts, at least, you know, and it's, that's very different in a way than, you [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11001.6s)]
*  know, I'd look back at some, like the most talented politicians of my lifetime, [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11005.16s)]
*  which I'd have to say the two were, were Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, just like [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11009.0s)]
*  into the most talented traditional politicians, Trump's like the anti [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11012.4s)]
*  politician, but like they were like the traditional and just unbelievably, but [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11016.32s)]
*  they never had to do that. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11020.76s)]
*  It was just a different time. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11022.52s)]
*  Bill Clinton had to walk up and like, you know, be like, oh, it's a beautiful baby. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11023.64s)]
*  I have here. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11026.96s)]
*  They go back and then play the sax and then have a couple of good answers to a [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11027.48s)]
*  small crowd. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11030.84s)]
*  I'm from a little town called hope. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11031.4s)]
*  And you know, like that, that's not the game anymore. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11033.039999999999s)]
*  Now the game is like, can you sit down and actually, you know, have some [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11035.72s)]
*  ideas in a long form? [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11039.92s)]
*  And I think that's so much better because it's so much more revealing of, you [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11041.48s)]
*  know, kind of like what we were saying before, you reveal a little bit. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11044.8s)]
*  It's not 50 hours, but in those, in those three hours, you reveal a [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11047.359999999999s)]
*  little bit of your soul. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11050.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11051.76s)]
*  And I think that process makes you actually a better person. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11051.960000000001s)]
*  I, uh, I ultimately think that Barack Obama was a fascinating human being. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11054.24s)]
*  And there was a choice made early on to be more, to do like less interviews, be [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11058.960000000001s)]
*  more behind the wall, I think. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11065.6s)]
*  And that, that's, that's a disservice because I think it's a skill to be an [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11067.68s)]
*  authentic person, like that you build to be able to allow yourself to be yourself. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11071.32s)]
*  Like it's very possible that Kamala Harris is a fascinating person. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11077.68s)]
*  Like, we just never gotten to meet her. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11081.0s)]
*  And I don't know if she has gotten to me or by, you know, it's a practice thing [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11082.880000000001s)]
*  to like reveal yourself as a tricky thing. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11088.08s)]
*  I think it's just good for the candidate. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11092.52s)]
*  I think she, well, I think she, what she did, you know, I'm a critic. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11094.52s)]
*  I don't think she's a good candidate, but what she does pretty fricking incredible. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11098.960000000001s)]
*  Meaning like in that, to raise that much money in that short amount of time. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11103.4s)]
*  I think it was a terrible thing for the democratic party to do. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11108.72s)]
*  I think she's a terrible candidate, but still with the tools he got, like use [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11111.48s)]
*  Tik Tok, use whatever. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11116.88s)]
*  I'll say the fact that she came as close as she did to being president is pretty [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11118.519999999999s)]
*  goddamn insane, if you ask me. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11122.88s)]
*  But yeah, the Democrats are a mess. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11124.96s)]
*  They're a mess. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11127.439999999999s)]
*  Like I've never seen a political party before, but that in itself is, is I [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11127.88s)]
*  think a very good thing. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11132.76s)]
*  And what comes from here is there's a lot of possibilities now. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11134.279999999999s)]
*  And, you know, there's never been like, I don't know who the person is. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11138.44s)]
*  I don't see anyone out there that I could think of that would fill this role, but [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11143.64s)]
*  there's never been a more ripe time for someone to Donald Trump, the [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11147.52s)]
*  democratic party now, you know, like somebody to what Donald Trump did. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11152.72s)]
*  People tend to forget this because now like it's also because the accusation [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11157.2s)]
*  from the Democrats is that, you know, the Republican parties are all a bunch of [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11162.0s)]
*  Trump cultists or something like that. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11166.12s)]
*  But like, I'm, I'm old enough to remember 2016. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11168.44s)]
*  And what actually happened was that Donald Trump came in and just really [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11172.6s)]
*  resonated with the voters and the establishment of the Republican party [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11178.160000000002s)]
*  hated it. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11182.240000000002s)]
*  They were openly talking about changing the rules at the Republican national [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11183.2s)]
*  convention to deny him the nomination in 2016. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11188.68s)]
*  What they were saying is that they were going to raise the number of delegates [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11192.640000000001s)]
*  required so high that nobody could hit it and then say, Hey, since nobody hit it, [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11195.84s)]
*  we select Mitt Romney again, and we're going to run Mitt Romney again. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11200.28s)]
*  Like they were openly, openly conspiring to steal the thing from him. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11203.52s)]
*  And eventually he just had so much support on the ground that they couldn't do it. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11207.76s)]
*  Right now, someone could totally do that to the Democrats. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11211.92s)]
*  But the thing is it would have to be somebody outside of the three letter [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11214.76s)]
*  agency control, because that's what everyone's rejecting right now. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11217.960000000001s)]
*  But if you were to actually sit there and go like the, and even policies, I [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11221.08s)]
*  don't necessarily agree with, but there are a lot of policies that if it was [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11224.64s)]
*  actually like a pro labor working class party, you could, you could, you know, [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11228.08s)]
*  Bernie Sanders showed you a little bit of what's possible. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11232.76s)]
*  And this was from like an 80 year old socialist who didn't really have the balls [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11235.4s)]
*  to go through with it at the end of the day. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11238.439999999999s)]
*  You know, like if somebody younger and a little bit more, more with the [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11240.119999999999s)]
*  current zeitgeist were able to do that, that could happen. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11245.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, I would generally think that AOC can develop into that candidate. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11248.68s)]
*  Uh, she might not be there yet, but I think she can develop into that. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11252.68s)]
*  It could be out there. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11255.8s)]
*  It could be, I don't know. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11256.68s)]
*  I don't see AOC being the one to do it, but I could be wrong about that. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11257.6s)]
*  She's got some qualities, unlike almost all the other ones you could think of. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11263.04s)]
*  Um, I just, you know, I don't see, I don't see anyone right now who I [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11267.44s)]
*  think could be that person, but I never would have said, I mean, if you had asked [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11272.880000000001s)]
*  me in 2014, who's going to come take over the Republican party, I never would have [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11277.28s)]
*  guessed Donald Trump was going to come do what he did. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11281.16s)]
*  So it might be the person we're seeing who we're not even thinking of, or it [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11283.64s)]
*  might just be some unknown, you know, same with Obama wasn't unknown. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11286.52s)]
*  I mean, obviously he had, he had very powerful people behind his presidential run. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11290.0s)]
*  It's not like he was a true, just like grassroots guy, but he wasn't anyone we [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11296.08s)]
*  would have been necessarily thinking about. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11299.56s)]
*  I mean, he gave that big speech at the 2004 DNC, but that was it. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11301.2s)]
*  That was the thing he was known for. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11305.64s)]
*  He gave one great speech at the third, besides that he was a state [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11306.88s)]
*  Senator and then a junior Senator. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11309.56s)]
*  No one's thinking he was going to be the next president. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11311.119999999999s)]
*  It could be like a John Stewart type character. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11313.0s)]
*  Of course. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11315.039999999999s)]
*  I don't think he would ever, I honestly don't think a comedian will ever run, [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11315.4s)]
*  but I never thought Trump would ever run. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11318.359999999999s)]
*  So there is, there is something about John Stewart that is, um, he's, and [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11320.359999999999s)]
*  obviously I disagree with him on a lot of stuff too, but he is an authentic person. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11327.64s)]
*  Um, and there's something about that that gives you a huge advantage, [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11332.08s)]
*  particularly in our current political climate. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11335.84s)]
*  People are so sick of the phoniness. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11338.84s)]
*  It's like, it's, it's, and, and it's, and, and they're right to be, [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11342.4s)]
*  cause you could only, you know, so you can lie to some of the people, some of [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11345.6s)]
*  the time, like this, you can only lie so much before eventually nobody wants to [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11348.6s)]
*  hear you in that phony voice, telling the same phony lies anymore. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11353.0s)]
*  And at least John Stewart is, I will say, I think he's, I think John [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11356.36s)]
*  Stewart is telling the truth the way he sees it. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11360.56s)]
*  Like, I don't think he's necessarily right about a lot of things. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11364.12s)]
*  He is right about a lot of things, but I think he's wrong about a lot of other [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11366.88s)]
*  things, but he, I just get the impression that he believes what he's saying. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11369.32s)]
*  And there's something powerful about that. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11373.92s)]
*  Especially when he's surrounded by people that disagree with him. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11375.92s)]
*  He's still all this. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11378.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11379.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11379.92s)]
*  That takes a certain kind of courage. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11380.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11382.199999999999s)]
*  And be funny doing it, but he's not going to run. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11383.92s)]
*  Nah, I don't think so. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11386.96s)]
*  This is annoying. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11387.839999999998s)]
*  No, nobody like you have to be fucking crazy to run. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11388.759999999998s)]
*  That is one of the real problems, you know? [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11393.24s)]
*  And then like people like attack Donald Trump for being like a narcissist. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11395.44s)]
*  I have to be. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11400.04s)]
*  Who the hell else is going to ever do this? [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11402.880000000001s)]
*  All right. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11404.52s)]
*  What gives you hope about this whole thing we got going on? [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11405.640000000001s)]
*  Uh, America and human civilization. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11409.08s)]
*  Okay. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11413.04s)]
*  So this is not mine, but this is a Jean Epstein who's like, uh, is a really [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11413.44s)]
*  brilliant economist and a great guy. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11421.52s)]
*  And he told me this once and I just always loved it. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11424.48s)]
*  And he, so I call it Epstein's Epstein's case, not that different [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11427.0s)]
*  Epstein, Jean Epstein, no relation. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11431.279999999999s)]
*  I want to be clear on that. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11433.32s)]
*  Okay. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11434.48s)]
*  This is Jean's let's call it Jean's case for radical optimism. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11435.64s)]
*  And the way he put it was he goes, uh, he goes, so imagine you were sitting [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11440.6s)]
*  around in, um, 1845 and like, you're at the height of, you know, the slavery. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11446.16s)]
*  And you were like, Hey, in 20 years, slavery is going to be [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11456.64s)]
*  abolished across the West. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11461.74s)]
*  And like, if you told that someone, they'd be like, dude, slavery has [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11464.0s)]
*  existed for all of human history. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11466.32s)]
*  Slavery is look around. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11468.4s)]
*  It's not going anywhere. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11469.96s)]
*  You'd have to be out of your mind to think we're 20 years away from [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11471.52s)]
*  abolishing slavery and yet we were. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11475.32s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's just like the greatest thing in the history of the world. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11478.96s)]
*  And not, and unfortunately America had to fight a bloody civil war to get there, [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11482.36s)]
*  but many other countries didn't. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11485.84s)]
*  And they just walked away from what had been the status quo forever. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11487.18s)]
*  You know, and just stop doing it. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11493.16s)]
*  And now look, you can argue there's slavery by other names and things like [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11495.64s)]
*  that, and like, you know, to some degree, paying an income tax is some degree of [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11499.24s)]
*  slavery, but there is not chattel slavery in the way that there used to be. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11503.0s)]
*  And that is like an incredible advance for humanity. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11507.68s)]
*  And then the other example he would give is he goes, uh, he was talking about how [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11513.24s)]
*  at the beginning of the Reagan administration, like in 1981, that the [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11517.44s)]
*  neocons, because when he was trying to have detente with Russia, the neocons [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11522.16s)]
*  were in the press being like, he just guaranteed another hundred years of [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11526.4s)]
*  Soviet dominance, you know? [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11530.04s)]
*  And if someone had just been to you like, Hey, listen, calm down in 10 years, [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11531.640000000001s)]
*  there won't be a Soviet union. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11535.92s)]
*  It's just been like, what are you like? [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11538.08s)]
*  Okay, nice idea, but you're out of your fucking mind. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11539.720000000001s)]
*  And yet that was true too. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11541.48s)]
*  And so there is even when, you know, and you can see some dynamics, even in our [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11542.960000000001s)]
*  politics today, where like, you know, three years ago, I was really concerned [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11547.640000000001s)]
*  about whether they'd shut the whole thing down, us, I mean, you know, like [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11555.0s)]
*  when it was during the COVID times and during times where it was like everyone [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11559.480000000001s)]
*  I knew was just getting strikes on all their channels. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11562.960000000001s)]
*  And if you just even wanted to like talk about how like there are [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11565.480000000001s)]
*  people being vaccine injured, you'd like lose your YouTube channel, get people [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11569.24s)]
*  getting kicked off Twitter left and right. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11572.960000000001s)]
*  And I just saw it and I was like, dude, the, the grasp is just getting [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11574.6s)]
*  tighter and tighter and tighter. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11578.480000000001s)]
*  The regime is not going to allow these alternative voices, you know, in here. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11579.960000000001s)]
*  And they're just getting too big and they're going to shut this whole thing [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11584.24s)]
*  down and I'm going to have to figure out what I'm going to do. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11586.640000000001s)]
*  Uh, after that, and I was totally wrong. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11589.119999999999s)]
*  It just, the trend totally went in the other direction and things are now at [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11592.759999999998s)]
*  a point where it's like, I couldn't even imagine it. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11596.24s)]
*  I never would have envisioned Elon Musk was going to get $44 billion [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11598.16s)]
*  together and buy Twitter. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11601.679999999998s)]
*  And then he was, you know, it's like, and so I just think that if you kind of like [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11602.96s)]
*  zoom out, I think that the, the regime has lost their monopoly on propaganda. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11606.56s)]
*  And this opens up enormous possibilities for what, you know, I, [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11613.8s)]
*  I remember so vividly 2002 and, and 2002, you know, nine 11 happened in late 2001. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11618.64s)]
*  We invaded Iraq in 2003, but all of 2002 was a massive propaganda campaign, just [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11628.199999999999s)]
*  constantly laying down the blueprints for this war that we knew was George W. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11634.599999999999s)]
*  Bush was about to launch. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11638.88s)]
*  And it was, you know, they have weapons of mass destruction. [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11640.16s)]
*  They were in on nine 11. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11642.039999999999s)]
*  They're friends with Al Qaeda. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11643.32s)]
*  They're going to hand this weapon that they don't have off to the terrorist. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11644.68s)]
*  They're not friends with, and then they're going to nuke Kansas and, and every right-winger, [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11647.28s)]
*  by the way, this is also sorry for rambling a little here, but this is also one of the [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11650.96s)]
*  reasons why when, when the Jew haters will say things like, they'll be like, Oh, [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11654.24s)]
*  look, all of the Jews support Israel or 70% of the Jews vote this way, or the 70% [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11658.28s)]
*  of the Jews support this word. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11663.76s)]
*  It's like, listen, I don't like blaming or even when the, the Palestine haters will [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11664.6s)]
*  say 70% of Gazans support Hamas or whatever. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11670.039999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, look, I remember a time in this country. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11673.08s)]
*  I know I'm going back 20 years, but every right-winger in this country was completely [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11676.0s)]
*  convinced that we have to go invade Iraq because he has weapons of mass destruction [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11680.4s)]
*  and you're some type of leftist homo. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11685.0s)]
*  If you don't agree with that, that was the entire culture in this country. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11686.8s)]
*  And it was the one thing that the New York times and Bill O'Reilly and CNN and the [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11689.96s)]
*  Washington post all agreed on, they were all on board selling this war. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11693.96s)]
*  You could not do that today. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11697.92s)]
*  They could not get away with that today because if they did, how do you control [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11700.44s)]
*  this entire problem? [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11705.6s)]
*  You tell me, how do you control Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson? [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11706.56s)]
*  You know, how do you get these guys to go? [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11710.0s)]
*  They're not going to go along with it. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11711.68s)]
*  And in fact, they're almost definitely going to have people on their show who [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11713.04s)]
*  are just tearing it apart. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11716.880000000001s)]
*  And so I just look at that and I go like, yo, I mean, we're at a place now where we [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11718.6s)]
*  have this world of possibilities that would have seemed impossible just so [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11722.76s)]
*  recently. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11728.56s)]
*  And so just thinking like all of that rambling stew, whatever all that was, that [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11729.720000000001s)]
*  leaves me feeling very, very hopeful for the future. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11734.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of social and political progress in that rambling stew over [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11738.4s)]
*  the over the decades and the centuries. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11743.08s)]
*  For me, probably some of the technological progress is really exciting. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11745.439999999999s)]
*  Me personally, it just fills me with hope whenever I see the rockets go up to [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11749.359999999999s)]
*  clear clarify, not the ones going into Gaza, the ones going into outer space. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11755.24s)]
*  So I assume you had to clarify the Epstein thing, the Epstein rule. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11760.519999999999s)]
*  I have to clarify exactly which rockets, SpaceX and Blue Origin rockets, taking [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11765.519999999999s)]
*  humans out to space. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11773.08s)]
*  And yeah, for us to be among the stars, like it makes me feel like we're going to [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11774.64s)]
*  make it because the bleaker times throughout human history, you think, I mean, [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11779.839999999998s)]
*  there's just a sense you're right. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11785.56s)]
*  And during COVID, there was a sense of like, for many reasons, maybe just a simple [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11786.72s)]
*  psychological human reason, it felt like bleak. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11792.0s)]
*  Like, fuck, I don't think we as a civilization are right. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11796.48s)]
*  If we can't handle this pandemic from a policy perspective, from a human [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11801.4s)]
*  perspective, economic perspective, like this is like pandemic light. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11805.2s)]
*  There's going to be other bigger troubles coming our way. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11809.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11812.92s)]
*  And then now you have this kind of, again, the rockets are going up. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11813.48s)]
*  It's like we, you know, first of all, we'll colonize space and other planets. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11818.24s)]
*  And we like, we're inventive motherfuckers. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11823.400000000001s)]
*  We'll figure it out. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11826.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11827.400000000001s)]
*  And then certainly, you know, like for me, just personally, cause this is like [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11827.960000000001s)]
*  really touched my life, but you know, like the, the innovations in medical [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11832.44s)]
*  technology are just stunts and you know, my, my son had a congenital heart defect [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11838.36s)]
*  at open heart surgery when he was three days old. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11845.08s)]
*  And, um, I mean, this is like something that 20 years ago, I would have lost my [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11848.32s)]
*  child, you know, and he's fine, just absolutely fine. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11853.16s)]
*  Cause it's just amazing what these surgeons and cardiologists and, you [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11856.56s)]
*  know, neonatologists and all of them, what they do now is like goddamn magic. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11860.32s)]
*  As though there was always something about that, that would, it was almost [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11864.04s)]
*  like that inoculated me against ever having a sense of like, well, I wish [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11867.56s)]
*  it was a previous time. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11873.04s)]
*  Cause like now, sorry, in a previous time I lose my kids. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11874.880000000001s)]
*  So I don't get whatever other challenges there are out here. [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11877.400000000001s)]
*  Like I'll take that trade off where this baby survives and gets a shot at having [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11880.0s)]
*  a life and there is a lot of that stuff is just kind of easy to take for granted. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11884.560000000001s)]
*  And it's like, you know, when it touches your life, it's, you don't take it for [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11889.68s)]
*  granted as much, but it's just like, now it really is, it is, there are miracles [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11893.0s)]
*  going on all over the place now that like everybody in human history did not have [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11896.68s)]
*  access to. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11900.960000000001s)]
*  All right, brother. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11902.080000000002s)]
*  It's great to finally meet a friend and have a conversation. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11902.76s)]
*  Yeah, I really enjoyed this. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11905.72s)]
*  And, uh, I can't wait to talk to you again, brother. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V0bJfqEaa4&t=11907.08s)]
