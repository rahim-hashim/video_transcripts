*  chess player of all time. I'm not biased. Daniel Nagrano on poker and many more. Chris Hatfield,
*  explaining how rockets work and the experience of being launched into space alone is worth the
*  money. By the way, you can watch it on basically any device. Once again, sign up at masterclass.com
*  slash lex to get a discount and to support this podcast. And now here's my conversation with
*  Manolis Callis. What to you is the most beautiful aspect of the human genome?
*  Don't get me started. We've got time. The first answer is that the beauty of
*  genomes transcends humanity. So it's not just about the human genome. Genomes in general are
*  amazingly beautiful. And again, I'm obviously biased. So in my view, the way that I like to
*  introduce the human genome and the way that I like to introduce genomics to my class is by telling
*  them, you know, we're not the inventors of the first digital computer. We are the descendants
*  of the first digital computer. Basically, life is digital. And that's absolutely beautiful about
*  life. The fact that at every replication step, you don't lose any information because that
*  information is digital. If it was analog, if it was just protein concentrations, you'd lose it after
*  a few generations. It would just dissolve away. And that's what the ancients didn't understand
*  about inheritance. The first person to understand digital inheritance was Mendel, of course. And
*  his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years while Darwin was getting famous
*  about natural selection. But the missing component was this digital inheritance,
*  the mechanism of evolution that Mendel had discovered. So that aspect, in my view, is
*  the most beautiful aspect, but it transcends all of life. And can you elaborate maybe the
*  inheritance part? What was the key thing that the ancients didn't understand?
*  So the very theory of inheritance as discrete units, you know, throughout the life of Mendel
*  and well after his writing, people thought that his P experiments were just a little fluke,
*  that they were just a little exception that would normally not even apply to humans.
*  What they saw is this continuum of eye color, this continuum of skin color, this continuum of hair
*  color, this continuum of height. And all of these continuums did not fit with the discrete type of
*  inheritance that Mendel was describing. But what's unique about genomics and what's unique about the
*  genome is really that there are two copies and that you get a combination of these. But for every
*  trait, there are dozens of contributing variables. And it was only Ronald Fisher in the 20th century
*  that basically recognized that even five Mendelian traits would add up to a continuum-like
*  inheritance pattern. And he wrote a series of papers that still are very relevant today
*  about sort of this Mendelian inheritance of continuum-like traits. And I think that was
*  the missing step in inheritance. So well before the discovery of the structure of DNA, which is
*  again another amazingly beautiful aspect, the double helix, what I like to call the most noble
*  molecule of our time, holds within it the secret of that discrete inheritance. But the conceptualization
*  of discrete elements is something that precedes that. So even though it's discrete, when it
*  materializes itself into actual traits that we see, it can be continuous. It can basically
*  arbitrarily rich and complex. So if you have five genes that contribute to human height,
*  and there aren't five, there's a thousand. If there's only five genes and you inherit some
*  combination of them, and everyone makes you two inches taller or two inches shorter, it'll look
*  like a continuous trait. But instead of five, there are thousands, and every one of them contributes
*  to less than one millimeter. We change in height more during the day than each of these genetic
*  variants contributes. So by the evening, you're shorter than you walk up with.
*  Isn't it weird then that we're not more different than we are? Why are we all so similar if there's
*  so much possibility to be different? Yeah. So there are selective advantages to being medium.
*  If you're extremely tall or extremely short, you run into selective disadvantages. So you have
*  trouble breathing, you have trouble running, you have trouble sitting if you're too tall.
*  If you're too short, you might have other selective pressures acting against that.
*  If you look at natural history of human population, there's actually selection for height
*  in Northern Europe and selection against height in Southern Europe. So there might actually be
*  advantages to actually being not super tall. And if you look across the entire human population,
*  for many, many traits, there's a lot of push towards the middle. Balancing selection is
*  the usual term for selection that seeks to not be extreme and to have a combination of alleles that
*  keep recombining. And if you look at mate selection, super, super tall people will not tend to marry
*  super, super tall people. Very often you see these couples that are compensating for each other.
*  And the best predictor of the kid's age is very often just take the average of the two parents
*  and then adjust for sex and boom, you get it. It's extremely heritable. Let me ask, you took a step
*  back to the genome outside of just humans, but is there something that you find beautiful about
*  the human genome specifically? So I think the genome, if more people understood the beauty of
*  the human genome, they would be so many fewer wars, so much less anger in the world. I mean,
*  what's really beautiful about the human genome is really the variation that teaches us both about
*  individuality and about similarity. So any two people on the planet are 99.9% identical.
*  How can you fight with someone who's 99.9% identical to you? It's just counterintuitive.
*  And yet any two siblings of the same parents differ in millions of locations. So every one of them is
*  basically two to the million unique from any pair of parents, let alone any two random parents on the
*  planet. So that's, I think, something that teaches us about sort of the nature of humanity in many
*  ways, that every one of us is as unique as any star and way more unique in actually many ways.
*  And yet we're all brothers and sisters. Yeah, just like stars, most of it is just a fusion
*  reaction. Yeah, you only have a few parameters to describe stars. Yeah, exactly. Mass size,
*  initial size and stage of life. Whereas for humans, it's thousands of parameters scattered
*  across our genome. So the other thing that makes humans unique, the other things that makes
*  inheritance unique in humans is that most species inherit things vertically. Basically,
*  instinct is a huge part of their behavior. The way that, I mean, with my kids, we've been watching
*  this nest of birds with two little eggs outside our window for the last few months,
*  for the last few weeks as they've been growing. And there's so much behavior that's hard coded.
*  Birds don't just learn as they grow. There's no culture. A bird that's born in Boston will
*  be the same as a bird that's born in California. So there's not as much inheritance of ideas,
*  of customs. A lot of it is hard coded in their genome. What's really beautiful about the human
*  genome is that if you take a person from today and you place them back in ancient Egypt,
*  or if you take a person from ancient Egypt and you place them here today,
*  they will grow up to be completely normal. That is not genetics. This is the other type of
*  inheritance in humans. So on one hand, we have genetic inheritance, which is vertical from your
*  parents down. On the other hand, we have horizontal inheritance, which is the ideas that are built up
*  at every generation are horizontally transmitted. And the huge amount of time that we spend in
*  educating ourselves, a concept known as neoteny, neo for newborn and then teni for holding.
*  So if you look at humans, I mean, the little birds that were, you know, eggs two weeks ago,
*  and now one of them has already flown off, the other one's ready to fly off.
*  In two weeks, they're ready to just fend for themselves. Humans, 16 years, 18 years, 24,
*  getting out of college. I'm still learning. So that's so fascinating, this picture of a vertical
*  and the horizontal. When you talk about the horizontal, is it in the realm of ideas? Exactly.
*  Okay. So it's the actual social interactions. That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
*  So basically, the concept of neoteny is that you spend acquiring characteristics from your
*  environment in an extremely malleable state of your brain and the wiring of your brain
*  for a long period of your life. Compared to primates, we are useless. You take any primate
*  at seven weeks and any human at seven weeks, we lose the battle. But at 18 years, you know,
*  all bets are off. Like we basically, our brain continues to develop in an extremely malleable
*  form till very late. And this is what allows education. This is what allows the person from
*  Egypt to do extremely well now. And the reason for that is that the wiring of our brain and the
*  development of that wiring is actually delayed. So, you know, the longer you delay that, the more
*  opportunity you have to pass on knowledge, to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas from the parents to
*  the child. And what's really absolutely beautiful about humans today is that that lateral transfer
*  of ideas and culture is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school, but it's from
*  Wikipedia and review articles on the web and thousands of journals that are sort of putting
*  out information for free and podcasts and videocasts and all of that stuff, where you can
*  basically learn about any topic, pretty much everything that would be in any super advanced
*  textbook in a matter of days, instead of having to go to the Library of Alexandria and sail there
*  to read three books and then sail for another few days to get to Athens and etc. etc. etc.
*  So the democratization of knowledge and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge,
*  is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern.
*  RG So you sound excited about it. Are you also a little bit afraid or are you more excited
*  by the power of this kind of distributed spread of information? So you put it very kindly that
*  most people are kind of using the internet and looking Wikipedia, reading articles, reading
*  papers and so on. But if we're honest, most people online, especially when they're younger,
*  probably looking at five second clips on TikTok or whatever the new social network is,
*  are you, given this power of horizontal inheritance, are you optimistic or a little
*  bit pessimistic about this new effect of the internet and democratization of knowledge on our,
*  what would you call this, this genome, like would you use the term genome by the way?
*  Yeah, I think we use the genome to talk about DNA, but very often we say, I'm Greek, so people ask
*  me, hey, what's in the Greek genome? And I'm like, well, yeah, what's in the Greek genome is both our
*  genes and also our ideas and our ideals and our culture. So I think that there's a beauty to the
*  democratization of knowledge, the fact that you can reach as many people as any other person on
*  the planet and it's not who you are, it's really your ideas that matter, is a beautiful aspect of
*  the internet. I think there's of course a danger of my ignorance is as important as your expertise.
*  The fact that with this democratization comes the abolishment of respecting expertise,
*  just because you've spent 10,000 hours of your life studying, I don't know, human brain circuitry,
*  why should I trust you? I'm just going to make up my own theories and they'll be just as good as
*  yours, is an attitude that sort of counteracts the beauty of the democratization. And I think that
*  within our educational system and within the upbringing of our children, we have to not only
*  teach them knowledge, but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge. And that, you know,
*  it's very similar to sort of you fish, you catch a fish for a man for one day, you fed them for one
*  day, you teach them how to fish, you fed them for the rest of their life. So instead of just gathering
*  the knowledge they need for any one task, we can just tell them, all right, here's how you Google it,
*  here's how to figure out what's real and what's not, here's how you check the sources, here's how
*  you form a basic opinion for yourself. And I think that inquisitive nature is paramount to being able
*  to sort through this huge wealth of knowledge. So you need a basic educational foundation
*  based on which you can then add on the sort of domain specific knowledge. But that basic
*  educational foundation should just not just be knowledge, but it should also be epistemiology,
*  the way to acquire knowledge. I'm not sure any of us know how to do that in this modern day.
*  We're actually learning one of the big surprising things to me about the coronavirus, for example,
*  is that Twitter has been one of the best sources of information. Basically, like building your own
*  network of experts of, you know, as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise of the WHO and
*  the CDC and the, or maybe any one particular respectable person at the top of a department
*  of some kind of institution, you instead look at, you know, 10, 20, hundreds of people, some of whom
*  are young kids with just that are incredibly good at aggregating data and plotting and visualizing
*  that data. That's been really surprising to me. I don't know what to make of it. I don't know,
*  I don't know how that matures into something stable. You know, I don't know if you have ideas,
*  like what if you were to try to explain to your kids of how, where should you go to learn about
*  coronavirus? What would you say? It's such a beautiful example. And I think the current
*  pandemic and the speed at which the scientific community has moved in the current pandemic,
*  I think exemplifies this horizontal transfer and the speed of horizontal transfer of information.
*  The fact that, you know, the genome was first sequenced in early January, the first sample was
*  obtained December 29, 2019, a week after the publication of the first genome sequence,
*  Moderna had already finalized its vaccine design and was moving to production. I mean, this is
*  phenomenal. The fact that we go from not knowing what the heck is killing people in Wuhan to,
*  wow, it's SARS-CoV-2 and here's the set of genes, here's the genome, here's the sequence,
*  here are the polymorphisms, etc. In the matter of weeks is phenomenal. In that incredible pace of
*  transfer of knowledge, there have been many mistakes. So, you know, some of those mistakes
*  may have been politically motivated, or other mistakes may have just been innocuous errors.
*  Others may have been misleading the public for the greater good, such as don't wear masks,
*  because we don't want the masks to run out. I mean, that was very silly in my view and a very big
*  mistake. But the spread of knowledge from the scientific community was phenomenal. And some
*  people will point out to bogus articles that snuck in and made the front page. Yeah, they did. But
*  within 24 hours, they were debunked and went out of the front page. And I think that's the
*  beauty of science today. The fact that it's not, oh, knowledge is fixed. It's the ability to
*  embrace that nothing is permanent when it comes to knowledge, that everything is the current best
*  hypothesis and the current best model that best fits the current data, and the willingness to be
*  wrong. The expectation that we're going to be wrong, and the celebration of success based on
*  how long was I not proven wrong for, rather than, wow, I was exactly right. Because no one is going
*  to be exactly right with partial knowledge. But the arc towards perfection, I think is so much
*  more important than how far you are in your first step. And I think that's what sort of the
*  current pandemic has taught us the fact that, yeah, no, of course, we're going to make mistakes.
*  But at least we're going to learn from those mistakes and become better and learn better and
*  spread information better. So if I were to answer the question of where would you go to learn
*  about coronavirus? First textbook, it all starts with a textbook, just open up a chapter on
*  virology and how coronaviruses work, then some basic epidemiology and sort of how pandemics have
*  worked in the past. What are the basic principles surrounding these first wave, second wave? Why do
*  they even exist? Then understanding about growth, understanding about the R0 and RT at, you know,
*  various time points. And then understanding the means of spread, how it spreads from person to
*  person. Then how does it get into your cells from when it gets into the cells? What are the paths
*  that it takes? What are the cell types that express the particular ACE2 receptor? How is your immune
*  system interacting with the virus? And once your immune system launches its defense, how is that
*  helping or actually hurting your health? What about the cytokine storm? What are most people
*  dying from? Why are the comorbidities and these risk factors even applying? What makes obese people
*  respond more or elderly people respond more to the virus while kids are completely, you know,
*  very often not even aware that they're spreading it? So I think there's some basic
*  questions that you would start from. And then I'm sorry to say, but Wikipedia is pretty awesome.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Google is pretty awesome.
*  So it used to be a time, it used to be a time maybe five years ago. I forget, I forget when,
*  but people kind of made fun of Wikipedia for being an unreliable source. I never quite understood it.
*  I thought from the early days, it was pretty reliable or better than a lot of the alternatives.
*  But at this point, it's kind of like a solid accessible survey paper on every subject ever.
*  There's an ascertainment bias and a writing bias. So I think this is related to sort of people
*  saying, oh, so many nature papers are wrong. And they're like, why would you publish in nature?
*  So many nature papers are wrong. And my answer is, no, no, no, so many nature papers are scrutinized.
*  And just because more of them are being proven wrong than in other articles,
*  is actually evidence that they're actually better papers overall, because they're being
*  scrutinized at a rate much higher than any other journal. So if you basically judge Wikipedia by
*  not the initial content, but by the number of revisions, then of course it's going to be the
*  best source of knowledge eventually. It's still very superficial. You then have to go into the
*  review papers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I mean, for most scientific topics, it's
*  extremely superficial, but it is quite authoritative because it is the place that everybody likes to
*  criticize as being wrong. You say that it's superficial. And a lot of topics that I've
*  studied a lot of, I find it, I don't know if superficial is the right word,
*  because superficial kind of implies that it's not correct.
*  No, no, no. I don't mean any implication of it not being correct. It's just superficial.
*  It's basically only scratching the surface. For depth, you don't go to Wikipedia, you go to the
*  review articles. But it can be profound in the way that articles rarely, one of the frustrating
*  things to me about certain computer science, like in the machine learning world, articles,
*  they don't as often take the bigger picture view. It's a kind of data set and you show that it works
*  and you kind of show that here's an architectural thing that creates an improvement and so on and so
*  forth. But you don't say, well, what does this mean for the nature of intelligence for future
*  data sets we haven't even thought about? Or if you were trying to implement this, if we took this
*  data set of 100,000 examples and scale it to 100 billion examples with this method,
*  look at the bigger picture, which is what a Wikipedia article would actually try to do,
*  which is like, what does this mean in the context of the broad field of computer vision or something
*  like that? Yeah, yeah. I agree with you completely, but it depends on the topic. For some topics,
*  there's been a huge amount of work. For other topics, it's just a stub.
*  So, you know. I got it. Yeah. Well, yeah, actually, which we'll talk on, genomics was not
*  great. Yeah, it's very shallow. Yeah. It's not wrong. It's just shallow. It's shallow. Yeah.
*  Every time I criticize something, I should feel partly responsible. Basically, if more people
*  from my community went there and edited, it would not be shallow. It's just that there's different
*  modes of communication in different fields. And in some fields, the experts have embraced Wikipedia.
*  In other fields, it's relegated. And perhaps the reason is that if it was any better to start with,
*  people would invest more time. But if it's not great to start with, then you need a few initial
*  pioneers who will basically go in and say, enough, we're just going to fix that. And then I think
*  it'll catch on much more. So if it's okay, before we go on to genomics, can we linger a little bit
*  longer on the beauty of the human genome? You've given me a few notes. What else do you find
*  beautiful about the human genome? So the last aspect of what makes the human genome unique,
*  in addition to the similarity and the differences and the individuality, is that, so very early on,
*  people would basically say, oh, you don't do that experiment in human. You have to learn about that
*  in fly. Or you have to learn about that in yeast first, or in mouse first, or in a primate first.
*  And the human genome was in fact relegated to sort of, oh, the last place that you're going to go to
*  learn something new. That has dramatically changed. And the reason that changed is human genetics.
*  We are the species in the planet that's the most studied right now. It's embarrassing to say that,
*  but this was not the case a few years ago. It used to be first viruses, then bacteria, then yeast,
*  then the fruit fly and the worm, then the mouse. And eventually, human was very far last.
*  So it's embarrassing that it took us this long to focus on it?
*  It's embarrassing that the model organisms have been taken over because of the power of human
*  genetics. That right now, it's actually simpler to figure out the phenotype of something by mining
*  this massive amount of human data than by going back to any of the other species. And the reason
*  for that is that if you look at the natural variation that happens in a population of seven
*  billion, you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide. So every nucleotide you want to
*  perturb, you can go find a living, breathing human being and go test the function of that nucleotide
*  by searching the database and finding that person. Why is that embarrassing? It's a beautiful data
*  set. It's embarrassing for the model organism. For the flies. Yeah, exactly. I mean, do you feel
*  on a small tangent, is there something of value in the genome of a fly and other of these
*  model organisms that you miss that we wish we would be looking at deeper? So directed
*  perturbation, of course. So I think the place where humans are still lagging is the fact that
*  in an animal model, you can go and say, well, let me knock out this gene completely and let me knock
*  out these three genes completely. And at the moment you get into combinatorics, it's something you
*  can't do in the human because there just simply aren't enough humans on the planet. And again,
*  let me be honest, we haven't sequenced all seven billion people. It's not like we have every mutation,
*  but we know that there's a carrier out there. So if you look at the trend and the speed with which
*  human genetics has progressed, we can now find thousands of genes involved in human cognition,
*  in human psychology, in the emotions and the feelings that we used to think are uniquely
*  learned. Turns out there's a genetic basis to a lot of that. So the human genome has continued
*  to elucidate through these studies of genetic variation, so many different processes that we
*  previously thought were something like free will. Free will is this beautiful concept that
*  humans have had for a long time. In the end, it's just a bunch of chemical reactions happening in
*  your brain and the particular abundance of receptors that you have this day based on what
*  you ate yesterday or that you have been wired with based on your parents and your upbringing, etc.,
*  determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component to narrow and narrow
*  slices. So how much on that point, how much freedom do you think we have to escape the
*  constraints of our genome? You're making it sound like more and more we're discovering that our
*  genome actually has a lot of the story already encoded into it. How much freedom do we have?
*  So let me describe what that freedom would look like. That freedom would be my saying,
*  oh I'm going to resist the urge to eat that apple because I choose not to. But there are
*  chemical receptors that made me not resist the urge to prove my individuality and my free will
*  by resisting the apple. So then the next question is, well maybe now I'll resist the urge to resist
*  the apple and I'll go for the chocolate instead to prove my individuality. But then what about
*  those other receptors that you know. That might be all encoded in there. So it's kicking the
*  bucket down the road and basically saying, well your choice may have actually been driven by
*  other things that you actually are not choosing. So that's why it's very hard to answer that
*  question. It's hard to know what to do with that. I mean if the genome has,
*  if there's not much freedom it's the butterfly effect. It's basically that in the short term
*  you can predict something extremely well by knowing the current state of the system.
*  But a few steps down it's very hard to predict based on the current knowledge.
*  Is that because the system is truly free? When I look at weather patterns I can predict the next
*  10 days. Is it because the weather has a lot of freedom and after 10 days it chooses to do
*  something else? Or is it because in fact the system is fully deterministic and there's just
*  a slightly different magnetic field of the earth, slightly more energy arriving from the sun, a
*  slightly different spin of the gravitational pull of Jupiter that is now causing all kinds of tides
*  and slight deviation of the moon etc. Maybe all of that can be fully modeled. Maybe the fact that
*  China is emitting a little more carbon today is actually going to affect the weather in Egypt in
*  three weeks and all of that could be fully modeled. In the same way if you take a complete view of a
*  human being now, you know I model everything about you, the question is can I predict your next step?
*  Probably. But at how far? And if it's a little further is that because of stochasticity and
*  sort of chaos properties of unpredictability of beyond a certain level or was that actually true
*  free will? Yeah, so the number of variables might be so you might need to build an entire universe to
*  simulate a human and then maybe that human will be fully simulatable but maybe aspects of free will
*  will exist and where's that free will coming from? It's still coming from the same neurons or maybe
*  from a spirit inhabiting these neurons but again you know it's very difficult empirically to sort
*  of evaluate where does free will begin and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals and
*  end. So on that topic let me ask the most absurd question that most MIT faculty roll their eyes on
*  but what do you think about the simulation hypothesis and the idea that we live in a simulation?
*  I think it's complete BS. There's no empirical evidence. Absolutely none. Not in terms of empirical
*  evidence, not but in terms of a thought experiment, does it help you think about the universe?
*  I mean so if you look at the genome it's encoding a lot of the information that is required to
*  create some of the beautiful human complexity that we see around us. It's an interesting thought
*  experiment how much you know parameters do we need to have in order to model something you know this
*  full human experience. Like if we were to build a video game how hard it would be to build a video
*  game that's like convincing enough and fun enough and you know it has consistent laws of physics all
*  that stuff it's not interesting to use a thought experiment. I mean it's cute but you know it's
*  Occam's razor. I mean what's more realistic the fact that you're actually a machine or that you're
*  you know a person? What's the fact that all of my experiences exist inside the chemical
*  molecules that I have or that somebody's actually you know simulating all that? I mean
*  well you did refer to humans as a digital computer earlier so of course of course but that does not
*  kind of a machine right? I know I know but I think the probability of all that is nil
*  and let the machines wake me up and just terminate me now if it's not.
*  I challenge you machines. They're gonna they're gonna wait a little bit to see what you're gonna
*  do next. It's fun it's fun to watch especially the clever humans. What's the difference to you
*  between the way a computer stores information and the human genome stores information? So you also
*  have roots and your work would you say you're when you introduce yourself at a bar? It depends
*  who I'm talking to. Would you say it's computational biology? Do you do you reveal your expertise in
*  computers? It depends who I'm talking to I don't know truly I mean basically if I meet someone
*  who's in computers I'll say oh I mean professor in computer science if I meet someone who's in
*  engineering I say computer science and electrical engineering if I meet someone in biology I'll say
*  hey I work in genomics if I meet someone in medicine like hey I work on you know genetics.
*  You're a fun person to meet at a bar I got you but so no no but what I'm trying to say is that I don't
*  I mean there's no single attribute that I will define myself as you know there's a few things
*  I know there's a few things I study there's a few things I have degrees on and just a few
*  things that it grants degrees in and you know I I publish papers across the whole gamut you know
*  the whole spectrum of computation to biology etc. I mean I the complete answer is that I use computer
*  science to understand biology so I'm a you know I develop methods in AI and machine learning
*  statistics and algorithms etc. but the ultimate goal of my career is to really understand biology.
*  If these things don't advance our understanding of biology I'm not as fascinated by them although
*  there are some beautiful computational problems by themselves I've sort of made it my mission to
*  apply the power of computer science to truly understand the human genome health disease
*  you know and the whole gamut of how our brain works our body works and all of that which is
*  so fascinating. So the dream there's not an equivalent sort of complementary dream of
*  understanding human biology in order to create an artificial life an artificial brain
*  artificial intelligence that supersedes the intelligence and the capabilities of us humans.
*  It's an interesting question it's a fascinating question so understanding the human brain is
*  undoubtedly coupled to how do we make better AI because so much of AI has in fact been inspired
*  by the brain. It may have taken 50 years since the early days of neural networks till we have you know
*  all of these amazing progress that we've seen with you know deep belief networks and you know all of
*  these advances in go and chess in image synthesis in deep fakes in you name it.
*  And but the underlying architecture is very much inspired by the human brain which actually
*  posits a very very interesting question. Why are neural networks performing so well
*  and they perform amazingly well? Is it because they can simulate any possible function?
*  And the answer is no no they simulate a very small number of functions.
*  Is it because they can simulate every possible function in the universe? And that's where it
*  gets interesting the answer is actually yeah a little closer to that. And here's where it gets
*  really fun. If you look at human brain and human cognition it didn't evolve in a vacuum it evolved
*  in a world with physical constraints like the world that inhabits us. It is the world that we
*  inhabit and if you look at our senses what do they perceive? They perceive different you know
*  parts of the electromagnetic spectrum you know the hearing is just different movements in air
*  the touch etc. I mean all of these things we've built intuitions for the physical world that we
*  inhabit and our brains and the brains of all animals evolved for that world. And the AI systems
*  that we have built happen to work well with images of the type that we encounter in the physical
*  world that we inhabit. Whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal that doesn't match
*  anything in our world neural networks will not do as well. And that actually basically has this
*  whole loop around this which is this was designed by studying our own brain which was evolved for
*  our own world and they happen to do well in our own world and they happen to make the same types
*  of mistakes that humans make very many times. And of course you can engineer images by adding just
*  the right amount of you know sort of pixel deviations to make a zebra look like a bamboo
*  and stuff like that or like a table. But ultimately the un-doctored images at least
*  are very often you know mistaken I don't know between muffins and dogs for example
*  in the same way that humans make those mistakes. So it's you know there's no doubt in my view
*  that the more we understand about the tricks that our human brain has evolved to understand the
*  physical world around us the more we will be able to bring new computational primitives in our AI
*  systems to again better understand not just the world around us but maybe even the world inside
*  us and maybe even the computational problems that arise from new types of data that we haven't been
*  exposed to but are yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in with a very tiny little subset of
*  functions from all possible mathematical functions. Yeah and that small subset of functions all that
*  matters for us humans really that's what makes it's all that has mattered so far and even within
*  our scientific realm it's all that seems to continue to matter. But I mean I always like
*  to think about our senses and how much of the physical world around us we perceive. And if you
*  look at the LIGO experiment over the last you know year and a half has been all over the news.
*  What did LIGO do? It created a new sense for human beings. A sense that has never been sensed
*  in the history of our planet. Gravitational waves have been traversing the earth
*  since its creation a few billion years ago. Life has evolved senses to sense things
*  that were never before sensed. Light was not perceived by early life. No one cared.
*  And eventually photoreceptors evolved and you know the ability to sense colors by sort of catching
*  different parts of that electromagnetic spectrum and hearing evolved and touch evolved etc.
*  But no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos floating through earth or gravitational waves
*  flowing through earth etc. And I find it so beautiful in the history of not just humanity but
*  life on the planet that we are now able to capture additional signals from the physical
*  world than we ever knew before. And axions for example have been all over the news in the last
*  few weeks. The concept that we can capture and perceive more of that physical world
*  is as exciting as the fact that we were blind to it is traumatizing before. Because that also
*  tells us how you know we're in 2020. Picture yourself in 3020 or in 20 you know what new
*  senses might we discover. Is it you know could it be that we're missing nine tenths of physics
*  that like there's a lot of physics out there that we're just blind to completely oblivious to it.
*  Yeah and yet they're permeating us all the time. Yeah so it might be right in front of us.
*  So when you're thinking about premonitions yeah a lot of that is ascertainment bias. Like yeah
*  every you know every now and then you're like oh I remember my friend and then my friend doesn't
*  appear and I'll forget that I remember my friend. But every now and then my friend will actually
*  appear I'm like oh my god I thought about you a minute ago you just called me that's amazing.
*  So you know some of that is this but some of that might be that there are within our brain sensors
*  for waves that we emit that we're not even aware of. And this whole concept of when I hug my
*  children there's such an emotional transfer there that we don't comprehend. I mean sure yeah of
*  course we're all like hard wire for all kinds of touchy feely things between parents and kids.
*  Beautiful between partners is beautiful etc. But then there are intangible aspects of human
*  communication that I don't think it's unfathomable that our brain has actually
*  evolved ways and sensors for it that we just don't capture. We don't understand the function
*  of the vast majority of our neurons and maybe our brain is already sensing it. But even worse
*  maybe our brain is not sensing it at all and we're oblivious to this until we build a machine that
*  suddenly is able to sort of capture so much more of what's happening in the natural world. So what
*  you're saying is physics is going to discover a sensor for love.
*  And maybe dogs are off scale for that and we've been you know we've been oblivious to it the
*  whole time because we didn't have the right sensor. And now you're gonna have a little
*  risk that says oh my god I feel all this love in the house. I sense a disturbance in the forest.
*  And dogs and cats will have zero none none none.
*  Let's take a step back to our unfortunate place. To one of the 400 topics that we had actually planned.
*  But to our sad time in 2020 when we only have just a few sensors and very primitive early
*  computers. So in your you have a foot in computer science and a foot in biology.
*  In your sense how do computers represent information differently than like the genome
*  or biological systems? So first of all let me let me correct that no we're in an amazing time in 2020.
*  Computer science is totally awesome and physics is totally awesome and we have understood so much
*  of the natural world than ever before. So I am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky
*  to be living in the time that we are because you know first of all who knows when the asteroid
*  will hit. And second you know of all times in humanity this is probably the best time to be a
*  human being and this might actually be the best place to be a human being. So anyway you know for
*  anyone who loves science this is this is it this is awesome it's a great time. At the same time just
*  a quick comment all I meant is that if we look several hundred years from now and we end up somehow
*  not destroying ourselves. People probably look back at this time in computer science and
*  at your work of Manolis at MIT as infantile and silly and how ignorant it all was.
*  I like to joke very often with my students that you know we've written so many papers we've
*  published so much we've been citing so much and every single time I tell my students you know the
*  best is ahead of us. What we're working on now is the most exciting thing I've ever worked on.
*  So in a way I do have this sense of yeah even the papers I wrote 10 years ago they were awesome at
*  the time but I'm so much more excited about where we're heading now and I don't mean to minimize
*  any of the stuff we've done in the past but you know there's just this sense of excitement about
*  what you're working on now that as soon as the paper is submitted it's like oh it's old like you
*  know I can't talk about that anymore. At the same time you're not you probably are not going to be
*  able to predict what are the most impactful papers and ideas when people look back 200 years from now
*  at your work what would be the most exciting papers and it may very well be not the thing
*  that you expected or yeah the things you've got awards for or you know this might be true in some
*  fields I don't know I feel slightly differently about it in our field I feel that I kind of know
*  what are the important ones and there's a very big difference between what the press picks up on
*  and what's actually fundamentally important for the field and I think for the fundamentally
*  important ones we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are and it's hard to sometimes get the
*  press excited about the fundamental advances but you know we take what we get and celebrate what
*  we get and sometimes you know one of our papers which was in a minor journal made the front page
*  of reddit and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views even though it was in a
*  minor journal because you know somebody pitched it the right way that it suddenly caught everybody's
*  attention whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental you know we have a hard time
*  getting the editors even excited about them when so many hundreds of people are already using the
*  results and building upon them so I do appreciate that there's a discrepancy between the perception
*  and the perceived success and the awards that you get for various papers but I think that
*  fundamentally I know that you know some paper I'm so so when you're right that you're most proud
*  you know you just you trapped yourself no no no no I mean is there a line of work that you
*  have a sense is really powerful that you've done to date you've done so much work in so many
*  directions which is interesting is there something where you think is quite special I mean it's like
*  asking me to say which of my three children I love best I mean exactly so I mean it's such a
*  give me question that is so so difficult not to brag about the awesome work that my team and
*  my students have done and I'll just mention a few off the top of my head I mean basically there's
*  a few landmark papers that I think have shaped my scientific path and you know I like to somehow
*  describe it as a linear continuation of one thing led to another led to another led to another
*  and you know it kind of all started with
*  skip skip skip skip skip let me try to start somewhere in the middle
*  so my first PhD paper was the first comparative analysis of multiple species
*  so multiple complete genomes so for the first time we we basically developed a concept of
*  genome-wide evolutionary signatures the fact that you could look across the entire genome
*  and understand how things evolve and from these signatures of evolution you could go back
*  and study any one region and say that's a protein coding gene that's an RNA gene that's a regulatory
*  motif that's a you know binding site and so on and so forth so I'm sorry so comparing different
*  different species species of the soul so take human mouse rat and dog yeah you know they're
*  all animals they're all mammals they're all performing similar functions with their heart
*  with their brain with their lungs etc etc so there's many functional elements that make us
*  uniquely mammalian and those mammalian elements are actually conserved 99 percent of our genome
*  does not code for protein one percent codes for protein the other 99 percent we frankly didn't
*  know what it does until we started doing this comparative genomic studies so basically these
*  series of papers in in my career have basically first developed that concept of evolutionary
*  signatures and then apply them to yeast apply them to flies apply them to four mammals apply
*  them to 17 fungi apply them to 12 drosophila species apply them to then 29 mammals and now
*  200 mammals so sorry so can we so the the evolutionary signatures it seems like a such
*  a fascinating idea and we're probably going to linger on your early phd work for two hours but
*  how can you reveal something interesting about the genome by looking at the multiple
*  multiple species and looking at the evolutionary signatures yeah so so you basically align
*  the matching regions so everything evolved from a common ancestor way way back and mammals evolved
*  from a common ancestor about 60 million years back so after you know the meteor that killed off the
*  dinosaurs landed alleged near machu picchu we know the crater it didn't allegedly like that was the
*  aliens okay no just slightly north of machu picchu in the gulf of mexico there's a giant hole that
*  that meteor by the way sorry is that definitive to people have people um um conclusively
*  figured out what killed the dinosaurs i think so so it was a meteor well you know for volcanic
*  activity all kinds of other stuff is coinciding but the meteor is pretty unique and we now have
*  terrifying i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of 2020 left so if anything no no but think about it
*  this way so the the the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years we humans have been around
*  for what less than one million years if you're super generous about what you call humans
*  and you include chimps basically um so so uh we are just getting warmed up and you know we've
*  ruled the planet much more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex
*  t-rex had much less of an environmental impact than we did and um if you if you give us another
*  154 million years you know humans will look very different if we make it that far so i think
*  dinosaurs basically are much more of life history on earth than we are in all respects but look at
*  the bright side when they were killed off another life form emerged mammals and that's that whole
*  evolutionary uh branching that's happened so you you kind of have uh we have these evolutionary
*  signatures you see is there basically a map of how the genome changed yeah exactly so so now you
*  can go back to this early mammal that was hiding in caves and you can basically ask what happened
*  after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton of evolutionary niches opened up and the mammals
*  started populating all of these niches and in that diversification there was room for expansion
*  of new types of functions so some of them populated the air with bats flying a new evolution of light
*  some populated the oceans with dolphins and whales going off to swim etc but we all are
*  fundamentally mammals so you can take the genomes of all these species and align them on top of
*  each other and basically create nucleotide resolution correspondences what my phd work
*  showed is that when you do that when you line up species on top of each other you can see that
*  within protein coding genes there's a particular pattern of evolution that is dictated by the level
*  at which evolutionary selection acts if i'm coding for a protein and i change the third
*  codon position of a triplet that code for that amino acid the same amino acid will be encoded
*  so that basically means that any kind of mutation that preserves that translation that is invariant
*  to that ultimate functional assessment that evolution will give is tolerated so for any
*  function that you're trying to achieve there's a set of sequences that encode it you can now look
*  at the mapping the you know graph isomorphism if you wish between all of the possible dna encodings
*  of a particular function and that function and instead of having just that exact sequence at the
*  protein level you can think of the set of protein sequences that all fulfill the same function
*  what's evolution doing evolution has two components one component is random blind and stupid mutation
*  the other component is super smart ruthless selection that's my mom calling from greece
*  yes i might be a fully grown man but i am agree say did you just cancel the call wow i know i'm
*  in trouble and she's gonna be calling the cops i'm gonna i'm gonna edit this clip out and send it to her
*  so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding for the same kind of function yeah so you so you now have
*  this mapping between all of the set of functions that could all encode the same all of the set of
*  sequences that can all encode the same function what evolutionary signatures does is that it
*  basically looks at the shape of that distribution of sequences that all encode the same thing
*  and based on that shape you can basically say oh proteins have a very different shape
*  than rna structures than regulatory motifs etc so just by scanning a sequence ignoring the sequence
*  and just looking at the pattern of change i'm like wow this thing is evolving like a protein
*  and that thing is evolving like a motif and that thing is evolving so that's exactly what we just
*  did for covid so our paper that we post in a bio archive about coronavirus basically took this
*  concept of evolutionary signatures and applied it on the sars-cov-2 genome that is responsible for
*  the covid-19 pandemic uh and comparing it to uh to 44 sarbicovirus species so this is the beta
*  where did you just use sarbicovirus so sars related beta coronavirus it's a portmanteau
*  so that one family of viruses yeah so that family by the way we have 44 species that or
*  maybe four species in the family yeah virus is a clever bunch no no but but there's just 44
*  and again we don't call them species in in viruses we call them strains but anyway there's 44 strains
*  and that's a tiny little subset of you know maybe another 50 strains that are just far too
*  distantly related most of those only infect bats as the host and a subset of only four or five
*  have ever infected humans and we basically took all of those and we aligned them in the same exact
*  way that we've aligned mammals and then we looked at what proteins are you know which of the
*  currently hypothesized genes for the coronavirus genome are in fact evolving like proteins and
*  which ones are not and what we found is that orf 10 the last little open reading frame the
*  last little gene in the genome is bogus that's not a protein at all what is it it's an RNA structure
*  that doesn't have uh it doesn't get translated into amino acids and that so it's important to
*  narrow down to basically discover what's useful and what's not exactly basically what are what
*  is even the set of genes the other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed is that within
*  orf 3a lies a tiny little additional gene encoded within the other gene so you can translate a DNA
*  sequence in three different reading frames if you start in the first one it's you know atg etc if
*  you start on the second one it's tgc etc and with there's a there's a gene within a gene
*  so there's a whole other protein that we didn't know about that might be super important so we
*  don't even know the building blocks of sars-cov-2 so if we want to understand coronavirus biology
*  and eventually fight it successfully we need to even have the set of genes and these evolutionary
*  signatures that i developed in my phd work are you we just recently used you know what let's uh
*  let's run with that tangent for a little bit if it's okay uh is uh can we talk about uh the the
*  covid 19 a little bit more like how what's your sense about the the genome the proteins the
*  functions that we understand about covid 19 where do we stand in your sense what are the big open
*  problems and also you know you you kind of said it's important to understand what are the
*  like the the important proteins and like why is that important
*  and so what else does the comparison of these species tell us what it tells us is how fast
*  are things evolving it tells us about at what level is the acceleration or deceleration pedal
*  set for every one of these proteins so the genome has you know 30 some genes some genes evolve
*  super super fast others evolve super super slow if you look at the polymerous gene that basically
*  replicates the genome that's a super slow evolving one if you look at the nucleocapsid protein
*  that's also super slow evolving if you look at the spike one protein this is the part of the spike
*  protein that actually touches the h2 receptor and then enables the virus to attach to your cells
*  that's the thing that gives it that that visual the corona look basically the corona look yeah
*  so basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus and there's a first part of the protein s1
*  which basically attaches to the h2 receptor and then s2 is the latch that sort of pushes and
*  channels the fusion of the membranes and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells
*  which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins so the s1 protein is evolving ridiculously
*  fast so if you look at the stop there's this gas pedal the gas pedal is all the way down
*  orf8 is also evolving super fast and orf6 is evolving super fast we have no idea what they do
*  we have some idea but nowhere near what s1 is so what the isn't that terrifying that s1 is
*  evolved that means that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fast doesn't that mean new
*  strains can be created or it does that means that it's searching for how to match how to
*  best match the host so basically anything in in general in evolution if you look at genomes
*  anything that's contacting the environment is evolving much faster than anything that's
*  internal and the reason is that the environment changes so if you look at the evolution of these
*  herbic viruses the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly because it's attaching to different hosts
*  each time we think of them as bats but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one
*  species of bat to another species of bat you have to adjust and you want to the new ACE2 receptor
*  that you're going to be facing in that new species sorry quick tangent yeah is it fascinating to you
*  that viruses are doing this i mean it feels like they're this intelligent organism i mean is it
*  like does it give you pause how incredible it is that they're the evolutionary dynamics that
*  you're describing is actually happening and they're figuring out figuring out how to jump from bats
*  to humans all in this distributed fashion and then most of us don't even say they're alive or
*  intelligent whatever so intelligence is in the eye of the beholder you know stupid is as stupid does
*  as forrest gump would say yes and intelligent is as intelligent does so basically if the virus is
*  finding solutions that we think of as intelligent yeah it's probably intelligent but that's again
*  in the eye of the beholder do you think viruses are intelligent oh of course not really no
*  it's so incredible remember remember when i was talking about the two components of evolution
*  one is the stupid mutation yeah which is completely blind and the other one is the
*  super smart selection which is ruthless so it's not viruses who are smart it's this component of
*  evolution that's smart so it's evolution that that sort of appears smart and how is that happening
*  by huge parallel search across thousands of you know parallel infections throughout the world
*  right now yes but so to push back on that so yes so then the the intelligence is in the mechanism
*  but then by that argument viruses would be more intelligent because there's just more of them
*  so the search they're basically the the brute force search that's happening with viruses because
*  there's so many more of them than humans then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent
*  i mean so you don't think it's possible that i mean who runs would we even be here with if
*  viruses weren't i mean who runs this thing so so so so let me answer yeah let me answer your your
*  question so we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses yes and part of the reason is that if you
*  look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after
*  the death of the dinosaurs is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome spread throughout
*  our genome and created binding sites for new classes of regulatory proteins and these binding
*  sites that landed all over our genome are now control elements that basically control our genes
*  and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry of mammalian genomes so you know everything's
*  coevolution and we're working together yeah but and yet you say they're dumb no i never said
*  they're dumb they just don't care they don't care another thing oh is the virus trying to kill us
*  no it's not the virus is not trying to kill you it's trying it's not it's actually actively trying
*  to not kill you so when you get infected if you die bomber i killed him is what the reaction of
*  the virus will be why because that virus won't spread many people have a misconception of oh
*  viruses are smart or oh viruses are mean they don't care it like you have to clean yourself of any
*  kind of anthropomorphism out there i don't know oh yes so there's a there's a sense when taken as
*  a whole that there's a it's in the eye of the beholder stupid is a stupid does intelligent is
*  a stupid intelligent does so if you want to call them intelligent that's fine then because the end
*  result is that they're finding amazing solutions right i mean i i mean but they're they're so dumb
*  about it they're just doing dumb they don't care they're not dumb and they're not they're just they
*  don't care the care the care word is really interesting i mean there could be an argument
*  that they're conscious they're just dividing they're not they're just dividing they're just
*  a little entity which happens to be dividing and spreading it just doesn't want to kill us in fact
*  it prefers not to kill us it just wants to spread and when i say once again i'm anthropomorphizing
*  but it's just that if you have two versions of a virus one acquires a mutation that spreads more
*  that's going to spread more one acquires a mutation that spreads less that's going to be
*  lost yes one acquires a mutation that enters faster that's going to be kept one acquires a
*  mutation that kills you right away it's going to be lost so over evolutionary time the viruses that
*  spread super well but don't kill the host are the ones that are going to survive yeah but so you
*  you brilliantly describe the basic mechanisms of how it all happens but when you zoom out and you
*  see the uh you know the entirety of virus it may be across different strains of viruses
*  it seems like a living organism i am in awe of biology i find biology amazingly beautiful
*  i find the design of the current coronavirus however lethal it is amazingly beautiful the
*  way that it is encoded the way that it tricks your cells into making 30 proteins from a single rna
*  human cells don't do that human cells make one protein from each rna molecule they don't make
*  two they make one we are hardwired to make only one protein from every rna molecule and yet this
*  virus goes in throws in a single messenger rna just like any messenger rna we have tens of thousands
*  messenger rnas in our cells in any one time in every one of our cells it throws in one rna and
*  that rna is so i'm going to use your word here not my word intelligent yeah that it hijacks the
*  entire machinery of your human cell yeah it basically has at the beginning a giant open
*  reading frame that's a giant protein that gets translated two-thirds of that rna make a single
*  giant protein that single protein is basically what a human cell would make it's like oh
*  here's a start code on i'm going to start translating here human cells are kind of dumb
*  i'm sorry again this is not the words that we normally use but the human cell basically is oh
*  this is an rna must be mine let me translate and it starts translating it and then you're in trouble
*  why because that one protein as it's growing gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides
*  the first peptide and the second peptide start interacting and the third one and the fourth one
*  and they shut off the ribosome of the whole cell to not translate human
*  rnas anymore so the virus basically hijacks your cells and it cuts it cleaves every one of your
*  human rnas to basically say to the ribosome don't translate this one junk don't look at this one
*  junk and it only spares its own rnas because they have a particular mark that it spares
*  then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein in your human cells are now only able
*  to translate viral rnas and they more and more and more and more of them that's the first 20
*  proteins in fact halfway down about protein 11 between you know 11 and 12 you basically have a
*  translational slippage where the ribosome skips reading frame and it translates from one reading
*  frame to another reading frame that means that about half of them are going to be translated
*  from one to 11 and the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16 it's gorgeous and then
*  then you're done then that mrna will never translate the last 10 proteins but spike is
*  the one right after that one so how does spike even get translated this positive strand rna virus
*  has a reverse transcriptors which is an rna based reverse transcriptors so from the rna on the
*  positive strand it makes an rna on the negative strand and in between every single one of these
*  genes these open reading frames there's a little signal aac gca or something like that that
*  basically loops over to the beginning of the rna and basically instead of sort of having a single
*  full negative strand rna it basically has a partial negative strand rna that ends right before the
*  beginning of that gene and another one that ends right before the beginning of that gene
*  these negative strand rna is now make positive strand rna's that then look to the human whole
*  cell just like any other human mrna it's like oh great i'm going to translate that one because
*  it doesn't have the cleaving that the virus has now put on all your human genes and then you've
*  lost the battle that cell is now only making proteins for the virus that will then create
*  the spike protein the envelope protein the membrane protein the nucleocapsid protein that
*  will package up the rna and then sort of create new viral envelopes and these will then be
*  secreted out of that cell in new little packages that will then infect the rest of the cells
*  repeat the whole process it's beautiful right it's hard not to anthropomorphize it
*  but it's so gorgeous so there is a beauty to it is there is it is it terrifying to you
*  so this is something that has happened throughout history humans have been nearly wiped out over and
*  over and over again and yet never fully wiped out so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the human race
*  i'm not even concerned about you know the impact on sort of our our survival as a species
*  this is absolutely something i mean you know human life is so invaluable and every one of us is so
*  invaluable but if you think of it as sort of is this the end of our species by by no means
*  basically so so let me explain the back death killed what 30 percent of europe that has left
*  a tremendous imprint uh you know a huge hole a horrendous hole in the genetic makeup of humans
*  there's been series of wiping out of huge fractions of entire species or just entire
*  species altogether and that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire if you look at how
*  europe was shaped and how africa was shaped by malaria for example all the individuals that
*  carry a mutation that protects you from malaria were able to survive much more and if you look at
*  the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequency of malaria the maps are actually
*  showing the same pattern the same imprint on africa and that basically led people to hypothesize that
*  the reason why sickle cell disease is so much more frequent in americans of african descent is because
*  there was selection in africa against malaria leading to sickle cell because when the cell sickle
*  malaria is not able to replicate you know replicate inside your cells as well and therefore
*  you protect against that so if you look at human disease all of the genetic associations that we do
*  with human disease you basically see the imprint of these waves of selection killing off gazillions
*  of humans and there's so many immune processes that are coming up as associated with so many
*  different diseases the reason for that is similar to what i was describing earlier where the outward
*  facing proteins evolve much more rapidly because the environment is always changing but what's
*  really interesting the human genome is that we have co-opted many of these immune genes to carry out
*  non-immune functions for example in our brain we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections
*  that don't get used this whole use it or lose it we know the mechanism it's microglia that cleave
*  off neuronal synaptic connections that are just not utilized when you utilize them you mark them
*  in a particular way that basically when the microglia come tell it don't kill this one it's
*  it's used now and the microglia will go off and kill it once you don't use this is an immune function
*  which is co-opted to do non-immune things if you look at our adipocytes m1 versus m2 macrophages
*  inside our fat will basically determine whether you're obese or not and these are again immune
*  cells that are resident and living within these tissues so many disease associations
*  that we co-opt these kinds of things for incredibly complicated functions exactly evolution works in
*  so many different ways which are all beautiful and mysterious but not intelligent not intelligent
*  it's in the eye of the beholder but but but the the point that i'm trying to make is that
*  if you look at the imprint that covet will have hopefully it'll not be big hopefully the u.s.
*  will get attacked together and stop the virus from spreading further but if it doesn't it's
*  having an imprint on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires so if you look
*  at now the genetic associations of blood type and immune function cells etc there's actually
*  association genetic variation that basically says how much more likely am i or you to die
*  if we contact the virus and it's it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome that
*  humans have basically made it so far and selection is ruthless and it's brutal and it only comes with
*  a lot of killing but this is the way that viruses and environments have shaped the human genome
*  basically when you go through periods of famine you select for particular genes and what's left
*  is not necessarily better it's just whatever survived and it may have been the surviving one
*  back then not because it was better maybe the ones that ran slower survived i mean you know again
*  not necessarily better but the surviving ones are basically the ones that then are shaped for any
*  kind of subsequent evolutionary condition and environmental condition but if you look at for
*  example obesity obesity was selected for basically the genes that now predisposes to obesity were
*  at two percent frequency in africa they rose to 44 frequency in europe that's fascinating because
*  you basically went through the ice ages and there was a scarcity of food so you know there was a
*  selection to being able to store every single carol calorie you consume eventually environment
*  changes so the better allele which was the fat storing allele became the worst allele because
*  it's the fat storing allele it still has the same function so if you look at my genome speaking of
*  mom calling mom gave me a bad copy of that gene this fto locus basically makes me has to do with
*  obesity or the bc yeah i basically now have a bad copy from mom that makes me more likely to be
*  obese and i also also have a bad copy from dad that makes me more likely to be obese i'm homozygous
*  and that's the allele it's still the minor allele but it's at 44 frequency in southeast asia 42
*  frequency in europe even though it started at two percent it was an awesome allele to have
*  a hundred years ago right now it's pretty terrible illio so the other concept is that diversity
*  matters if we had a hundred million nuclear physicists living the earth right now we'd be
*  in trouble you need diversity you need artists and you need musicians and you need mathematicians
*  and you need you know politicians yes even those and you need like oh it's not it's not get crazy
*  but so because then if a virus comes along or whatever exactly exactly so so no there's two
*  reasons number one you want diversity in the immune repertoire and we have built in diversity
*  so basically they are the most diverse basically if you look at our immune system there's layers
*  and layers of diversity like the way that you create your cells generates diversity because
*  of the selection for the vdj recombination that basically eventually leads to a huge number of
*  repertoires but that's only one small component of diversity the blood type is another one the
*  major histocompatibility complex the hla alleles are you know another social diversity so the
*  immune system of humans is by nature incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience
*  so basically what i'm saying that i don't worry for the human species because we are so diverse
*  immunologically we are likely to be very resilient against so many different attacks like this current
*  virus so you're saying natural pandemics may not be something that you're really afraid of because
*  of the diversity in our genetic makeup what about engineered pandemics do you have fears of us
*  messing with the makeup of viruses or well yeah let's say with the makeup of viruses to create
*  something that we can't control and would be much more destructive that would come about naturally
*  remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is humans are much dumber
*  you mean like human scientists yeah humans humans just like humans overall yeah humans overall
*  but i mean even you know the sort of synthetic biologists you know basically
*  if you were to create a you know virus like sars that will kill a lot of people you would probably
*  stars start with sars so whoever you know would like to design such a thing would basically start
*  with a sars tree or at least some relative of sars the source genome for the current virus was
*  something completely different it was something that has never infected humans no one in their
*  right mind would have started there but when you say sources like the nearest the nearest relative
*  relative is in a whole other branch no species of which has ever infected humans in that branch
*  so you know let's put this to rest this was not designed by someone to kill off the human race
*  so you don't you don't believe it was engineered the likely yeah the the path to engineering a
*  deadly virus would not come from this strain that got it that was used moreover there's been various
*  claims of haha this was mixed and matched in the lab because the s1 protein has three different
*  components each of which has a different evolutionary tree so you know a lot of popular
*  press basically said aha this came from pangolin and this came from you know all kinds of other
*  species this is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus tree so basically the s1 protein
*  has been recombining across species all the time remember when i was talking about the positive
*  strand the negative strand sub genomic rnase these can actually recombine and if you have two
*  different viruses infecting the same cell they can actually mix and match between the positive
*  strand the negative strand and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination that now has
*  the s1 from one and the rest of the genome from another and this is something that happens a lot
*  in s1 in orfe to tetra and that's something that's true of the whole tree for the whole family exactly
*  viruses so it's not like someone has been messing with this for millions of years and you know
*  changing this happens naturally that's again beautiful that that somehow happens that they
*  recombine in the so two different strands can affect the body and recombine so all of this
*  actually magic happens inside uh hosts like all like yeah yeah that that's why they that's why
*  classification wise virus is not thought to be alive because it doesn't self replicate it's not
*  autonomous it's something that enters a living cell and then co-opts it to basically make it its
*  own but by itself people ask me how do we kill this bastard i'm like you stop it from replicating
*  it's not like a bacterium that will just live in a you know bottle or something it's a virus viruses
*  don't live without their host and they only live within their host for very little time so if you
*  from replicating it'll stop from spreading i mean it's not like hiv which can stay dormant for a
*  long time basically coronaviruses just don't do that they're not integrating genomes they're
*  rna genomes so if it's not expressed it degrades rna degrades it doesn't just stick around well let
*  me ask also uh about the immune system you mentioned a lot of people kind of ask you know
*  how can we strengthen the immune system to respond to this particular virus but new viruses in general
*  do you have from a biological perspective thoughts on what we can do as humans
*  if you look at the death rates across different countries people with less vaccination have been
*  dying more if you look at north italy the vaccination rates are abysmal there and a lot
*  of people have been dying if you look at greece very good vaccination rates almost no one has
*  been dying so yes there's a policy component so italy reacted very slowly greece reacted very fast
*  so yeah many fewer people died in greece but there might actually be a component of genetic
*  immune repertoire basically how did people die off you know in the history of the greek population
*  versus the italian population there's a that's interesting to think about uh and then there's a
*  component of what vaccinations did you have as a kid and what are the off-target effects of those
*  vaccinations so basically a vaccination can have two components one is training your immune system
*  against that specific insult the second one is boosting up your immune system for all kinds of
*  other things if you look at allergies northern europe super clean environments tons of allergies
*  southern europe my kids grew up eating dirt no allergies so growing up i never had even heard
*  of what allergies are like really allergies and the reason is that i was playing in the garden i
*  was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from you know all kinds of dirt and stuff tons of viruses
*  there tons of bacteria there you know my immune system was built up so the more you protect your
*  immune system from exposure the less opportunity it has to learn about non-self repertoire in a way
*  that prepares it for the next insult so horizontal thing too like the so it's throughout your
*  lifetime in the lifetime of the of the people that uh your ancestors yeah that kind of thing
*  yeah what about the so again it returns against free will on the free will side of things is there
*  something we could do to strengthen our immune system in 2020 is there uh like uh you know
*  exercise diet all that kind of stuff so it it's kind of funny um there's a cartoon that basically
*  shows uh two windows with a teller in each window one has a humongous line and the other one has no
*  one the one that has no one above says health no it says exercise and diet and the other one says
*  pill and there's a huge line for pill so we're looking basically for magic bullets for sort of
*  ways that we can you know beat cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this and beat that and turns
*  out that the window with like just diet and exercise is the best way to boost every aspect
*  of your health if you look at Alzheimer's exercise and nutrition i mean you're like really for my
*  brain neurodegeneration absolutely if you look at cancer exercise and nutrition if you look at
*  coronavirus exercise and nutrition every single aspect of human health gets improved and one of
*  the studies we're doing now is basically looking at what are the effects of diet and exercise how
*  similar are they to each other we basically take in diet intervention and exercise intervention
*  in human and in mice and we're basically doing single cell profiling of a bunch of different
*  tissues to basically understand how are the cells both the stromal cells and the immune cells of
*  each of these tissues responding to the effect of exercise what are the communication networks
*  between different cells where with the muscle that exercises sends signals through the bloodstream
*  through the lymphatic system through all kinds of other systems that give signals to other cells
*  that i have exercised and you should change in this particular way which basically reconfigure
*  those receptor cells with the effect of exercise just how well understood is the those reconfigurations
*  very little we're just starting now basically is there is the hope there to understand the effect on
*  so like the effect on the immune system on the immune system the effect on brain the effect on
*  your liver on your digestive system on your adipocytes adipose you know the most misunderstood
*  organ everybody thinks oh fat terrible no fat is awesome your fat cells is what's keeping you alive
*  because if you didn't have your fat cells all those lipids and all those calories would be
*  floating around in your blood and you'd be dead by now your adipocytes are your best friend they're
*  basically storing all these excess calories so that they don't hurt all of the rest of the body
*  and they're also fat burning in many ways so you know again when you don't have the homozygous
*  version that i have your cells are able to burn calories much more easily by sort of flipping a
*  master metabolic switch that involves this fto locus that i mentioned earlier and it's target
*  genes irx3 and rx5 that basically switch your adipocytes during their three first days of
*  differentiation as they're becoming matured epocytes to basically become either fat burning
*  or fat storing fat cells and the fat burning fat cells are your best friends they're much closer
*  to muscle than they are to white adipocytes is there a lot of difference between people like
*  that you could give science could eventually give advice that is very generalizable or is our
*  differences in our genetic makeup like you mentioned is that going to be basically
*  something we have to be very specialized individuals any advice we give in terms of diet
*  like what we're just talking about believe it or not the most personalized advice that you give for
*  nutrition don't have to do with your genome they have to do with your gut microbiome with the
*  bacteria that live inside you so most of your digestion is actually happening by species that
*  are not human inside you you have more non-human cells than you have human cells you're basically
*  a giant bag of bacteria with a few human cells along and so how and those do not necessarily have
*  to do with your genetic makeup they interact with your genetic makeup they interact with your
*  your genome they interact with your nutrition they interact with your environment they're you
*  know basically an additional source of variation so when you're thinking about sort of personalized
*  nutritional advice part of that is actually how do you match your microbiome and part of that is how
*  do we match your genetics but again you know this is a very diverse set of you know contributors and
*  the effect sizes are not enormous so i think the science for that is not fully developed yet
*  speaking of diets because i've wrestled in combat sports sports my whole life or
*  weight matters so you have to cut and all that stuff one thing i've learned a lot about my body
*  and it seems to be i think true about other people's bodies is that you can adjust a lot of
*  things that's the miraculous thing about this biological system is like i fast often
*  i used to eat like five six times a day and thought that was absolutely necessary how could
*  you not eat that often and then when i started fasting your body adjusted that and you learn how
*  to not eat i know and it's it was uh if you just give it a chance for a few weeks actually over a
*  period of a few weeks your body can adjust to anything yeah and that's a miracle that's such
*  a beautiful thing so i'm a computer scientist and i've basically gone through periods of 24 hours
*  without eating or stopping and you know then i'm like oh must eat and i eat a ton i used to order
*  two pizzas just with my brother and you know like so i i've gone through these extremes as well and
*  i've gone the whole intermittent fasting thing so i am i can sympathize with you both on the seven
*  meals a day to the zero meals a day um so i think when i say everything with moderation i i actually
*  think your body responds interestingly to these different changes in diet i think part of the
*  reason why we lose weight with pretty much every kind of change in behavior is because our
*  epigenome and the set of proteins and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome are not well
*  suited to that nutritional source and therefore they will not be able to sort of catch everything
*  that you give them and then you know a lot of that will go on digested and that basically means that
*  your body can then you know lose weight in the short term but very quickly will adjust to that
*  new normal and then we'll be able to sort of perhaps gain a lot of weight from the diet so
*  anyway i mean there's also studies in factories where basically people you know dim the lights
*  and then suddenly everybody started working better it was like wow that's amazing three weeks later
*  they made the lights a little brighter everybody started working better so any kind of intervention
*  has a placebo effect of wow now i'm healthier and i'm going to be running more often etc so it's
*  very hard to uncouple the placebo effect of wow i'm doing something to intervene on my diet
*  from the wow this is actually the right thing for me so you know yeah from the perspective from
*  nutrition science psychology uh both things i'm interested in especially psychology it seems that
*  it's uh extremely difficult to do good science because uh there's so many variables involved
*  it's so difficult to control the variables so difficult to do sufficiently large scale experiments
*  both sort of in terms of number of subjects and temporal like how long you do the study for that
*  it just seems like it's not even a real science for now like nutrition science i want to jump
*  into the whole placebo effect for a little bit here and basically um talk about the implications
*  of that if i give you a sugar pill and i tell you it's a sugar pill you won't get any better but if
*  i tell you sugar pill and tell you and i and i tell you wow this is an amazing drug it actually
*  will stop your cancer your cancer will actually stop with much higher probability what does that
*  mean that's so amazing that means that if i can trick your brain into thinking that i'm healing
*  you your brain will basically figure out a way to heal itself to heal the body and that tells us
*  that there's so much that we don't understand in the interplay between our cognition and our biology
*  that if we were able to better harvest the power of our brain to sort of you know impact the body
*  through the placebo effect we would be so much better in so many different things just by
*  tricking yourself into thinking that you're doing better you're actually doing better so there's
*  something to be said about sort of positive thinking about optimism about sort of you know
*  just getting your brain and your mind into the right mindset that helps your body and helps your
*  entire biology yeah from a science perspective that's just fascinating obviously most things
*  about the brain is a total mystery for now but that's that's a fascinating interplay that the
*  brain yeah that the brain can reduce the brain can help cure cancer is uh i don't even know what
*  to do with that i mean the way to think about that is the following the converse of the equation
*  is something that we are much more comfortable with like oh if you're stressed then your heart
*  rate might rise and all kinds of sort of toxins might be released and that can have a detrimental
*  effect in your body etc etc etc so maybe it's easier to understand your body healing from your
*  mind by your mind is not killing your body or at least it's killing it less so i think the you know
*  that aspect of the stress equation is a little easier for most of us to conceptualize but then
*  the healing part is you know perhaps the same pathways perhaps different pathways but again
*  something that is totally untapped scientifically i think we try to bring this question up a couple
*  times but let's return to it again is what's do you think is the difference between the way a computer
*  represents information the human genome represents and stores information like what and maybe broadly
*  what is the difference between how you think about computers and how you think about biological
*  systems so i made a very provocative claim earlier that we are a digital computer like that at the
*  core lies a digital code and that's true in many ways but surrounding that digital core there's a
*  huge amount of analog if you look at our brain it's not really digital if you look at our sort of
*  rna and all of that stuff inside our cell it's not really digital it's really analog in many ways
*  but let's start with the code and then we'll expand to the rest so the code itself is digital
*  so there's genes you can think of the genes as i don't know the procedures the functions inside
*  your language and then somehow you have to turn these functions on how do you call the gene how
*  do you call that function the way that you would do it in old programming languages is go to address
*  whatever in your memory and then you start running from there and you know modern programming
*  languages have encapsulated this into functions and objects and all of that and it's nice and cute
*  but in the end deep down there's still an assembly code that says go to that instruction and it runs
*  that instruction if you look at the human genome and you know the genome of pretty much most species
*  out there it's there's no go-to function you just don't start in you know transcribing in position 13
*  hundred five you know 13 527 in chromosome 12 you instead have content-based indexing so at every
*  location in the genome in front of the genes that need to be turned on i don't know when you drink
*  coffee there's a little coffee marker in front of all of them and whenever your cells that metabolize
*  coffee need to metabolize coffee they basically see coffee and they're like oh let's go turn on
*  all the coffee marked genes so there's basically these small motifs these small sequences that we
*  call regulatory motifs they're like patterns of dna they're only eight characters long or so like
*  gat gca etc and these motifs work in combinations and every one of them has some recruitment
*  affinity for a different protein that will then come and bind it and together collections of these
*  motifs create regions that we call regulatory regions that can be either promoters near the
*  beginning of the gene and that basically tells you where the function actually starts where you call
*  it and then enhancers that are looping around of the dna that basically bring the machinery that
*  binds those enhancers and then bring it onto the promoter which then recruits the right sort of
*  the ribosome and the polymerase and all of that thing which will first transcribe and then export
*  and then eventually translate in the cytoplasm you know whatever rna molecule so the beauty
*  of the way that the digital computer that's the genome works is that it's extremely fault
*  tolerant if i took your hard drive and i messed with 20 of the letters in it of those zeros and
*  ones and i flipped them you'd be in trouble if i take the genome and i flipped 20 of the letters
*  you probably won't even notice and that resilience that's fascinating again is a key design principle
*  and again i'm anthropomorphizing here but it's a key driving principle of how biological systems
*  work they're first resilient and then anything else and when you look at this incredible beauty
*  of life from the most i don't know beautiful i don't know human genome maybe of humanity and
*  all of the ideals that should come with it to the most terrifying genome like i don't know covid 19
*  sars-cov-2 and the current pandemic you basically see this elegance as the epitome of clean design
*  but it's dirty it's a mess it's you know the the way to get there is hugely messy and that's
*  something that we as computer scientists don't embrace we like to have clean code you know as
*  like in engineering they teach you about compartmentalization about sort of separating
*  functions about modularity about hierarchical design none of that applies in biol testing
*  testing sure yeah biology does plenty of that but i mean through evolutionary exploration but
*  if you look at biological systems first they are robust and then they specialize to become anything
*  else and if you look at viruses the reason why they're so elegant when you look at the design
*  of this you know genome it seems so elegant and the reason for that is that it's been stripped down
*  from something much larger because of the pressure to keep it compact so many compact
*  genomes out there have ancestors that were much larger you don't start small and become big you
*  go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff increase complexity and then you know slim it down and one
*  of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication one of the things we found is that
*  baker's yeast which is the you know yeast that you use to make bread but also the yeast that you use
*  to make wine which is basically the dominant species when you go in the fields of toskani
*  and you say you know what's out there it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae or the way my
*  italian friends say saccharomyces cerevisiae so so um which means what oh saccharomy okay i'm sorry
*  i'm greek so yeah zaharo mikis zaharo is sugar mikis is fungus yes cerevisiae cerveza beer so
*  it means the sugar fungus of beer yeah you know less less let's still sounding to the still poetic
*  yeah so anyway saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the major baker's yeast out there is the descendant
*  of a whole genome duplication why would a whole gene duplication even happen when it happened is
*  coinciding with about 100 million years ago and the emergence of fruit-bearing plants
*  why fruit-bearing plants because animals would eat the fruit and would walk around and poop
*  huge amounts of nutrients along with a seed for the plants to spread before that plants were not
*  spreading through animals they were spreading through wind and all kinds of other ways but
*  basically the moment you have fruit-bearing plants the these plants are basically creating
*  this abundance of sugar in the environment so there's an evolutionary niche that gets created
*  and in that evolutionary niche you basically have enough sugar that a whole genome duplication which
*  initially is a very messy event allows you to then you know relieve some of that complexity so i had
*  to pause what does genome duplication mean that basically means that instead of having
*  eight chromosomes you can now have 16 chromosomes so but the duplication at first when you have
*  six when you go to 16 you're not using that oh yeah you are yeah so basically from one day to
*  the next you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes probably a non-disjunction
*  event during a duplication during a division so you basically divide the cell instead of half the
*  genome going this way and half the genome going the other way after duplication of the genome you
*  basically have all of it going to one cell and then there's sufficient messiness there that you end
*  up with slight differences that make most of these chromosomes be actually preserved it's a long story
*  short to me but it's a big upgrade right so that's not necessarily because what happens immediately
*  thereafter is that you start massively losing tons of those duplicated genes so 90 of those genes
*  were actually lost very rapidly after whole genome duplication and the reason for that is that biology
*  is not intelligent it's just ruthless selection random mutation so the ruthless selection basically
*  means that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene ruthless selection just kills off
*  that gene it's just you know you know if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome
*  you will very rapidly lose the second copy of most of your genes and a small number 10% were
*  kept in two copies and those had to do a lot with environment adaptation with the speed of replication
*  with the speed of translation and with sugar processing so i'm making a long story short to
*  basically say that evolution is messy the only way like so so you know the example that i was giving
*  of messing with 20 of your bits in your computer totally bogus duplicating all your functions and
*  just throwing them out there in the same you know function just totally bogus like this would never
*  work in an engineer system but biological systems because of this content-based indexing and because
*  of this modularity that comes from the fact that the gene is controlled by a series of tags and now
*  if you need this gene in another setting you just add some more tags that will basically turn it on
*  also in those settings so this gene is now pressured to do two different functions and
*  it builds up complexity i see the holgerum duplication and gene duplication in general
*  as a way to relieve that complexity so you have this gradual buildup of complexity as function get
*  passed get sort of added on to the existing genes and then boom you duplicate your your workforce
*  and you now have two copies of this gene one will probably specialize to do one and the other one
*  will specialize to do the other or one will maintain the ancestral function the other one
*  will sort of be free to evolve and specialize while losing the ancestral function and so on
*  so forth so that's how genomes evolve they're they're just messy things but they're extremely
*  fault tolerant and they're extremely able to deal with mutations because that's the very way that
*  you generate new functions so new functionalization comes from the very thing that breaks it so even
*  in the current pandemic many people are asking me which mutations matter the most and what i tell
*  them is well we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the current genome to then understand
*  which mutations have previously happened or not and which mutations happen in genes that evolve
*  rapidly or not and one of the things we found for example is that the genes that evolved rapidly
*  in the past are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic the genes that evolved slowly
*  in the past are still evolving slowly which means that they're useful which means that they're under
*  the same evolutionary pressures but then the question is what happens in specific mutations
*  so if you look at the d614 gene mutation that's been all over the news so in position 614 in the
*  amino acids can have a protein of the s protein there's a d2g mutation that that sort of has
*  creeped over the population that mutation we found out through my work disrupts a perfectly
*  conserved nucleotide position that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of
*  equivalent mammalian evolution of these viruses that basically means that it's a completely new
*  adaptation to human and that mutation has now gone from one percent frequency to 90
*  frequency in almost all outbreaks so there's a mutation i like how you say in the mute the
*  416 what was okay yes 614 sorry 614 no d614g d6 so so literally so what you're saying is this
*  is like a chess move yeah so it just mutated one letter to another exactly and that hasn't happened
*  before yeah and never and this somehow this mutation is really useful it's really useful
*  in the current environment of the genome which is moving from human to human when it was moving
*  from bat to bat it couldn't care less for that mutation but it's environment specific so now
*  that it's moving from human to human whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by orders of magnetism
*  okay so you're like tracking this evolutionary dynamics which is fascinating but what do you do
*  with that so what does that mean what does this mean what do you make what do you make of this
*  mutation in trying to anticipate i guess is the is one of the things you're trying to do is anticipate
*  where how this unrolls into the future this this evolutionary dynamics such a great question so
*  so there's there's two things remember when i was saying earlier mutation is the path to new things
*  but also the path to break old things so what we know is that this position was extremely preserved
*  through gazillions of mutations that mutation was never tolerated when it was moving from bats to
*  bats so that basically means that that that position is extremely important in the function
*  of that protein that's the first thing it tells the second one is that that position was very
*  well suited to bat transmission but now is not well suited to human transmission so he got rid of it
*  and it now has a new version of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit
*  from human to human so in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us about the future it basically
*  tells us here's the regions that are currently mutating here's the regions that are most likely
*  to mutate going forward as you're building a vaccine here's what you should be focusing on
*  in terms of the most stable regions that are the least likely to mutate or here's the newly evolved
*  functions that are the most likely to be important because they've overcome this local maximum that
*  it had reached in the bat transmission so anyway it's a tangent to basically say that evolution
*  works in messy ways and the thing that you would break is the thing that actually allows you to
*  first go through a lull and then reaching new local maximum and I often like to say that if engineers
*  had basically designed evolution we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria
*  because it's my making the bacterium worse that you allow evolution to reach a new
*  optimum that's just a pause on that that's so profound that's so profound for the entirety of
*  this scientific and engineering disciplines exactly we as engineers need to embrace
*  breaking things we as engineers need to embrace robustness as the first principle
*  beyond perfection because nothing's going to ever be perfect and when you're sending a satellite to
*  mars when something goes wrong it'll break down as opposed to building systems that tolerate failure
*  and are resilient to that and in fact get better through that so the spacex approach versus nasa
*  for the for example is there something we can learn about the incredible
*  take lessons from the incredible biological systems in their resilience in their in the
*  mushiness the messiness to our to our computing systems to our to our computers it would basically
*  be starting from scratch in many ways it would basically be building new paradigms that don't
*  try to get the right answer all the time but try to get the right answer most of the time
*  or a lot of the time do you see deep learning systems in the whole world of machine learning
*  is kind of taking a step in that direction absolutely absolutely basically by allowing
*  this much more natural evolution of these parameters you basically and and if you look at sort of deep
*  learning systems again they're not inspired by the genome aspect of biology they're inspired by the
*  brain aspect of biology and again i want you to pause for a second and realize the complexity
*  of the entire human brain with trillions of connections within our you know neurons with
*  millions of cells talking to each other is still encoded within that same genome
*  yeah that same genome encodes every single freaking cell type of the entire body every single cell is
*  encoded by the same code and yet specialization allows you to have the single viral like genome
*  that self-replicates the single module modular automaton work with other copies of itself
*  work with other copies of itself it's mind-boggling
*  create complex organs through which blood flows and what is that blood the same freaking genome
*  create organs that communicate with each other and what are these organs the exact same genome
*  create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts of blood pumping energy to it
*  20 of our energetic needs to the brain from the same genome and all of the neuronal connections
*  all of the auxiliary cells all of the immune cells the astrocytes the legal downsize the neurons the
*  excitatory the inhibitory neurons all of the different classes of parasites the blood brain
*  barrier all of that same genome one way to see that in a sad this one is beautiful the sad thing
*  is thinking about the trillions of organisms that died to create that you mean on the evolutionary
*  path to and the evolutionary path to humans it's crazy there's two descendant of apes just
*  talking on a podcast okay it's just so mind-boggling just just to boggle our minds a
*  little bit more yeah us talking to each other we are basically generating a series of vocal
*  utterances through our pulsating of vocal cords received through this the people who listen to
*  this are taking a completely different path to that information transfer yet through language
*  but imagine if we could connect these brains directly to each other the amount of information
*  that i'm condensing into a small number of words is a huge funnel which then you receive and you
*  expand into a huge number of thoughts from that small funnel in many ways engineers would love to
*  have the whole information transfer just take the whole set of neurons and throw them away i mean
*  throw them to the other person this might actually not be better because in your misinterpretation
*  of every word that i'm saying you are creating new interpretation that might actually be way better
*  than what i meant in the first place the ambiguity of language perhaps might be the secret to
*  creativity every single time you work on a project by yourself you only bounce ideas with one person
*  and your neurons are basically fully cognizant of what these ideas are but the moment you interact
*  with another person the misinterpretations that happen might be the most creative part of the
*  process with my students every time we have a research meeting i very often pause and say
*  let me repeat what you just said in a different way and i sort of go on and brainstorm with what
*  they were saying but by the third time it's not what they were saying at all and when they pick
*  up what i'm saying they're like oh well now they've they've sort of learned something very different
*  from what i was saying and that is the same kind of messiness that i'm describing in the genome
*  itself it's sort of embracing the messiness and that's a feature not a book exactly and in the
*  same way when you're thinking about sort of these deep learning systems that will allow us to sort
*  of be more creative perhaps or learn better approximations of these complex functions
*  again tuned to the universe that we inhabit you have to embrace the breaking you have to embrace
*  the you know how do we get out of these local optima and a lot of the design paradigms that
*  have made deep learning so successful are ways to get away from that ways to get better training by
*  sort of sending long range messages these lstm models and the you know sort of feed forward loops
*  that you know sort of jump through layers of a convolutional neural network all of these things
*  are basically ways to push you out of these local maxima and that's sort of what evolution does that's
*  what language does that's what conversation and brainstorming does that's what our brain does
*  so you know this design paradigm is something that's pervasive and yet not taught in schools
*  not taught in engineering schools where everything's minutely modularized to make sure
*  that we never deviate from you know whatever signal we're trying to emit as opposed to
*  let all hell breaks lose because that's the that's the path to paradise the path to paradise yeah i
*  mean it's difficult to know how to teach that and what to do with it i mean it's um it's difficult
*  to know how to build up a sign the scientific method around messiness i mean it's not all
*  messiness we need we need some cleanness and going back to the example with mars that's probably the
*  place where i want to sort of moderate error as much as possible and sort of control the environment
*  as much as possible but if you're trying to repopulate mars well maybe messiness is a good
*  thing then i'm that you quick you quickly mentioned this in terms of us uh using our vocal cords to
*  speak on a podcast um so elam musk and neurolink are working on trying to plug as part of discussion
*  with computers and biological systems to connect the two he's trying to connect our brain to a
*  computer to create a brain computer interface where they can communicate back and forth
*  on this line of thinking do you think this is uh possible to bridge the gap between our engineered
*  computing systems and uh the messy biological systems my answer would be absolutely
*  we you know there's no doubt that we can understand more and more about what goes on in the brain
*  and we can sort of train the brain i don't know if you remember the palm pilot yeah palm pilot
*  yeah remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created am i thinking of the same thing
*  it's basically you had you had a little pen and for every character you had a little scribble that
*  was unique that the machine could understand and that instead of trying the machine trying to teach
*  the machine to recognize human characters you had basically they figured out that it's better and
*  easier to train humans to create human-like characters that the machine is better at recognizing
*  so in the same way i think what will happen is that humans will be trained to be able to create
*  the mind pattern that the machine will respond to before the machine truly comprehends our thoughts
*  so the first human brain interfaces will be tricking humans to speak the machine language
*  where with the right set of electrodes i can sort of trick my brain into doing this and this is the
*  same way that many people teach like are learned to control artificial limbs you basically try a
*  bunch of stuff and eventually you figure out how your limbs work that might not be very different
*  from how humans learn to use their natural limbs when they first grow up basically you have these
*  you know neoteny period of you know this puddle of soup inside your brain trying to figure out
*  how to even make neural connections before you're born and then learning sounds in utero of you know
*  all kinds of echoes and you know eventually getting out in the real world and i don't know
*  if you've seen newborns but they just stare around a lot you know one way to think about
*  this as a machine learning person is oh they're just training their edge detectors and eventually
*  they figure out how to train their edge detectors they work through the second layer of the visual
*  cortex and the third layer and so on and so forth and you basically have this learning how to control
*  your limbs that probably comes at the same time you're sort of you know throwing random things
*  there and you realize that oh wow when i do this thing my limb moves let's do the following
*  experiment take a breath what muscles did you flex now take another breath and think what muscles
*  do i flex the first thing that you're thinking when you're taking a breath is the impact that
*  it has on your lungs you're like oh i'm now going to increase my lungs or i'm not going to bring
*  air in but what you're actually doing is just changing your diaphragm yeah that's not conscious
*  of course you never think of the diaphragm as a thing yeah and why is that that's probably the
*  same reason why i think of moving my finger when i actually move my finger i think of the effect
*  instead of actually thinking of whatever muscle is twitching that actually causes my finger to move
*  so we basically in our first years of life build up this massive lookup table between
*  whatever neuronal firing we do and whatever action happens in our body that we control
*  if you have a kid grow up with a third limb i'm sure they'll figure out how to control them
*  probably at the same rate as their natural limbs and a lot of the work would be done by the
*  if a third limb is a computer you kind of have a not a faith but a thought that
*  the brain might be able to figure out like the plasticity would come from the brain yeah like
*  the brain would be cleverer than the machine at first when i talk about a third limb that's
*  exactly what i'm saying is an artificial limb that basically just controls your mouse while you're
*  typing you know perfectly natural thing i mean again you know in a few hundred years maybe sooner
*  than that but but basically there's as long as the machine is consistent in the way that it will
*  respond to your brain impulses you'll figure out who will control that and you could play tennis
*  with your third limb and let me go back to consistency people who have dramatic accidents
*  that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain can be taught to co-opt other parts of
*  the brain to then control that part you can basically build up that tissue again and eventually
*  train your body how to walk again and how to read again and how to play again and how to think again
*  how to speak a language again etc so there's a massive amount of malleability that happens
*  you know naturally in our way of controlling our body our brain our thoughts our vocal cords or
*  limbs etc and human machine interfaces are all inevitable if we sort of figure out how to read
*  these electric impulses but the resolution at which we can understand human thought
*  right now is nil is ridiculous so how are human thoughts encoded it's basically combinations
*  of neurons that co-fire and these create these things called n-grams that eventually form
*  memories and so on so forth we know nothing of all that stuff so before we can actually read
*  into your brain that you want to build a program that does this and this and we said that
*  we need a lot of neuroscience well so uh to push back on that do you think it's possible that
*  without understanding the functionally about the brain or the from the neuroscience or the
*  cognitive science or psychology whichever level of the brain will look at do you think if we just
*  connect connect them just like per your previous point if we just have a high enough resolution
*  between connection between uh wikipedia and your brain the brain will just figure it out
*  with less understanding because that's one of the innovations of neural link is they're
*  increasing the number of connections to the brain to like several thousand which before was
*  you know in the dozens or whatever you're still off by a few orders of magnets on the order of seven
*  right but uh the thing is the hope is if you increase that number more and more and more
*  maybe you don't need to understand anything about the actual how human thought is represented in the
*  brain you can just let it let it figure it out by itself all uh kianna reeves waking up and saying
*  yeah exactly exactly so yeah sure you don't have faith in the plasticity of the brain to that degree
*  it's not about brain plasticity it's about the input aspect basically i think on the output aspect
*  being able to control a machine is something that you can probably train your neural impulses that
*  you're sending out to sort of match whatever response you see in the environment if this
*  thing moved every single time i thought a particular thought then i could figure out i
*  could hack my way into moving this thing with just a series of thoughts like i think guitar
*  piano tennis ball and then this thing would be moving and then you know i would just have the
*  series of thoughts that would sort of result in the impulses that will move this thing the way that
*  i want and then eventually it'll become natural because i won't even think about it um i mean in
*  the same way that we control our limbs in a very natural way but babies don't do that babies have
*  to figure it out and you know some of it is hard coded but some of that is actually learned based
*  on the whatever soup of neurons you ended up with whatever connections you pruned them to
*  and eventually you were born with you know a lot of that is coded in the genome but a huge chunk
*  of that is stochastic instead of the way that you sort of create all these neurons they migrate
*  they form connections they sort of you know spread out they have particular branching patterns but
*  then the connectivity itself unique in every single new person all this to say that on the
*  output side absolutely i'm very very you know um hopeful that we can have machines that read
*  thousands of these neuronal connections on the output side but on the input side oh boy
*  um i don't expect any time in the near future we'll be able to sort of send a series of impulses
*  that will tell me oh earth to sun distance 7.5 million etc etc like nowhere i mean i think
*  language will still the be the input way rather than sort of any kind of more complex it's a
*  really interesting notion that the ambiguity of language is a feature yeah and we evolved for
*  millions of years to um to take advantage of that ambiguity exactly and yet no one teaches us the
*  subtle differences between words that are near cognates and yet evoke so much more than you know
*  one from the other and yet you know when you're choosing words from a list of 20 synonyms you know
*  exactly the connotation of every single one of them and that's something that you know is there
*  so so yes there's ambiguity but there's all kinds of connotations and in the way that we select our
*  words we have so much baggage that we're sending along the way that we're emoting the way that
*  we're moving our hands every single time we speak the you know the pauses the eye contact etc
*  so much higher baud rate than just the vocal you know string of characters well let me just take a
*  small tangent on that oh tangent we haven't done that yet haven't done that we'll return to the
*  origin of life so i mean you're greek but i'm i'm going on this personal journey uh i'm going to
*  paris for the explicit purpose of uh talking to one of the most famous uh a couple who's a famous
*  translators of russian literature dostoevsky tolstoy yeah and they go that's their art is the
*  translation and um everything i've learned about the translation art it makes me feel
*  um it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound than the natural language processing
*  papers i read in the machine learning community that there's such depth to language that um i
*  don't know what to do with i don't know if you've experienced that in your own life with knowing
*  multiple languages um i don't know what to i don't know how to make sense of it but there's so much
*  loss in translation between russian and english and getting a sense of that like for example
*  there's like just taking a single sentence from dostoyevsky and like there's a lot of them you
*  could you could talk for hours about how to translate that sentence properly uh that captures
*  the meaning the the the period the culture the humor the wit the suffering that was in the context
*  of the time all of that it could be a single sentence uh you could you could talk forever
*  about what it takes to translate that correctly i don't know what to do with that so being greek
*  it's very hard for me to think of a sentence or even a word without going into the full etymology
*  of that word breaking up every single atom of that that sentence and every single atom of these words
*  and rebuilding it back up i have three kids and the way that i teach them greek is the same way
*  that you know the documentary i was mentioning earlier about sort of understanding the deep roots
*  of all of these you know words um and it's very it's very interesting that every single time i
*  hear a new word that i've never heard before i go and figure out the etymology of that word because
*  i will never appreciate that word without understanding how it was initially formed
*  interesting but how does that help because that's that's not the full picture no no of course of
*  course but what i'm trying to say is that knowing the components teaches you about the context of
*  the formation of that word and sort of the original usage of that word and then of course the word
*  takes new meaning as you create it you know from its parts and that meaning then gets augmented
*  and two synonyms that that sort of have different roots will actually have implications that carry
*  a lot of that baggage of the historical provenance of these words so before working on genome
*  evolution my passion was evolution of language and sort of tracing cognates across different languages
*  through their etymologies and that's fascinating that that there's parallels between i mean of
*  course the idea that there's evolutionary dynamics to our language yeah every single word that you
*  utter parallels parallels what does parallels mean para means side by side alleles from alleles
*  which means identical twins parallels i mean name any word and there's so much baggage so much
*  beauty in how that word came to be and how this word took a new meaning
*  than the sum of its parts yeah and that and and they're just they're just words they don't have
*  any physical exactly and now and now you take those words and you weave them into a sentence
*  the emotional invocations of that weaving are fathomless and they're all all of those emotions
*  all live in our in the brains of humans in the eye of the beholder in the eye no seriously you
*  have to embrace this concept of the eye of the beholder it's it's the conceptualization that
*  nothing takes meaning with one person creating it everything takes meaning in the receiving end
*  and the emergent properties of these communication networks where every single you know if you look
*  at the network of our cells and how they're communicating with each other every cell has
*  its own code this code is modulated by the epigenome this creates a bunch of different cell types each
*  cell type now has its own identity yet they all have the common root of the stem cells that sort
*  of led to them each of these identities is now communicating with each other they take meaning
*  in their interaction there's an emergent property that comes from a bunch of cells being together
*  that is not in any one of the parts if you look at neurons communicating again these n-grams
*  don't exist in any one neuron they exist in the connection in the combination of neurons
*  and the meaning of the words that i'm telling you is empty until it reaches you and it affects you
*  in a very different way than it affects whoever's listening to this conversation now because of the
*  emotional baggage that i've grown up with that you've grown up with and that they've grown up with
*  and that's i think the magic of translation if you start thinking of translation as
*  just simply capturing that emotional set of reactions that you evoke that you evoke
*  you need a different set of words to evoke that same set of reactions to a french person
*  than to a russian person because of the baggage of the culture that we grew up in yeah i mean
*  so basically you shouldn't find the best word sometimes it's a completely different
*  sentence structure that you will need matched to the cultural context of the target audience
*  that you have yeah that it's i mean you're just i usually don't think about this but right now
*  there's this feeling as a reminder there's just you and i talking but there's several hundred
*  thousand people will listen to this there's some guy in russia right now running uh like in moscow
*  listening to us and there's somebody in india i guarantee you there's somebody in china and
*  south america there's somebody in texas and and they all have different emotional baggage they
*  probably got angry earlier on about the whole discussion about coronavirus and uh about some
*  aspect of it uh yeah it's and there's that network effect yeah yeah that's uh it's a beautiful thing
*  and and this lateral transfer of information that's what makes the collective quote-unquote
*  genome of humanity so unique from any other species so you somehow miraculously wrapped it
*  back to the very beginning of when we're talking about the human um the beauty of the human genome
*  so i think this is the right time unless we want to go for a six to eight hour conversation we're
*  gonna have to talk again but i think for now to wrap it up um this is the right time to talk about
*  the uh the biggest most ridiculous question of all meaning of life off mike you mentioned to me that
*  you um you had your 42nd birthday 42nd being a very special absurdly special number uh and you
*  had a kind of um a get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life so let me ask you
*  in your as a biologist as a computer scientist and as a human what is the meaning of life
*  i've been asking this question for a long time uh ever since my 42nd birthday uh but well before
*  that and even planning the meaning of life symposium and uh symposium sim means together
*  posy actually means to drink together so symposium is actually a drinking party
*  so can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life symposium that you put together it's like
*  the most genius idea i've ever heard so 42 is obviously the answer to life the universe and
*  everything from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and uh as i was turning 42 i've had the
*  theme for every one of my birthdays when i was turning 32 it's 100 000 in binary so i celebrated
*  my hundred thousandth binary binary birthday and i had a theme of going back 100 000 years you know
*  let's dress something in the last 100 000 years anyway it was we've i've always had these that's
*  it's such an interesting human being okay that's awesome i've always had these sort of uh sort of
*  numerology related announcements for my for my birthday party so um what came out of that
*  meaning of life symposium is that i basically asked 42 of my colleagues 42 my friends 42 of my
*  you know collaborators to basically give seven minute species on the meaning of life each from
*  their perspective and i really encourage you to go there because it's mind-boggling that every
*  single person said a different answer every single person started with i don't know what
*  the meaning of life is but and then gave this beautifully eloquently answer eloquent answer
*  and they were all different but they all were consistent with each other and mutually synergistic
*  and together forming a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many ways
*  is some people talked about the loss of their loved one their life partner for many many years
*  and how their life changed through that some people talked about the origin of life some people
*  talked about the difference between purpose and meaning i'll you know maybe quote one of the
*  answers which is this linguistics professor friend of mine at harvard who basically said
*  that she was going to she's greek as well and she said i will give a very pithian answer so pithia
*  was the oracle of delphi who would basically give these very cryptic answers very short but
*  interpretable in many different ways there was this whole set of priests who were tasked with
*  interpreting what pithia had said and very often you would not get a clean interpretation but she
*  said i will be like pithia and give you a very short and multiply interpretable answer but unlike
*  her i will actually also give you three interpretations and she said the answer to the
*  meaning of life is become one and the first interpretation is like a child become one year
*  old with the excitement of discovering everything about the world second interpretation in whatever
*  you take on become one the first the best excel drive yourself to perfection for every one of your
*  tasks and become one when people are separate become one come together learn to understand each
*  other damn that's an answer and one way to summarize this whole meaning of life symposium
*  is that the very symposium was illustrating the quest for meaning which might itself be the meaning
*  itself be the meaning of life this constant quest for something sublime something human
*  something intangible some you know aspect of what defines us as a species and as an individual
*  both the quest of me as a person through my own life but the meaning of life could also be
*  the meaning of all of life what is the whole point of life why life why life itself because
*  we've been talking about the history and evolution of life but we haven't talked about why life in
*  the first place is life inevitable is life part of physics does life transcend physics but fighting
*  by fighting against entropy by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations rather than diluting
*  away is life a distinct entity in the universe beyond the traditional very simple physical
*  rules that govern gravity and you know electromagnetism and all of these forces is life another force is
*  there a life force is there a unique kind of set of principles that emerge of course built on top
*  of the hardware of physics but is it sort of a new layer of software or a new layer of a computer system
*  so that's at the level of you know big questions there's another aspect of gratitude of basically
*  what I you know what I like to say is during this pandemic I've basically worked from 6 a.m. until
*  7 p.m. every single day non-stop including Saturday and Sunday I've basically broken all boundaries of
*  where life personal life begins and work life you know ends and that has been exhilarating for me
*  just just the intellectual pleasure that I get from a day of exhaustion where at the end of the
*  day my brain is hurting I'm telling my wife wow I was useful today and there's a certain
*  pleasure that comes from feeling useful and this is certain pleasure that comes from feeling grateful
*  so I've written this little sort of prayer for my kids to say at bedtime every night
*  where they basically say thank you God for all you have given me and give me the strength
*  to give on to others with the same love that you have given on to me
*  we as a species are so special the only ones who worry about the meaning of life
*  and maybe that's what makes us human and what I like to say to my wife and to my students during
*  this pandemic work extravaganza is every now and then they ask me but how do you do this and I'm
*  like I'm a workaholic I love this this is me in the most unfiltered way the ability to do something
*  useful to feel that my brain is being used to interact with the smartest people on the planet
*  day in day out and to help them discover aspects of the human genome of the human brain of human
*  disease and the human condition that no one has seen before with data that we're capturing
*  that has never been observed and there's another aspect which is on the personal life many people
*  say oh I'm not gonna have kids why bother I can tell you as a father
*  they're missing half the picture if not the whole picture teaching my kids about my view of the
*  world and watching through their eyes the naiveté with which they start and the sophistication with
*  which they end up the understanding that they have of not just the natural world around them but of
*  me too the unfiltered criticism that you get from your own children that knows no bounds of honesty
*  and I've grown components of my heart that I didn't know I had until you sense that fragility
*  that vulnerability of the children that immense love and passion the unfiltered egoism that we as
*  adults learn how to hide so much better it's just this bag of emotions that tell me about the raw
*  materials that make a human being and how to make a human being and how to make a human being and
*  how these raw materials can be arranged with more sophistication that we learn through life
*  to become truly human adults but there's something so beautiful about seeing that progression
*  between them the complexity of the language growing as more neural connections are formed
*  to realize that the hardware is getting rearranged as their software is getting implemented on that
*  hardware that their frontal cortex continues to grow for another 10 years
*  there's neuronal connections that continue to form new neurons that actually get replicated and
*  formed and it's just incredible that we have these not just you grow the hardware for 30 years and
*  then you feed it all of the knowledge no no the knowledge is fed throughout and is shaping these
*  neural connections as they're forming so seeing that transformation from either your own blood
*  or from an adopted child is the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being and it completes
*  you it completes that path that journey the create life oh sure that's at conception that's easy
*  but create human life to add the human part that takes decades of compassion of sharing of love and
*  of anger and of impatience and patience and as a parent i think i've become a very different kind
*  of teacher because again i'm a professor my first role is to bring adult human beings into a
*  you know more mature level of adulthood where they learn not just to do science
*  but they learn the process of discovery and the process of collaboration
*  the process of discovery and the process of collaboration the process of sharing the process
*  of conveying the knowledge of encapsulating something incredibly complex and sort of giving
*  it up in sort of bite-sized chunks that the rest of humanity can appreciate i tell my students all
*  the time if you you know like when an apple fall when a tree falls in the forest and no one's there
*  to listen has it really fallen the same way you do this awesome research if you write an impenetrable
*  paper that no one will understand it's as if you never did the awesome research so conveying of
*  knowledge conveying this lateral transfer that i was talking about at the very beginning of sort
*  of human humanity and sort of the the sharing of information all of that has gotten so much more
*  rich by seeing human beings grow in my own home because that that makes me a better parent and
*  that makes me a better teacher and a better mentor to the nurturing of my adult children
*  which are my research group first of all beautifully put connects beautifully to the vertical and the
*  horizontal inheritance of ideas that we talked about at the very beginning i don't think there's
*  a better way to end it on this poetic and powerful note um manolis thank you so much for talking to
*  me it's a huge honor we'll have to talk again about the origin of life about epigenetics
*  epigenomics and some of the incredible research you're doing truly an honor thanks so much for
*  talking to you such a pleasure it's such a pleasure i mean your your questions are outstanding i've had
*  such a blast here i can't wait to be back awesome thanks for listening to this conversation with
