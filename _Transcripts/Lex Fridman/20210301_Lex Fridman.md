# Josh Barnett: Philosophy of Violence, Power, and the Martial Arts | Lex Fridman #165
**Lex Fridman:** [March 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJWPowbCK_I)
*  The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett, one of the greatest fighters and submission wrestlers in history,
*  with an epic 25-year career that includes being the UFC Heavyweight Champion and countless other accolades.
*  He also happens to be one of the most intelligent and brutally honest human beings in all of martial arts,
*  and especially so about his appreciation of and fascination with violence.
*  Quick mention of our sponsors, which feels ridiculous to say after that introduction.
*  Monk Pack Low Carb Snacks, Element Electrolyte Drinks, 8 Sleep Self-Cleaning Mattress,
*  and Rev Transcription and Captioning Service.

*  As a side note, let me say that I've been a fan of Josh Barnett for a long time.
*  This conversation was indeed a long time coming and I'm sure we'll talk many times again.
*  For what it's worth, I'm a student of combat sports and admire when they're done at the highest level,
*  either through masterful execution of skill or relentless dominance of pure guts.
*  For context, I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling,
*  jiu-jitsu, judo, and even catch wrestling, which is a variant of submission grappling that Josh
*  is one of the great practitioners, scholars, and teachers of.
*  I could probably talk for hours about what I've learned from my time on the mat,
*  but if I were to say one thing, it is that the mat is honest.
*  You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat.
*  It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself, all the delusions you might have,
*  or at least I had, that there's anything in this world that can be achieved except through blood,
*  sweat, and tears. That honesty, taken to the highest levels, as is the case with Josh,
*  creates the most special of human beings and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.

*  And now, here's my conversation with Josh Barnett.
*  Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas that influenced you the most?
*  Are we just jumping right in? We're right in into the deepest.
*  No foreplay on camera. All right. I had an interesting philosophical journey.
*  At least I think it's interesting. And that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy or maybe
*  authentic is not the right word, but like, yeah, we'll say organized.
*  I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people with the most influence on me.
*  But I also feel like, to a degree, your personality will oftentimes dictate what
*  philosophers that you can vibe with. So what ideas from Nietzsche? Was it the
*  Ubermensch? Definitely the Ubermensch is huge to me because I see it as an extension of
*  basically the religious concepts of God and higher ideals, but just put into a different
*  secular context. And the idea also that the Ubermensch is a striving and overcoming,
*  something that you're always working towards that very few will ever, it's not like the
*  concept that you can just make them. It doesn't happen that way. And it's not based simply upon
*  if you were, say, put through a genetic program and turned into a super soldier. That wouldn't
*  make it. That's the very surface level and incorrect understanding of what the Ubermensch
*  is. The Ubermensch is the idea of this kind of human that transcends all the weaker, lower
*  aspects of humans, which we're full of. But I also think that there's an element in Nietzsche's
*  writing that suggests that it's not something you can even be in all the time. It's even a temporary
*  state because it's not something that we're capable of maintaining. It's something to strive
*  for, like a morality, an image, an ideal, a set of principles that we can connect to that doesn't
*  rely on otherworldly kind of out there things. Yeah. With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of
*  the Ubermensch is something built on authenticity as well as Heidegger would say, like Dasein,
*  when you are authentic and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche's and highly influenced by
*  him, I think that the Ubermensch is an example of authenticity in that it isn't about trying to be
*  anything that you cannot be or to go against who you are, but to actually understand that, accept
*  that, and then work with what you can work with and create from your lump of clay that is you.
*  Because I can't become... There are certain things that are just not going to happen for me
*  because it's not in my proclivity. I mean, I'm never going to be five foot tall and 120 pounds.
*  Again, I guess. But I know, as you get more in tune with who you are, as you start learning more
*  about what unique things or at least what that combination that makes you, that Gestalt part of
*  yourself, what those things are and how you can use them, then you can work towards being that...
*  Taking what that is and seeing if you can get to that point. Now, the likelihood is, no,
*  maybe probably never. I mean, but we can never achieve godhood yet. Religion is a constant striving
*  and a look at a higher ideal concept. Even if it's multiple gods or one god, it's still essentially
*  all built around this concept. I like the idea of Catholics' original sin, if you think of sin,
*  not as evil, but as missing the mark, the archer's term where it derives, or even in Spanish without.
*  If you accept that you are imperfect, if you accept that you need to constantly strive even
*  against yourself because you will figure out the best ways at which to submarine your own
*  capabilities, submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever, you will ruin them more
*  than anything else. You will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose for a good reason,
*  or you'll say that you'll figure out a way to put it on everything else but yourself.
*  The idea of thinking of, well, as I'm starting off on this whole thing, I got a lot of work to do,
*  and that's just the way it is. I got to figure out what areas those are going to be.
*  And so I thought, if I think of original sin, actually can be, that can be a clever idea,
*  but it's also just accepting that we're all uniquely strange and unequal in our own ways,
*  but we have to figure out how that fits in. The word authenticity connects to all of that.
*  Striving to be your authentic self means figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,
*  the character of your little demons that you get to play with and around them finding a path to
*  whatever the hell ideal versions of yourself you can carve and pretending like that's such a thing
*  is even possible. The other idea about Nietzsche is on his idea of morality. He presents the argument
*  that morality is a human illusion and that there's not such a thing as good and evil,
*  and these are all kind of constructs. Do you think there's such a thing as good and evil
*  that's connected to some objective reality? I think that there are some, I actually do
*  believe that there are some universals. I'm not Kantian in any way, but I do think that
*  there are some universals. And the thing that actually brought me to even the concept of that
*  was Jung. So, you know, Jung's concept of the collective unconsciousness and then taking
*  that thought and then applying it to looking through history and the most varied history
*  you can find. So, I would say probably religion is your earliest one that you can get for written
*  history or written examples of human behavior and psychology at the furthest that we can look into it
*  from man's hand to whatever the medium is, cuneiform or whatever. But as you do that,
*  and then let's say going from Mesopotamia to India to Europe and just going from all these places as
*  disparate as they may seem, as many different cultures and ethnicities and religions and how
*  the religions will vary quite a bit from monotheist to polytheist and so on and so forth. But then
*  just seeing how there's all the through lines. And of course, Campbell, he did this much earlier than
*  me thinking about it. But I think that by looking at things that way and starting to find the threads
*  instead of always just looking at everything as being its own compartmentalized concept,
*  as if it only applies to this time, this people like getting overly pomo about it is just a really
*  idiotic postmodern. So you think that there is a, just like Joseph Campbell, there's a thread that
*  connects all of these stories, narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve.
*  And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas of maybe on the morality side,
*  which is the trickiest one of good and evil. Somewhat. Yeah. I think that a lot of this stuff
*  is just derived from a biological perspective. I feel like these things are innate within us.
*  Do you think are innately humans are good? Like we
*  know? I don't. I feel like I also feel like there's the issue of scale too. Like,
*  like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his the way he interacts with groups in
*  terms of scale. You know, what is this thing about like at the familial level? I'm a communist. And
*  then at the civic level, I'm a Republican or something at this other level. And then it goes
*  on at the widest level. He's a libertarian or something of that nature. You know,
*  fundamentally human interaction changes on scale and scale and also from, you know,
*  subjective to the environment around them. So, and I don't even mean environment just in the sake of
*  physical environment, nature, right? Like nature is constantly trying to murder you. Well, it's
*  not really trying. It's just nature's being nature. The universe is the universe. And at times it
*  takes you out. It's just not with any particular compunction or prejudice. It just oops, you know,
*  sorry, there's no more Dodos. My bad. But don't you think the particular flavor of the complexity
*  that is the human mind was created? Like, let me make an argument for that. All people are
*  fundamentally good. Okay. Is there's an evolutionary advantage to being the striving to cooperate.
*  To add more love to the world of like compassion, empathy, all that kind of stuff. And that the very
*  thing that created the human mind was this evolutionary advantage, whatever the forces
*  behind this evolutionary advantage and scale. Yes. So when we're dealing with a small tribe,
*  sure. Yeah. When you meet another tribe, maybe there's other factors that are going to end that.
*  Let's say you scale up and so your 150 has exceeded their 150 and like you start to get to
*  a certain point where you can't really be close enough to someone down the line of that next,
*  like that 150 is 150, 150. And they just now all of a sudden become some guy, whatever. And when
*  it comes to some guy at once it starts hitting scale, I don't know that it's capable.
*  People can be as magnanimous to a stranger as to the known. If they orient themselves to be
*  secure enough, because it does come to security, insecurity, and one way or the other, either
*  brought on by the unknown, brought on by an actual threat, brought on by even their own, as we would
*  use the word insecurity in that their own insecurity within their own capabilities,
*  their own belief in themselves, all these things can change things from being compassionate and
*  what have you to at least at the very least, maybe not evil, but self-interest driven to the point of
*  negative results for those that aren't. You know what I mean? Right. But another way to frame that
*  is maybe it's less about scale and more about the amount of resources available. So if we're
*  overflowing with resources in terms of security and safety, all the things you've mentioned,
*  if we have more than enough resources, then the way we treat a stranger, the way we position
*  ourselves towards that stranger might be in a way that allows us to be our real human selves,
*  is supposed to serve our animal self. And therefore it's mostly about how clever can we,
*  descendants of Abe's, be in coming up with all cool kinds of technologies and ways to
*  efficiently use the resources we have such that we're not constrained. And my hope is that we can,
*  that human innovation will outpace the growth of our, the number of people that are starving for
*  resources. Yes. I think that there's a lot of rationality behind this argument. And
*  in some ways I agree and in a lot of ways I see it as
*  missing the point of how this experiment has been playing out across time. When you look at
*  what, for one, it's like define resources. What is a resource as humans would define it,
*  or wealth even. And so you can say, well, an iPhone's a resource, the internet's a resource,
*  water obviously is a resource. But if we weigh them, what is more important to human beings?
*  Water, internet or iPhones, it's water. So if we look at resources, if we start with
*  what do human beings need to live? I mean, actually live, not live here in this
*  bullshit fantasy creation extension of our own ingenuity and a prison of our own creation and
*  also a paradise of our own creation. But this is not how human beings normally live. This is all
*  built upon stuff on concept, on idea, and some of it's built on just, well, this is the paradigm,
*  so this is what you do. Human beings need food, they need water to survive, they need shelter from
*  the elements, and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things and be able to pass them
*  down so that these things don't become, you don't end up in this gap where you have to relearn
*  things because if it's lost, then that time before you can get it back again is going to be
*  dark ages of sorts, or it's going to be highly detrimental to your group because not knowing how
*  to fish, not knowing how to hunt, not knowing how to even clean and cook the game once you have it
*  could be lethal. That's fascinating to think of that as a basic resource, the knowledge to
*  attain the very low level things of water and food.
*  Right, and we'll figure it out. We did it once before and we've done it over and over and over
*  and over again. It's just costly.
*  Yes, it has costs for sure. But when you think of how you look at the, well, we'll just deal with
*  the first world of the West. You look at the pathway of Western civilization and its growth,
*  and then you look at how technology injected into it over time, how it magnifies things or
*  pushes things at orders of magnitude faster, and then the internet comes along even faster.
*  You're watching industrial revolution too. What is it? The capacitor and then so on. It goes
*  further and further. As the internet and technology, especially on the electronic side of things,
*  start increasing in capability. It massively outpaces even our necessity for it at times.
*  Plant obsolescence happens quicker and over and over and over again. Wealth increases,
*  increases, increases, increases in terms of the things that we're able to acquire.
*  I've seen homeless people with smartphones. We're living in the most wealth-laden,
*  luxury-laden age of all of humanity. Yet, what happens when we see calamity or people
*  go on hard time? The things that they value, what do people go to an argument about the cost of
*  things that are luxury items generally and not necessity items? We get into fights about
*  the things that are, at the end of the day, not necessities to us. People are so concerned about
*  Netflix and the internet. Personally, I'm very concerned about the internet because I look at
*  it as my own little personal library of Alexandria in my pocket. That's what I love about it. The
*  ability to have a tool as effective as it is, even though I'm in a constant battle, to not let that
*  tool become a vice or to become something that actually brings me to a lower state.
*  The question is, are we willing to murder each other over Netflix versus murder each other over
*  water? We're willing to murder each other over water. That's a given.
*  That's our animalistic selves. It's animalistic, but it's also either you do it or you don't.
*  Unless somebody's willing to share that water or if that water is of such a limited
*  capability or such a limited amount, then you will have to murder to have that water.
*  With Netflix, the argument is the higher we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider in Los
*  Angeles resources, we're less willing to commit violence.
*  We're less willing to commit violence, I would say, over Netflix, but we are willing to commit
*  violence over Netflix, over everything associated with Netflix, over televisions, over sneakers,
*  over... When we look at the majority of the stuff that came with the riots, it was
*  used car dealerships, targets, and then you look and it's like, okay, what do they so hell bent to
*  get out of this whole thing? I'm even talking about the ideological elements or anything like
*  that. Just like, okay, something's going on, boom, looting, whatever. What are you going to loot?
*  You'll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread. I didn't see a single loaf of bread. I saw
*  televisions and shoes. It's poetry, Josh.
*  But to me, it is poetry in a sense because you get to see
*  who we, how we actually are operating. What is becoming first principles to most people.
*  But wait, but you could also argue that those riots were more like the madness of crowds,
*  which is like...
*  It's definitely a lot more than just that. I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like,
*  okay, boom, the lights are off, the grid is down. We've hacked into the whole system,
*  turned into an 80s movie, and you have the ability to go get a hold of whatever it is
*  that you think is most important. And what do we do? And I say we, as in, including all of us,
*  we grab a TV, we break into a sneaker store on Melrose. It's just like, we still giant cause
*  statues, or the value of that is completely market driven. It's just a piece of polypropylene or
*  whatever, butyl. And it's cool. I'm a big fan of art. But it's like,
*  I can't eat that. And at the end of the day, man, you're sitting there with your like,
*  what'd you do today, honey? What'd you get? Man, we were able to, oh, I got this designer art
*  statue. Are you going to go, well, you can't really sell it on the art markets where people
*  are really going to pay for it. So are you going to become an underground art dealer with your one
*  piece of cause art? One interesting thing is just before I forget it, you mentioned the Library of
*  Alexandria and your phone. Well, your phone, but also just thinking of your little world that
*  you're creating for yourself on the internet. That's a really powerful way to actually phrase
*  it. One of the things that you've been on Joe Rogan several times. Although everybody always comes
*  to me and go, Oh, that was so great. I didn't know you you're on you've on Joe Rogan. I go,
*  this is like my fifth time, dude. I've been a fan of yours for a long time from,
*  from other avenues. This is a long time coming actually, everybody, you have no idea like how
*  many times through messaging and missing each other over the years. This is ridiculous. This
*  is a long time coming. You don't realize how special this is for us. This is well,
*  I'm also starstruck. We'll talk about this, but you symbolize something very important to me
*  through my journey through wrestling through jujitsu through judo through just street fighting
*  through just combat. There's a you're the in some sense, the devil on my shoulder of like a violence
*  in a good in the in the devil gets a bad rap. He does get a bad rap. I realize, you know,
*  sitting encased in ice down at that low ass level, you know, but you know, the angel side is more
*  like the athletic, the sport, the science, the tech, the technical, the chest side of things. So
*  but on the library, Alexander, let me ask, uh, because you were on Joe Rogan,
*  it does make me really sad. And I realized that I'm just probably being romantic that his most of
*  his library of interviews that were on YouTube have now been taken down because he wanted Spotify.
*  And that was the first, I'm probably an idiot, but it was the first time I realized
*  that this knowledge that we've been building up on the internet doesn't necessarily last forever.
*  No, it doesn't unless you preserve it. I mean, it's like all things. If you do not preserve them,
*  if you do not make efforts, um, you know, so many of my, it just really brings to mind off the top
*  my head. All my, so many friends of mine that are Jewish, uh, you know, they're, they're basically
*  secular, but yet through even the secular aspect of just keeping the traditions alive, it's like,
*  well, you could always pick a book and read about it. Read about it clearly. It's called the Torah.
*  But, um, if you don't put these things into action, if you don't make them a part of
*  your consciousness, maybe even on the subconsciousness, just by through, through
*  repetition, they will die. They will become simply something that exists somewhere until you
*  find it again. And Carl Gotch used to say something, um, he would say that I don't invent moves. I just
*  rediscover them. But yet Gotch and Billy Robinson also would understand, uh, that you, if someone's
*  not carrying the torch, it'll go out. Now that doesn't mean fire can't be rekindled. It just
*  means that it, that torch no longer is lighting the way on, on this knowledge. And so it's,
*  it's important to be an individual, even on, on an individual level, to be a repository for,
*  for aspects of knowledge. You mentioned Gotch. You, um, consider yourself a catch, uh, wrestler.
*  So I've mentioned to you offline that I competed in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments,
*  can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic, you're the exactly right person to ask what is
*  catch wrestling and what are its defining principles? I would say the easiest way for
*  us to talk about and give, uh, an overview of what catch is in the simplest terms is
*  think of collegiate wrestling with submissions. That is essentially what catch is. And it's not
*  surprising because collegiate wrestling is actually derived from catch as catch can.
*  It's just that over time, certain aspects were, were, um, removed from the competition structure
*  so that they became, uh, null elements, things that were discarded. Uh, but it's funny that you
*  can take a high level, uh, amateur collegiate types and you can show them a move and then add
*  a little bit to it and go, Oh, well, hey, that was just like what we already do here, but except,
*  Oh, I didn't know you could take it all the way to this point or, you know, things of that nature,
*  especially when it comes to professional wrestling, like, uh, teaching people like, no, that, that,
*  I know you're just using this for, uh, in a show, but this is actually a real move and here's how
*  it really feels. And so collegiate wrestling and wrestling in general for people who are not aware
*  is basically two people started on their feet and they have to score that they're trying to
*  take each other down and they have to, um, they score points along the way. You can end matches
*  by pinning them, for example, on their back. I think one way to describe wrestling is, uh,
*  it's very much about figuring out ways to establish control and leverage in these kind of, uh,
*  tie-ups or there's different styles where you can do more from a distance to where it's more about
*  the timing and all that kind of stuff. Ultimately, it's an art of like both upper body and lower
*  body and you could choose the different puzzles that you solve there. You could be attacking
*  the head, the arms, you can be attacking the legs. There's also part of collegiate wrestling
*  that's on the ground that has more, uh, what's called like a referee's position, right?
*  The referee's position where you're on, uh, your hands and knees basically. And so, uh,
*  Do you, do you understand what that's supposed to simulate? Why is that one of the standard
*  positions? It's one of the standard positions because one, it's one of the easiest ways to
*  actually get up. Um, but two, it's because you cannot be on your back. If you're on your back,
*  you're getting pinned and the back exposure or being pinned is pretty much the universal
*  wrestling, uh, thing. One, taking the guy from their feet to the floor, uh, and two,
*  pinning them as you go from like, was it, uh, Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling,
*  Mongolian sumo, uh, Indian, um, well, they'll call it Pellwani. It's also called Kushdi, um,
*  Jiu-Jitsu, Judo. Um, so many of them is like, there's a, you Samba,
*  even if it doesn't end the match, it's still like, what are the most important aspects of
*  the competition itself across every style. And this is where submission, like catch wrestling
*  or, uh, submission wrestling or Jiu-Jitsu feels different, which it seems like for most wrestling,
*  for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the, is the goal, uh, as opposed to submission,
*  which I guess those are two are related, but dominating the position. So that's what pinning
*  is. It's almost like breaking your opponent, like breaking through all of their defenses to
*  where they're completely defenses and you could do anything with them that you want. Maybe that's a
*  Wikipedia definition of dominance. I don't know. And then it sounds very much like a chain to a
*  radiator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, there's a threat that connects all the winners, uh, but submission
*  feels different. Uh, I mean, it is actually different when you think about it across the
*  landscape. I don't think radically different, but just still slightly different in that, um,
*  if you think of wrestling as being derived from, from, from combat, right? So well, it is combat
*  sports, but more, more lethal combat, getting somebody off their feet and onto their back is
*  about a lethal place for the person on bottom to be in general. I mean, I don't, don't come at me
*  with your talks about your fucking worm guards and blah, blah, blah, and whatever, spider,
*  baron. Okay. Get out of here with that. This is, we're not talking about you in this highly, uh,
*  regimented sporting environment. We're talking about general, you know, all the body hair,
*  none of the waxing human beings. So, um, getting someone on their back. Okay. There, as you're
*  trying to get up, you're getting hit with a rock or stabbed or what have you set on fire.
*  Who knows? Generally these conflicts are not just isolated to one on one. You've it's, if it's four
*  on two, you're, you're, you're your buddy that was with you back to back. Now he's on his back.
*  What do you think? And now it's going to be one on one. Well, three go on one. So, and then you go,
*  you elevate this to, to armored combat, right? And it's boom, put them on the ground. Oh crap.
*  It's hard to get up. Well, while you're struggling to get up stab, you know, that's where jujitsu's,
*  uh, concepts come from with all their leveraging and off balancing is, oh man, if I end up in this
*  situation and tight close quarters combat, yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives and
*  what have you, but it's way easier if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back
*  and then pull my knife and just go stick. Is there a thread that connects all of these different
*  arts from not just arts, but from the very base violence of war, just like you said that there's
*  no rules to the very regimented, uh, I B a J F I do it just through tournaments and just,
*  you've kind of laid out some of it, but can you go all the way to the,
*  so when you start off with absolute skills in the sense of absolute offense and defense in
*  the taking or preserving of life, right? Full on at its, at its purest form of self defense and
*  self preservation. Okay. And then you extrapolate part of that in that all animals train in violence,
*  all play usually degenerates into some sort of soft violence. So be it cats when they're kittens
*  and puppies and not everything learns how to kill, how to fight. Um, not that, you know, just that,
*  that dumb alpha meme stuff where the idea is that, oh, by being alpha, that means you run around
*  like basically just being a bully and a shit head and no, actually alpha wolves spend very little
*  time fighting because if you were actually alpha, you don't get into fights. There's no need to.
*  And if you're probably getting into any large amount of fights, it's probably cause you're
*  being shitty at being an alpha and now people are tired of you being in charge. Um, and yet in the
*  animal world and it would be the same for human beings at that, that, that base beginning level
*  of violence, there's a big risk. So I know that we live in this place with healthcare and where,
*  or you might be in a place with nationalized health, whatever, right? There's, there's,
*  there's band-aids, there's, there's, uh, uh, uh, penicillin, there's all that kind of stuff,
*  but that's not the normal way of things. You know, uh,
*  there's a channel that just hurts me every time I, I used to follow and I had to unfollow it
*  because it was too painful for me as a human being called nature is metal. Ah, yes. Instagram,
*  it was, uh, sobering. And then it was like, this is too sober. I have to be sobering. So in there,
*  the risk is at its highest level there. The damage you take, the winner walks away hurt.
*  Getting blamed. And when you need every aspect of your physical and athletic faculties to
*  survive, because it isn't going to be the, the, this isn't the first and it's definitely not
*  going to be the last, especially if you're the slowest one. You know, it's a, it was, it was,
*  there's a lyric from a clutch song. Uh, don't go for the fat ones. Just go for the slow ones.
*  Man, but that, the universal truth of the way nature works is you said it's not cruel. It's
*  not cruel. It's just the way it is. Yeah. I mean, watch, uh, animals getting the fights on,
*  on any of these sort of documentary stuff, you'll see an intense short and then dispersal. Like
*  you'll see as soon as one feels like, uh, things have switched just enough to boom, the bear or
*  whatever it is takes off. It's like, I'm not, I'm done with this because if you can get out of there
*  with just some scars and what have you, okay. You lose an eye. Nah, it's not as good. Uh, you really
*  get hurt bad and get infected. You're done. You know, so it, there's a, a serious risk to be,
*  um, that can come with these sorts of things. Yet I believe that we are inherently born for at least
*  aspects of use of violence. And so at the end of the day, we need these things, not just to,
*  not just survive each other, but they're, they're a part of being able to hunt and other things.
*  But, uh, violence is a part of human nature. Violence is, it's a, it's like an, it's an absolute,
*  it is in every person. It is a part of every interaction. It isn't part of every,
*  every law, everything. And I'm not, by the way, I'm not an ANCAP. So don't even don't,
*  don't hit your wagon to me on that one. An Anarchy Capitalists. An Anarchy Capitalists. Yes.
*  Not, not an ANCAP. They have nice book, book shops. Yeah, they do. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to,
*  you know, sit here and shit talk ANCAPs. Uh, although I also used to get into the conversations
*  with, uh, with, uh, an ANCOM, uh, anarcho communist, uh, a good friend of mine. And he would,
*  he would bring up this stuff and I'm like, yeah, cool, man. I'm down with anarchy.
*  You ain't going to like it. What do you mean? I go, cause I'm going to take,
*  I'm going to gather all kinds of people to, I'm going to make this, I'm going to get the
*  strongest together. I'm going to take your shit. Okay. On that topic, I have, uh, a friend of mine
*  now, uh, a fellow Russian, uh, Ukrainian, uh, Michael Malas. Oh, I, yeah, I'm familiar with
*  Michael Malas. I watched a little bit of your guys' uh, conversation. So this is really good to ask
*  you because, uh, I like how he's in the white suit and you're in the white and black, but he,
*  he lives in New York city. He is, uh, his spouse's ideas of anarchism and his idea, and this is
*  different than, um, sort of the Ayn Rand, uh, set of ideas that there's a line between sort of
*  capitalism that's backed by the state and just pure anarchism. And his idea that violence won't
*  take over, uh, in an anarchism is one that feels to me not grounded in reality. I may be,
*  I may be wrong. So is there some, so, uh, the idea with pure capitalism is that
*  you mean laissez faire completely deregulated. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what it will agree, it'll end
*  up in one, it'll end up in, if you're anti-globalist, it's going to be that it's going to be globalist
*  a hundred percent because it has no pure capitalism has no consideration for, uh,
*  has no consideration for your, your native users or of any sort. Like it doesn't matter.
*  But the idea of governments is that the land, the little piece of land you're geographically,
*  you're born on means you're going to stick to whatever founding documents created that little
*  land. So anarchism is against that. And the argument is you should be able to choose which
*  ideas you live with. And the concern there is nobody, uh, the, the geographical little land,
*  the governments that organize on that land will not do not need to protect you from the violence.
*  And my sense is there does need to be an army. There does need to be police that help however
*  the form that police takes, but there needs to be a more centralized, not completely centralized,
*  but more centralized safety net of the protector from the violence scale again. Right. So if you
*  want to have your anarchist utopia, well, what will you call it? You tell your anarchist
*  creation here at certain scale, I'm sure it's doable, you know? Um, but as it scales,
*  as the scale increases, it's completely untenable and a state will emerge. A state will always
*  emerge because even people always think of states as, as like people rubbing their hands and smoking
*  cigars in back rooms and just out of nowhere coming around and just like, oh, we're going to
*  create this big centralized thing and just so that we can tell everybody what to do and we can be in
*  charge. I mean, I know that there are people like that that exists that they would like to do things
*  of that nature and that they see, uh, the use of power as something to be used more for their,
*  their personal gains over first, which again, self-interest and human beings. But, um,
*  uh, but eventually a state people want, they want something to go like, okay,
*  who's taking care of this and who's taking care of that and who, and how do we create some sort of,
*  uh, some sort of, uh, protocol for this? Like, okay, well, when it's not Bob, when is it Susie?
*  When is it whatever? I mean, like, how do we, you know, it's gotta get done if we want this
*  thing to become bigger, if we want our, all of our plumbing to work right, if we want it, just,
*  I'm sorry, a state's gonna happen. A state is also, when you think about it,
*  it's supposed to have consideration to tribe, right? So if people think that we're not tribes,
*  well, you're not, you're not really thinking very deeply. We're all tribes of a sort. And, uh,
*  everybody likes to use the word tribalism and this idea of, of this, uh, antagonistic concept. But,
*  and while sure tribalism can be antagonistic, tribalism can also be, uh, a positive thing,
*  or I could just say it just seems to be a natural thing. People, you know, they create their, their
*  groups of one sort or another. And so when you have, well, when you think about where, when
*  nation states really started to become a thing, uh, and I don't mean even the more modern looking
*  variants that we could think back of and say the 19th century or something like that, even older
*  than that. I mean, you think the Assyrians didn't have a state of some sort? Of course they did.
*  Um, they, how do you increase your, your, your, your empire if you don't actually have a place
*  to start from? So you're saying like naturally when you start talking and thinking about scale of
*  humans, naturally states emerge. And can we try to make an argument for anarchism, which is,
*  uh, okay. Okay. Okay. So, uh, anarchy in a sense is an opposition to the unhelpful,
*  unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies that eventually the States lead to.
*  And that's what we can see. I mean, I would say less anarchy, let more study James Burnham,
*  you know, uh, or well,
*  any, anybody that wants to talk about the managerial problem and the man.
*  I see. So you, you have a sense, a hope, maybe let's think like, what is the path forward
*  with the inefficient state? Is it revolution or is it to work within the system to constantly
*  improve it? Man, I don't know that one. I mean, my general sense, uh, and maybe this is the Nietzschean
*  part of me is that, yeah, it'll, it would take maybe not even just maybe not even defining,
*  uh, it specifically as revolution. Maybe it would just take just total calamity to,
*  to get people to stop being shitty, to not stop being a lesser version of themselves, to stop
*  thinking more about, uh, things from the paradigm that we exist in now where we're,
*  we're giving so much value to stuff that isn't really all that valuable. You know,
*  we're so concerned about likes and I don't just mean like whether we get them or not,
*  but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off of our platform because this is too
*  destabilizing to people. And it's like, cause once you exceed Dunbar's number, I think it's actually
*  without having the right faculties, which would need to be developed because this is dealing with,
*  this is dealing with tech that brings things, ways of approaching being that we are not
*  naturally programmed to be able, uh, to handle appropriately. So, and I think even, even,
*  even more, it's even more detrimental to women than men because I think, uh, women have a more
*  natural proclivity towards, um, uh, group association and, uh, and, and more group-oriented
*  thinking and patterning. And now, and with also coupled with seemingly more sensitivity towards,
*  towards human, uh, states. So I feel like women, like the classic idea is like, oh, you know,
*  women are psychic and they have a sixth sense and what have you. And I think that's just a, uh,
*  uh, a way of simplifying what I think is that women may be more in tune with picking up on the
*  unsaid. Like they might be better at, at, at seeing, um, physical cues, uh, inflection and tone,
*  like different, like they may be far more sensitive to these things, which to me would make sense
*  because dealing with children that can't, uh, communicate. So, so generally more,
*  I'm just thinking of like, right now, okay. Now, whether it be a woman or a man, but especially
*  with even the social, uh, push on this concept of empathy, which of course it gets to the point
*  where it loses any meaning anymore. Like people use the word empathy absolutely incorrectly all
*  the time and they don't even understand what you're really asking of people. But let's just take it as,
*  as we're using empathy in the correct sense and you're taking on the emotional content of the
*  thing itself. Now you open that up to thousands of people, maybe hundreds of thousands of people
*  all across the world that you will never meet, that you will never know that you're not even
*  getting an actual true representation most of the time of who these people are. You're,
*  you're meeting persona and some of these personas are even deliberately created to elicit a response
*  in authentically. Are you referring to bots or, uh,
*  could be bots or actual people bots are one thing, but I mean, there are literal people out there
*  that will create something, create a go fund these for, for tragedies. It never didn't really,
*  or events that didn't happen or any number of things. Okay. I mean, burn their own house down
*  and then say, you know, we were attacked and then it comes down. Oh, you did it to yourself
*  because you wanted money and empathy and this, that, and you wanted all this, this emotional
*  wealth, let's say this emotional, uh, coin as well as actual, if possible, you wanted to leverage
*  it in some way. That's not the majority of people, but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,
*  well, if I post this photo, um, and I put this little blurb in there, I bet I can get this much
*  cache out of it in this sense. And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference to like
*  butt picks and stuff like that, because clearly obviously people understand that, that, uh,
*  our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate. I mean, that's pretty, pretty obvious.
*  But you're, you're, you're saying this kind of new medium of communication on social media is,
*  uh, is, is unnatural. And it preys on us. And so as you, you want this, you know, you look at,
*  you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right? And so you're just like, there's no,
*  there, there is no overarching state to, to create any kind of, uh, structure, right? And so
*  if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect with it, and before I say anything particularly
*  damning about unfettered capitalism, uh, I'm a massive capitalist because I view capitalism,
*  essentially as what it boils down to, uh, these arguments with people too, they, they start giving
*  me all these extra definitions about capitalism. Like, no, no, this is obviously some sort of
*  theory you're taking from other ship, but that doesn't describe capitalism. Capitalism is
*  the ability for us to create whatever we want, or, you know, create our, our thoughts, ideas,
*  physical things, and trade them freely amongst each other in ways that we find, um, acceptable,
*  right? You know, I'm not even using the word fair because I might think it's fair to me.
*  You might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually, I think he, what he thought was unfair
*  to him and it's more fair to me. And then someone, a third observer goes, oh man, you should have,
*  you should not have paid that for that. You should have paid this. And it's like, well,
*  you know what, it works for me without sufficiently acceptable that you, you both agreed to the
*  transaction. Correct. And, uh, you know, but, but also at the, at the root of that is freedom,
*  right? And as far as I can tell, I've been banging this around in my head. It's like for
*  every one unit of freedom, you need two units of accountability. And if you don't have that,
*  what you end up with is human self-interest. We're not even going to get into evil human
*  self-interest, sabotaging other things, even not in a sense to be malicious. Okay. So in terms of,
*  let's put this as mathematically speaking, I love this. So anarchism is more like two units of
*  freedom and one unit of accountability or maybe zero units of accountability. Possibly. I mean,
*  the anarchists tend to think like, no, everyone will be accountable. It's like, fuck they will.
*  When have you seen this happen in real life? You know, I mean, people aren't even accountable in
*  their revolutions after times. So, uh, you aren't looking at the way people really are. It's like,
*  Marx is like, yeah, people are like this. They're like that. Look at how capitalism does it. I mean,
*  he of course assigns a lot of really ridiculous economic principles and practice, but also assumes
*  that everybody who makes any profit from anything is somehow stealing it and really assigns a
*  negative moral aspect to them. And then it's like, oh yeah, but then eventually communism will happen
*  to everyone. No one will act that way anymore. And you're like, whoa, hold on. You just said
*  that people are all, are you saying it's all due to capitalism or it's, is it innate? It's just,
*  it's a fundamental misunderstanding of, and it's like, Hey, look at you. You're like a notorious,
*  like anti-Semitic, angry, like, uh, just absolute curmudgeon of a human being who seems to be
*  really not all that fun to be around. Yeah. And then it's just like, so you have to think like,
*  if there was 1 billion Marx's in the world, how would they behave? It would be absolute.
*  They would hate each other so bad. And you know, this isn't for me to even poison the well on Marx
*  is like, Oh, his personality sucks. Like there's lots of people whose personality sucks. That
*  doesn't mean they can't make, I don't know that it's never, what, you know, somebody argues,
*  he's just a, he's a loner. I mean, I don't know that his personality sucked at all.
*  Let me walk that back and that he was human. Say his personality sucked. He was sometimes
*  contradictory, irrational. Sometimes he was, uh, quite sexist despite the emails I've gotten
*  that, uh, that, that's that told me that, uh, that there's, that's people was written to me that,
*  Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled as sexist in his discussion about women. I'm pretty sure
*  there's a bunch of documents where he's just like, he's just a bitter guy.
*  I will agree with you. And Marx is as bitter as they come to, but, um, you know, a bitterness
*  in and of itself doesn't make like what, why I hate Marxism comes from, you know, the, the whole,
*  the entirety of the thing. And, but the dismissal of human nature, but I'm not going to say that
*  Marxism or practic, man, you can find any forbidden book and it could have something good in it.
*  As colonel is a good idea. Yeah. And like at the end of the day, you know, Marx is a human being.
*  He's got a nice beard. He does. He had a hell of a beard. Yeah. A decent portrait. I mean,
*  he looks like the kind of guy like, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley, but thankfully
*  I don't think he was much of a fighter. But in any case, I mean, not the anarchists are,
*  they're more hot for like, uh, max sterner. People like to think that, uh, Nietzsche borrowed a lot
*  from sterner. And my argument is one, you don't have any real evidence for that. And two bullshit,
*  you know, I mean, anybody could, I, the fact that they have some overlapping thoughts doesn't make
*  it, uh, lifted, not to mention go read a lot more philosophy and see how there's so many different
*  things. Oh, this guy said it in, uh, 1722. Well, and then this guy says that again in 1922. Does
*  that mean he read the other guy's stuff? Not necessarily. I mean, he's working from the same
*  type of human physiological construct as anybody else. Like, of course it's possible that this guy
*  could think the same thing. We think a lot of the same things to be perfectly honest. I mean,
*  reading the Haga-Kure going back to philosophy books, this was really impactful on me as a
*  younger adult because here's a book written in the 19th century about someone who lived through,
*  uh, the 19th and 18th century at times as a samurai, now a monk and his objections to society
*  at the time, the same objections one was having to society as I was reading it, like the same
*  human behaviors, the same, uh, impetus for action that he found, uh, a problem.
*  Like, well, that's the same, that's the same shit now. Like we're not, and this was the thing. And
*  then I'm reading more religion. I go, Oh, we're no different than anyone who wrote the Torah or
*  older. We are the same thing with the same problems with the same, uh, psychological issues, the same
*  human behaviors. Like these things are not different. Yeah. And we haven't changed growing
*  set of tools though, to, to kill each other with or to communicate together and all the kind of
*  stuff, but underlying it, there's a human nature. Well, we're also trying to understand that human
*  nature. I think we've just like you said, learning how to fish acquired more and more knowledge
*  about that human nature. Uh, but it's been a very slow journey, slower than people realize. Yes.
*  In terms of understanding, uh, human nature, let me ask in terms of egoism, to be curious, uh,
*  to get your sense about Ayn Rand and, um, her whole idea of virtue of like selfishness and her,
*  because you mentioned that everybody has a kernel of truth there. There's potential for a kernel
*  to be discovered in any, in anything. For example, I've been recently reading mine comp, uh,
*  you know what? That's the thing. Even there's something in there's probably things in mine
*  comp that are not the surface level read. If you get all hung up on, on all, probably all his crap
*  about, um, you know, his anger, anger at Jews and this and that all this crap, it's like, okay,
*  yeah, that that's right on the surface. Try to get below that. Try to see, you know, how is he,
*  how is he creating the Jews as a cope somehow? Like how is he using, why, why are they his,
*  his scapegoat? And I mean, scapegoat in the, so Renny Girard's, uh, concept of the scapegoat.
*  I mean, in that sense, whereas, uh, you know, Hitler uses, it wants to make the, the Jews,
*  the scapegoat for world war one. Yeah. I mean, for me, the starting point,
*  similar with Ayn Rand is, uh, like mine conf is not a good place to search, not just because
*  Hitler is evil, but it's just not full of ideas. No, it is not. It has its significance due to a
*  lot of historically speaking, but the starting point for me with Hitler is like to acknowledge
*  that he's human and to at least consider the possibility that any one of us could have been
*  Hitler. So like the not make Peterson kind of concept. Also, um, Jonathan Haidt has a thing
*  about, uh, the difference between hate and disgust mechanisms and things like that. And so he used,
*  he goes into the, looking at, uh, Hitler and his, through his, his diary entries and journals and
*  stuff like that to look, uh, and see it more as the, the disgust mechanism. Then also try and see
*  like, if there's any evolutionary biological, uh, attachment to this, whatever, I mean, you're right.
*  He is a human being. Any of us are, we're all human beings. It's not that
*  it's probably jarring for people to think, but we're,
*  we're all, I guess, suppose potentially capable of just being in and all these evil people in the
*  world think they're doing it for the sake of good, which makes them the most dangerous.
*  And there's some, there's differences in levels of insane. I think he was way more insane than
*  Stalin. I think Stalin legitimately thought he was being doing good. I would say that's probably true.
*  Stalin was just outright brutal. He had, he had his five year plan. He had all of the other things.
*  He's just had a much lower value for human life. Yes. And so he was willing to take,
*  make decisions about what he actually, as a, as a good executive, which he was of managing different
*  bureaucracies and so on, he was willing to make decisions that resulted in mass human suffering
*  where Hitler was, it seems like to me, what much moodier, so allowed emotions and moves to make
*  decisions. We also have to consider, um, the different trajectories and how, where,
*  and when they were making their decisions. And I mean, not by time specifically, but,
*  you know, Hitler engaged into this, this conflict across multiple continents. And then that,
*  everything that comes with basically fighting the whole world, Stalin had his conflict and then
*  he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it. So he was dealing with his own internal instead
*  of dealing with the internal and the external. So if Stalin was put under a world war scenario,
*  I don't know, maybe he would have eventually lost his marbles too. Yeah. I'm not sure that,
*  that's you're right there. The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin. He wanted to
*  control the land that already existed as opposed to wanting to colonize other land. He was as
*  nationalistic as Hitler, but, uh, and was as capable and willing for, uh, violent conflict as
*  Hitler for the aims of the state. But he, he, he centered and internalized prior to then externalizing
*  and moving outwards. Whereas even maybe prior to him, there was an interest to continually push
*  communism in an aggressive sense, following on the momentum from the, the what 1918 revolution.
*  And that the halting of that, uh, through various aspects, I guess, uh, in Germany,
*  part of that was the national socialist. Like they, they came up and then they, they were the
*  other ones to fight the communists. And so you had the two totalitarians going after it. Um,
*  but then in the rest of the world that was not dealing with, um, totalitarian aspects,
*  it was just, it wasn't gonna stick, especially in the West and other places. But
*  Stalin see it just, you know, casually thinking it seemed like Stalin decided to go, all right,
*  well, we're not going to go just start launching right into more conflicts here. We're going to,
*  these dudes are going down. So that's cool for us because they hate us and we hate them. Um,
*  but now we're going to, we're going to focus internally and then we're going to work on
*  growing at a slower rate and picking our battles a bit more specifically. And of course there's,
*  you know, you can get to the, even this is after Stalin, but yeah, you got the
*  Besman of type stuff talking about subversion in, in cultural aspects.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's, there's fascinating dynamics to propaganda throughout the whole
*  period that that's a whole nother kernel. Yeah. Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?
*  One of the things that's kind of fascinating to look at is how many nations, both journalists
*  and nations wanted almost crave to take Hitler at his word that he wanted peace
*  until it was too late. They almost wanted to be delude themselves. I mean, the same is true with
*  the Stalin. Uh, people wanted to take Stalin at his word for it.
*  They still delude themselves. Yeah. We will delude. We, we will delude ourselves over any number of
*  things. And until even after the fact where the history just says, Hey, fuck face, you know,
*  you cannot supplement your pseudo reality onto actual reality here. But yet we deal with people
*  in pseudo realities constantly. I mean, we will always find a way to, to change reality to suit
*  our needs. Well, the nature of truth now, there's now multiple actual truth is kind of fascinating.
*  There's multiple versions of history that people are telling, you know, the version, the version of
*  the great patriotic war in Russia, the world war two in Russia is very different today under Putin
*  than the version that we're learning on the, in the United States and then different than the
*  version in Europe in the United States. Uh, the, the hero of the war is the United States
*  in Europe. There's a much more sad and solemn story of suffering and so on. Sure. And in Russia,
*  it's the great patriotic war. It was a unifier of a sense. And it, I mean,
*  yeah, I mean, you can't argue that war and conflict that, and, or I just even, um,
*  reducing that to stressors, agitation, suffering doesn't create human motivation. You know,
*  we started this off, you brought up, uh, Frankel and I'm like, yeah, Frankel's dope.
*  Answers for meaning, uh, Maslow's great. And, and I talked to you about how I started to think like,
*  man, do the ability for human beings to, to, to live and, or potentially flourish in the worst
*  environments you can think of is pretty incredible in and of itself. And that it's a crazy thought
*  to think that without Frankel and Maslow ending up in concentration camps,
*  do they write some of the most important books on philosophy in the 20th century? And that's
*  insane on a lot of different levels, but, um, suffering is a creative force. I mean, I don't,
*  do you think we'll always have war? Yes, we will always have war in some form or another. We,
*  we need quote unquote air quotes for those just listening, uh, war to survive. We need war to
*  flourish. We need at least, can you explain the quote, the air quotes around the war? Well,
*  because, uh, take, take, take, take the, you see wars as violence? No, words are not violence. So
*  like, so when we're talking about quotes, because, uh, while you know what us getting on the mat or
*  just getting on these hardwood floors and wrestling around is not literal war. It's war of a sorts,
*  you know, work, you know, it is, it is a diluted form of war. American football is a diluted form
*  of war. All this is, these are diluted forms of war. Tennis is a diluted form of war. Um, and
*  I think the, one of the best explanations I ever got from this and another person, very, uh, impactful
*  on my life and outlook and thinking about things, Cormac McCarthy. And so in blood meridian, there's
*  this fantastic speech about war given by the judge, which there's a ton of fantastic speeches
*  on things given by the judge. Yeah. All that exists in creation without my knowledge does
*  so without my consent. Okay. That's pretty heavy. That's, that's hard. Can you break that up? Can
*  you say that again? Uh, all things that exist in creation, all things that exist without my knowledge,
*  do so without my consent. What does that mean? Well, I think from the judge's perspective,
*  it's like, well, I didn't consent to that bird or that dog or this building or all this, like all of
*  this, you know, I didn't create it. So it's done so without my consent. And if it's up to my consent,
*  well, I'll design it how I want to. There's another similar, uh, look into how the judges
*  in that book is he would study everything, everywhere he went. And so he's collected this
*  group of ne'er do wells from all over to go on these hunts, uh, against, uh, certain tribes in,
*  in the Southwest, um, and getting paid by the U S government, the Mexican government.
*  So he's on these Indian hunts and yet they're going to all these different places and
*  they would stay the night in a cave somewhere and he would find cave paintings. He would write them
*  all down or he would find old pieces. There's an example of him, uh, the narrator, uh, explaining
*  how watching the judge and how he drawing everything. He's got this notebook just full of
*  things, the drawings and writings and how he found like a piece of armor from a conquistador or
*  something way back in the day, a Spanish armor. He draws it into his, his book and then crushes it.
*  It's so that, so the reason we'll always have war in the society is because there's these
*  struggle of amongst people that want to be the designers. There's, there's that, but it's,
*  I'm just saying that, uh, he's got this whole quote on war. Like war is about, is, is play war
*  is a game and the differences is that what's at stake. So all things are a game of some sort. And
*  you're putting up for it or you're, what you're willing to put up for it determines whether or
*  not you're going to participate or not. And, you know, all, all aspects of any game is war.
*  And it's just, what, what does it stake? You know, if it's your life, it's a different story. If
*  it's just a coin, that's another thing. A nice way to put it is, uh, humans play a game in this kind
*  of pursuit of, uh, creating whatever the hell the reason is that we keep creating cooler and
*  cooler things that, that it seems to be the result of a game that we naturally play. It
*  would naturally crave. I don't know. I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy is to
*  understand what is the underlying force of all that. Is it the will to power? Is it,
*  I think will to power is a really great way of, uh, of describing it.
*  Do you want to be the winner of the game?
*  No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power as being the winner of the game.
*  Well, I mean, if we're going to get philosophical, yes, you want to be the winner of the game.
*  What does winning the game define how you win? Everybody's going to define that win differently.
*  You know, you could define the win in the most base level, like, oh, I got all the things.
*  Well, if you got all those things without the, the needing component of fulfillment,
*  then you're going to be a very unhappy person with a whole lot of things.
*  There's a self referential aspect to where, to me, the winner of the game is defined by
*  the people playing the game. So if I'm playing a game, I want to win in the sense that most of
*  the other people who are playing the game will say, yeah, that guy won by their, by our collective
*  definition. If I just come up, listen, I'm sort of, if I come out, that's a lot of, that's a lot
*  of weight on the external on you. Right. But that's, that's how games seem to work somewhat.
*  So I'm already a winner in my life by defining my own, I'm basically the best person in the world
*  at doing me at being Lex. Yeah. So like, and then I'm really happy with that. That's, that's a source
*  of happiness. Games are also iterated, right? So you, you start off with your game and then your
*  game with your immediate. And then the game further than that, the game further than that,
*  and then the game today and the game tomorrow and the game next week. And so it never ends.
*  And if you try to keep thinking about it that way, no wonder people go crazy, but we, we don't want
*  to think about things that way. We don't want to think about being towards death. We don't want to
*  think about whether or not I'm going anywhere after this other than in the ground or what have you,
*  like we, you know, why all of these games are sent some distraction. This is where we
*  But I mean, it's, it's violence is that we need to let this out. And so it is of our kids need to
*  wrestle and play just like animals need to wrestle and play. We need to have forms of competition.
*  We need to have ways to, to test ourselves to create when, what is it? When at peace,
*  a man of war makes war with himself. And so we need to be able to competently go at war with
*  ourselves and go at war with our neighbor and go at war with our neighbor's neighbor
*  in a way that is repeatable at the very least. So one, one way of saying that there will always
*  be war. I mean, that's my hopeful view is that most of the war conducted in the future will be,
*  like you said, the man might go to war with himself. That would be great. That that's,
*  that's what to me love is, is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement and your own
*  creativity and towards others feeling sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior and
*  compassion and empathy. It would be great. But I mean, you can have,
*  well, I'll put it to you this way. If you have a whole community of Randians and a whole community
*  of Ancoms and they could all like, I don't know, a toast of London on Netflix and they love Netflix
*  and they love the internet and they love picking apart Moncom with you. They love like they like
*  all these things, even the esoteric that they can, they can, they can get on with, but at the,
*  at the fundamental root, they cannot help but go to war because they are literally oil and water.
*  No, but see, but they would, the very labels they assign to themselves would need to dissipate.
*  Well, well, then you would have to stop being whatever it is that you took on as your ideological
*  or religious point, right? Yeah. I mean, I, there's some days I'm an Ancom, some days I'm an N caps and
*  whatever the, an archic, an archic capital. I mean, there's, it depends on the, the hour,
*  the minute of the day, you constantly changing moods and embracing that flow, the change
*  of opinions, of ideas as there's some days like I'm actually cognizant of the fact,
*  cause I've been not getting my sleep. And after I get some sleep, I see I'm so much more optimistic
*  about the world. The less and less sleep I get, the more sad and cynical I get up and down.
*  I don't even let my, well, okay. I try not to let in most days. It's never a problem.
*  Any sort of like, uh, what are the kids call it now? Blackpilled way of thinking be my,
*  my, my over my, the umbrella, which I hang under. So we actually, uh, to drag us back,
*  can we talk about Carl gotcha and catch wrestling? Cause I do want to make sure I touch it. I mean,
*  what, uh, who were, you know, Carl gotch is, uh, is he the greatest catch wrestler? I don't know if
*  he was the greatest catch wrestler ever. I don't, I don't, I mean, he's one of them for a myriad of
*  Carl gotch, uh, Billy Robinson, uh, gotcha and Robinson's trainer, Billy Riley. Um,
*  so who are these figures and what did they miss? So my Ada, he's one of the greatest catch
*  wrestlers ever because he's responsible for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu along with Christelle Gracie.
*  Okay. There's so much of things I'd like to say here, but one of the things that
*  catch wrestling seemed to espouse as a principle is that a violence. I, I just,
*  the, the tournaments I competed at, uh, the unfortunate thing, and we'll probably
*  hopefully talk about a little bit, they weren't disorganized and the level of competition was
*  pretty low. People really sucked. Pretty typical. Is that typical? Okay. Well, it's, it's, I mean,
*  think about, um, local run of the mill, uh, Jiu-Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF created, you know,
*  vast difference. So, so I, you know, but there is a, to me as a human being that like intellectually,
*  philosophically, it was more interesting to go to catch wrestling tournament. It seemed more real
*  and honest because of the way they communicate about violence and aggression. So it is, it is
*  often, uh, more honest. I think that as that from, does that originate from gosh,
*  Rob said, well, it originates from all wrestling in that, uh, even Wade, Wade shallis, not a,
*  not a classically considered catch wrestler yet. The reason why he has the world record for
*  most amount of world champions pinned or the record for pins in the NCAA is because, well,
*  of course, the idea is to put you on your back and opinion, but there's no way you're going to let me
*  do that. Uh, so how do I make it so that you want me to pin you? Well, it's by, you put them in
*  excruciating pain. So at the end of the day, you're both there. You both want to win. Neither one
*  wants to allow anything to the other. So how do I, how do I get you to lose to me? I make it so
*  unbearable for you that you decide losing is better than staying. So those are the two, those two are
*  so fascinating because so coming from Russia, I don't know if that's where I got it or if it's
*  just my own predisposition is I always loved the, there's two ways to get you to want to pin yourself.
*  One is to make it so painful not to pin yourself that you pin yourself or whatever. And the other
*  is it's sort of like a Bruce Lee water flows, make it so easy to pin yourself. So it's technique.
*  It's like the elegance, the ease of movement. This is the Satya brothers, uh, like the, just the
*  elegance, the efficiency, the chess of it. Yeah. They're practically like ballet watching these guys.
*  You know, it's incredible. Satya brothers are massive. And, uh, and also caveat a little bit
*  that like, uh, if you're, if you're approaching this from a Russian perspective, Russians are
*  quite truthful about things. Uh, especially when it comes to something like combat, they just,
*  this is how it is. And this is how it's going to be honest. Yes. And the honesty is what I really
*  like about, uh, catch wrestling because I find that we given any opportunity for us to be dishonest
*  for any number of reasons, we're gonna, uh, especially if it's a dishonesty towards a
*  positive, right? Like, oh, well, you know, it's all technique and it's all this and it's the gentle
*  art and blah, bro. I have rolled with ADCC world champions, you know, some of the best you have
*  ever heard of. There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like, oh yeah, they wanted to
*  sweep you and you said no. And then you did said no again. And then you said no and attacked their
*  leg. It ceases to be all that gentle because at the end of the day, these dudes are strong as hell.
*  They're flexible. They're all, I mean, they're, they're the difference between the athleticism
*  and, and the, the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap. The athleticism shows up,
*  but then there's all that other extra. And part of that is meanness and, and pain and, uh,
*  getting what you need out of it. But see, there is a philosophical
*  difference in the way it's thought because I think some of it is just, they just in denial,
*  like, oh, people will, they like to, people like to espouse a lot of things as theory.
*  And then it's like, okay, let me watch when they're, oh, you're not doing anything about
*  what you said right now. In fact, you're doing the opposite. You're, you're literally hurting that guy
*  because you, your shit ain't working in the way that you'd like it to. So you're having to use
*  strength. You're having to, it's one of my favorites, like, oh, you're using too much strength.
*  And it's like, well, hold on. Do we want people not to use strength at this point to understand
*  more of mechanics or are you trying to tell people if they use strength at all, uh, that
*  they're somehow bad at what they do? Cause you know, it's not my fault. You're not stronger than
*  this. Yeah. Speaking of something else that's, uh, that's, I tend to think what it comes down to is
*  like strength is fine until you beat me with it. Then it sucks. Okay. So strength is another thing.
*  I'm speaking, I'm thinking about more like anger. Oh, sure. So like a lot of angry guys in jujitsu.
*  I know that. Really? Okay. Okay. Good. Well, but let's talk about, let's talk about the highest
*  level of competition. There's a book called wrestling tough. Yeah. It's a really good book.
*  I've encountered in my life, a few, uh, especially in wrestling people who really tried to find a way
*  to use anger, to get really angry at their opponent, not like stupid anger, but just like
*  intense pointed, uh, anger, uh, distilled into something that you can use fuel.
*  And like, I remember the story. I don't know where I read it might be wrestling tough,
*  where a person was imagining that their opponent just raped their mother, raped their girlfriend
*  or something like that to, to create this like method acting thing in their head to be like,
*  to, to snap them out of this polite interaction of the usual, like athletic convention and like,
*  you know, design of necessity. So my anecdote for this was I was sitting with, uh, backstage
*  before a fight, not my fight. And I'm, I'm working with this guy and this dude is,
*  this is a, this is a world champion guy. Uh, and he's competed at the highest levels. Uh, and he,
*  he looks at me and he goes, you know, you ever get nervous before fights? And I looked at him and I
*  went, no, I don't. And he just looks at me. He's like, fuck man. I'm so nervous. You know,
*  I, how do you do it, man? Well, you know, I wish it could be like, you know, I said, you know what,
*  that doesn't mean that what I'm doing is better. It's just what is necessary for me. It's the way
*  I am. And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote. This is a family guy episode,
*  I guess. Uh, where some, uh, another famous high level guy told me about this experience with a
*  world champion boxer in Japan. And this guy would get insanely nervous and worked up and anxious
*  before his matches. And he hated it and hated it and hated it. And so he wanted to get rid of that
*  feeling. So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions and managed to, and he goes in and next
*  fight, he's cool as a cucumber and doesn't perform and loses. And so what I said, going back to
*  anecdote one was, uh, you know, whatever is necessary for you to get yourself in the best
*  state of being right now to compete, whatever that may be, it could be absolute stress and fear. It
*  could be anger. It could be calmness. It could be whatever, but there is a, but there is a, a,
*  there's a state at which you need to be in to do your best.
*  And use the individual. You have to find that. Can you comment on, uh, Tyson, Mike Tyson?
*  Oh yeah. That thing.
*  So first, so he, uh, there's two things I want to, so he's a, in terms of fear, there's a clip
*  there, I think from a documentary where he talks about, he is like fully afraid as he walks up to
*  the ring and as he gets closer and closer and closer, he gets more confident until he gets in.
*  He's a God or something like that. That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan,
*  that he gets aroused, uh, at the possibility of true, like I've hurting somebody in the ring.
*  So like he gets aroused at the violence. I like it cause it's coupled to your basically statement
*  that we need to own to find our own unique way of existing at our top level of performance.
*  And that perhaps is Mike Tyson, but do you think there's something more deeply universal to the,
*  the Mike Tyson speaking to the fact that he's aroused at the possibility of violence?
*  I do actually. Uh, although I don't think that it always equates to arousal for people. In fact,
*  I would say in general, it doesn't, uh, I can say I've never had a boner in the ring. In fact,
*  anything, you know, old combat cock is like, w we're not hanging around. We're leaving. We're
*  going up. We're taking off. We don't want anything to do with this. You have fun. Come back to us
*  when you have something warmer, softer, smells better. But, um, the power, the feeling of
*  aliveness. Yeah, I could see it being, you know, back to the, even the concept of the Ubermensch,
*  I feel like the States, the highest States of being I've ever been in were in the midst of
*  conflict. I felt like that was the time. Those are the, those are the moments in my life where
*  I felt like I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence. But yet even being in that
*  state was not, it was not something that you can interact with people that weren't in that state
*  with you. Like they wouldn't get it. You would almost seem, and to be that way all the time,
*  either a might drive you mad or B is you're not, you're something that's untenable to the rest of
*  society. Like you can't function with everybody else. It will not work.
*  It's just like you said with the Ubermensch, just like it's perhaps that ideal is not something you
*  can hold for long. That's the very nature of it. Yeah. Well, there was an example in the spoke
*  Zarathustra about a snake being down the person's throat and biting it and then having this maniacal
*  laughter erupting. And to me it was, at least I read it as, yeah, okay, there's this insane
*  moment that isn't forever, but that it is life and death and it is, and the overcoming it
*  is the thing that all of a sudden gives you that tapping into your highest state. This is,
*  man is a chasm, a tightrope between man and Ubermensch. Well, I don't want to leave your
*  thought about, we'll call those things flourishes to the aspect of Tyson's interpretation or his
*  expression of his feelings in combat. And so I gave this antidote to the guy and I just,
*  my first anecdote to that athlete I was working with and I said, there isn't a superior way in
*  this sense. There is the way that works for you. That may be something you can implement to other
*  people if you find that person, because we all have different personalities. And to me,
*  that's an absolute, don't come at me with all your other fucking social sciences crap. No,
*  we have distinct personalities. That personality, who you really are and this, again, Heidegger,
*  being authentic. If you're authentic with who you are, goods and bads, you will know how to
*  create what that is. And for me, violence and fighting and conflict was something that always
*  felt normal to me. And I don't mean normal in, like I grew up in a war zone or abusive household
*  or something like that. I just meant that, I was a kid who was very joyful and inquisitive
*  and spent a lot of time around older people, of all things. And also, while I don't think I have
*  much capability towards engineering, my mom said that one of the first things as like a little baby
*  when she put me in my sister's old crib, instead of my sister who just milled about and was fine
*  with it all, the first thing I did was I completely deconstructed it. I didn't break it. I figured
*  out how to pull it apart.
*  Curiousity about the world and yet that wasn't in conflict with the idea of violence?
*  No, not at all. And so being a very joyful and nice kid, but kids are kids. And if kids can find
*  that you respond maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you. And if you should stand out
*  in some way by being taller or bigger or something or caring, especially, they will agitate you.
*  They don't really fully understand it either. And so I don't hold anything against any of the kids
*  that used to pick on me or whatever, especially at the youngest ages. Like, man, they don't know
*  shit either. But once that line was pushed, for me it was, oh, well, I was being cool. Now you're
*  being uncool. Well, then that gives me license for everything. And so boom, we would just go at it.
*  Or kids that would try to initiate a fight. And I was like, okay. And being in that moment of just
*  going to town with someone else, it just felt like this is...
*  I belong here.
*  Yeah. It was never a problem for me. In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was,
*  well, not only did I learn the hard way that it doesn't matter. At the end of the day,
*  it doesn't really matter what anybody else does. If your response and violence, even to their
*  violence, if you're the winner, is often going to be penalized severely. Society, state apparatus,
*  they don't want any of that. They want to be the only arbiter of violence in the world always.
*  But I learned a very difficult lesson with that. And it was really impactful in a negative way on
*  me. But also I had to learn on an individual sense, you need to manage violence too. Because,
*  hey, if someone attacks you or starts a fight with you and you go at it, beating them up is one thing.
*  Trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street and throw it in their face,
*  maybe that's a bit much at seven. So you need to learn what level is necessary. And you need to
*  learn what comes with all... What's the responsibility of when you enact violence,
*  you take on something, when you have a responsibility for that. This is the extension
*  of your actions. But as I got older, and especially as I found sports and then combat sports,
*  now this was a place for me to flourish. And to the point where I was more myself in that space
*  than I was outside of it until time enough where I could learn to get this back together again.
*  And I never say that I'll merge the two or anything like that. No, all what happened,
*  my journey from adolescence on to manhood, a huge portion of it, besides the normal finding
*  yourself, whatever, whatever, actually what it was, was getting back to who I always was.
*  That curious kid, the kind kid.
*  Getting back to the guy that I should have been allowed to become instead of what happened
*  under the pressures of other things. Society.
*  Yeah. And the attempt for society and certain people within managerial positions to compress
*  what that was into something that they found more suitable.
*  Yeah, but those pressures allow you to discover this little world,
*  forbidden world in many ways of violence that you could explore. Through sport, you can explore it
*  and it's more socially acceptable to explore it through sport.
*  For sure. But even then there's like, at times it's socially unacceptable. So I beat Sem Schilt,
*  he cut my right eyebrow, I cut him and busted his nose and he's bleeding all over me as I have an
*  armbar on top. It's raining blood, quote some slayer, from a lacerated Sem Schilt,
*  bleeding in his horror, creating my structures. Now I shall rain in blood. But I win the fight,
*  armbar, nasty one, I get on my feet and the first thing I do is I wipe all the blood off onto my
*  hands and I lick it and I do my thing. And all the MMA journalists freaked out. Dana Wise like,
*  man, I don't know about that. We don't want him doing it. Everybody had this huge problem.
*  And then some folks would even contend, oh, you're trying to do it. Like, no, no, no,
*  this isn't planned. You don't think of these things. This is how I really feel. This is who
*  I really am. And it was even kind of comical after the fact. And BJ Pan was on the very card
*  with me watching him at some point in his career, all of a sudden win fights and then do this licking
*  the glove thing and everyone thinks it's the coolest thing ever. And I'm like, hey, fuck faces.
*  I did this in 2002 or 2001. And BJ Pan actually back then was like, dude, you're a badass,
*  you're a killer. Where did that come from? Because that seems like a deeply human moment.
*  I could say I could just be goofy about it and call it orgiastic.
*  Are we back to Mike Tyson? Yeah, but Tyson, but no, no, it's beyond that.
*  Is it a celebration of human nature? I've had some pretty decent orgasms in my life at this point. I'm
*  43. But no, none have ever compared to that. Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.
*  And I, this is where I feel like the restrictions of general existence in society are gone. And I get
*  to fully live in a state that feels more meaningful of the most meaning. I think of it as life and
*  death. And it's just, it is the way I'm built. And I don't have, I've never had any problem
*  applying violence. Like it doesn't, I don't know where it comes from or how you would define it
*  or whatever, if you want to stick me under in a psychologist chair, but like I don't,
*  there's a part of me that can just like, no, if I'm going to apply, I can apply violence to any level
*  and be okay with it. And it doesn't, I don't lose sleep. It doesn't bother me. It's not a problem.
*  It's, it was me learning how to fully understand violence, humans, and the broader perspective
*  that allowed me to think about things and like, well, what am I, what, what do I really want to
*  accomplish with my actions in the world? Just on a whole, you know, not compartmentalizing my sporting
*  career. Even when I get in the ring, I don't have any mercy generally. And if I do, it's because I
*  make a, a really deliberate attempt to be in a state where I can have mercy. If I just go in there
*  to fight with everything I got, there is zero, there's nothing, there's nothing that will hold
*  me back other than the referee. And that's that, you know, I, I know I agreed to be allowed to do
*  and not to do, but, but within that, no, and I expect it to be done to me. But in terms of values,
*  in terms of seeing what, to me, violence is, is just yet another canvas that humans can
*  paint beautifully on. Clearly. I mean, we have venerated the violent.
*  There are communists that venerate the violent on their behalf. There are national socialists
*  that venerate the violent there. And then if you remove it from an ideological perspective,
*  we venerate the violent when they're a hero. We venerate the violent in our religion. Well,
*  I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence of, of Yahweh and Sodom and Gomorrah, right? So,
*  or do we say Jehovah? I don't know. Is there, you've already mentioned one, but is there a fight
*  where you've achieved the highest of heights for your own personal being? Just when you look within
*  yourself that you're the proudest of, or maybe was your most beautiful creation? Is there something
*  that stands out? There, there are a few, actually, fighting semi-shield and a rematch. Well, the first
*  one was pretty good too. But the rematch was, I was suffering, I had suffered early prior, the week
*  prior to food poisoning. And so while my abs are looking all right, I in the ring didn't have
*  the power that I expected to. And I was struggling in ways in some of the grappling
*  with the submission stuff that I hadn't accounted for. Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion? No,
*  I mean, like just physical, I wasn't back up to a hundred percent in terms of just power output. And
*  Semi was, well, he's always seven foot tall. But this time he was, the first time I fought him,
*  he was two sixty, two fifty seven or two sixty something, something like that. This time he was
*  like two ninety. And so he was a significantly bigger cat and he was, he's a big dude. And
*  I just remember being up against the ropes with him, changing levels, trying to take him down.
*  And he's fighting, he's hipping. And I just thought in my head, there's no fucking way I'm
*  going to lose this fight. There's no way you are not going to beat me. It's not going to happen.
*  And I arm barred him the other arm. You know, the fact he's like, I really want to get you for that.
*  I want to get that match back. And you fucking got my other arm, Dick. I'm like, yeah, dude,
*  I still love you though. Yeah. You know, and that's but the whole time you're like, so this has to do
*  the dichotomy of you're feeling your worst and having to overcome. And you're literally mentally
*  telling yourself there's no way there's no fucking way I'm going to lose this fight. And then there's
*  even my last bare knuckle match and getting in the ring and fighting bare knuckle boxing
*  for the first time. And just thinking, just being in a great state and just looking so forward
*  to seeing, I mean, I called someone and I was talking to them the night before and I said,
*  yeah, well, I want, you know, I video called you because this face might not look like this
*  when I see you next. And they're just like, oh, okay. That's not just like empty trash talk.
*  That's no, that's like a clarity of mind and the seriousness of all. I go, I might die.
*  Most pretty high chance of being deformed some way. So fuck it. I don't really. Are you,
*  do you think about, are you accepting your own death? Yes. You're going to 100%. Yeah. I,
*  in fact, and that's in a strange way, that's partially what makes it so elevated in terms of
*  my sense of feeling by being able to
*  have death at my side. It feels good. And to be there and to think that
*  this could be the one, like why not? You know, I'm not a religious person at all, even though I
*  very much have to seem, seems to bang on the drum about the usefulness or understanding the
*  usefulness of religion for people. But, you know, if, if, if, if I got to do something, then yeah,
*  put me in Valhalla, man. I don't want to be anywhere else. Nothing else seems like a good
*  place for me to be. I want to, I want to fight all day long and feast all night. You know,
*  it sounds great. I saw you throw your hat into the ring of Vader. I mean, yes,
*  he got COVID, I guess. I hope he, I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good,
*  if not better. Epic with that. Did I understand correctly that might be his last fight? Yes,
*  that's my understanding. And it would be epic as hell. And it would be epic as hell because
*  the person that I want to give my most to is a person that I respect, especially at this, this
*  long, this long, this, this, this long career of mine and getting at this, this, this, this
*  twilight years, like two warriors. And that's the thing about even this going in there with the
*  aspect of being with death and all that is that when that person is in there, they are my brother
*  with me in this. And that's so when you give me your best, even if I, even if I win dominant
*  fashion, but if you show up and you're as authentic and being here as I am, then, then I love you.
*  And I'm glad for you to be here and we're in this together. And, and at this point, you know,
*  your loss or my loss or whatever is no less deserving of veneration than the wind. Like
*  we're here in this. And so to be in the ring with Fiora and to venerate him in win or defeat,
*  to be in there with, with someone like that is to me, it's so rare. So.
*  It's incredible how the ultimate violence is coupled with like love or respect. And it's like,
*  it's weird how this is how the competition in his violent form is also a
*  veneration of just the human connection. It's also the removal. I feel like it's the purest,
*  one of the purest ways, purest, honest, most honest places a person can exist. That line and
*  fight club, you don't know really who you are until you've been in a fight. I mean, believe that.
*  And I've seen so many examples of people trying to portray themselves as one thing.
*  And then in the ring, you see who they really are. Or even when they're trying to portray
*  themselves as one thing and they're winning the crowd at times, we'll see who they really are and
*  still hate them. You know, it's like, well, I said all the good things, bro, don't work that way.
*  Yeah. But speaking of Fiora, if we take you out of the picture,
*  who are the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time? I feel you out of the picture as a
*  cop out to some degree. I feel like we need a little bit more time, you know, so to see how
*  this unfolds, because you got to compare a lot of things. And I did I did I think I'm like centuries.
*  I did an interview. I don't know about centuries, but that would help if we can keep accurate
*  records and not allow too much bias to fall in too much propaganda. But I made an argument.
*  I was in an interview with an MMA outlet of some sort, and I can't recall who it was.
*  But oh, it was argument about will the winner of King of Alaska versus
*  Steve Amiochik be the greatest heavyweight of all time. And I said, fuck and no way.
*  Oh, no, it's Cormier Amiochik. That's what it was. I said, absolutely not. Not even close.
*  And I said, these guys need a bit more time to see how things go and also how things go for some
*  of their opponents. And like there's more factors than just this one fight. It really is. And I go,
*  and when you want to weigh these people, even if let's say we'll bring Alistair or Alistair
*  over him into the equation. OK, you judge him on what you know now, what he's done for you lately.
*  Which is a very myopic way of doing it. What has he done over his career? K-1 champion. He was a
*  champion in Dream. He striked for us, blah, blah, blah. His overall record, the entirety of all the
*  different opponents he's fought. And I just sit back and I go, OK, he's not the UFC champ, but
*  his accolades, his merits in some ways actually stand up higher than Cormier's and Amiochik is.
*  So what about the moments? Do you give much value to the special moments, like the highest heights
*  you rise to, not in terms of records or the strikes landed, but just creating a magical
*  moment in a fight? It doesn't have to be even a championship fight, but just, you know,
*  Conor McGregor is an example of somebody who creates a narrative, who creates a story,
*  who creates a drama, and the special magic happens, even if it's like not with-
*  Myth is greater than reality. And that is always the case. And so I understand that so very much.
*  And it takes an asshole like me to poopoo on your myth. They at least get you at the end of the day,
*  you're not going to abandon your myth, but perhaps temper it with the facts and logic.
*  So you're not a fan of myth?
*  No, I'm an absolute massive fan of myth.
*  But you prefer facts and logic.
*  It's like when I, no, I mean, I like saying facts and logic because people, I also,
*  I am not a materialist in that sense. I don't think that materialism can solve for everything.
*  It's not enough. It's not robust enough. I'm sorry. If facts and logic and or reason,
*  as the enlightenment scholars all thought, including Marx, was enough for people, then
*  we wouldn't have any religions. We wouldn't have narratives and myths and all this kind of stuff.
*  I'm sorry. There's nothing about history that supports the idea that rationality will overcome
*  all. There's something about Ben Shapiro's facts don't care about your feelings that feels to be
*  missing something fundamental about human nature. It's not clear to me exactly what is missing.
*  To give old Ben a fair shake. I don't know Ben Shapiro. I don't really listen to Ben Shapiro,
*  not against Ben Shapiro. I'm not here to say anything particularly bad about him.
*  Although I will say at one time, Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick an actual fight with Ben
*  Shapiro. In the ring? Somewhere. Yeah. And I actually responded, and I tried to get him to
*  clarify, I said, hey, are you saying that you want to fight Ben Shapiro? That you're looking
*  to actually, because I was waiting for him to say something and then I can be like, okay, well,
*  it's one thing to want to get into a fight with someone. It's another thing to go pick on a little
*  tiny guy like Ben who's much smaller than you and doesn't train or whatever. But if it's not me,
*  I can find someone your size and you can go fight him. Basically, don't be a bully piece of shit.
*  Yeah. Which by the way, Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget. You are never going to be able to
*  compete even with Ben Shapiro in an argument on any level about anything. Oh, intellectual argument.
*  Yeah, intellectual argument. Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever. But nevertheless,
*  in the discussion of greatness in fighting, I think you need to look at some of the numbers.
*  And there's the magic. There is some context also in that. Where did Alistair Overham fight?
*  Oh, we fought in Pride where you could soccer kick people and stomp their heads and this and that.
*  And so the game environment is actually different too. There's more uncertainty. There's more chaos
*  and pride. There's more. Go back a little further and go like, what about the guys that used to,
*  like Dan Severn fought bare knuckle, head butts, the whole nine. You beat Dan Severn, right? I did
*  beat Dan Severn. That was killing an idol, so to speak. Although I didn't really kill him because
*  I still love him. He's still responsible for inspiration along this whole pathway. It's
*  meeting your God and then putting a knife in it, I guess. Realizing they're human and then bringing
*  them down to your level. Exactly. But also there's a huge misconception there and that is that I could
*  bring Dan Severn down to my level, but I couldn't bring his mustache down to my level.
*  It is of mythic proportions. Greater than yours. Your facial hair is greater than yours. My facial
*  hair is creating its own legacy, but it is not Dan Severn mustache level or now Don Fry mustache.
*  So Don Fry mustache, Dan Severn mustache. Now you have like Shia versus Sunni.
*  Do you think there will be Karl Marx painting of Josh Barnett one day with the beard? Is that
*  basically what you're trying to say? I hope so. I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx.
*  Chaos has a charm to it. It does. We all thought Doc Brown in Back to the Future was quite charming.
*  You have to throw that into the calculation where they fought.
*  Yes, and the rules that they fought under. If some guy like Igor Vovchanchin won a
*  32-man tournament or something like that, I go, okay,
*  Stipe and Daniel Cormier are awesome and they will for sure be revered for their careers, 100%.
*  Can you say that they're particularly even better overall than Igor Vovchanchin?
*  Maybe one of them could have beat them. Maybe one of them wouldn't have. Maybe
*  Igor would have got them with the knuckles right away. Well, maybe if they fought him in Pride,
*  they wouldn't have won. Maybe if they fought him bare-knuckle, they wouldn't have won. I don't know.
*  And there's something about the chaos. Do you put Hoist Gracie in the top 10?
*  Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors? I don't know. I'd have to think about that. Maybe
*  not. But I put Hoist Gracie as pyramid level. Wow, dude, what an amazing man. He's so important.
*  Absolutely incredibly important. But there's something about
*  stepping into fighting another human being under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had.
*  You don't know what is going to happen and couple that with not much money. All of it.
*  The purity of it too. There's something about money, I mean, I guess shit for that capitalist
*  world, but that ruins the purity of the violence. Yeah, people given the opportunity for...
*  Yeah, well, the bigger things get, the more... I love the fact that fighting has opened up to such
*  a degree that the career business side of it, because I absolutely distinctly separate the two,
*  the business side of it has opened up to give me far more possibilities, open way more doors for
*  me than I ever intended it to. Whereas the athlete side of things has, if anything, just gotten
*  substantially worse, I would say. And some of this can be... Some of this is due to all the nature of
*  all games will be learned, will be gamed without even the rules being broken. And once that's
*  figured out, you need to make an adjustment. No adjustments have been made. So the game just
*  appears to be the same game over and over and over and over and over again on ESPN+, on whatever,
*  on whatever, on whatever. It doesn't really matter which night you watch. It's the same game
*  constantly. And that's not because the athletes are worse or better. It's because they have had
*  that game structure long enough that they figured out what do you do to be the most successful at
*  it? What is the highest percentage way of approaching it essentially, even if you're not
*  thinking of percentages? What would the... If we take a step back, it's really fascinating to think
*  about the early UFCs. Did you fight Dan Severin in the UFC? I fought him in Super Brawl. Super
*  Brawl. So those early, early days, you're undefeated. 2000.
*  What were those early days, let's say, of mixed martial arts like?
*  Let me tell you the day of high adventure.
*  Yeah, it is. It was so much fun. And it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of
*  a novel, a comic book. I mean, I would love to transcribe my experiences as what I consider a
*  second generation MMA athlete, except I'm way too sensitive to anybody's personal anythings that are
*  not even to... I'm not a gossipy person. I really do believe that small people talk about others.
*  Big people talk about ideas. But there's some stories you can't tell without telling the whole
*  story. And there are so many amazing stories that could be told. People being at their best,
*  people being at their worst. Yeah, the whole bunch of gossip. Is there something you could speak to
*  the chaos of the time? Oh, 100%. Okay, so we at AMC got connected to somebody that was throwing
*  an event in Nampa, Idaho. And we all piled into this and Matt Hume's Subaru wagon and we jammed
*  out and we left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho, only to find out that there was
*  nothing really put in place. It was absolute disrepair and chaos. They didn't have a ring.
*  They didn't have this. It was such a bullshit adventure. But we were like, well, there's hardly
*  anywhere to fight. It's tough to find these opportunities. So, okay, well, how about this?
*  Whoever is here to fight and is willing, all right, well, since there's no venue, there's no this,
*  whatever, we all got gloves, we got mouthpieces, we'll just go to the park as long as we still get
*  paid. And so folks were kind of like, I don't know about that. The guy I was going to fight was,
*  he finally figured that they finally, he finally gets information on who I actually am. And I was
*  undefeated at the time. I think I had fought Super Bowl 13 and already won that tournament. And so
*  he's like, yeah, I had no clue. I'm so glad we didn't fight. You would have murdered me.
*  What a setup. And eventually, Matt had to have a strong arm the guy and get our money that we
*  were supposed to all get and drive back. And because he his whole position was, well, there
*  ain't no fucking way we drove all the way out here for free. This is on you. You fucked this up. Not
*  my problem. But what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account. So fix it. Or me fighting my
*  first organized fight against an AMC guy on 11 days notice through a connection to an old wrestling
*  coach I had. And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts instructor that I had worked with.
*  We grappled in his apartment. We did tie pads in the park. I ran a couple miles every day. And then,
*  all right, boom, show it up. Won my fight by front choke in two minutes. And then Matt goes, OK,
*  well, hey, you did really great. We'd like you to come back and fight again in the summer. What do
*  you think? OK, go back off to university. And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn't go exactly
*  as how I wanted it to. So I got to find a way to get more experience. I would literally fight people
*  in the university rec center on the old wrestling mats as they didn't know I had a wrestling team.
*  I would find anyone doing martial arts, anyone talking about getting into street fights,
*  anyone whatever, and just basically go, oh, you ever watch UFC? Yeah, yeah, that stuff's cool.
*  What do you think? Oh, man, I'm super into it, man. That's badass. Rad. So would you want to fight?
*  I mean, it was way easier picking fights than it was, you know, getting a girlfriend.
*  Yeah, I just, you know, path least resistance. I think it might be useful for us to get some advice
*  from you. Yeah, because you've accomplished for the journey of a martial artist first. If
*  you've accomplished some of the greatest accolades there is in the sport, if somebody who's starting
*  out now or like early on in their journey, what advice would you give on how to become
*  a martial artist, catch wrestler, fighter? Well, I mean, really what it comes down to is do it
*  because you love it. Do it for that reason and that reason alone. Most people that get into this and
*  attempt to make any sort of professional inroads with it, you are not going to be the world champion.
*  You probably will never even fight for a belt and you're probably not going to net make money at this.
*  So don't do it for those reasons. Do it for the reason of the passion. Do it for the reason to be
*  the absolute best that you can be, whatever that ends up being. You might at best only be
*  mediocre, but you won't even be mediocre if you don't do it like you really mean it.
*  So the passion, look, where's the kernel of the passion? Would you say is it in the learning
*  process itself, the improvement? I think it really depends on the person, right? I mean,
*  there's some people that really love the fact of they feel like they're growing, right?
*  Will to power, you're growing, growing stronger, growing better. The idea of eliminating weakness.
*  So to which I'll quickly define weakness as things that weaken you, not like being physically weak.
*  Sure, you could call that weakness, but maybe you're not meant to be a super strong guy.
*  But choosing to be weak is really a different story other than just like we're all
*  deficient in some way or another. So that's neither here nor there. It's a matter of what
*  you decide to do with it. And that's different from strength and weakness, at least the way I
*  look at it. Like strength is choosing, regardless of the difficulty to make improvements to strength
*  is even choosing to acknowledge that you do lack and accept it and then make a decision
*  what to do with it. Yeah, but there's also, there's a bunch of stuff that just like you said,
*  it's what you're drawn to. There's an honesty to just grappling that it seems more real than
*  anything else you can do. Sure. And that's where the passion and love can come. Yeah, I mean,
*  being in an environment, hopefully that is as true as possible, would be a starter. So it's hard to be
*  a bullshit person when you're literally trying to tear each other's arms off.
*  Yeah. You really sort of see who somebody is. I also feel like you really get to see somebody who,
*  there are a couple of instances where you really see who people are on the mats and in the bedroom.
*  So even the aspect of self betterment,
*  growth along a path. I mean, hell, that's part of the device of capture for martial arts as a
*  business. Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt. Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.
*  So there's a benefit to that too. I really enjoyed the progression of belts. Sure. A bit of it is OCD
*  or whatever, but you're enjoying the recognition of your growth when you feel, when you're made to
*  feel, when I think genuinely you do earn it. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It makes complete sense to me.
*  It just, it's anything that has a goodness in its purity can also have a detriment in its perversion.
*  And there's a value to competition. I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this. I've gotten
*  the most value in giving everything I have to try to win and lose. So like I've gotten,
*  I remember most of the matches I've lost and I think that's what I've gotten the most from
*  the sport is losing. Think about it. I mean, if you really think about it,
*  um, what makes you want to actually in detail go over what happened? Oh, it's the time when you
*  didn't get what you wanted. It's a time when you gave it everything you had and you came up short
*  or failed miserably. Okay. So if you're embarrassed in some way, right. And so that's usually the only
*  time people again, calamity is the impetus for them to actually turn around and go, who the fuck am I?
*  What am I doing? And why am I doing it? Instead of naturally going, hmm, okay, well I won. Why?
*  What was it? The cause? And so I think part of my success is that when I win, I'm brutal. When I
*  lose, I'm brutal and there is no in between. So I remember losing, uh, the rematch against Noguera
*  and I still feel like it was a bullshit call. Like I feel like I won that fight, but
*  my, my opinion is that, and this even came up. So one of the coaches in the back was like,
*  Oh, you did great. You know, don't feel bad. You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I go,
*  no, fuck that. I didn't finish them. I allowed the referees to make a judge decision that I think is
*  incorrect and bad, but that came because I didn't take them out. You know, fuck that. No,
*  no, he won. He's going to get more money. He's going to get more recognition, blah, blah, blah,
*  blah, blah, blah. I accept all this and it's not okay. And I need to, if I, when I get a chance to
*  fight them again, I got to figure out how to wait to like take this guy out. I don't want to say
*  forever. I'm not trying to put them six feet underground. Well, when I fight, yes I am. But,
*  but, but the, but the point being, I need to find a way to like, this is definitive.
*  You don't get to say shit about it because I'm the only one who can stand right now.
*  That's the way it's got to be. Anything less than that is not good enough. And even if I achieve
*  that, then I got to figure out, okay, it's not a given. How did I get to this point? How did I make
*  that happen? Was it simply bent because of his own mistakes or was it because of my, my, my
*  successful action? So it was always self-critical. Always, constantly. You love movies. I read this
*  somewhere. Yeah. You mentioned Blade Runner is a favorite. Number one of all time. The, the final
*  cut. That's my go-to. So you would say, uh, Blade Runner is the greatest movie of all time. It's
*  one of the greatest movies of all time. And it is my number. What's in the top? My top five, uh,
*  Blade Runner, final cut. This is the original Blade Runner. And I used to own on tape the original
*  the adjust cut. Yeah. And, uh, and I had the director's cut on DVD. Why Blade Runner by the
*  way? What, what, as a kid, I just thought it was so cool. There was something about it that really
*  spoke to me, the whole cyberpunk landscapes and, uh, you know, this guy chasing down rogue, uh,
*  Android replicants and is it, uh, is it just the entire cyberpunk universe robots as well? No,
*  it's, it's, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it. Uh, on the, on the surface, I have, uh,
*  I've always tended towards dark subject matter. Uh, like things that are of the dark, so to speak,
*  are things that I've always been gravitated towards. I think maybe part of it is that the
*  things that are darker are more accepting and more upfront with death. And perhaps I think that
*  maybe that is what was, uh, yeah, somehow more honest perhaps. And there's also the aspect of,
*  uh, rebelliousness usually, like there was, uh, I was never one to want to just do what somebody
*  told me to do, you know, um, I'm not sitting around trying to always be such a radical individual that
*  I can't take orders. No, in fact, I'm more than willing to take orders from somebody that I feel
*  is competent and has merit and reason behind what they're doing. And it makes like, okay, yeah,
*  I'm a hundred percent for it. Not only will it kind of take orders, I will help you achieve
*  whatever it is. If I think it's worthwhile, um, even at my own expense, but, uh, to get to that
*  point is a rarity. Like it's not, not a given. And so you can even imagine like being a grade
*  school teacher and this kid doesn't respect you and he doesn't really think you're that smart.
*  Yeah. They don't really appreciate that. But, um, so cyberpunk is number one. What else?
*  So cyberpunk is kind of number one. It's a, it's an environment I love, but at the same time,
*  Conan the Barbarian by John Milius is one of my favorite films of all time. Uh, and, you know,
*  that's such a pure film in a way, like the motivations are pure. They're very easy to
*  follow, but not lacking in depth. You know, it's not, it's not just explosions and, and
*  teal and orange. It's, uh, it's, it's more on the human condition and I love it. And it's shot
*  incredibly well. It's got an incredible soundtrack. Yeah. I fucking love it. But with Blade Runner
*  also in a deeper sense, you know, again, the human condition, you know, you start seeing like,
*  what is, what is being, what is being human? Uh, you know, how does this relate to,
*  if you can make it and you can tell it what to do, at what point is it like you should or you
*  shouldn't, you know, why do you get to determine what's alive and what's not, what's a life that
*  should be allowed to live and what isn't, and what would be the strain of being Roy Batty
*  and seeing all these incredible moments that with his passing will no longer exist,
*  especially if he hasn't had a chance to put that flame into another torch, so to speak,
*  if he hasn't written them down, if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else,
*  gone like tears in the rain. Like tears in the rain. That scene is incredible. Uh, I mean,
*  but it's funny cause those two universes are very different, going into the barbarian and
*  cyber punk is there. That makes me curious about what else might be in the list.
*  Uh, well, let me think. And it's a pretty, do you like the Godfather type of universe? No,
*  no. I mean, I'm sure the Godfather, I've never actually even watched the whole Godfather.
*  No, but also like, uh, was it Casino, Goodfellas? Goodfellas is a good movie,
*  but no, that's not on my top. It's, it's a good flick. Uh, but it doesn't really do it for me.
*  Uh, I, if people really want to get into this a little more, I did make a hundred,
*  a list of a hundred, a hundred of my favorite movies on my Facebook fan page. Uh, but, uh,
*  do you remember like, oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there. Raiders of the Lost Ark.
*  Um, uh, Valhalla Rising by Nicholas from Winding Refn, uh, uh, Maniac by, uh, William Lustig. Uh,
*  it's a 1980 gnarly video nasty horror movie about a serial killer, uh, who murders women
*  and scalps them. Uh, and it's gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak and very, uh, um,
*  I mean, it's the kind of thing that like a lot of people would have a real hard time watching.
*  But, uh, one, again, I like things that are dark, but two, I thought the performances were
*  fantastic in this film and they really got out the, I think what the underlying thing was,
*  and it was, you know, it was a guy who was basically just like run amok by the overbearing
*  mother, uh, Jungian archetype. And it, she was, she imparted her insanity into him and he,
*  but yet there was this aspect you could see of him, of him wanting to try and actually be able
*  to be in the world and have love and have, uh, uh, feminine companionship to go with,
*  with his masculine aspect, but he had no way of understanding how to really make that happen.
*  And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine. So it's his struggle with,
*  it's his struggle with, and there's a little part in the, in the movie where he somehow comes across
*  this model or something and they actually, he starts to feel like maybe he might be able to
*  actually have a relationship with somebody and it goes somewhere. But, uh, yeah, even the Elijah
*  Wood remake I felt was really well done and captured most of the essence of what the movie
*  was about, but I still feel like the original by William Lustig, uh, is the best.
*  What's the greatest, uh, love movie of all time? It is love movie of all time.
*  So like something more loves, I mean, I suppose love underlies most of these movies,
*  especially, I mean, hell, Tekashi Miki's films are all about family of all things,
*  as bonkers as those movies are. They, the general theme is family almost entirely in all of his films.
*  Uh, yeah, there's, there's very, I mean, even you can argue Blade Runner. Yeah,
*  there is, it's everywhere. Is it a love film of all time? Uh,
*  that's interesting. I mean, is Excalibur a film about love? Uh, what's Excalibur about? King Arthur.
*  Excalibur is about, uh, Arthur becoming king of the Britons and his love of his, his country and
*  his love of Guinevere. But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about, um, the, the necessity for
*  the king to love, to, to hold, hold Excalibur to stay, to, to realize that while if you're the king,
*  you can love your wife and you can love your best friend and they may fuck each other behind your
*  back and as they fall in love too. But at the end of the day, your responsibility, your, your love
*  has to be to the, to the country and everyone else first and not your own personal, uh, wants,
*  which, you know, made a much more interesting story when you have, uh, Carmen Berenna and, and,
*  and, or, or, or, oh, oh, what is that one? It's, it's a German opera, but, uh, you know, and the
*  horses and slow-mo and sword fights and an epic death scene between, uh, Arthur and his, his son.
*  Okay. Now I definitely have to watch it and I haven't watched it. Embarrassed.
*  Uh, it's, uh, it is John Borman's second film in Hollywood. His first one being, uh, Point Blank
*  with Lee Marvin, which is also on top of one of the upper echelon movies on my list, uh, derived
*  from a book by called The Outfit by, uh, what is his name? Uh, I forget, but Darwin Cook, the
*  comics illustrator, he did, Donald Westlake wrote. So Darwin Cook does, does an amazing comic book
*  send up of Darwin Cook's novels and they are fucking incredible. So anyways, but, uh, the
*  Point Blank with Lee Marvin, uh, you know, it's a man driven by purpose, revenge, but also by,
*  like, really pure motivations. He wants his money. He was, he was betrayed. He, and he wants his,
*  his cash because this is what he agreed to do the thing for. And this is, which also is part of the
*  reason why I like No Country for Old Men so much, which I felt was a great movie, even better book.
*  But, uh, I remember talking to my friend and I go, you know, Anton Jigger is the most pure human
*  being in that whole book. Well, that guy's the villain. I go, ha ha, is he evil? He's the one,
*  he lies to no one. He does everything he says he will do. He always follows his word. And on the
*  rare occasion, he allows fate to make a decision as he figures like, well, whatever all led us to here
*  will lead us one way or the other. And if we're at this crossroads, what,
*  how is there any better or worse way than to do it over a coin flip? And so that whole scene where
*  the guy is going, well, what am I putting up? And he goes, everything, you've been putting it up every
*  day of your life. And that's true. Everything we do is a, is a, is a decision, is a calling, is a,
*  is a choice. And it's, and then it bummed me out that they, they reduced the last interaction
*  between Jigger and what's his face is life. And he finally finds her and she's like, you don't
*  have to do this. I mean, she's, he's like, yes, yes, I do. This is the way it is. You can think
*  that your life could have turned out any sort of ways. You could have done this, you kind of that,
*  but the reality is this is the way your life is. And it's the way it was always going to be,
*  you know, the fact that I'm here is the end of it. And that's that.
*  Yeah, it's, it's funny if you're honest, this will dark movies reveal that the villains are
*  the, the purest of humans and can teach us the most like profound lessons. And that's,
*  that's certainly an example of it. What do you think the big ridiculous last philosophical
*  question, what do you think is the, the meaning of this whole thing we've got going on of life
*  and existence on earth from your individual perspective, but the entirety of the human
*  species life, the universe and everything. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't.
*  We could just leave it at that.
*  You knew exactly where I was going. I love it.
*  Josh, I love you very much. You've been a huge inspiration.
*  I have a friend who she said, do you know Lex Friedman? Have you gone on Lex's con? I go,
*  yes, I know. I know. Lex Friedman is, I've sadly been way too long in contact without
*  making it happen for too long. And, and yes, I will a hundred percent. I even cut a shirt
*  at the beginning of the pandemic to make my own little mask at one point due to the Lex process.
*  And I love it. I can't really hear you like, but I'm demonstrating
*  just let's see it through. But no, this has been a blast. And next time,
*  next time let's drink some of the war, bring a whiskey.
*  I will bring some warmaster. I wasn't sure if you were, if you imbibed at all in spirits,
*  100%. It felt a little weird to do it early on in the morning, especially cause I'm flying.
*  I mean, I've had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.
*  It, it, uh, now that you've mentioned it, it doesn't at all. So next time, let's make sure
*  what Jorgen calls the, uh, adult beverages. Let's, uh, make sure we indulge.
*  I have zero reservations for doing such a thing. I'm into it.
*  Josh, thanks for talking to me. My pleasure.
