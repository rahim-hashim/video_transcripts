# Andrew Callaghan: Channel 5, Gonzo, QAnon, O-Block, Politics & Alex Jones | Lex Fridman Podcast #425
**Lex Fridman:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEou104m_P0)
*  there's two people in the back two of her homegirls wearing like shy steve masks i'm like
*  what are we doing what where are we going and she goes we're gonna go film the riot we're going to
*  lake street and so we drive down there kmart is burning target is burning everything is on fire
*  she has the sony a7 she gives me a microphone and she's like go talk to that guy and that was a guy
*  with a molotov cocktail on his hand who had just burned kmart down and so i go what should i ask him
*  she goes what's on your mind so i walk up to him i'm like what's on your mind
*  the following is a conversation with andrew callaghan host of channel five on youtube where
*  he does gonzo style interviews with fascinating humans at the edges of society the so-called
*  vagrants vagabonds runaways outlaws from qanon adherence to fish heads to o block residence
*  and much more he created the documentary that i highly recommend called this place rules on the
*  undercurrents that led to the january 6th capital riots this is the last human podcast to support
*  it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's andrew callaghan
*  i tried to color match you though got the black and white going i went to walmart before this and
*  got the wrangler shirt with the texas longhorns tee is that where you shop walmart generally yeah
*  i'm a target man myself there's no way you get those suits from target so you're saying it's
*  a nice way to complement a suit i think you go men's warehouse if not further i think you would be
*  wrong you go further no the other direction you got that from target not target i was joking about
*  target i like walmart better it just felt like a funny thing to say no it was funny the most
*  expensive thing i own is this watch and it was given given to me as a gift yeah when i was on
*  tour i had these 2700 cartier glasses that i got for a lot of money 2700 dollars uh like sunglasses
*  yeah but they're really embarrassing but i was on tour so i just felt like i could do anything as
*  far as fashion choices but looking looking back at pictures from myself in that era i'm like god
*  so that was the symbol of of the fame got to your head i think so yeah i think fame getting to your
*  head if you spend more than 100 bucks on sunglasses you've officially gone off the deep you've crossed
*  the line totally and that's where you go back to walmart to humble yourself i really love walmart
*  in fact i moved to austin because i was at walmart and a lady said that i look handsome in a suit
*  and i was like that's it i love this place she just said it for no reason whatsoever this older
*  lady just kind of looked at me and with this like genuine sweetness just said oh you look handsome
*  she's she's not wrong man thank you that's part of your whole swag though yeah the suit thing yep
*  anyway uh what was the first if you remember first recorded interview you did well like my
*  first grade teacher mrs claudia we uh this is back in the day like i was telling you we just asked
*  her about her life in columbia and stuff like that but i didn't really get into actual journalism
*  until my ninth grade year i had no idea i had an interest in it before then i wanted to be a rapper
*  it's all about hip hop and meditation and uh picking psilocybin mushrooms in public parks
*  and stuff like that that's what i was into that's a lot so cyber meditation rap public parks yeah i
*  was making like conscious rap music like i was to the point where i had like four dream catchers
*  hanging above my bed alex gray painting on the wall tapestry on the ceiling just scribbling rhymes
*  down all the time so you said somewhere that you sucked at school okay well let me let's step back
*  a little bit so i had this amazing journalism course in ninth grade i went to an alternative
*  high school and the teacher was named calvin shaw and he was just like i ended up taking his class
*  all four years and he used to let me actually leave school like i didn't like going to school
*  so he'd let me basically go around seattle and do different interviews with people as long as i could
*  come back by the end of the day and write a story for his class and he'd mark me as president so the
*  first article that i wrote was about the the silk road and the deep web because you know yeah as a
*  ninth grader when i discovered the hidden wiki i thought that i was like really tapping into like
*  the the most secret society elite level black market in the world and so if you remember they
*  had that hidden wiki link that was like hire a hitman you know and so i i messaged them and i was
*  like all right you know i want to get someone killed at my school like how much is it going to
*  cost me and i published my interview with the hidden wiki hitman it was probably a fed or
*  something but who knows and that my first article was called like inside the deep web a conversation
*  with a hitman that's nice yeah i mean you're fearless even then i mean i was hiding behind a
*  tor browser so there's not much fear to be had also was anonymous it was anonymous but i did
*  publish it under my name so you're right i could have been could have been in danger i also saw
*  that he said he took too many shrooms when you were young and that led you to have hallucinogen
*  persisting perception disorder hp pd can you explain what this is well that condition is
*  classified by persistent visual snow floaters morphing objects like i see them right now i see
*  them all the time this the snow is in the room the snow is definitely in the room it's all over you
*  and uh basically it wasn't that i took too many shrooms i think that it was i took i took about
*  an eighth of uh semi-essence mushrooms which are the ones that come from the earth instead of cow
*  shit and i took a an eighth of those at my friend toby's house and which is a normal amount but i
*  was in eighth grade so i woke up the next morning with these extreme you know visual distortions
*  and i thought that it would go away i tried to make it go away but there was there's really no
*  cure for hp pd it's a lifelong condition so it's just a matter of dealing with it and realizing
*  that it is only visual so when people ask me hey i have hp pd how do i cope with it i say remember
*  that every other sense that you have what you can hear what you can taste you know your feet on the
*  ground you're still on earth you're still here well he said it's only visual and yes gratitude
*  for being alive at all it's great but you said that this led you into some dark psychological
*  places like depersonalization disorder yeah depersonalization is the feeling that
*  you are not real but that reality still exists derealization is the idea that reality itself
*  is an illusion created by your mind and that you're the only person alive and that everything that
*  your brain is projecting to your visual cortex is a lie and that you're the only living human being
*  both are pretty intense hp pd creates both of those things and so when i've talked to people
*  who have the condition it's really either or but more than 70 percent of people with hp pd fall
*  into either category they're both coping mechanisms for the like i don't know what really happens i
*  talked to a researcher once named dr abraham he lives in upstate new york he's the leading
*  scientist when it comes to hp pd research he's the only one who actually seems to care about
*  finding a cure and the only known treatment right now is alcohol and benzodiafenes that's not good
*  right so alcoholism something that came into my life pretty early alcohol abuse as a result of
*  that experience because that helps with the visual symptoms make some of the static go away man never
*  tried benzos though so which so can you explain to me why in that spectrum you are like so do you
*  sometimes have a sense that you're not real sometimes something else is not real like the
*  reality is not real yeah i experienced it all the time you know but like i said my job helps with
*  that because i get to feel like um you know when you seek out extremes to a certain extent and you
*  put yourself on the front lines of intense events whether it be politically or socially or just dive
*  into deep fringe subcultures you get this feeling that you're real and being filmed is also
*  confirmation if you can look at the mp4 file that you're in fact living here on earth confirming
*  yeah that you were in it with the reality by watching yourself on video exactly so there is
*  that basically the engine behind all the extreme interviews you've done well i got hp pd around
*  the same time that i began this journalism course in ninth grade so i sort of always used journalism
*  as a therapeutic mechanism to deal with some of these symptoms especially depersonalization
*  there's some pretty good illustrations of what it feels like kind of feels like you're trapped
*  behind your eyes or that you're just this like nebulous soul that's trapped in a flesh suit that
*  you're not really a part of you're sort of puppeteering a flesh and bone skin suit trapped
*  or just the ability to step outside of yourself you feel like your soul is not something that is
*  connected to your body it's something living in your head it's really hard to explain to people
*  who haven't gone through derealization or depersonalization but if you go on support
*  groups they always say like how do i break free from behind my eyes like dark stuff like that
*  also you're trapped i mean there's a higher state of being through meditation that you can kind of
*  step outside of yourself but this is not that unfortunately it was kind of the meditative path
*  or you know the eastern path that i took and kind of fused that with psychedelic culture in seattle
*  that took me down the psychedelic use rabbit hole in the first place so like i'd say it all started
*  with siddhartha siddhartha that's a good book have you done shroom since then no i don't really
*  do psychedelic drugs but like a lot of people think that i'm against them which i'm not just
*  doesn't work for me if it works for you i'm sure that can be really fun especially i know there's
*  lots of like therapeutic uses for acid and ketamine and psilocybin but i personally abstain from those
*  kind of anything psychotropic i try to stay away from drinking a bit well yeah i mean i didn't
*  drink at all before i had the hppd stuff and i would have drank later in life but definitely like
*  14 15 every day after school i drink a 40 ounce of mickeys it's like a kind of looks like old
*  english but the bottle's green and it has a hornet on the side of it just kind of became a ritual
*  just to deal with the anxiety of of that situation and it made the the snow go away yeah alcohol
*  really works to suppress hppd symptoms so you said you hated classes in school except that
*  journalism class okay we need to clear this up because on my wikipedia page for some reason for
*  andrew callahan early life it says andrew hated every single class except for one yeah so i've
*  had a bunch of teachers who are super cool like this guy tim my astronomy professor in ninth grade
*  mrs zanetti my creative writing teacher in sixth grade and this really cool dude at my college in
*  new orleans named charles cannon who taught me a class called new orleans mythology my three
*  favorite classes besides my journalism class and they all hit they all hit me up and they're like
*  hey man saw you said you hated every class except sorry i couldn't be everything that you wanted
*  me to be yeah and so i just want to say shout out to all those teachers i didn't hate every class
*  the point that i was making is that being forced into the institution of school so young and having
*  to take common core classes like biology dissecting frogs history of the han dynasty stuff like that
*  that i didn't want to learn but i had to learn multiple times i mean i learned about the dynastic
*  cycle in ancient china three separate times at three different schools and i was like who is
*  writing this curriculum and why is it so important that i understand this process yeah the part that
*  makes school difficult especially in college is that you have people just go into school just to
*  get the degree who don't really know exactly what they're interested in and they don't even have
*  time to figure that out because they're in a business program or a communications program
*  with no specific interest well i think if you want to do school right take on every single subject
*  that you're forced into it's like the david foster wallace just be unborable by it just really go in
*  as if ancient chinese dynasties are the most interesting thing you could possibly learn and
*  it is somewhat interesting the silk road and the great wall and terracotta the soldiers and stuff
*  but i'm just saying like when i got to college i signed up for journalism school right and i
*  didn't get to take a media class until the second semester and you know i had to take everything
*  prior to that and i'd already spent so much time i just think the excruciating boredom of schooling
*  left a bad taste in my mouth but there was individual classes that i liked a lot yeah there
*  should be some choice or maybe a lot of choice even at the level of high school for what what kind of
*  classes you pursue yeah for sure and uh you're also saying so wikipedia is not always perfectly
*  right no but it's just interesting because like i've said so much in podcasts but that's what they
*  isolated and i've gotten that question before which i understand it's the first thing on my
*  wikipedia page but it makes me sound like a super hater have you ever seen this instagram page
*  called depths of wikipedia that's great oh it's so good dude uh you said you love journalism what
*  did you love about journalism i mean what hooked you on a basic level everybody wants media coverage
*  right everyone likes to be on camera and get exposure for whatever they're doing and so being
*  a journalist and being a almost like a portal for exposure for people allows you to be on the front
*  row of everything that you want to to be a part of you get to be in the front row for history as
*  as it's unfolding because everyone wants to be covered so being a journalist gives you a ticket
*  to everywhere that you want to go in life and so it allows you to step into different realities
*  almost and then go back to yours and it just keeps life interesting buy the ticket take the ride
*  hunter s thompson is he up there in there as one of the influences who are your influences i think
*  the early daily show was so good um sasha barron cohen huge influence i mean that was like the
*  lg show especially i think louis theroux's broadcasts on bbc were great um i was really
*  into hunter s thompson too but not really until college you know i really like a particular
*  hunter s thompson book called the great shark hunt where he covers the ruben salazar murder by
*  la pd or la sheriff's department in in the in boil heights in the in the 70s and his his
*  relationship with his lawyer oscar acosta and that whole saga is great fear and loathing i like but
*  not as much as his straightforward reporting because there's the gonzo side of hunter where
*  he's like saying he's taking drugs and seeing shit and there's the other side of him which is
*  like an actual reporter interested in telling a story that's has news value so it's two different
*  lanes for him there is something about you that makes people want to say you're the hunter s
*  thompson of this generation and i don't think they mean the drugs i think they mean some kind
*  of non-standard willingness to explore the extremes of humanity and like almost a celebration of the
*  extremes of humanity yeah well that's a very kind comparison i'll get there one day maybe i just
*  went to aspen on a little hunter s thompson recon trip to go check out the woody creek tavern which
*  is the spot that he was like his bar near his cabin and it was pretty cool to see unfortunately
*  it's kind of turned into not not a dive bar now but it's a sit down sort of country restaurant
*  but it was cool but i expected to see a bunch of gnarly hunter s thompson types uh what's he
*  doing drugs i mean drugs and alcohol is all part of it somehow yeah and so it opens a gateway to
*  a deeper understanding of humanity but i will say though like as someone now who doesn't party like
*  i did when i was younger it's not as important as i thought it was you know yeah i'm uh conflicted
*  on this i'm good friends with a lot of people that say alcohol is really bad for you and i believe
*  that too but there's something that i'm just as an introvert as a person who has a lot of anxiety
*  for me alcohol has opened doors of like just opening myself up to the world more oh i'm actually
*  a fan of of alcohol moderate drinking but i'm saying like my life before i would say 2019 2018
*  especially there was the chaos on camera but then there was my private life which was like
*  chaotic partying all the time oh i see and i i convinced myself much like hunter did that that
*  was the secret sauce that in the core the spiritual in my spiritual core that gave me the creativity
*  but then i cut out a lot of that stuff and i'm just as creative and it's interesting that a lot
*  of i think one of the hardest parts about addiction is that if you're a functioning
*  highly creative addict of any kind your your brain and your addictive part of your brain
*  convinces yourself that it's all part of the cross purpose and it has this like symbiotic
*  you know inspirational thing going on but it's not it's not true it can be but it's typically not
*  yeah it's not uh it's not a requirement right you can sometimes channel you can sometimes leverage
*  all those things for your creativity but the creative engine it lives outside of that like
*  have you read the hunter's uh daily routine in the year up to his death it was like 15 grapefruits
*  and eight ball of coke and like just like a certain amount of shotgun shells for him to fire into the
*  sky every morning yeah there's no way and he didn't do anything creative in those in those
*  final years yeah but so the creativity goes away and gradually you just become like a party animal
*  like andy dick a caricature of yourself yeah i mean that's why life is interesting you make
*  all kinds of choices and sometimes you can have uh create works of genius in a short amount of time
*  based on drugs and no drugs einstein had that miracle year where he published several incredible
*  papers in one year 1905 did he do drugs before that lots of coke and i was like i believed you
*  for a second i'm like did einstein have blow i don't think he did how do you think he gets
*  that hair come on it's true i'm just asking questions high confidence hair look into it yeah
*  you know what i mean uh yeah well no he's a well put together uh sexy young man the hair came later
*  yeah was albert einstein attractive as a teenager that's not teenager was he attractive as a young
*  man uh sexually attractive i don't i mean i'm turned on by einstein at all ages i don't
*  discriminate but are you more turned on by the work that he did or his physical being uh no
*  sometimes i fantasize what it would be like to be in the in the arms of einstein i could even get
*  that out yeah uh in the arms of einstein yeah just just i want to feel safe it's a good idea
*  for a rom-com to be a little more serious like general relativity that space time can be unified
*  and curved by gravity is an incredibly wild and difficult idea to come up with like it's a really
*  difficult thing to imagine given how well uh newtonian classical mechanics physics works
*  for predicting how stuff happens on earth to think like like like the that gravity can get more
*  space time both space and time is and it permeates the entire universe it's a field it's a really
*  wild idea to come up as one human on earth to intuit that is really really really difficult
*  and it's really sad uh to me that he didn't get a noble prize for that was it was there people
*  saying he was crazy when he was around or was it was he universally recognized it's like an
*  ojeevus no i think once the papers came out he was widely recognized as a true genius but before that
*  he wasn't recognized he had a really difficult so back now where does a black hole go like after
*  something gets sucked into it you mean is it a portal to another place that kind of thing
*  yeah no i well we don't we don't know it could be like it could be uh that the universe is kind
*  of like swiss cheese full of black holes there's something called hawking radiation where the
*  because of quantum mechanics the information leaks out of a black hole so it is possible to escape a
*  black hole there's a lot of interesting questions there i hope we get to the bottom of that and
*  there's a super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy which doesn't seem to scare physicists
*  but it terrifies me oh yeah for sure astronomy can be terrifying yeah we're all like uh orbiting
*  i mean we're not just opening the sun but the sun is part of the solar system is part of the galaxy
*  and it's all orbiting a gigantic black hole have you ever spoke to someone who's been in outer space
*  jeff bezels he flew his own rocket wow that's pretty cool astronaut that's been to deep space
*  no well maybe i've spoken to an alien that just hasn't admitted it i want to do a research paper
*  like a report about space madness you know it's supposed to be this like torturous feeling that
*  you get when you look away from earth and into the abyss after you've exited earth's orbit or
*  whatever um because there's one specific psychiatrist who knows how to deal with space madness and i
*  want to figure out how interview people with it is this a real thing like is there a wikipedia
*  article on it yes look up space madness treatment well now i don't trust wikipedia after what you
*  told me so i know they think i hate classes i thought you meant more about the fact that
*  you're isolated out in space that we need social connection and it's difficult yeah i think it's
*  just a feeling of extreme and insignificance that you might get sometimes when you look at the night
*  sky but it's that times a thousand it's like an existential void that's created after looking into
*  the abyss and then realizing how small earth is in the grand scheme you just start to really
*  have a strange new perception about the the pointlessness of existence i don't need to go
*  to space for that i mean only a handful of people have been to space but i'm sure they're all pretty
*  well off so this psychiatrist has to be like in the multi-millions well technically we're all in
*  space because earth is in space but so um i wonder if you have to go to space to talk to the psychiatrist
*  probably so well technically we're all in space so right can't that's a boundary he can't have
*  but not everyone believes that as you've seen from my my work probably you're right and that's those
*  are important people they're asking important questions yeah um you hitchhiked across u.s.
*  for 70 days when you were 19 right tell the story of that well this sort of connects to what i was
*  talking about with the boredom of school and these common core classes so after my first year of
*  school where i lived in the dorms like a like a old school dormitory building at a school in new
*  orleans called loyola university i wanted to i wanted to just do something i felt so bored i was
*  working for the school newspaper for the for that whole first year it was called the maroon and i
*  didn't have the ability to write my own stories like i had to defer to an older editor and they
*  would give me stories to write about and they were all about like on-campus happenings like the pope
*  visits new orleans or glass recycling to be restored in the french quarter or hoverboards
*  banned on campus due to safety concerns and it just kind of felt like all right i kind of wanted to be
*  a gonzo reporter i'm not sure if working my way up through the traditional newsroom hierarchy is
*  going to get me to that point so i started reading a bunch of old hobo literature you know like post
*  world war ii vagabonding stuff and there was this book called vagabonding in america by an old hobo
*  ed burn and i read this and it just basically obviously some of it was outdated they had stuff
*  in there like the hobo code like oh this moniker on the side of a fence means this person has free
*  soup or something like that they didn't have stuff like that but what it did tell me it told me about
*  train stop towns like dunsmear and you know places in montana where there was a friendly
*  attitude toward drifters and that still persists from the 60s and 70s to this day even though in
*  my opinion movies like texas chainsaw massacre have ruined hitchhiking culture in america because
*  now everyone thinks you're gonna you know decapitate them if they pick you up so after my final day of
*  courses at loyola i literally left all of my belongings inside my dorm and took the street
*  car to the greyhound station got a one-way ticket to baton rouge and i was like i'm gonna
*  hitchhike across the whole country back to seattle with no money and now that was that was the plan
*  and it worked out i love it i traveled across the united states before in similar kind of plan
*  because you were you on the silver dog so it's the greyhound bus greyhound is pretty nice that's a
*  step above hitchhiking yeah that's way better than hitchhiking greyhound amtrak amtrak no that's the
*  leadest what's in between greyhound and amtrak a car that's what it is yeah it's a car yeah a car a
*  shitty car okay cool yeah i lived in a shitty car you lived in a car yeah when i was uh driving
*  across the united states solo uh with a friend some some solo and i would uh have i would eat
*  cold soup i love cold soup what i like is the cold uh chickpeas in a can you get the water out and
*  just dump them in your mouth yeah those are good beef jerky kind bars kind bars are really good
*  for the road yeah i mean all of that is great but too much of it is not great like too much cold soup
*  not great too much beef jerky so what was the route you took was it chicago across or was it
*  philadelphia across philadelphia across to la or where uh san diego's window but it was a zigzag
*  and went up to chicago and then all the way down to texas so you went philly through appalachia up
*  to the midwest yeah did you cut over like through the southwest down to san diego no no i went
*  straight down to texas all the way down okay west so like but did you cut from texas west through
*  new mexico and arizona to get to the city yeah that is the best road trip place interstate 40
*  like albuquerque flagstaff vegas kingman the mojave desert yuma doesn't get better yeah i mean
*  and your kids so you don't care and you were throwing caution to the wind i met some crazy
*  crazy people it gives me some sanity like whenever i'm feeling kind of out of control or you know
*  like bummed out i just remembered that the road is still out there the open road never goes anywhere
*  and it's kind of like a i see like an invisible door in the corner of the room all the time that
*  makes me more comfortable because i'm like hey at the end of the day if i'm bummed out i can go hit
*  the road and i'm sure there's going to be a fun time ahead yeah get that gray hon ticket and go
*  i would say silver dog half because sometimes i gotta ride the dog when i'm when no one will
*  pick me up there's some places in the country where no one's going to pick you up yeah kansas
*  missouri they're not going to do it you're not charming enough you thought about that i was 19
*  fresh clean shaven yeah i was pretty charming that's right but the older you get the harder it is
*  to hitchhike because they think you're like an escaped convict or some type of like psycho wanderer
*  and some of these people are like what we call punishers people who never stop talking
*  and so they see someone hitchhiking and they're like yes i'm gonna talk at this person yeah and
*  you can tell their eyes are wide they're like what's up and you're like oh shit so it's six hours of
*  just like oh cool nice yeah that's rough yeah yeah you're right you're right i like people that are
*  comfortable in silence yeah but then that also raises the question are they about to kill me
*  you know what i mean i think that's a you problem not a you know what's funny is almost everybody who
*  picked me up when i was hitchhiking it was like a like a day laborer like it was almost all mexican
*  day laborers who picked me up oh interesting because i think that like in some places down there
*  that's a typical thing to do hitchhike to work a lot of people don't have cars but they still have
*  to get to their jobs so a lot of people ask me hey where should i drop you off where's your job at
*  and i'm like my job is to explore and they were they were down with it see like for me it was
*  really easy because he'd just say like i'm traveling across the united states and i think
*  people love that idea and they want to help they they romanticist because they also have that
*  invisible door everybody has that invisible door i just want to go so you know what i'm talking about
*  yeah i mean i don't think it can anchor you a bit just to remind you that every pattern that i've
*  fallen into is voluntary and it's for my own stability and mental health well that's why i'm
*  like renting everything and i'm making sure like tomorrow i could just go i gave away everything i
*  own twice in my life just very like i'm ready to go tonight let's go what's the hardest item
*  you've had to part with in this experience there's nothing you've never had a material object that
*  was really hard to let go of so you give that watch to somebody if it meant no this you're right
*  you're right that's probably the only i've never had to let go of that though yeah that's the only
*  thing i own this it means a lot to me but everything else but then again listen because uh okay this
*  watch is giving to me by rogan um has become a close friend but like whenever i romanticize the
*  notion that this watch means a lot to me it's like don't worry about it i'll just get you the same
*  one again yeah it's a pretty sick sick ass gift though yeah it's pretty pretty sick i'm not usually
*  a gift guy but you know um when when somebody you you look up to kind of gives you a thing it's a
*  nice little symbol of uh yeah of that relationship so it's nice but other than that no but even this
*  like whatever the relationship is what matters the human is what matters not that i agree 100
*  you had something like this not really i mean there was a hard drive that i lost that had all
*  of my like childhood pictures on it and stuff like that that i think about all the time because i
*  left it on a train and like the certain memories you think about it you just get pissed off and
*  just think to myself someone has that somewhere i have dreams about reuniting with the hard drive
*  you and uh hunter biden have the similar kind of i don't think he wants to reunite with that one
*  okay dude it's crazy like you know all he did was smoke crack right or was there more stuff going on
*  and i think there's prostitutes involved oh okay whatever i think you gotta look into it i think
*  i have to look into it too um was carowak jack carowak and somebody that was an inspiration at
*  all in this road trip did you even know who that is the b generation i didn't know who it was and
*  then after i did the ultimately i wrote a book about my hitchhiking experience years later
*  and everyone was like have you read on the road and then on the road i probably heard the title
*  of that book every day at least 10 times for two years and um i'm sure carowak is a great guy
*  i mean i just don't i'm not too familiar with the beat generation it's a great book it's uh
*  you read it or no i refuse to read it people even have gifted it to me been like hey man you're
*  gonna love this one and i'm like is that on the road if i honestly people have given me a book
*  with wrapping paper on it and they're like this is right at the rally i was like that's fucking on
*  the road isn't it give you a different cover yeah no i'm like anything but that but i'm sure it's
*  a great book it's just the comparison thing drives me crazy but respect big respect to carowak
*  would never speak down on the whole anyone in the beat generation what are some interesting
*  moments you remember from that those 70 days man there was so much i mean getting mistaken
*  for a gay prostitute on my first hitchhiking ride in louisiana was pretty funny where did you
*  come from and where did you go well i mean the the journey began in baton rouge and the first
*  destination was houston which is about four and a half hours west um on interstate 10 so i'm in
*  crowley louisiana i'm on the side of the road and i guess this was a cruising truck stop it was known
*  for being a place where male lot lizards would go to procure clients and i was there lot lizards
*  it's a derogatory term in trucker culture for a prostitute who hangs out at the loves or
*  pilot flying j large interstate truck stops now trucker culture as it once was is pretty much
*  finished because of the live stream cameras they have inside of the trucks now so you can't snort
*  suit a fed or pick up anybody you can't even pick up a hitchhiker or you get fired killed all the
*  romance yeah definitely the truck that the old school outlaw trucker lifestyle unless you're an
*  owner operator who's not even in a union which is like a real cowboy way to haul loads you can't do
*  that you were mistaken for a lot lizard mistaken for a lot lizard by a small man from honduras
*  with a spiky leather jacket covered in studs nice didn't speak any english but you know i thought
*  he was just you know a nice guy and then he pulled over at a there's private theaters in the south
*  where they have confessional booths set up and they have three channels and people go in there
*  and you know porn yeah people go in there and you know please themselves yeah yeah so i thought he
*  was taking me to one of the to one of those i was like all right cool man yeah like you know if this
*  guy wants to go jerk off i'm just gonna wait in the car it's all good i don't discriminate but then
*  um i was like he buys a booth for me and i'm like okay you know not really in the mood to watch
*  porn with this random guy so he gets in the same booth as me and he starts jerking off right next
*  to me and i'm like oh man like i don't think this is chill i'm like dude can you stop he stopped
*  jacking off and he's like what do you mean like i thought this is what you want to do like i have
*  money for you like what's up and i was like oh no i'm just a regular guy he was super cool about it
*  he started laughing he's like oh my bad man i thought you were you know selling something i
*  said no and he said oh it's all good and he gave me a ride all the way to houston that's great yeah
*  we talked about anything except that for the rest of the car ride it's great he was just rolled with
*  it oh sorry about that it could have been i had about a foot and a half on this guy so i wasn't
*  too scared i also had like a knife in my pocket but i didn't want to stab him especially not at a
*  place like that and you were still that that didn't like leave a bad taste in your mouth well i
*  figured that can't happen again it can't keep happening so i was like all right if i got this
*  out of the way the first ride the following rides are going to be spectacular yeah i mean
*  who among us have not been mistaken for a lot lizard it's a fact you heard it here first
*  what else what what some interesting beautiful people that you've met well i used the app uh
*  couch surfing to find places to stay now you can only submit like five couch surfing requests a day
*  unless you're a premium member which means you also host people couch surfing still around yeah
*  yeah totally oh but it's evolved obviously into a different thing airbnb is the kind of competitor
*  to that right couch surfing is free though right so couch surfing they call it like the cs community
*  so basically there'd be these like couch surfing super hosts in different cities like there was
*  one in santa fe this firefighter dude who had like 15 other couch surfers there chilling nice so i
*  would do it everywhere a lot of them were um catholics you know so it was their way of giving
*  back a lot of them were nudists and so i didn't realize that there's a small little section at
*  the bottom of someone's couch surfing profile that says clothing optional yes and that means
*  if you go there i thought it meant like it's cool if you walk to the bathroom in your underwear
*  no if you go there everyone's going to be butt naked so i made that mistake a few times not that
*  i'm anti nudist but i didn't want to you know i wasn't ready to take that leap of faith and uh
*  yeah it was just great couch surfing hosts were amazing yeah that was just great it was this
*  constant thing where i felt like wow people are so welcoming i'm not having to pay them a dollar
*  for this experience yeah i love couch surfing for like again for me being an introvert just
*  crashing on a person's couch being essentially forced into a great conversation is great yeah
*  the one thing that gets exhausting about hitchhiking is constantly thanking people
*  you know being in like sort of constant superficial gratitude everywhere all the time like oh thanks
*  for let me sleep on your couch thanks for the food yeah part of the reason i wanted to live in an rv
*  later in life is to avoid having to constantly live in this like thanks so much type of frequency
*  because it's exhausting to constantly hey man thanks i think the shallowness of that interaction
*  is exhausting not just the not not thanks yeah it was a true favor of course i love giving people
*  gratitude for that but just this thing where everyone who picks you up is you know you get
*  eight rides a day you're like thanking eight people a day like they're you know the second
*  coming of jesus you start to feel a little bit debased what'd you learn about people from that
*  from that journey that's your first time really kind of going into it the the american public is
*  just so kind overall i mean they're so like embracing depending on who you are and specifically
*  though the christian family people of the u.s. who drive in minivans and have that that fish
*  sticker on the back where it's like jesus fish and then they have the family sticker you know
*  where each member of the family is a stick figure those people never picked me up and would flip me
*  off with their whole family sometimes they would throw full dr peppers at me as a family while i
*  stood on the side of the road as a family together they'd yell shit like go to hell hippie when i was
*  on the side of the road and so it's weird that the most charitable christian american family
*  values people never gave me any charity or even conversation they were antagonizing me and saw me
*  as like a hippie left over from the 60s who needed to go to work go to vietnam i don't get it yeah but
*  the people who really extended a hand to me is people on the margins yeah people working on
*  seasonal visas people whose cars have you know less than a quarter tank left people struggling
*  with addiction who saw me struggling or at least they thought that i was because they assumed i was
*  hitchhiking not out of adventure but because i had no car and were willing to sacrifice their day
*  almost sometimes to take me exactly where i needed to go that's beautiful man i've had similar kind
*  of experience that people were struggling the most of the ones who are willing to help you when you're
*  struggling yeah there's people like in religious contexts and other kind of communities that just
*  judge others because they've kind of constructed a value system where they're better than others
*  because of that value system and that that actually has a cascade that forces you to actually be kind
*  of a dick yeah i never thought about that way it's so true do you think about like morality and
*  religion a lot yeah yeah yeah i've been to certain parts of the world where religion is really a big
*  part of life i'm just uh always skeptical about tribes of people that believe a thing and they
*  believe they're better than others because they believe that thing that could be nations that could
*  be religions yeah i mean in ukraine and in russia i've seen a lot of hate towards the other yeah and
*  that that hate i'm always very skeptical of because it could be used by powerful people
*  to direct that hate uh just so the powerful people can maintain power and get money this kind of stuff
*  it's a scary thing to see how easy it is for high up political people to mobilize the hate of just
*  the average working person and can almost convince them to sabotage their own countrymen
*  who they share more in common with than the politician they look up to just to advance
*  the agenda of one party that's what we're seeing now are there some places in america that are
*  better than others can you can you speak negatively of uh like uh aforementioned joe rogan talk shit
*  about connecticut non-stop is there can you pick a region in the united states you can talk shit
*  about to talk shit about oh for sure i mean or from that experience let's just narrow it down to that
*  oh colorado oh jeez really yes i know so many people that love color dude dallas denver
*  i used to think phoenix sucks but i love phoenix now the way they build these cities to just be so
*  circular and massive it's just like stopping you don't like circles i like grids man oh you're a
*  grid guy manhattan new orleans san francisco what is it about grids that bring out the worst in people
*  circles is where everyone just there's a everyone's just vibing out yeah
*  goosies but the grid gets people locked in hateful i don't know man but i've never heard anyone talk
*  shit about colorado i have to say it's kind of refreshing yeah it provides a necessary balance
*  for the colorado wikipedia page yeah oregon too i got problems with oregon oregon yeah well here's
*  the issue you have and i don't like just calling people racist because it's kind of like a two
*  dimensional insult but you have the most racist state with the most psychotic anarchist city in
*  the middle of it what is going on up there how did this happen the the yin and the yang is so extreme
*  that there must be something in the in the willamette what do you have against anarchism i have nothing
*  i used to be an anarchist when i was in eighth grade i had this friend named mads who was part
*  of a group called seattle solidarity which is like an antifa precursor so i grew up like going
*  to black block protests and i mean there was a particular shooting the murder of john williams
*  who is a native american woodcarver in downtown seattle he got killed by a seattle police officer
*  named ian burke he john williams was carving a pipe or from a wood block with a pocket knife
*  he's deaf in one ear officer pulls a gun on him and says put it down he doesn't hear him he shoots
*  him six seconds later so that police involved shooting is what instantly turned me into like
*  a very critical of law enforcement kind of person when i was super young and so
*  as someone who used to see this guy who got murdered was a 55 year old man i used to see
*  him around pike place where my mom lived it's a public market in downtown that to me put me into
*  the anarchist political sphere just just channeling the anger of that experience and the officer got
*  no charges by the way you can look up the video it's horrific you know and it didn't get reported
*  the officer i'm pretty sure is still active duty and so it's like situations like that early in
*  life channeled me toward political extremism but i grew up to realize how incompatible that
*  anarchistic worldview is with reality and with the with american society can only exist in a
*  small little chamber you know you can't apply that to the industrial heartland of the country
*  and i think also anarchism so i've gotten to know michael malice who's written quite a bit about
*  anarchism and it's also exists as a body of literature about different philosophical
*  notions that kind of resist the state the ever-expanding state in different kinds of
*  ways and it's always nice to have extreme thought experiments to understand what kind of society
*  you want to build but implementing it may not necessarily be a good idea yeah i mean emma
*  goldman i'm a huge fan of her writing also the prison abolitionists that are associated with the
*  anarchist movement angela davis ruth wilson gilmore all that stuff influential i still adhere to a lot
*  of those principles when talking about stuff like radical prison reform and stuff like that
*  but just i i drifted more toward having a more open mind as i got older extremism implemented
*  in almost all of its forms is probably going to cause a lot of suffering yeah you worked as a
*  doorman on the uh i could say legendary bourbon street in new orleans uh where you saw what you
*  described as this might be another wikipedia quote by the way but this is where i do my research
*  is it say hellish scenes hellish scenes and quotes wikipedia is damn right about that all right thank
*  you that's a win that's one in the win column uh so yeah tell the story of that what's it like
*  to work on bourbon street what kind of stuff do you see i mean i was a host at a at a fine dining
*  restaurant that on the corner of bourbon and iberville so that's the first street if you go
*  from canal street onto the quarter so this is like across from like a daiquiri spot it's the the
*  middle of the tourist corridor of new orleans and the spot was kind of like and kind of a tourist
*  trap it was called bourbon house the food was good chef eric i don't want you to see this and
*  think you don't make good andouille sausages but it was overpriced and so i had to we had to
*  maintain this like fine dining facade on a street where almost everyone is like throwing up fighting
*  or is half naked so there was this policy we had these giant glass windows next to the tables
*  so if you're eating at a bourbon house you can look out onto bourbon street and you can see as
*  you're dining a full panoramic view of all these partiers throwing beads boobs all that yeah we had
*  this policy where if we're serving someone we can't look onto bourbon street if something crazy is
*  happening so there's a fight or something that we can't look right so there is a dude i remember
*  i'm fucking serving a table there's a dude in a batman mask butt naked with 12 pairs of beads
*  just jerking it yeah back to jerking it full on he's jerking it right and every every single
*  person at the restaurants looking out there like look they're taking pictures and the manager
*  steven looks at me he's like keep your fucking eyes on the table so i'm serving these people
*  you know i'm like you want to eat what you like red beans and rice or would you like some creole
*  fucking and uh there's just this dude and you know ultimately the manager went out and you know
*  escorted him further down bourbon street but you know i would get off work at around midnight
*  every night and that was when bourbon street is at its most chaotic and so i lived in the french
*  quarter as well so i live oh i lived about 12 blocks down bourbon on at a in a small creole
*  cottage in a cute little like orange old school new orleans one-story spot i lived in the attic
*  above these uh these gay meth dealers named frankie and johnny oh wow and so i would get off work
*  and i would basically have to walk through like this battlefield i mean it was a battlefield
*  getting home was out of like the warriors movie it was almost the humanity on display yeah it was
*  like kensington philadelphia but just alcohol you know what i mean oh it's all alcohol but it's a
*  lot of with a lot of visitors right from outside almost all visitors yeah and that that kind of
*  would set the flow for the weekend for example if the raiders were playing the saints raider nation
*  and they do not play around if it's the patriots that's a whole different crowd they think they're
*  better than everybody else yeah well they technically are better than everybody else but yeah but
*  people from massachusetts aren't like the cream of the crop in terms of like american superiority
*  strong words yeah no no offense but i mean no i that's i'm sure they won't take that as
*  they are good at fighting though i'll tell you that all right great new england has hands
*  compared to some places which places are those colorado colorado has no hands yeah
*  the west coast not too much hand that's why you feel safe talking shit about colorado but if you
*  get to the corn fed parts of east colorado yeah these guys got hands bigger than my head they'll
*  beat the shit out of me but anyways i'd walk back to uh to my house on bourbon street and i would be
*  sifting through this battlefield and i had a friend at the time who was like yeah we should do a taxi
*  cab confessions type spinoff where we ask people to confess a deep dark secret and we posted the
*  next day and so we tried that and it went viral on instagram instantly it was mostly incest stories
*  you know people admitting to incest i know it's a common southern stereotype but there's some truth
*  to it uh there was some murder confessions that was pretty crazy uh we never really posted any
*  of those but how did you get people to confess pretty easy and new orleans has a homicide solve
*  rate of like 22 so i mean most of the time they'll they'll just tell you i remember i was i was walking
*  down bourbon and i asked this kid i was like what's your deepest dark a secret and he told me he's
*  like i just smoked a dude in the magnolia it's a project housing the third ward project development
*  and they said i just smoked a dude in the magnolia playground for touching my sister
*  molesting his sister and i was like what and he was like yeah look it up and i was like all right
*  hold on and it was like man found dead in central city playground like appeared to be homeless shot
*  execution style so i told the kid i was like why did you tell me that he's like man put that
*  shit out there like i'm trying to go viral like tag me too oh i don't think you understand that
*  even if you're a juvenile he was probably 15 yeah you can go you can get juvenile life in
*  louisiana for a homicide even if it's you know justified so i just deleted the footage in front
*  of him i was like i'm gonna delete this footage see that trash button i'm hitting it right now
*  don't tell anyone that again and he was like i appreciate it and he walked off but
*  it's the little little moments like that anything for the gram i guess yeah after a while though
*  it became sort of uh repetitive you know because there's only so many things people can confess to
*  that are they go viral you know and just oh so you were trying to see like what well i mean
*  there's the incest one some people just say like i eat ass that was like every everyone said that
*  like i cheated on someone or i've seen a surprising number of people on your channel say
*  mention eating ass yeah
*  how seriously you said that will live in my head for the rest of my life that's good yeah i want
*  you i want to live in your head saying that a lot of people mention eating ass yeah a lot of people
*  do mention that yeah also that's kind of where i developed this magnetism for freestyle rapping
*  you know everywhere i go people rap not sure why i mean as a former rapper myself in middle school
*  and for the first year of high school i think that maybe like it takes one to know one but
*  everywhere i go people start rapping if you and me went outside of this podcast studio and walked
*  around for five minutes i can find somebody it's rapping i can tell who raps or who can rap who has
*  eight bars in their head that they're ready to go i think you're also there's something about you that
*  gives them creates the safe space yeah to uh perform their art yeah that was the quarter
*  confession series was the first time you saw the suit that's when the suit came out yeah it was
*  kind of like a ron burgundy eric andre inspired where'd you get that suit goodwill goodwill yeah
*  always wow i was playing checkers you're playing chess good job i mean goodwill has a surprising
*  amount of identical gray suits for sale yeah i've actually gotten suits that uh at three stores
*  before they're great a lot of people donate suits and i was going for oversized suits which are the
*  cheapest ones there so yeah it was like 12 bucks 12 to 25 every time for the outfit if i wanted to
*  look super sophisticated like like i'm from another era that would go to thrift store yeah
*  because they're usually like this there's like uh like the patterns they have it's just like a
*  more sophisticated suit which is what you kind of picked out it made you look ridiculous but in the
*  best kind of way the tough part about quarter confessions for me is that everybody that was
*  featured for the most part would more or less regret being a part of the show yeah and that
*  over time just gave me a bad feeling where i was like you know what i kind of feel like i am
*  doing an ambush interview especially because i'm presenting as so agreeable yet the intention is
*  to make something funny yeah and i get that that's what people do in the satire sphere i'm sure
*  ali g and bruno and borat did the same thing and i don't think it's unethical because that's all
*  for the purposes of comedy it is what it is but for me i wanted to do something different yeah
*  because there's an intimacy to confessing a thing right and then you just don't really realize
*  the implications of that and the atmosphere of bourbon street is like anything goes like it's
*  a free spirited place but if you transport that energy digitally to a different place like
*  colorado yeah they might look at it and be like different place and time like five years later
*  right that same person has a family and stuff like this and all of a sudden they're talking about
*  eating ass right exactly you know kids have to think about that or you know imagine if there's
*  a video of your grandma or grandpa out there when he was a kid talking about eating ass
*  that's a horrible experience to discover that about your you know respected elder later in life
*  it's tough i don't even know where to go with that but uh is the literally the opening question was
*  tell me your deepest darkest secret uh yeah just come up to somebody like that yeah how often do
*  you get like a no how often what's the yes to no ratio well the weird thing is like we don't really
*  extract answers from people like what makes a good interview is when they're ready to talk
*  the more you have to talk and try to get an answer out of them it's just not a good vibe like so we
*  kind of look for people who appear to be already ready to talk open body language like they seem
*  confident and verbose and we approach them first there's a look we wouldn't approach a shy person
*  and be like come on tell me no what about a person with pain in their eyes oh yeah we're
*  interviewing them yeah so they're ready to talk they're just not like yeah there's different ways
*  to be ready right i see homeless people a lot and they always look fascinating and the ones i've
*  talked to are always fascinating yeah we just did a video at the vegas in the vegas tunnels like
*  trying obviously it got taken down by fox but whatever we i was gonna make a joke that i didn't
*  see it we tried to help a lot of them by getting them ids and when i made the documentary i had this
*  idea that if i it's a big roadblock for them is getting identification without ids you can't
*  check into a homeless shelter you can't do day labor you can't qualify for housing nothing so
*  when we interviewed them they'd basically tell us if i had my id i wouldn't be here and so we said
*  okay we're going to really help this time we're not just going to talk to them about their struggles
*  we're going to actively go out and get them ids at the dmv so we did that and you know nothing
*  it really changed in their life and we sat down with a recovery specialist who works directly with
*  them day in and day out and he explained to me that he's been trying to do the same thing
*  i tried to do in a one week period for the past 10 years and that they have deeper underlying
*  traumas and pain that need to be dealt with far before they even take the steps to enter society
*  as a housed person that's a heavy truth right there breaking that shame cycle has to come first
*  because you gotta think right like i'm from a generation that romanticizes vagrancy and
*  homelessness to a certain extent if it's called van life or if it is done in a way that's sort
*  of like rolling stone willy nelson hit the road people who are above 50 they feel really embarrassed
*  to be in the spiral of homelessness they feel like failures a lot of them have kids who they
*  weren't there for that's not the kind of pain that can be dealt with by giving someone a tiny home
*  it's a good step forward but to for someone to really make a change they have to want to change
*  and so it's how do you help someone and guide themselves in the right direction and if you're
*  too paternalistic and you use shame as a as a method to get them to clean up they're going
*  to end up right where they started yeah that's a tough truth to accept because a lot of people
*  want a quick fix to things and i don't blame people who go out and give baloney sandwiches out to
*  homeless and each case is probably its own little puzzle each person is so complex now imagine drug
*  abuse what that does for the brain yeah trauma childhood trauma there's so much to unpack
*  and then just the uh the belief that they're the undesirables that they're that they don't deserve
*  to be a part of society because they failed a fundamental obligation like taking care of their
*  kids if we could take a small tangent to you mentioned this vegas video which is fascinating
*  um it was taken down recently by youtube or youtube took it down based on yeah it was illegal
*  uh fox five i guess so the documentary was an hour and 45 minutes we used 10 seconds of a news
*  clip that was publicly broadcast by fox five vegas and according to the copyright act of 1976
*  you're allowed to use any publicly broadcast news clip in a transformative capacity in any
*  documentary film or research paper or broadcast or anything um they specifically this corporation
*  called gray media that controls the tv stations in almost every small town they had lawyers hit up
*  youtube and youtube youtube complied with an illegal copyright strike to get our video
*  immediately removed and i'm a youtube partner i'm in the youtube partner program so to think that i
*  wasn't forewarned is it's a bit strange but it also smells like corruption to me to a certain
*  extent yeah you shouldn't have that amount of power at the very least they should have the
*  power to just like silence that five second clip maybe yeah but i'm taking them to court because
*  i have the means to be able to do so i'm a larger creator i have an audience i have the financial
*  backing to do it i can't imagine how many people out there are smaller creators with like not as
*  much consumer of a you know a fan base they can mobilize against someone like fox five or the
*  money to go to court so i want to take them all the way there to set precedent for future cases
*  so that these giant mainstream mainstream media conglomerates can't
*  copyright strike documentary filmmakers at will it doesn't make sense oh thank you for doing that
*  that's really really really important and that's really powerful and it might hopefully empower
*  youtube to also put pressure on people to not and youtube is in a difficult position because there's
*  so much content out there there's so many claims it's hard to investigate but youtube should be in
*  a place where they push back against this kind of stuff as a first line of defense especially to
*  protect small creators so what you're doing is really really important appreciate it man
*  and it sucks that it was taken down are you do you have any hope well i talked to my youtube
*  partner today and he said that the fox five lawyers have two weeks to comply with my counter
*  appeal but you know i spent 20 grand on human voiceovers in five different languages so i
*  invested probably in total like 70k into this video so even if it gets reinstated the steam's
*  kind of been taken out of its trajectory but also it's just like a really important video is good
*  for the world yeah like why the hell would fox five have an invested interest in having the video
*  taken down i just hate it when people do that to videos or to creators that are doing good in the
*  world yeah it's not an expose on the mayor of las vegas it's an attempt to show the civilian
*  public how to get involved in a local non-profit and potentially intervene in the lives of the
*  tunnel people well fuck fox five the other channel five as you said yeah well thank you for pushing
*  back amen and highlighting it hopefully it gets brought back up but yeah defending other creators
*  so that other creators can take risks and and don't get taken down for stupid reasons
*  yeah so quarter confessions was written no it was all real life reality tv documentary
*  but it caught the attention of a larger company called doing things media yes and they contacted
*  me pretty much like a week after i graduated from college in the may of 2019 and they said hey like
*  how would you like to produce a show i was like what do you mean they were like we'll get you an rv
*  we'll pay you 45k a year you get to we'll pay for gas for food for two hotels a week
*  go out there make content and we'll be in the background just powering it all and that was
*  the birth of all gas no brakes yes i mean all gas no brakes was named after a book that i wrote
*  called all gas no brakes the hitchhiker's diary which chronicled the 70 day journey that we're
*  just talking about it's a tough book to find by the way oh yeah there's only a few copies left
*  i'm thinking about doing a reprint at some point down the line but i sold off the last 100 copies
*  like a month and a half ago yeah until then you guys should go read on the road by jack carrow
*  i don't know if you read it if you can't get my book get on the road by jack carrow it's great
*  it's the best when's your birthday i'll send you april 23rd okay i'm a tourist
*  typical tourist yeah yeah i'm a typical tourist man i'm a scorpio moon should write that down
*  what's the time when you were born 11 30 11 30 at night or of course yeah typical this guy knew it
*  that's the real science yeah anyways so the name the idea of all gas no brakes as a show was to
*  combine the the i guess road dog ethos of the all gas no brakes book with the presentation and
*  editing style of quarter confessions so it was to take quarter confessions on the road that was
*  pretty much like a simulated hitchhiking experience but with the editing and like punchy
*  effects of quarter confessions which is like i wear a suit we do the fast zoom ins little effects
*  stuff like that it was a man those were the the best years it was just it was just so fun i mean
*  imagine you're fresh out of college you were just a doorman interviewing people about like
*  you know making out with their cousin and stuff and then boom this company that you've never even
*  heard of is willing to buy you an rv and give you 45k a year which to me at the time was more
*  money than i could possibly imagine so i called my dad i was like dad i need you to find me an rv
*  because he's the only guy i know who knows about cars even he doesn't know much about cars so he's
*  like all right i'm on it so the rv was 20 000 and the first event that we were called to cover was
*  the the burning man festival and that was tough because burning man is not too keen on filming
*  supposed to be a non-commercialized you know escape from the from reality i mean they have
*  a gift economy set up it's based upon like mutual participation and non-exploitation and so the idea
*  of making a burning man video was tough at first because burn burners oftentimes and this is not
*  all of them but are pretty well off in general a lot of them have tech jobs are pretty high up in
*  silicon valley and burning man is where they go to take off you know to take the edge off and
*  basically become their burner persona on the playa they become reborn and they take ketamine and they
*  wear kaleidoscope glasses and steampunk hats and they you know snort mdma and they run around the
*  sand listen to do you snort mdma that's what i need yes you can i thought it's a pill i didn't
*  know it's better to take it in a pill or water but you can snort mdma i definitely need to take
*  i'm already full of love but like that i probably go to another level yeah don't snort it because
*  it only lasts you like 90 minutes let me write that down so anyways we didn't know what to do
*  because we try to film don't like the initial idea for all gas no breaks was to instead of asking
*  people what's your deepest darkest secret it was what's the craziest trip you've been on so the
*  idea was to not satirize drunk people but satirize people who are fried on acid and so we went to
*  boulder real quick did a test interview with some lady who talked about seeing ancestral aliens
*  during a peyote retreat and so it's pretty easy to extract trip reports from hippies and you know
*  gutter punks and stuff like that or oogles so we go to burning man we start asking people like you
*  know what's your craziest trip story and they didn't have the same type of free-flowing
*  storytelling style that like a on the street truss punk in new orleans might have where they're
*  like i don't give a fuck i'll tell you whatever these people were very bottled up about what they
*  were willing to disclose so we went on burning man radio and we did a broadcast and we said hey
*  we're we're doing we're psychedelic journalists it was me and my friend ciel at the time i said
*  we're psychedelic journalists we're parked on tan and i which is a cross street in black rock city
*  and we said we have a 1998 catalina coachman sport it's an rv we've set up a podcast studio
*  we're doing a show about psychedelic voyages yeah so lo and behold two hours later we had
*  10 people lined up at the rv nice willing to talk so that vetted people in advance for us
*  and so we did a couple interviews uh and that was that well what were some of the stories from the
*  trip reports uh there was this lady named rosma who said that she was known in several circles
*  in berkeley for being multi-orgasmic and could create multiple repeated climaxes using only her
*  mind by like squinting her eyes and squeezing her eyes together so much that like the pleasure
*  spiral just you know went crazy i feel like i talked to several people like that at berkeley
*  yeah you know what i'm talking about not that well yeah that lady i think she did she manifest
*  herself in many forms yeah right so but still it was on the cruder end there was one guy
*  named uh kimbo slice was his burner name he talked about taking a shit after taking like a
*  a quarter of mushrooms and how he was like seeing his childhood and visualizing his past life
*  you know as the the turds were flowing into the toilet and just talks about the psychedelic
*  union between pooing and taking taking shrimps so he was very visual with his words yeah so there
*  was stuff like that i interviewed alex gray which was super cool about his first trip in san francisco
*  when he was in 1971 shortly after the summer of love i got to do some pretty cool interviews
*  but still it was a semi-ambush style i i wouldn't say that we were doing journalism yet it was still
*  comedic video work you know was there a narrative no that tied it together it's like really just a
*  trip comedic almost with the interview and then i go burning man and then it's on to the next one
*  so i guess that could give a loose structure but it's just like a punchy and slapstick thing
*  um everything was going good until we interviewed this guy named dj soft baby he was uh wearing a
*  golden leotard uh with once again kaleidoscope glasses shirt shirtless dancing like you know
*  dancing and uh he was eating chowder out of a a plastic bowl and he was like this chowder so
*  fucking good he's like this is the best shot i've ever had in my life and he starts putting the
*  chowder on his face and he's like i want the chowder all over me yeah and so we we just go
*  hey man can you just do a dance for us real quick just for some b-roll he does a dance we
*  posted on instagram the next morning doing things media ceo calls me read he says all of our pages
*  are down and he's like that guy you filmed dancing last night on drugs putting chowder on his face
*  that guy is at the top of mit i don't understand what he went to i'm like saying
*  you know my brother's a rocket science he's like head of nasa or whatever well i mean the guy knows
*  people in boston okay you know not in the whitey bulger sense but in the reverse sense i have
*  trouble believing the dj soft baby oh dj soft baby was major it could have been harvard it could have
*  been but it wasn't it wasn't umass i don't think there's anybody that's a quote at the head of
*  mit who's putting um what was it all over his face uh chowder chowder well then you haven't
*  been to burning man yet okay i'm not doing that so i'm gonna have to consult the my colleagues at
*  mit if they know dj soft baby so whoever he probably was harvard let's put it on them okay
*  the top of harvard so he made some calls you know to the to the tops to the heads of big tech
*  yeah got all the doing things media pages taken down at the time that was like a
*  vast network of pages and we ended up having to take the obviously the video came down
*  and he held the entire network of instagram pages hostage and so that was a he made us agree to
*  never post that video again and then somehow got all of our pages reinstated so that was my first
*  brush with like uh you know powerful people on drugs and that was probably my last brush with
*  powerful people on drugs so what what did you transition into from there i think after burning
*  man we um went to the south went to talladega race weekend went to a donald trump jr book signing
*  went to a uh jugaloo adjacent fetish mansion in central florida called the sausage castle uh
*  jugaloo adjacent uh saucy okay can you can you run that by me again to jugaloo adjacent fetish
*  mansion in central florida fetish mansion in central florida jugaloo adjacent i mean every
*  single one of those words i feel like needs a book or something right um so uh jug by the way who are
*  the jugaloo's is this i see i see pfcp fans okay but i say adjacent because it's not a jugaloo
*  mansion but there's a lot of jugaloo's who kick it at the mansion it's jugaloo friendly okay
*  jugaloo friendly yeah because they get made fun of in a lot of places oh so it's not okay got it
*  and jugaloo's say outrageous shit you know and they embarrass themselves and they fight a lot
*  so they're kind they're on the fbi's gang list which if you ask me rcp or the the jugaloo's
*  the jugaloo's if it was the the head of the jug the jugaloo's it would be violent j and shaggy too dope
*  but there's associated acts like twisted and there's a whole rabbit hole honestly tech nine
*  is sort of a part of that tech nine i don't know who that is should i know he's a uh he's actually
*  one of the top selling touring rappers despite having sort of not that many streams tech nine is
*  like it's got a huge cult following in missouri this is like the jugaloo's started in uh war in
*  michigan we should also say icp insane clown posse so this is a thing this is a movement oh yeah if
*  you if you went to seattle right now and punched a cop and they booked you in county jail you may end
*  up running with the jugaloo's running with the jugaloo's they are of presence in pacific northwest
*  prison system from what i've heard can you tell a jugaloo from like a distance well they say
*  whoa so if you see a jugaloo they'll say that also like i'll try to i'll try to look they're uh
*  they're kind of it's called the dark carnivals the mythology they abide by what do they define
*  themselves what's the ideology a family a family no i understand but what's the ideology what's
*  the philosophical foundation of their anti-racist uh they like to drink fago and also just like
*  cheap liquor and stuff like that they're they they're into drugs yeah a lot of circles if you
*  pull out a crack pipe people will be like i don't want to drink with you anymore if you're at a
*  jugaloo party and someone's smoking twizz or something it's relatively accepted what's twizz
*  meth meth right right lots of tattoos yeah the hatchet man is the most common one so it's a
*  it's a psychopathic records logo it's a cartoon of a clown wheeling a hatchet it's actually a
*  pretty sick logo i vaguely remember enjoying some of the uh icp music it's good that's pretty good
*  it's funny it's edgy well they get satirized a lot but i got love for the clowns and also so when
*  all gas no breaks transitioned away from you know rich elite drug parties and into like the south
*  that's when the fun really started to happen living in your rv in alabama and florida and stuff is the
*  best why why what what is it about people are just so friendly down there and it's warm year round
*  and people are non-judgmental it's just great the south gets hated on a lot especially in the
*  coastal state coastal states mississippi and alabama are kind of like the butts of a lot of
*  jokes and stuff but those are great states i love it new mexico albuquerque all those oh yeah the
*  abqs it's great abq what's that albuquerque it's what jesse pinkman called it as the abq
*  oh shit the the depth of references you bring to the table is intense it's okay i met a lady in
*  albuquerque when i was traveling across the united states and she said take me with you
*  said i'm sorry man i can't yeah but i think about that lady i think you made the right call i don't
*  know yeah on the road yeah by jack carowak best book i've ever read in my life there's a there's
*  a moment when he meets a nice girl on a bus and they have a love affair it was good on the bus or
*  they no no here they went to california well yeah and there was a love affair on the bus but
*  it wasn't sexual it was just romantic it was it was in the air it was an air which there is
*  something in the air on the bus uh like a greyhound megabus that type of situation there's
*  certainly something in the air it was a romance there is man we travel because it's like strangers
*  getting together and you're like feeling each other out and but you're in it like you each have
*  a story because you wouldn't be taking a bus unless you had a story so you're especially if
*  you're traveling across country there's something you ever taken the dollar bus from philly to new
*  york the chinatown bus yeah i have that's a great bus the people on that it's not a fucking dollar
*  though it was a there's some that are five bucks no no no no no if you book it way ahead of time
*  it's like 20 i was like this is a fucking lie calling it one dollar i got i don't know why i'm
*  swearing the anger came out i apologize swearing is okay sometimes when i got last time i was on
*  the chinatown bus there was like a rooster walking down the aisle actual yeah well it's
*  chilling it was awesome well there's a nice part of your film with the rooster i forgot about that
*  yeah that felt almost fake yeah did you plant the rooster no the rooster there's a place in
*  ebor city in tampa where roosters walk around all the time and we had a rooster park there
*  right by the main drag for what did i say we had a rooster parked we had the rv parked in ebor
*  city for a long time and the rooster laid eggs in the the undercarriage nice back to the all gas
*  no brakes thing though yeah yeah so it was lots it was really fun making it and then we started all
*  gas no brakes in september of 2019 six months later the country shuts down and everything just
*  hits the fan i was actually here in austin when it shut down i was on sixth street i remember the uh
*  i don't just hang out on sixth street all the time but i was just here come on just be honest i do
*  like sixth street yeah i like east austin better but i like sixth street too so anyways the nba
*  shuts down everything's shutting down and i so i went down to the dirty six and i asked this doorman
*  i was like are you guys ever gonna shut down he was like fuck no bro the dirty six never closes
*  and i was like all right we'll see about that next day plywood and then i was like all right
*  i thought my career was over when covid hit i was like what are we gonna do nothing's happening
*  anymore there's no more parties or taladega races or burning mans to go to so i went back to seattle
*  in the rv and i just spent four months just depressed living in the rv trying to figure out
*  what would happen but all gas no brakes went on still well this was the craziest thing about that
*  period of time is that when when covid hit i'm sure you remember everything turned political
*  overnight in seattle if you went to a house party you can get canceled you know because people are
*  like oh you're a super spreader so if you wanted to socialize even with a group of four or more you
*  had to do so with your phones damn near turned off and a lot of people were doing hyper social
*  policing at that time beyond that in the south and in more conservative places they were doing
*  the opposite they were trying to prove that they could hang out 500 deep with no mask to make a
*  statement against the establishment so you had this polarization that led to more division and
*  that's when the anti-vax protest started and i went to sacramento and the passion was unreal
*  this is about it this is about two months after the covid lockdowns began and that was my first
*  political video was at the sacramento the california state capitol in sacramento documenting the they
*  called it the freedom rally but that's typically like anti-vax stuff and uh it was real intensity
*  and that video was my most successful to date at that time and so i was like okay am i a political
*  reporter now am i covering politics like what's going on what were the interviews that made up
*  that video uh what kind of what style of questions were you asking what i don't know if you remember
*  but i was actually scared when the pandemic started i thought that this is something that
*  might kill us all based upon what i was consuming and uh so i'd ask people what do you think about
*  this lockdown and i've had people say you know i'm immune compromised if i get exposed to
*  covid i have a 95 fatality rate but guess what i'd rather be free and dead than alive living in fear
*  and i was like wow so it's just stuff along those lines you had some san diego surfers there
*  complaining about the beaches being shut down when such awesome waves were coming yeah it's
*  interesting how that really brought out
*  the worst in people oh yeah i'm not sure why why that is fear maybe paranoia
*  i don't know it really divided people like along the lines as you mentioned
*  like triple mask yourself or fight for your country yeah right exactly like why are those
*  the two options that is literally what it was yeah it's wild and both groups think they're
*  fighting for the survival of something yeah and so that's where you really run into problems when
*  you have two polarized groups who both think that their cause is for the common good
*  mutual understanding is impossible at that juncture and so after three months of almost every
*  everybody being locked down george floyd happens and i remember i saw the third precinct burning
*  on my phone in minneapolis and uh everyone says andrew you have to go cover this
*  and i'm somebody like i said you know police violence has been close to my heart since i was
*  a kid and my first thought is i can't do that i'm a comedic reporter i can't go to minneapolis and
*  cover this it'll be the end of my career and um i had a friend named lacy who i went to college with
*  and she told me she was like bro this is your chance for you to do something serious you can
*  actually create a meaningful piece of reporting like you always wanted to before quarter confessions
*  and you can turn all gastronome breaks into a new source so i called reid who is the ceo of the
*  company that owned all gas no breaks and i was like look man i want to go to minneapolis i was
*  in orlando at the time i was actually at the sausage castle and uh he said he said the sausage
*  castle yeah the juglo mansion oh right yeah it's called the sausage castle so i'm watching
*  minneapolis unfold uh on lake street where it was burning and i got to the orlando airport
*  and i booked a flight without i booked it on my own card i didn't consult my boss or anything
*  and i was sitting in my seat on the flight and he straight up told me he's like if you
*  fuck this up and this destroys the brand we're getting a different host this if you mess this up
*  and you turn our our show away from a party show about drinking and drugs and all that stuff and
*  you make this a social justice show you're done but i was like i just turned my phone off i got
*  to the minneapolis airport on the second night of the riots and when i got to the airport there
*  was national guardsmen in the airport and there was a it was like a call of duty mission and the
*  one in the airport and on the speaker they say if you're arriving here right now you are not
*  permitted to go anywhere outside of the airport national guardsmen will escort you to your uber
*  or to your car they're going to take a picture of your id they're going to figure out where you're
*  going you are not permitted to go outside tonight and so lacy picks me up there's two people in the
*  back two of her home girls wearing like shy steve masks i'm like what are we doing what where are
*  we going and she goes we're gonna go film the riot we're going to lake street and so we drive
*  down there k-mart is burning target is burning everything is on fire she has the sony a7 she
*  gives me a microphone and she's like go talk to that guy and that was a guy with a molotov
*  cocktail in his hand who had just burned k-mart down and so i go what should i ask him she goes
*  what's on your mind so i walk up to him i'm like what's on your mind he said something like
*  everything that was happening here was supposed to happen this is how we feel is it right no is
*  this going to benefit the community no but this is how we feel this is how we feel that's pretty
*  powerful yeah that's through a lot of the the documenting that you do this is how we feel is
*  like yeah screaming through that yeah and i noticed that aside from a group called unicorn riot there
*  was no one else actually interviewing the protesters the local news was on the bridge 15 not 15 but five
*  blocks away you know filming just the the scene itself just at the fire but i saw some crazy things
*  off camera too i saw so there was kind of two groups there there was like the the anarchists
*  more mobilized protesters and then there was just mostly african-american community members who were
*  just pissed who had nothing to do with the organized resistance and they were all kind of joining forces
*  to riot and uh there was this anarchist kid who ran up to white castle with like a molotov cocktail
*  and he was about he's about to throw it at white castle and this black dude ran up to him grabbed
*  his arm and he's like ah we fuck with white castle and i was like what and so you see if you go on
*  lake street every business is burned yeah white castle remains damn i also saw these dudes rip
*  this atm out of a bank and hit it with sledgehammers they were a group of friends hitting it with
*  sledgehammers right hitting those sledgehammers boom all of a sudden money starts spraying out of
*  the atm like i've never seen some shit like this like pouring out of it and then this group of
*  friends who were just united and getting it open start fighting each other for the money as it's
*  flying out of it and so there was just it was like a like joker from the batman's army type
*  type vibes but i got shot in the ass by the national guard it was no good like a what a
*  rubber bullet yeah yeah not not something like honestly it hurt i'm not sure what i was expecting
*  is an answer to that question yeah i liked it it was good yeah and then after that i posted the
*  video and it was very well received and that was the pivotal point where i realized that
*  everything was going to change i mean there was a still kind of a comedic element to the way you do
*  conversations so the way you edit so did you see yourself as a potentially like a john stewart type
*  of character at first but you know i just think human beings are just funny in general yeah the
*  absurdity of it cool thing about john stewart is like i generally like to say that anybody who
*  works for corporate media whether it be comedy central or anything owned by time warner fox
*  msnbc they can't say what they want because in order to climb up in those organizations you have
*  to appease the narrative of the company that you're working for to rise in the ranks john stewart i
*  feel like has so much clout in the media world that i'm pretty sure he can say whatever he wants
*  like i actually don't think that john stewart is controlled by anybody i really don't i think that
*  he can go on the show and talk about whatever i do think that certain people have broken the brains
*  of the covid broke the brains of a lot of really great people i admire trump broke the brains of
*  a lot of people i admire like to where trump trump derangement syndrome become it became a
*  thing like you can't see the world quite as clearly because of it and i think uh john stewart is quite
*  a genius at like stepping away even though the world needed him in that time stepping away during
*  that moment of trump and coming back now sort of being able to reflect being those sort of the other
*  statesmen my favorite john stewart moment that illustrates that perfectly is whenever he went
*  on the colbert show and he was just joking around with steven colbert who i think is a full-blown
*  propagandist about uh the wuhan lab league theory he was just goofing around he was like it's called
*  the coronavirus lab and they had it before and now what do we have and it was like you could see in
*  steven colbert that he was like gun to his head type shit where he's like john john stop joking
*  about that yeah and that made me realize like oh everything that john stewart did especially for
*  the 9-eleven first responders he's a true american and not in the sense of like uh that
*  the different political parties want you to believe is an american not a do your part in
*  social distance american not a you know wave wave your trump flag in the back of your pickup truck
*  american just a guy who genuinely stands up for what's right there is a degree to which you can
*  be in those positions easily captured by group think though even when you're not controlled
*  by bosses and money and all that kind of stuff i think john sewers has been mostly resistant
*  but it's it's hard his position is difficult i think he's done the best job though if someone
*  is that obviously democrat connected yeah corporate media economy he seems to be the freest
*  talker yeah so this is when you first became famous i'm not even sure what fame means i mean
*  i just see myself as me when did you get the shades oh that was on tour that was that's a whole
*  the shades that's dark time but this i i didn't make like this is a meme really i don't even know
*  that's a simple i didn't make journalism to like become famous yeah i made it to give people a
*  platform to share their stories it just so happens that people liked it enough to where i became sort
*  of famous but you know if i could go back and not be the on camera guy and just platform the stories
*  i would but the reality is people need a face to attach to stuff they like and so that's just how
*  it is but yeah i would say right around minneapolis protest portland's protest proud boys rally time
*  when i was really in there is when i started to be acclaimed as more than just like a ambush
*  meme lord did that have effect on you the fame not at that point not at that point so like you
*  were still able to have a lightness to you well the country was basically closed yeah so it
*  wasn't like there was a street to walk down where people were like there's that guy so getting
*  famous famous during covid made it so when the country reopened it was as if like i did my life
*  really changed because i was like oh all these fans i made during covid are like seeing me out of the
*  bar this is cool yeah at first fame is the best thing ever because you can go anywhere in the
*  country and these spaces that you normally feel a bit insecure in like a local dive bar a cool
*  restaurant a coffee shop where you just be another guy all of a sudden they're like oh my god i'm a
*  big fan they give you like free stuff you get this sense of acceptance that you never would have got
*  before so but there's also the dark side well it's all love man i i i i mean i just to speak to the
*  first part you're saying is there's so much love that people have and it's amazing i'm sure you
*  know what it's like that's beautiful the only downside of fame really is that you can't really
*  be anonymous again and you have to seek out more strange environments to be anonymous in like right
*  now i live in the desert basically and i want to live in the middle of nowhere in the mojave desert
*  not because i'm scared of people but because i just want to be like curious me again who people
*  don't know and i can ask questions to people that i'm interested in without them going
*  i remember i see i see you here i see you there that's the that's the main thing that's what i
*  loved about hitchhiking yeah just to have anonymity yeah it's the best but both are great complaining
*  about fame is just the lamest shit yeah we should go to furry conventions that you covered
*  we're an outfit i love furries i should do that yeah we should go together i go all the time we
*  should go together what's your favorite outfit no i have not i think you might like it more than
*  you think i listen maybe i'm just afraid to face who i really am yeah your persona the true lex
*  will come out when you're yeah in a 3600 dollar everything is possible lizard is that what they
*  go with well scalies are the lizard furries yeah and there's a big division in the community where
*  they think scalers are kind of douchebag you know because the the scaly suits are more expensive
*  they're about seven grand whereas a fur suit is 3600 so and they're also taller yeah so when the
*  scalies pull up to the fur fest it's like ah fuck the reptiles fuck the reptiles i can get behind
*  that i like like more like i'm more like a teddy bear type of guy yeah i think bears i what's that
*  maybe squirrels i don't know oh squirrels are so cool giant squirrels yeah i want to put a gopro
*  on one and just see what the hell they do um you're talking about that conversation with uh the guy
*  at the head of doing things media how did that end up well i mean i want to clear up a few things
*  read the ceo of doing things i actually think he's a good guy i think that he was just trying to run
*  a business he saw what was working for his brand which is very college-centric very festival-centric
*  and he was right to think that journalism and especially coverage of sensitive topics like
*  covid or you know police brutality would definitely not work on merch you know you're
*  not going to sell a picture of me interviewing someone at a riot like you would me interviewing
*  a furry or a drunk dude in alabama doesn't work the same so it was a lot a lot harder to monetize
*  not just because of youtube censorship but also just because of the sensitive nature of the
*  content so reid was looking out for himself as a businessman there was a different partner
*  oh i'm not going to say his name that was more connected in hollywood i think he's responsible
*  for the the collapse of the show what was the collapse like what was so right as the country's
*  reopening i get a dm from eric wehrheim of tim and eric and i'm covering something called the ufo
*  mega conference in laflint nevada which is a beautiful river town and you know he de-ended
*  me he says let's make a show and i'm like oh shit is this real you know i grew up such a big fan of
*  nathan for you and the eric andre show and those are produced by their company absolutely
*  so i was like hell yeah let's do it three days later i get a call it says jona hill wants to
*  hop on board and i can't believe this you know i'm still in the rv and i'm in laflint nevada
*  so i'm like jona hill's super bad are you shitting me right now so i was excited
*  and uh oh and moneyball jona hill's a great actor oh he's great he's great all around yeah
*  and so credit he deserves well i mean he's got the credit by now but still deserves more
*  so basically just within a week i assembled this super team of tim and eric and super bad team yeah
*  pretty much of tim and eric i'm so sorry good and jona hill and yeah we just pitched it around
*  every single tv network rejected it i don't know why and they mainly did that because
*  i was in this weird situation where i had signed a contract with doing things media
*  that i didn't realize was called a 360 deal that's what they use in like the rap world
*  basically means that i can't do anything outside of them without them getting 100 of the money
*  so if i was to go work at sabaro or quiznos while i was working for all gas no breaks they would get
*  500 bucks a week from the sandwich spot i was unable to earn any outside income
*  um i didn't read the fine print because i was 21 and like i told you 45k a year rv sounds sick
*  and uh basically the tv networks were like why would we buy a show if the digital brand is
*  going to be running at the same time because they didn't want to stop doing all gas no breaks to
*  make a tv show they wanted all gas no breaks to continue as a web show while all gas no breaks
*  as a future tv show at showtime or hulu or somewhere like that was also concurrently running
*  which is impossible for one man to do and so every tv network said okay we're not doing that we want
*  an exclusive rights contract with this guy uh next oh yeah this is crazy to think about is it all
*  happened so fast so jona hill says a24 films wants to do a movie instead of a show and they're
*  going to let you keep the digital brand running so this meant that i could keep doing my instagram
*  stuff with doing things media slash all gas no breaks while making an a24 movie with jona hill
*  and tim and eric so it was just like i was excited it sounded perfect so they said okay what do you
*  want to make a movie about and i told them okay here's what's going to happen in 2020 in 2020
*  if trump wins there's going to be riots across the country the major cities are going to burn
*  down if trump loses the militias and his loyal supporters are going to try to have a coup in dc
*  that's what i said and i said so i'm going to follow the lead up to whoever wins the election
*  and i'm going to document what happens after so they said okay and so i was to begin filming in
*  late october you know during the campaign trail maybe mid october up until november and then
*  in the following months to see what would happen um this meant that i couldn't film anything for
*  all gas no breaks the digital show because i had to dedicate a hundred percent of my time to making
*  this perfect movie yes still one of the partners at doing things media was demanding that i'm not
*  only produce the movie but also more content for the show and i told them there's only so many
*  hours in a day man that's going to be impossible and i said if you want it to be possible i can
*  make it work but i want to have half of the monetization from the show 50 profit split
*  which i thought is fair if you want me to do double work when i was getting almost nothing before
*  split me in on the profits they fired us immediately me and my two childhood friends
*  who i hired to work on the show with me were all out of a job as we were filming for the now hbo
*  project we got our fire notices the guts on those on that and that person to because you should be
*  owning probably close to 100 of it i think so too but they didn't see it that way because they
*  figured we made the initial investment we discovered him it's how they looked at it
*  so it wasn't reed but it was the other partner who wasn't reed who said we have tons of verbatim he
*  said this we have i have tons of connections in the comedy world we can replace andrew overnight
*  i'm not sure why he made that miscalculation i wish he would have thought about it twice
*  i wish it didn't have to end like that but it did why do people do that like what's the benefit of
*  acting like that i think you can part amicably without the drama i think all betrayal and
*  anything like that is motivated by self-interest whether that be economic success social stability
*  whatever it is they figured that because i was being such a burden in asking for the profit
*  that they could just release me and find someone equally talented and not split them in so they
*  can make more money oh i see well that's a stupid way to think people think like that man people
*  who are the word i use is like sidekick syndrome like when people are kind of a part of the
*  production but they're not integral they start thinking that the front man doesn't matter or
*  something and that the brains of the operation are actually the people on the periphery and so
*  they start to believe that they can just shift things around and the audience won't care not
*  realizing that i was actually the one who created the show and that the lore of the show is connected
*  to my rise outside of their jurisdiction if that makes sense like the people who watch all gas no
*  breaks watched quarter confessions and read the book and so you know well this happens also not
*  just financially but just with people that sort of part of a team but they don't really contribute
*  creatively to the team and they they uh force their opinion or pressure i mean whether it's
*  comes from uh like from editors or all that kind of stuff or from sponsors or this there's pressure
*  they create when they when the the creator alone should be celebrated and have all the power
*  because they're the ones that are creating the thing in a way i have sympathy because like i
*  can't relate to that because i've always been the front man of my own projects by design so i'm not
*  sure what it's like to be uh like someone's owner from a content perspective i don't understand the
*  challenges they face maybe there was something that i didn't understand i don't know true well
*  oftentimes if you own a thing like this like this company you do think about brand right and then
*  maybe have a big picture idea what brand means and that that can be at tension with the the creative
*  project right yeah like but ultimately freedom for the creators is the best kind of brand yeah i
*  remember all three of us who worked on all gas no brakes got fired at the same time and we were in
*  that we were in the rv that tim and eric's company bought for us which was a bigger rv in the parking
*  lot parking lot of a walmart in south philly and the propane had just ran out and it was 15 degrees
*  outside so like the rv was getting really cold really fast and i just looked at my phone and it
*  was like you're fired and i was just like god help me but i've had a couple moments like that
*  and god does help me and they were always in the parking lot of wal- walmart right well yeah although
*  i know that walmart by the way the one in south philly is great yeah that's great
*  but technically now you can't park an rv there well you're not you're not a man who follows the
*  rules well if you know what i'm saying is those walmart cracker barrel and big five are supposed
*  to technically all let rv campers park overnight but if there's like a crime problem in the city
*  where they're at they can lobby individual walmarts can lobby with the corporate to take that away
*  so like all the portland walmarts you can't sleep there anymore any city with like significant
*  homelessness and like petty property crime the walmarts are a no-go fascinating so that was a
*  low point yeah and but from there from the ashes the phoenix rose over time yeah channel five was
*  born channel five was born in the march of 2021 after uh we finished filming for the hbo project
*  oh really so you went all in on the hbo project yeah i mean we filmed the hbo project from
*  november 2020 up until uh april 2021 damn near we were just like you know picking up the pieces
*  going back for individual interviews stuff like that so let's go to that project it turned out
*  to be a movie called this place rules it's supposed to be called america shits itself
*  oh yeah maybe you can tell the story of the film you have what's his name i wrote this down joker
*  gang and gum gang is that correct yeah the opening scene the opening scene of two characters uh just
*  talking shit and then getting into a fight and that i think was really brilliant how you presented
*  that as a almost like a microcosm of like the division between the the extremes of the left
*  and the extremes of the right that's exactly what it was i'm glad you picked up on it yeah and then
*  what i really liked is that the joke again um joker gang was kind of a little bit of a spoiler
*  alert i apologize but at the end of the film was as a kind of um a voice of wisdom yeah i just
*  just realized he seems the most he seems the most sane he was the voice of wisdom
*  he like cut through it yeah i also just realized a lot of people are gonna stream
*  the movie after watching this podcast which is cool yeah where did they stream it on hbl max
*  yeah hbl max i never got a chance to promote them it's such a pain in the ass man i wish we could
*  all just pay on it on youtube or something yeah and hbl gets the profits or whatever but like it's
*  such as i had to subscribe for every single thing but yes if you want to watch it it's really i
*  recommend extremely highly sign up to hbo whatever the hell on the positive note hbo is great to
*  work with like that they're the most professional like respectful company i've ever worked with
*  pretty much yeah hbl has created some of the greatest like tv but even in the background like
*  they get shit done there's there's no there's no wait time they have some of the best heavy
*  hitters on their team for trailers for posters all the promotional apparatus they have is like
*  super solid did you get like good notes from people there like how to a little bit man but
*  you know it's a it's a truly original like documentary like meaning like i just haven't
*  seen anything like it it's even like it's so like there's a humor and a lightness at the right
*  kinds of moments um like it like i said there's like a rooster in here that's like okay that's
*  like a non-sequitur like thing as part of a storytelling it kind of intensifies and reveals
*  the absurdity of the division and how one once like january 6th happens like everybody like goes
*  on to the next thing yeah it's like what happened to us it was almost like a delirium that everybody
*  was participating in some weird just like uh well like people say mind virus like all of a sudden
*  we just got captured yeah and people just like yelling at each other doing the most ridiculous
*  shit and i mean really january 6th the way you presented especially just reveals the circus of
*  it all i mean it really broke the the fourth wall that's how i would describe it because if you were
*  at january 6th and the lead up it felt like it was the beginning to a series of similar riots
*  but it just popped off so much that that was it there you haven't seen anything like it since it
*  was supposed to be a second one on january 20th it was the actual inauguration that never happened
*  it was a crazy time to be alive and around and especially the relationship that i developed with
*  enrique tario who was the former chairman of the proud boys he's now facing you know 23 years in
*  prison it's like a trip because i went to his house in miami maybe two weeks after january 6th and
*  talking to him it seemed like he didn't think anything was going to happen he was just like
*  yeah man that was crazy i'm glad i wasn't there like they're dumb for doing that he even told
*  me he doesn't think the election was stolen which is just a mind-fuck it's like why did you get
*  everyone so hyped up it's just weird to think about how so many people's lives are drastically
*  altered forever because of that just bizarre moment in time that will always live on
*  yeah what what did you uh cue an honest part of that story what did you learn about cure non from
*  that um just an all-encompassing world view that family that i talked to i call them the q anon
*  family but it's called the spencer family you know they were non-political up until the stop the
*  steel movement began in september of 2020 and within four months their entire life revolved
*  around the mythology and lore of q and i've never seen in my life a psyop just devour people's minds
*  in such an intense way in such a rapid period of time and i love how the kids in the movie are
*  also the voices of wisdom the spencer family it's the kid who like goes through the full journey
*  yeah of like believing um that whatever hillary clinton is a lizard or and just believing all the
*  the worst versions of the conspiracy theories and then kind of waking up was like what was the point
*  yeah it was heartbreaking to see his disappointment and his dad for even you know following q and on so
*  militantly because he was like i felt like they let my dad down i feel like they let our family down
*  you know because january 6th was supposed to be the day according to q and on that the storm happens
*  and that the military is supposed to mobilize and arrest the members of the deep state clinton soros
*  all that trump was supposed to go into a helicopter you know what i mean and take control of the country
*  back from you know the swamp and it didn't happen in fact the next day he was like almost denouncing
*  it now he doesn't but then he did and it was a really i think it hurt people's pride a lot
*  my friend 4g auto blow he's a trump rapper he describes it that way he says a lot of people's
*  pride got hurt by january 6th trump rapper oh yeah dude honestly there's some pretty dope trump rap
*  out there i'm serious they there's a rap yeah like you would think like oh yeah maga there's
*  no rappers there but there's rappers and they do a pretty good job they're good at delivering the
*  messaging they want to deliver yeah i mean they think of stuff that i'm like that's clever oh
*  they're like they have some political depth to them yeah well i mean is there something more you
*  could say about like how q and i works like who's behind it what's your sense of who's behind the
*  whole thing you know
*  i don't want this to sound rude or anything i just don't care about q and on you know what i mean
*  i've i've put so much thought into it and i just can't seem to care about it
*  was it like almost a disappointment because like the to me it was like a thing that just captured
*  a very large number of people's minds and then it just kind of faded i guess that's why it just
*  seems like uh it's gone and the ideas of q and on have just bled into mainstream standard conservative
*  thinking but there has to be a kind of retrospective like that's the problem i have with coven
*  you know a lot of stuff happened everybody freaked out there's a lot of big drama around
*  it and now everyone's like okay forgot yeah just like moved away what are the lessons learned has
*  anyone learned any lessons yeah like what exactly what i'm saying is i don't want q and on adherence
*  to see this and think i don't care about them yeah but like as far as who is behind it the damage is
*  done yeah but what are the mechanisms that made it work i mean that's really have you kind of like
*  thought about that i i kind of think that these viral ideas can be driven by and your film kind
*  of shows this by just a handful of people and they're not malevolent they just want to clout
*  yeah and there's something sexy there's something really sticky about conspiracy theories
*  like especially extreme ones you just kind of like it some of them can have this momentum they
*  capture the minds of a lot of people and you just go with it yeah and it like when i hear some
*  conspiracy theories like there's something like a small part of me that kind of like yeah it's
*  possible you know that q and on is a psyop to distract people away from actually uncovering
*  what the deep state is and who is truly running things behind the scenes because the deep state
*  is just the one percent it's that you take you get people so close to any type of class consciousness
*  and then you totally divert everything into like lizard humans who live on the moon and that
*  hillary clinton is eating babies on camera and q and on did just that that they want you to they
*  want to convince you that one there's no conservative deep state which is even more hilarious that trump
*  isn't connected to a huge rich corporate apparatus of propagandists and two that the democratic
*  establishment is the only deep state and that some middle middle of the road conservatives that
*  there's no grifters or manipulators outside of of that three-headed snake you know there's
*  grifters everywhere everywhere everyone wants to make money dude this is the world that we're in
*  it's in collapse everybody wants to make money and engagement is the rule of law so anything that's
*  why these news organizations follow retention incentives they want to make money by selling ads
*  so they try to create fear and constant division to enrich the corporate media establishment and
*  you have people who are almost realizing hey it seems like fox and cnn might be owned by the same
*  people and are tactically using these machines to keep us divided perfectly 50 50 to ensure that
*  the power structure never gets disrupted and then you guys then you get these people you know who's
*  going to save us donald trump that's the guy how is that the guy it's not the guy i don't have tds
*  i don't i'm not an orange man basher who thinks about the gallatine but i don't think he's the guy
*  uh you were shirtless lifting weights while whiskey or some alcohol was poured into your mouth by alex
*  jones in this movie and then you did the same to him that's true it feels like an interrogation
*  uh so alex was uh was a part of this film he was like throughout throughout the narrative and yet
*  he had a great interview with him uh what did you learn about interacting with alex
*  shows for making this film for one is that he's the exact same off camera as he is on camera yeah
*  it's not an act he told me that all real americans die before 58 he mentioned sean
*  connery and a few others and uh how old is he getting up there yeah i think early 50s
*  um i just found it fascinating i mean how how nice his studio is i mean the guys got like an msnbc
*  level setup i actually had a great time with him you know i mean it's bizarre because
*  having him in that movie created so many problems for me and when i interviewed him you know i
*  didn't necessarily portray him in the best light you know we joked around a bit but it wasn't an
*  alex jones hit piece necessarily but i like to think that i was a bit critical of him in the
*  film especially the ways that he antagonized his supporters to storm the capital or to follow that
*  trajectory um he told me when i met with him he was like i know you think that having me in this
*  movie is a good idea but um you're gonna have some serious backlash because of that at the time i
*  was like man it's fine you know it's all good we're just hanging out drinking whiskey doing
*  bench presses drinking jamison it's all good it was uh first of all i had to campaign to get him
*  in the film because the studios were like we don't there was a bizarre time around like i
*  think it was 2018 where deplatforming was the big thing that people were encouraging it said giving
*  a platform to problematic ideologies will in turn expand their reach and so even extending your
*  platform to someone who's problematic is helping them aka destroying humanity whatever it was so
*  that was the whole thing and uh when i did this media training that was you know mandated by hbo
*  it was all training and how to defend from that exact question they said when you when we put you
*  on npr and we put you on cnn they're gonna ask you about platforming problematic ideologies
*  and you're gonna have to say stuff like sunlight is the best disinfectant i believe that extremism
*  only goes away when you shine a light on it because leaving it in the dark will only allow
*  it to grow they gave me like 15 pointers um i didn't use any of those pointers because i'm
*  not the kind of person who wants to be media trained i like i like to speak freely but in
*  the promotional run for the film you know when i went on cnn this was a crazy experience so i
*  went on cnn and thankfully my friend was with me and so i'm on cnn and by the way your friend is
*  chilling in sunglasses laying in the couch right now that's larry it's like the
*  it's a mix of like the dude from big lobowski and uh uh the brad pitt role in uh true romance
*  yeah you know that reference no but i mean i'm sure it describes larry so like it kind of looks
*  like jack carwack yeah yeah so so hbo had a press tour set up for me and the main ones were cnn and
*  npr and so they said we're gonna you're gonna go on cnn on the don lemon morning show and he's
*  gonna ask you about your life what led up to the movie what we can expect so i get in the studio
*  it's about seven o'clock in the morning in new york at his show the night before at times square
*  so i'm like groggy eyed whatever they put the lav on me boom i'm live on cnn sunday morning
*  and he goes how would you describe enrique tario's mental state in the lead-up to the
*  capital insurrection and i'm i'm looking around i'm like is this guy serious like am i am i
*  sandwiched in the january 6th hit piece right now i thought it was about me yeah and so i told him
*  it's not about enrique tario it's about how companies like fox msnbc and even your station cnn
*  use the 24-hour news cycle to enrage people to generate ad revenue and pit americans against
*  each other during times like that and he said there's nothing fake about cnn i said i didn't
*  say you were fake news i'm not saying you're lying but you're directly antagonizing and
*  stirring people up against half the country because you need money during to support a
*  dying platform you said that pretty much nice and uh great you know i was so my mom was watching
*  and she was texting me she's like what are you doing and i was like i don't know and so he goes
*  why did you extend the platform to alex jones and i go i don't know i just wanted to drink some
*  jamison and lift some weights with him you know i'm just at this point i don't support that kind
*  of media i don't support cnn so uh you know i just i didn't give them much information about alex
*  but it was very awkward they never posted the segment online when i got off of that interview
*  uh i had a handler that a24 assigned to me so i had someone with me and she you could tell
*  she was flustered like she was furious about what i just did and so she goes i just got an email from
*  time warner c-suite and i go what's time warner c-suite she says i don't know if you know this
*  but the same people who own the same people who own cnn own hbo and it's time warner
*  and so they cancelled my press tour so my press tour was finished you know
*  all the late night shows that i was supposed to go on i was supposed to go on like
*  the late night shows and um that was off the table because they were worried that was like a loose
*  cannon i think and then the only remaining uh appearance i had left was npr in boston
*  and that was supposed to be a premiere so it wasn't supposed to be an interrogation it wasn't
*  supposed to be anything like that supposed to be a premiere in front of a live audience where they
*  watched a film and i show up after for a q a so i'm like all right whatever it's kind of weird
*  they only have this one press opportunity left i kind of felt bad that i ruined the entire press
*  tour by confronting don lemon but at this point i wanted to just do this final one especially
*  because it was a viewing and i was like cool i want to i sat in the audience i watched people
*  laugh to the film it was awesome so i go backstage and there's an npr journalist waiting for me
*  and nothing against people who wear masks but she had two n95s on and i'm not two n95s is
*  it's it's it's over the line so i go hey great to meet you she doesn't shake my hand and i go why
*  not and she goes you've been around some people who i don't want their germs yeah oh and i'm like
*  okay okay this is weird i thought this is a sort of like fun premiere for my movie we sit down
*  the first thing she asks me is how do you think the sandy hook families would feel about you
*  platforming one of the most despicable americans in history alex jones in front of a live audience
*  npr never published this the only recordings of it are by a fan named rob in boston who put it on
*  youtube vertical phone footage and i literally am like well the sandy hook family's lawyer mark
*  bangston who represented them in court in connecticut told me specifically that lennard posner
*  the father of noah posner who died at sandy hook was a huge fan of the film and so i said that to
*  her and that kind of just like silenced that conversation but the rest of the whole conversation
*  was just about exploitation and why are you platforming mentally ill people and giving a
*  platform to conspiracies like q anon don't you feel like you're a part of their spread
*  someone call you a misinformation reporter all this crazy stuff and yeah next day hit the fan
*  fuck all those people that film just in case you don't get a chance to see it and you should
*  you're critical of alex jones in the most artful way like it was the correct way to be critical
*  it showed him to be more interested in the grift of it yeah and you didn't do it in a like a pointing
*  fingers and like saying in the kind of npr way that you just mentioned it's but more like a
*  human way like this is tragedies happen all over the world and there's grifters that roll in and
*  then take advantage of it interesting ways and then human beings get swept up on either side of
*  it and it's revealing the humor the absurdity of it all and it was done masterfully it was done
*  like for people who criticize you for platforming alex jones or whatever yeah the film from a
*  political perspective is probably leans very much left yeah like heavily left but does it without
*  that exhausting energy of like judging right just this kind of you know
*  yeah two masks kind of judging yeah and it was just uh when all that was happening
*  when i was under fire from the mainstream press for platforming alex jones i thought back to what
*  he said to me and doesn't mean i agree with everything he says but he told me you're going
*  to be in trouble with these people if you uh put me in your in your video and you know it wasn't
*  too bad a trouble but definitely i do think sometimes what the film would have been like
*  without him and i think that it was worth it because his scene is so funny to me and it brings
*  me back to a different time in my life and i'm happy that that scene's out there i think it was
*  really well done it showed the layering of it all the entertainment plus sort of not considering
*  from his perspective the consequences of like rallying people up in this way that it's not just
*  i mean you really highlight this in the interview like it's he keeps saying it's info wars but then
*  there's always kind of a sense that info wars can turn to actual like civil war and yeah but
*  maybe not maybe it's uh all just a circus like we play for each other if you look at the speech he
*  did on january 5th it was said he said tomorrow you know millions of patriotic americans will take
*  our country back yeah so he eggs people on and then when it gets hot he steps away yeah but like
*  you said the thing he told you he turned out to be right oh yeah and the frogs are becoming gay
*  they've always been gay well saying frogs are straight is even crazier i've read stories where
*  you kiss one and becomes a prince and yeah that's true 100 percent you think alex believes what he
*  says in terms of the everything he says on info wars like how much of it is real he's right about
*  big tech censorship i think if he's right about anything it would probably be the heads of big
*  tech colluding together across company lines to deplatform certain people he's right about that
*  i think most of the things that he says follow the question everything narrative and then everything
*  is kind of like a conspiracy or like a plot or a false flag i think that he's built up a following
*  for so long that wants him to do that you know so i think he'll question things that he probably
*  thinks are relatively straightforward because that's the schtick of the show i mean the info
*  war is fighting misinformation and people want to see him be that guy to a certain extent if you're
*  a creator who supports your family you do follow economic incentives and people want you to be the
*  character and so you're going to naturally gravitate toward being it do you feel that
*  pressure yourself i did years ago not anymore i feel like now i can speak freely and really
*  say what i want to say in my new life but when i was younger yeah i feel like i had to be this
*  sort of awkward sort of amicable aloof guy who just didn't think anything about anything and
*  just was here to listen but now i feel more confident adding some narrative and voiceover
*  and things like that so for some people especially who publish on youtube the youtube algorithm they
*  can become a slave to the youtube algorithm yeah i mean for sure because and i definitely feel that
*  sometimes i know what works for me but i like to think that my audience appreciates when i
*  try new things so i'm not totally enslaved to it i mean yeah i try not to pay attention to views
*  or any of that well you get some high views so i'll report that for you so i wrote a chrome
*  extension that hides all the views on anything i create so you took it to that level yeah just
*  because it's a drug man and i'm also a number guy meaning like you give me like if i do 30 push-ups
*  today tomorrow i'm gonna try to do 35 just like enjoying yeah number go up like that's why i like
*  video games like rpg is like where you're like improving your skill tree you're like getting an
*  extra point and there's some aspect of youtube and other platforms anything at any other platform
*  you're like oh i got more today than i yesterday that's really really dangerous to me because
*  it can influence how much i enjoy a thing like if nobody gives a shit about it based on the numbers
*  you're like oh maybe that wasn't such a great experience i thought it was a great experience
*  but maybe it wasn't yeah honestly i do actually feel that way sometimes like i'll put out something
*  that i care about a lot but if the if it doesn't get as many views i'm like all right it must have
*  not been as as good as my high review videos or whatever yeah that's that's just like not true
*  though yeah and it might mean like on youtube that your thumbnail sucks or something like this or
*  whatever whatever the however the algorithm works but i mean that's the thing i'm battling
*  against to make sure i ignore all of that right it's actually something joe rogan has been extremely
*  good at he gives zero shits yeah and i think it's easier to do when you're really successful but he
*  was doing that when he wasn't successful really but anything he just follows like the stuff he
*  enjoys doing and legitimately enjoys it he happens to be really good at it but he gets good because
*  he's doing the things he really enjoys and like full on passionate about and that's why he'll have
*  like ridiculous guests and just yeah and just like just shit he enjoys doing yeah it's pretty cool
*  maybe i'll one day try to do that for now i'm too attached to like the gratification of getting a
*  million views in a day and stuff like that i'm not gonna lie to you and say that i've beat that or
*  something like well it's a worthy enemy to be fighting because it's a drug and it's one that
*  should be resisted for a creator because i feel like it can do negative stuff to your mind as a
*  creator oh yeah for sure anybody that controls you is not good a lot of people are controlled
*  by their audience they don't have to have a puppet master on a corporate level audience incentive is
*  a different type of uh i don't want to say slavery but yeah it is and that's why variety is good and
*  you're doing that yeah always expanding uh well let me just zoom out on this you made a film
*  yeah that's pretty cool yeah it was a great experience man i mean it was awesome working
*  with tim and eric awesome working with jona hill i feel the same about hbo and a24 everybody that
*  i worked on the film with i have a lot of love for and i appreciate the experience it's my first
*  movie it's a big deal like it's a good one in my head it's like i finally got to make the transition
*  from youtuber to filmmaker and that was always this psychic barrier that i felt like i had to
*  jump over you know there's a i mean just the way shot the humor that goes throughout it
*  just the the narration that you're doing in like a shitty director's chair
*  that's really well done whose idea was that uh it was actually tim and eric's idea there was a really
*  great editor named clay who works for absolutely and they did all the editing pretty much in the
*  office and so it was clay's idea to add a retrospective director's chair narrative arc
*  to the whole film yeah just like starting with the absurd fight and then going like oh that that's
*  a good way to start a movie just really really well done thanks man uh what about jona hill like
*  great guy he believed in this he did so was that what's that like what do you think is behind him
*  believing in such a wild project i think that jona hill has a good eye for like what's cool
*  amongst the younger folks like he's in the skateboarding stuff that's why he did that
*  film mid-90s and i think he probably saw a similar thing in what was going on with all gas no breaks
*  and was like shit this could be this could be big and so not only did he actually fund the film he
*  also gave me his agent and i forgot to mention that it was jona hill's lawyers that he gave me for free
*  that got me out of my contract eventually with doing things media or freed me up to speak about
*  what happened so he was also part of you kind of gaining your freedom yeah in a weird way like
*  even though him and i don't talk that much just because he's doing his own thing jona hill is
*  like a huge factor in my current success and just like everything that i've been able to accomplish
*  just on your own politics is it fair to say that your uh politics leans left i'm not really sure
*  sometimes you know i like to think that i am socially left like i think people should be able
*  to dress and act like however they want i don't believe in restricting people's social freedoms
*  economics wise it doesn't seem like leftist economic policy works very well on a city
*  city funding level like if you see what's going on in california it seems like the
*  the city leadership is mishandling the funds in california too so i don't know about that but
*  i don't know i don't really see myself as left or right i just never have well if you just like
*  objectively zoom out and don't have an insane standard of the extremes it feels like a lot of
*  your work leans left i tend to lead toward lean toward like the empathetic perspective
*  which i do think is more on the left and the right but also i'm not into like super like pc
*  stuff you know i don't believe in limiting free speech either i don't believe that i believe in a
*  free internet which i think is more embraced now by conservatives but it does seem that maybe you
*  can correct me but i get the sense sometimes that the left attack their own very intensely
*  it does happen but every community has terms of exile i mean look imagine think about what happens
*  in the conservative realm you know like when black rifle coffee company like denounced kyle
*  rittenhouse they lost a lot of money too like it's not the right attacks it's on too i mean think
*  about bud light and stuff like date i mean you know like every community has terms of exile you
*  just got to know who you're engaging with and you got to make that decision carefully it'd be nice
*  if there's an actual write-up of the things you're not allowed to say for each thing and then yeah i
*  wonder whose list would be longer it just does feel like the last list is a little longer if you're
*  a conservative and you have a t-shirt with like a demon on it like say goodbye you know i mean
*  they're you know there's certain stuff that they freak the hell out about
*  um and conservatives are really concerned about pedophiles yeah i mean i don't like
*  pedophiles either but i don't think about it all the time was one of the things you do in the film
*  is kind of confront one of the q anon folks where his concern is that everybody's a pedophile and you
*  showed to him calls himself a pedophile hunter and makes videos exposing democratic elite
*  pedophile kabbalist and is himself a convicted child molester there's an old thing that people
*  say that every confession every accusation is a confession to a certain extent so like it's it's
*  bizarre that some people's whole life after a big mistake will revolve around trying to seem like
*  the good guy instead of taking accountability for themselves yeah it's a common thing you see all the
*  time like neighborhood watch people you know what i mean like what made you that you know like what
*  did you do bro that you feel like you have to get karmic retribution by doing the reverse
*  sit on i don't get it yeah do you think uh to the degree of bias that affects your journalism
*  no but i mean with the migrant situation i don't know what was that covering that like i just got
*  a lot a lot of hate from conservatives for like letting the migrants tell their stories about
*  their journey and stuff well what did you learn from just going to the border i mean just the
*  sheer desperation that the the citizens of the world are in i mean there's people who truly believe
*  that america is the only hope for their success and to feed their family and i think a lot of
*  them are kind of getting catfished meaning america has its problems too it has severe problems
*  there's extreme poverty here but they're in america like if you just compare it to other
*  nations the level of corruption is much lower to where the opportunity for a person to succeed
*  to rise is is higher i wish success on everybody who comes here but my thing is the expectation
*  that they have and the sort of american dream propaganda they've been installed with isn't
*  necessarily a reflection of contemporary american reality so i'm talking to people who speak no
*  english and say i'm here for a better life i go where are you gonna go they say i have no idea
*  and i'm like man that's tough and you you almost think how bad are things elsewhere for someone to
*  abandon their family make this journey across multiple continents and end up here with no plan
*  and it just made me realize how sheltered i am to a certain extent as an american and going walking
*  back what i said a little bit because i was just trying to make a point yeah but what what i think
*  of as bad poverty like let's say west baltimore or ninth ward new orleans is nothing compared to
*  what's going on in almost half of the world if not more and so it just made me zoom out a little
*  bit sometimes you forget about third world poverty when you live here for so long and you get programmed
*  to believe the worst things that are out there is like kensington philadelphia or tenderloin
*  san francisco but those are just microcosms of more or less functioning cities despite what they
*  might lead you to believe philadelphia is a great place so is san francisco but there's places where
*  everywhere is really run down yeah like people focus on uh in major cities in the united states
*  like homelessness somehow that's a sign of a fallen empire right but you know that that's a
*  problem there's definitely uh it reveals some uh mismanagement of cities and i mean homelessness
*  in seattle and san francisco is for sure a result of the housing crisis especially post cobit and
*  all the gentrification that preceded it you know and it's unfortunate now to that the conservative
*  media is saying like look at biden's america as if biden created homeless people and it's just
*  disappointing because once again you're seeing the media use real issues that should concern every
*  u.s citizen and causing people to point fingers at a different political party as responsible for the
*  suffering of others do you think january 6th can happen again no i don't think so all the lessons
*  were learned yeah for sure i mean people got really screwed over i mean don't you have a sense that
*  there's a greater and greater growing questioning of the electoral process and all this kind of
*  stuff i think that americans overall are very comfortable with our standard of living i think
*  people like going to sonic and waiting in their car and getting milkshakes and people like going
*  to the amc theaters and they like going ice skating and mini golfing and going to the bar after work
*  i don't think that anyone wants a collapse of the basic structure of the country even the most
*  politically divided don't want to see 7-eleven go away we are so comfortable if you look at other
*  countries even europe look at how they protest and look at the arab spring those guys were talking
*  like january sixers and they actually took control of the government yeah you know and so
*  think about even if the mega crowd took over the capital building it's just a building
*  i don't know i just think that americans when they talk about civil war stuff it's just so
*  we're so far from that even if the rhetoric is as divided as it was in 2020 it won't happen again
*  for it to really happen it has to be there has to be a level of desperation there has to be a
*  level of economic desperation that's causing people to starve or some basic resource going away
*  water something like that who do you think wins trump or biden in the civil war well no
*  you know what's the guns in a game of mario kart no in the uh election 2024 oh man i have no idea
*  man i don't even know if i'm gonna vote it's weird that this is our choice i know i wish people were
*  more focused on like city politics like i'd rather vote like yes or no for a bike lane
*  in my neighborhood than i would for the president so local politics to you is where it is i think
*  the future oh i mean you can your vote actually matter let's say you have a community of 500
*  people and you live in henderson nevada you can influence whether or not there's a bike lane or
*  this is going to be a playground or you know an ampm you get to choose and you can influence
*  100 people to choose and boom this is your community you can't influence the result of
*  an election still that those at the presidential level it sets the tone of the country and uh so
*  trump running again and biden running again it just feels like there's going to be a lot of
*  questioning of election results i just can't believe those are our guys yeah i mean what is
*  that's really our guys like that's where we're at all these smart people we have in this country
*  great history we got joker gang versus gum gang where'd you find joker gang
*  well is he a legit juggler or is he just no no no joker gang is like a miami cuban guy
*  oh is joker 305 rawest chico alive so me and i have been following him for a long time on instagram
*  because he used to like uh post videos of himself like popping percussets and smoking
*  blunts on the toilet freestyling and so i had followed him for a while and then i finally got
*  this platform and i said oh my god i bet you now that we have a million followers joker gang will
*  sit down with us and lo and behold the clout did its thing and there i was face to face with the man
*  there was a controversy a year ago where a woman came forward and said that you were
*  pushy with her you respected and know you got the consent but you were pushy about it
*  looking back can you tell the story of that what are the lessons you learned from it
*  yeah i mean i've yet to speak on this for a lot of reasons mostly because it's just it was a hard
*  time and it's a sensitive subject and i've wanted to prioritize the reporting but i think that now i'm
*  ready and able to do so everything sort of started on um december 30 2022 and that was the release
*  date of the hbo project like i told you we didn't know when the movie was going to come out we
*  weren't told that it was going to come out on that date until early november and so i was like oh my
*  god here we go we got a movie coming out hbo had i didn't even know it was going to be them so
*  every day for those 50 days to where i received word and to the movie announcement or to the movie
*  release was like i was like a kid waiting for christmas morning you know what i mean it was
*  like every day i just i saw the movie release date as the first day of like the rest of my life
*  and so i remember the week of the movie release it was like every day i was like oh my god six
*  days five days four days and when it became two days like i was so excited and so like
*  honestly anxiety riddled because it was such a massive platform that i went out to the desert
*  by myself out in the mojave got a hotel and just kind of sat there and then movie release day comes
*  it was supposed to come out at um 8 pm pacific standard time i remember it was like 12 hours
*  left 10 hours left and then eight minutes before the movie at 7 52 or i guess it was sent at 10 52
*  east coast time i got a text message requesting a portion of my fat hbo check to contribute toward
*  apparently years of therapy bills that this person had accrued after
*  she says that she felt that i pressured her into giving consent years prior and i was confused
*  not only because of the timing but because this is someone that i hadn't seen in years
*  or spoken to in years and i presume that i was on good terms with um so i didn't respond to the
*  text message and then when i didn't respond about seven days later this person made some tiktok
*  videos and with the help of some friends launched an online campaign they got picked up by the press
*  pretty quickly so what did you feel like when you got that text well it's tough because on one hand
*  i'm not opposed to restitution being part of a private accountability process for real abuse
*  you know like if you've hurt someone to an extent that it took them out of work or something like i
*  think they're entitled to some money but unfortunately as i later learned this person
*  counsel and this was an attempt to basically create evidence by extracting a confession from
*  me to use as precedent for a civil lawsuit to the tune of a couple million dollars it's dark
*  yeah how did you meet this person well i met them when i was 22 and like i told you i was living in
*  an rv making the show called all gas no brakes and i would travel between cities like every other day
*  and so i would basically pick a new city and i got in this like pretty bad habit of what i would
*  say is essentially treating instagram like a like a dating app you know i would go to a new place
*  i'd post my location i'd surf the dms and i would look for like fans to meet up with it wasn't
*  always girls it was just people to party with because i was also partying every night but a
*  lot of times ended up being girls and stuff and so that's kind of how this situation was
*  um i didn't have sex with this person um had a consensual encounter that they reached out to me
*  about two weeks after saying hey i don't want you to take this the wrong way but looking back i felt
*  a lot more pressure to agree than i realized in the moment i don't think this is any fault of yours
*  i just think that you came on a bit too strong and i didn't want to let you down so
*  i gave in and it was that language made me feel horrible mainly because if this person had told
*  me hey i don't want to hook up i would have said yeah of course not well i don't want to hook up
*  with someone who doesn't want to hook up with me and i think that as fame increased during that time
*  i think i was just kind of oblivious to how people were seeing me especially those who had a digital
*  relationship with me prior to me knowing them and i don't think that i handled that the right way
*  well thank you for taking accountability but just to clarify you got consent
*  yeah i was the initiatory party in an interaction with a fan who felt that
*  she had to say yes because of i'm not sure why i don't know why but like i said this person also
*  disclosed to me they had a history of childhood trauma and were actively being treated for ptsd
*  and that they felt things move too fast for them given their situation and so i told her i said hey
*  if you want to reach out if you want to talk on the phone i'm always here for you i'm sorry to
*  hear that let me know if we can talk further about six months after that i was at sturgis bike week
*  and i remember this day this was the hardest day i was just chilling and i got a text from my friend
*  and said hey man you're getting cancelled right now and i was like what do you mean like did
*  someone find an old tweet or something what are you talking about and i opened my phone
*  and it was this instagram story of me it was like the ugliest picture of me you can find
*  it was like my face open that was like screenshotted and it said i remember this
*  specifically because i just couldn't believe it it said the ugly loser who hosts all gas no breaks
*  is a piece of shit he knowingly abused my friend and got away with it if you follow him i'm going
*  to message you and ask you why so this person who i don't know i didn't even know where who
*  that accusation was coming from they text they emailed every production company that i was
*  working with dm'd hundreds if not thousands of people like just saying that like i was this
*  piece of shit and i didn't even know who this person was so i was frantically calling and
*  texting like every person that i had seen intimately for the past year and being like hey are we on good
*  terms is everything okay and then i figured out that the person was coming from florida and i
*  knew who it was and so thankfully i reached out to the original person who i had the communication
*  with and i said hey like i think this might have been you this might have been your friend who
*  posted this are we good like i'm sorry i i apologized again i was like listen i feel bad
*  that you feel this way i want to do anything that i can to help you again i apologize and she said
*  apology accepted i'm sorry my friend asked if i could if she could post on my behalf and i'm
*  sorry i was going through a lot mentally and i saw your fame increasing and so i agreed to let her
*  speak on my behalf and um we let we made amends in private you know i said okay i'm here for you
*  let me know and she said apologies enough thank you for taking the time to speak with me and that
*  was two years prior to this text message being sent to my phone eight minutes before the movie
*  so naturally i wanted to go on my platforms and talk about what was happening but i also didn't
*  want to mess up the rollout of the movie you know and um so the the pr firm was like we got this
*  we'll handle this for you and that was i guess by way of a tmz thing that said andrew callahan is
*  devastated i'm not sure why they thought that that was going to make people be in my favor but
*  yeah it was just a picture of me on nbc that said andrew callahan devastated by allegations that
*  that was their plan i guess to show that i was remorseful or something you know how much of this
*  do you think lawyers kind of pushing this when money and fame are involved well i wish i could
*  say the lawyer but i just can't um that was involved in this but i will tell you that i try
*  to lean away from resentment and toward accountability completely what was my role in the situation
*  how can i never make someone feel like that again what can i do what changes can i make
*  to make sure that one i never treat someone this way and two to never be in that position again
*  well again thank you for taking accountability and the main reason i talk about that is because
*  it wasn't just that person there was multiple people who made videos reporting similar behavior
*  and so it's obvious that that was a pattern of behavior of mine and so i made the apology video
*  to announce that i was taking some time away because i just needed time away i mean my entire
*  support system collapsed my friends at the time disappeared i was getting like obituaries texted
*  to my phone they were like hey it's been nice knowing you it was great to see you grow good
*  luck you know like i was dead and uh yeah it got dropped from my agency no one gave me tough love
*  no one called me to ask me if i was all right it was just only everyone disappeared in a week
*  again thank you for taking accountability but i just hate how many cowards there are out there
*  like when people hit low points is when when you should help when you should stand with them if you
*  know their character yeah and it was just um it was hard to separate like the initial situation
*  that i knew was more or less a setup and the possibly genuine other accounts and so it was
*  like all right you know what at this point in my life i want to be on the right side of history
*  i don't want to be the anti-cancel culture mouthpiece i don't have the the mental strength to
*  fight this especially because i was envisioning the hbo drop to be this like the world opens up
*  to me moment and it was just the reverse but the uh it wasn't so much the the media reporting on it
*  that hurt me it was just little stuff like a childhood friend that you love seeing they
*  unfollowed you on instagram or just like seeing someone on the street that you grew up with and
*  like waving at them and they don't they don't do anything back and you're just like oh my god man
*  like this is my new life but what are you supposed to do thankfully i like somehow two weeks after
*  i met an amazing partner who i'm still with to this day and i was able to conquer my two biggest
*  fears which is monogamy and dogs i was terrified of dogs and terrified of having a girlfriend
*  now i have a girlfriend who i love and two dogs
*  so what were the what was the lowest point well right after this happened i entered like uh
*  recovery programs started with a but then i found a more specialized program that dealt with the
*  issues that i was dealing with say the hardest point was um
*  logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones would be better off if i was gone you know
*  what i mean and uh thinking that my mom and my friends that their life would be better if i took
*  myself out of the picture and um for one i just figured you know their friends canceled you know
*  her son is a disgrace you know my family is going to think they raised me wrong and my friends
*  i'm a social pariah now i'm a burden i'm better off dead and uh the hard part was you know i would
*  read um stories and books written by parents who lost their kids to suicide and they reported
*  feeling a lot of anger after the suicide so i tried to think of what's the way i can do it
*  to get the least amount of anger on behalf of the people who would grieve because hanging
*  someone will discover you so i figured that drinking myself to death would be the way to do it
*  and uh i wasn't able to yeah that was just a dark place you know i remember hating the people who
*  loved me because i knew they would grieve and that made me mad that makes sense like i was ready to
*  go i had no will to live but their grief was like i didn't want to cause that i didn't want to hurt
*  them so i was like i hated the people who loved me because they were stopping me from taking my
*  they were stopping me from taking my own life you know and uh it's weird to think that like
*  when i was going through that if you walk by me in the street i'll look like a normal guy
*  and so now when i walk around and i see people i think to myself you have no idea what that person
*  is going through you know like it's crazy that so many people are suffering in like complete
*  silence and you can't they don't wear it on them you know many of the people you talk to are probably
*  that yeah many people you've interviewed before all this and after are probably going through some
*  shit and i also thought if i could write down what i just told you on a piece of paper
*  and i was to to do it and then they found the note they would take it more seriously
*  seriously because they would know that i wasn't lying yeah but then you know if you do it it
*  reduces the lifespan of your parents by 15 years so i looked at it like i was taking time away from
*  them well thank you for the most part leaning towards accountability it's the right path to
*  take uh what advice would you give to young men uh that look up to you on how they can be good
*  men especially in regard to women if you have any kind of platform you know whether it doesn't have
*  to be famous on instagram it could be like if you're a pillar of your community in the culinary
*  world or whatever it is um just be hyper aware of that and remember that you are inheriting a
*  power dynamic that can create situations where there might be some pressure that you you don't
*  even realize is there but it's definitely there and you just have to be aware of that and two
*  um when when meeting new partners having hookups and stuff like that just try to have a trauma
*  informed conversation about their past really know the experiences and the backstory of what
*  a new partner has gone through in that world of intimacy whatever they're comfortable uh you know
*  to share obviously but you know i would advise against one night stands i would advise against
*  hooking up with someone um that you're meeting for the first time have those conversations prior
*  because even though it might sound like a vibe killer it's not and if you think that that
*  conversation is a vibe killer you probably shouldn't be in that situation in the first place
*  especially now how hyper sexualized things are and how common that type of violence is you need to
*  be able to have those conversations and stop and say hey tell me a little bit about your past is
*  there any triggers to make you uncomfortable let me know how i can be the best partner to you and
*  i'm sure that college-aged people are not having those conversations but i'm sure that it would go
*  a long way so especially when you're young college-aged you don't have enough experience
*  to be able to read a person without having that conversation there's a lot of times you can see
*  the trauma without explicitly talking about it that takes experience and knowledge and seeing
*  the world when you're young you don't know you really don't know shit making things a bit more
*  explicit is probably better yeah and also like as men were trained to believe that it's our duty
*  to be the initiatory party in any type of like sexual encounter like oh like man chases woman
*  you know what i mean like you know you have to be the one to make the move and or like she's playing
*  hard to get if you know she's resistant to your first like compliment or something i think that
*  that's not always how it has to be and that extra caution needs to be placed if you're taking the
*  initiatory role in an interaction especially if someone has a traumatic background they might
*  agree to do something with you because they're scared and you might not realize that's what's
*  going on but because you don't you don't see yourself as a predatory person you don't see
*  yourself as someone who would ever consciously make someone uncomfortable or cross a boundary
*  but people have histories that you might not understand and for me as someone who doesn't
*  have much honesty like childhood trauma or anything like that it's been an interesting year for me
*  working in therapy and elsewhere understanding how that affects the mind and also i understand
*  hurt people hurt people and that someone with a traumatic background isn't going to have sympathy
*  for applying that traumatic pain to someone else even if that person isn't the cause of
*  what put them in that spot if we can go back to channel five can you tell the origin story of that
*  yeah i mean channel five we during the august no breaks days we used to tell people that we were
*  called channel five if we wanted them to stop antagonizing us while we were filming because
*  every town has a channel five so when people were like what's this for if they were being super rude
*  and like trying to get in the camera and be hella obnoxious we would just say oh we're channel five
*  and they would be like oh my grandma's gonna see that and they would leave us alone so channel five
*  was a diversion tactic during all gas no breaks and it just so happened that we were in miami beach
*  one time and this kid came up like drinking liquor like you know trying to yell about like whatever
*  whatever they yell about in miami beach like titties or whatever and uh we're like bro this
*  is channel five be careful what you say and he was like for real and he just walked off and i said
*  to my friend at the time i was like that sounded pretty good right channel five and he goes it
*  sounds pretty good he's like that's got to be trademark though no it's not trademark yeah it's
*  crazy right there's a channel five in every city channel five ktla channel five seattle como news
*  dude channel five itself we own it
*  because no one's thought of something that simple because you'd think you'd have to specify we own
*  channel five dot com channel five dude we own it it's it's awesome so it was the same kind of
*  spirit as uh as the previous thing yeah uh what was the first one you did under the channel five
*  flag miami beach spring break i think i've seen that and it's gonna be a callback i think i think
*  um i think somebody mentioning eating ass there too that would be the place i believe that there's
*  only about five places in the u.s where people yell about eating ass all the time bourbon street
*  south beach miami sixth street in austin broadway in nashville and i'm just going to go ahead and
*  say times square you might not think it but time square really yeah they yell about us there
*  time square i would say bill street in memphis but it's not it's not good oh yeah i mean bill
*  street is like that the median age is too high on bill street for anyone to yell about ass
*  oh this is a fascinating portrait of america through that specific lens so miami beach and then
*  how would you describe your style of interviewing just now you've collected so many
*  if you if you had a style how would you describe your i guess before especially used to be like
*  deadpan now i would describe it as more directed but still relatively affable agreeable deadpan
*  interview style yeah there's a like in the face of absurdity yeah you're just like there with a
*  microphone there's a there's a comic aspect to it and that's intentional yeah i used to look at the
*  camera like jim from the office back in the day yeah i don't do that anymore what about the editing
*  like how do you think about the editing i still do most of it but susan helps a lot too it's my
*  associate uh yeah the editing style like i said we pioneered this editing style that honestly was
*  inspired a bit by like vick burger but we took it to real life crash zooms kind of chopping up
*  vocals a bit to add comedic timing where it didn't necessarily exist like you might add
*  like you might add two seconds of awkward silence that are built with room tone or you might make
*  everything really fast by cutting silence and switching frames i mean switching camera angles
*  but now we try to be pretty straightforward because we want to be taken more seriously
*  you know yeah sure what's crash zoom by the way a crash zoom is when the like it's artificial
*  zoom that you might add in adobe from here where the camera zooms in on someone's face
*  where the resolution is not there the resolution is not there unless you have a
*  i don't like a black magic cinema camera which you don't we don't we don't use those
*  the file size is too big the file that's still in constraint yeah all right and you also do
*  voiceover storytelling i think the first time i really did that was in the san francisco streets
*  video because there's so much content about san francisco homelessness tenderloin shoplifting
*  but there's not that much context in those videos about the history of san francisco
*  the housing crisis nimbism random zoning stuff that sounds boring but has a major role in the
*  current situation on the streets there as to why the tenderloin is neglected by police and by the
*  city council and the other neighborhoods like knob hill and north beach are so nice so i added
*  that purposely to the san francisco video and then also to the philadelphia streets video
*  to accentuate the reporting and add some historical analysis what's your goal with some of these
*  videos like the philadelphia streets one is it to reveal the full spectrum of humanity or is it also
*  to tell a story that's almost political well number one is always humanization that's the
*  primary goal is to take people in circumstances where they're often news items and remind the
*  public that these are people with lives and concerns and dreams just like you but secondly
*  we also want to start introducing more solution oriented journalism so not just oh my god i'm
*  becoming aware of how horrible this is but what can you actually do to help and as you can see
*  with the vegas tunnels video people are responding pretty positively to it like here's how you can
*  maybe help a homeless neighbor help get them an id help them qualify for housing or get a job at the
*  scrap yard there's always ways to help but so much of the youtube world is oversaturated by just like
*  endless videos of people suffering and the comments are always like wow so horrible but what does that
*  do for somebody you know uh you've uh interviewed many rappers yes educate me there's a lot to it
*  yeah uh can you explain this drill rap situation what what is drill rap evolving situation drill
*  began in 2010 some people say it was chief keith in chicago i think it was king louis in chicago
*  but i think all of it was very influenced by walk a flock of flame who dropped an album called
*  flock of ellie in 2010 it was like hyper violent adrenaline boosting rap music made by people who
*  were actually in the streets so in the 90s you had like if you had 50 cent you had rappers rapping
*  about like whatever gangster shit selling crack and beating people up but they weren't actually
*  doing it drill has a true crime component to where drill fans want to know that the person rapping
*  about catching bodies does in fact kill people so drill is uh it's pretty horrifying it sounds great
*  but it started in chicago then it spread to england and now it's bounced back to new york
*  it's just like the bronx and brooklyn specifically and spread from new york to the rest of the
*  country so now there's probably a drill rapper every 10 square miles so these are as opposed
*  to pretending to be a gangster and killing people you you get some credibility by actually doing it
*  yes and the fans are typically not in the communities that are affected by poverty so
*  they're kind of like superheroes to white kids it's dark and not just white kids but just anyone
*  who's not in the hood it's not necessarily a race thing there's white drill rappers too
*  slim jesus was a big one he's out of the picture now but there's there's white drill rappers slim
*  jesus um you made a video on oblock yeah what is what is oblock the place the culture the people
*  oblock is a housing project in south chicago in the englewood area uh where michelle obama grew up
*  it's also where chief keith was born and raised i don't know if he was born there but he was raised
*  there and he is the the forefather of modern drill music as we know it so these are the projects
*  where drill began it's also the first place where you have that intersection of drill music and true
*  crime because oblock has a lot of rappers and then nearby is an area called saint laurence
*  aka tukaville which has a lot of rappers as well and so these two rival drill gangs basically
*  have you know a lot of history and it connects to music at large so you've interviewed people there
*  what was there any concern for your safety no i mean i think that uh oblock
*  is has calmed down a lot for one it has security so you can't even really get in and out but two
*  i think that oblock's trying to rebrand itself a lot because it could be because little dirks
*  avoiding a rico charge could be for a variety of reasons i know you don't know exactly what that
*  means but little dirk rapper little dirk is from affiliated with oblock and a lot of people have
*  been murdered in retribution for killings that little dirk may or may not have influenced the
*  ordering of but anyways little dirk documented the killings in in no via rap music probably
*  okay i know you don't know about drill and but little dirk was associated with a rapper named
*  king von and king von perhaps paid for the assassination of a rapper named fbg duck who
*  got killed in chicago's gold coast neighborhood it's possible the oblock six are drill associated
*  not rappers but just shooters and they perhaps operating on king von's behalf when it killed
*  fbg duck king von was little dirks artist king von's now dead so there's a definitely a concern
*  that some of the fed charges will fall on dirt not sure if that's true but it's rumors in the
*  hip-hop community so oblock right now and when i film the video it's trying to go through a major
*  image rehab if you go on any instagram of anyone in oblock they've all converted to islam and so
*  they post pictures of themselves praying in the morning and have captions like put the guns down
*  let's pray so i think when i went there they saw it as a good opportunity to do a positive rebrand
*  and so i interviewed a rapper named boss top who was there all the way back in 2011 when chief
*  keith was coming up and so he basically ensured my safe protection but he didn't even need to
*  they're all very friendly and they know exactly what's up with youtube stuff i like how 2011 is
*  the old days like the ancient oh yeah the founding the founding fathers i was in eighth grade
*  oh man time flies when you're having fun it sure does a little dirk where's a little dirk now
*  atlanta so you left chicago not safe yeah i mean every rapper has to leave their hometown that's
*  what i did it's a journey seattle would have taken me out bro how's your i mean you do interview a
*  lot of people i mean that's like a top comment but it speaks to the reality of the fact that
*  you always find somebody rapping or you uh yeah you create the space for people to rap what's
*  that about i don't know man they're usually really good you think so i appreciate it well hell yeah
*  man i mean rappers in their own way since i touched a microphone rappers have gravitated
*  toward me i think there's something happening you're a rapper whisperer i think there's something
*  happening on a deeper cosmic spiritual level that lets the mind of rappers know that like
*  they have a safe place in front of our camera crew you have an interview with crip mac i do
*  he's a deal right now oh he is yeah is that a hashtag yeah for sure what uh that's an intense
*  interview people should go watch it people should go watch your uh all your interviews but that one
*  is pretty intense thanks um i was a little afraid for your life oh crip mac's the safest guy in the
*  world is a sweetheart oh definitely dude yeah but it's fun i feel like more safer on crip mac than
*  i do on with any given pedestrian yeah he was loud and flavorful yeah i should say so uh who's he
*  what's his story well his name's trevor he grew up uh in ontario california in the inland empire
*  moved to texas with his mom after his dad left his mom started started dating a cop from houston
*  named mr gary um his mom found mr gary getting you know anally penetrated by a co-worker and so
*  uh she booked crip mac a one-way greyhound ticket to la where he joined the crips
*  that's a good story
*  you know it's true yeah yeah of course yeah i'm just saying that uh you know he's a classic case
*  of somebody without a father figure who found camaraderie and you know sense of belonging and
*  purpose in a street gang which in la is like a rule of law in most of the city uh we were i forget
*  in what context earlier talking about martial arts and fighting and he's got to work in his punching
*  for him yeah i think so he gets into a lot of fights in jail though and from what i've heard he
*  wins like he does about half of them so it's all right what did he go to jail for now firearm
*  possession it was a probation violation oh it's too bad all right uh what so philly you went to the
*  border occupied seattle protests you went to ukraine yeah uh what's your favorite city
*  yeah uh what are some interesting things that stand out to you from memory just as i asked the
*  question some interesting i mean i was in jail at the border for a while that was horrible what was
*  that like was that your first time yeah well you know i didn't know that i couldn't hop my own
*  border as an american i'm thinking this is my country i can get in any way that i want wrong
*  you can only enter the u.s through an official port of entry which i learned the hard way
*  because i got arrested by border patrol and held as a detainee at a migrant center for a few days
*  what was the that like horrible which aspect i mean well for one like i don't know it was just
*  to be in a place like that and i probably sound like such a wimp right now because i know someone's
*  watching this who's done some hard time but we thought we were going to do at least six months
*  in jail because the the guards freaked us out and we're like you're being charged with a federal
*  crime you know what you boys did is serious we're waiting on word from san antonio about
*  whether or not we're going to extradite you so we're just sitting in these cells alone most of
*  the time in solitary with no pillows just to smell pillows no pillows no mat nothing just a space
*  blanket and i was sleeping on my shoes stinking up the place it was no good uh you mentioned the
*  ufo convention yeah uh what have you learned from those guys the ufologists i really want to know
*  what you think about that that's the one question that i want to reverse on you because you've talked
*  to so many people do you think that aliens have actually visited earth yeah when so when uh exact
*  dates i do i think there's alien civilizations everywhere i talked to a lot of people that have
*  doubts about it i just think i even suspect there's a intelligent alien civilization in our galaxy
*  and i just can't imagine them not having visited us so i lean on that what that actually looks like
*  i don't know uh the stuff we're seeing in terms of ufo sightings i think that's much more likely
*  to the degree it's real it's much more likely government projects so military
*  lockheed martin this kind of stuff so you think that they have knowledge of it yeah yeah one thing
*  i think about with aliens is scale so we have this idea that an alien would be a gray alien or
*  almost humanoid look alike that would visit us in human form arms legs head who's to say that
*  they're not able to shrink down to microscopic size with the same neural capacity yeah or just
*  have a very difficult to perceive form but i mean that they would go small not big no i think that
*  would take a humanoid like form just to be able to communicate with humans i think the big challenge
*  with aliens is to be able to find a common language so if you come to another planet
*  and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity going on but it looks nothing like humans
*  you have to find a common language and i think aliens would try to take physical form that's
*  similar yeah that us dumb humans would understand language is really interesting too i have this
*  series that i'm going to announce for the first time on here but i'm really interested in
*  endangered languages in the u.s there's like 150 languages in the u.s with less than a thousand
*  speakers wow and i want to like help spirit head efforts to preserve some of these like for example
*  hawaiian sign language 15 of those people left holy shit because when hawaii got annexed the asl
*  community tried to make it so the deaf native hawaiians wouldn't be able to speak their native
*  uh sign language and so they would do it under the desks at like schools for the deaf and blind
*  and they would get like their mouth washed out washed out with soap and stuff if they
*  um so much as did the hawaiian hand signs also the gulagichi language and the south carolina
*  sea islands hilton head island and stuff that's like a it's almost a creole language that's been
*  in the u.s for hundreds of years existing in isolation that's being threatened by golf course
*  developments i don't know how into language you are but i've been getting super nerded out about it
*  actually i'm interviewing somebody tomorrow who's an expert in human language he's from mit
*  uh studying the the syntax of a lot of languages including in the amazon jungle that's the
*  the peoples that live in the amazon jungle region yeah it's fascinating human language is fascinating
*  and also the barriers that creates and also how the games are played to what you're speaking by
*  governments this is part of the story of russia and ukraine is this is a battle over language
*  um the ukrainian language is a symbol of independence which is why they
*  they were trying to make it the primary language of the nation so sometimes the language represents
*  the culture and the peoples yeah it's intricately tied to the culture of the people i've been trying
*  to learn navajo which which languages do you know spanish and english spanish well see
*  i don't know spanish that well so that passes me yeah you're fluent basically yes oh it doesn't
*  hola that was good yeah that was real cancun spring break well i actually speak fluent
*  spanish according to spotify because there's a uh every episode is translated overdub by ai
*  in in spanish yeah there's a very spanish robot i have a spanish robot it's really it's i sound
*  like incredibly intelligent and intellectual in spanish they make it free man exactly uh
*  from everything you've done all the people you've seen do you think most people are good
*  underneath it all yeah
*  so the ones that do all the extreme shit okay i'll put it like this most people think they're doing
*  the best thing for the world i don't think anyone except for maybe a small fraction of sociopaths
*  wakes up every day and says i'm gonna fuck somebody's life up today i think the far
*  majority of people are fighting for what they think is right and do want to see america succeed
*  and want us to be in a happy place where no one is subjugated i just think people have drastically
*  different ideas of what means will get us there and unfortunately that's leading to a lot of
*  misunderstandings between cultures and yeah i think that uh most people are good i've been
*  through some things that leads me to believe that a lot of people though are primarily motivated by
*  self-interest and that in a fight or flight situation most people will choose flight
*  so i don't know if people are courageous as a whole but i think generally good but the energy
*  to stand up for what's right not sure about that there's the capacity though yeah to do good i
*  think human beings are inherently selfish as well but i don't think that you selfish is inherently
*  bad i think humans are primarily motivated by self-interest but generally have positive intentions
*  i do hope more humans rise to the occasion and have courage courage of their convictions
*  courage to have integrity but yeah i i think that most people are good and they want to do good
*  and they have the capacity to do a lot of good that's why i have hope for this whole thing we
*  got going on how do you heal the misunderstandings between people you think listening it's the only
*  option we have no forced education no like forced meetings or mediations between political opponents
*  just listen to more people and really listen try to get rid of whatever preconceived notions you
*  might have about how you should feel about someone you are supposed to disagree with and just keep
*  your ears and your heart open to people that you don't know and your life will change keep your
*  heart open a lot of people are scared to listen well andrew i'm a big fan and thank you for being
*  one of the best listeners in the world amen and showing the full spectrum of humanity to us so we
