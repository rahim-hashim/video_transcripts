# Paul Conti: Narcissism, Sociopathy, Envy, and the Nature of Good and Evil | Lex Fridman Podcast #357
**Lex Fridman:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRBksDVs4tg)
*  Narcissism is not arrogance. Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance. There is such a deep
*  sense of inadequacy and incompetence in the self that the defensive structure around that
*  becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.
*  The following is a conversation with Paul Conti, a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human
*  nature. My friend, Andrew Huberman, told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk
*  not just about the topic of trauma, which Paul wrote an amazing book about, but broadly about
*  human nature, about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy, good and evil, hate and love,
*  happiness and envy. As usual, Andrew was right. This was a fascinating conversation.
*  As the old meme goes, one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.
*  Allow me to also quickly mention that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode,
*  as I do in other episodes, even with experts. In part for fun and in part because I think the
*  tension of ideas and conversation is what creates insights and wisdom. My goal is to always empathize,
*  understand and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me. Disagreement is just one of the
*  ways I think it's fun to do just that, as long as I do so from a place of curiosity and compassion.
*  This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
*  And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conti.
*  Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study of the human mind and not just a set of tools
*  for treating psychological maladies? Absolutely. I think psychiatry is our best way to understand
*  who we are as people. It looks at our biology, how does our brain work, how does it connect the
*  parts with one another, how does the chemistry in it work. It's the very foundational aspects of
*  who we are and then it manifests as psychology. What do we think? What do we feel? What are our
*  strivings? What are our fears? I think psychiatry provides tools that we can use to help each other,
*  but those tools come through it being a discipline of understanding.
*  So with every patient you see, with every mind you explore,
*  are you picking up a deeper understanding of the human mind?
*  I think I'm trying to. I think we should learn, we should be able to take something away from
*  everything we do, every interaction to some small degree. Every conversation,
*  it doesn't have to be a patient, just anywhere. At Starbucks, getting a coffee,
*  you can learn something from that little experience. Yeah, even if you just reinforce
*  gentle kindness and gratitude and decent human interaction, there's a reinforcement of that,
*  that even if we don't take away memories or lessons, so to speak, we can reinforce who we
*  choose to be. So understanding ourselves from those interactions too, not just the general
*  philosophical human mind, but understanding our own mind, introspect on how our own mind works.
*  Everything we understand about anyone or anything else is coming through here, right?
*  Yeah, we're understanding others, we're also understanding ourselves. It's all feeding
*  through us. Yeah, but it's a tricky thing to step away and look at your own mind
*  and understand that it's just a machine. You can kind of control the way that machine processes
*  the external environment and the way that machine converts the things it perceives into actual
*  emotions, like how it interprets the things it perceives. You just sort of step away and
*  analyze it in that way and then you can control it. You can oil the machine, you can control how
*  it actually interprets the perceptions in order to generate positive emotions and be like a,
*  what is it, like a mechanic for the gears in the machine. I mean, I think to some degree,
*  to some degree, but the difference, I think, at least as I understand, I think of machines as not
*  being inscrutable, right? That if there's enough study, there's enough acumen applied that we can
*  understand whatever it is we're trying to figure out. Whereas part of understanding ourselves
*  is understanding that there are things we can't understand. And I think that's
*  indispensably important to health and happiness and also to having enough humility to see
*  how people can be different from us, how we can be different from ourselves at times. So knowing
*  that we don't know a lot and having some idea of what that might be, I think is an indispensable
*  part of the process, which I think is different from machines, I think. Yeah, the machines,
*  you're basically saying machines generally, because they're engineered from a design,
*  they're usually going to be simpler, therefore understandable. And you're saying the complexity
*  of the human mind is, at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.
*  Is there a meta-phenomena? What sometimes gets described as sort of levels of emergence,
*  where at increasing levels of complexity, you have novelty evolve that you can't predict
*  from lower levels of complexity, like for example, atoms to molecules, it's just one example.
*  I think neurons to consciousness, consciousness to culture, right? That there are meta-phenomena
*  that separate from the phenomena underneath of them and thereby add an entire aspect of novelty.
*  So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true, that we are all infinitely fascinating
*  because of these levels of emergence of novelty that are inscrutable because you can't predict
*  from one level to the next or understand fully are what make us, and not just us, but I think
*  sentient creatures, right? Human beings, right? But sentient creatures, inestimably more
*  interesting than creatures that aren't sentient. And I don't know, I think when we think about
*  machine learning and artificial intelligence, I think it's that that we're trying to create,
*  the levels of emergence that now we don't fully understand anymore, which I guess is both exciting
*  and maybe scary too. Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms, quantum mechanics,
*  go into chemistry, go into biology. From the biology, you have the functional phenomena,
*  especially as manifested in the human brain, and then multiple brains connecting together
*  through consciousness and intelligence creates civilizations. It's pretty interesting. Where do
*  you think the magic is? At which layer of the cake? Every layer. Because every time you emerge
*  from one thing to another, I see it as an analog, the concept of the dialectic, right? Where I think
*  it was Hegel, right? Who realized, hey, when you have like thing A and thing B and they're complicated
*  and they come together, you don't get a hybrid of A and B, right? You end up getting something
*  that's new, that's novel. And I think that describes to some degree what emergence is,
*  except there's a whole new, it's a universe of novelty, right? That comes in each layer of
*  emergence that allows infinite possibilities that weren't possible before. And I think that's why
*  we're so complicated that our functional neuroscience, right? Which I think is psychology,
*  right? Our ability to think about ourselves, about others, to be reflective is sitting on top of so
*  many layers of emergence. Like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants that we're,
*  each of us, our consciousness is standing on the shoulder of a giant of many, many, many levels of
*  emergence, of novelty, so many of which we don't understand. I mean, about subatomic particles,
*  everything that quantum physics means, when does time become important, right? As opposed to
*  things happening outside of time and outside of space, when do we slot into one temporal
*  perspective and then the complexity just, I think, grows and grows and grows.
*  Yeah, the interesting word you use is novelty. If true, this really blows my mind. In some
*  either shallow or deep sense, it is true. I'm trying to figure that out. I don't know if you
*  know something about cellular automata. It's this very simple mathematical object where you have
*  rules that govern each individual little cell and they interact locally. And then, you know,
*  you understand the very simple operation of those individual cells, but at another layer of
*  abstraction, when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision, these meta objects start
*  appearing that function. You could build a torrent machine with it. You can build an arbitrary
*  complexity of computation on top of this kind of very simple object. It's an interesting question
*  whether that was always there. The atoms somehow know about love, right? Like about consciousness,
*  about war and violence and evil and hate and all that. That's already laid in the possibility
*  of that, the capacity for that. It's already in the atoms. It's already in the physics. It's
*  already in them and in all the different chemistry and that builds up. And it's like even the origin
*  of life, still a mystery. That's known. That's in the physics. That's known to the universe,
*  the basic background physics in the universe. Because that's not the case. It's like, where does
*  that come from? Where's that magic? And how many layers can the cake possibly have? How many are
*  we going to keep building? If we're constantly through this process of abstraction, of adding
*  a layer to the cake, adding novel things, like where's the ceiling? As we expand out into the
*  cosmos, if we successfully can do that, are we going to keep building more miraculous, complex
*  objects? And then the brain is just a middle layer thing? We tend to think of ourselves as
*  a truly, truly special manifestations of what's possible in the universe. But maybe we're just
*  like the basic tiny building block of something much, much, much bigger. We're in the early days
*  of being a brick and a very large building. Sure. I think that's entirely possible. I think the only
*  emergent thing, so to speak, that we build is culture, the aggregation of us. So you have
*  individual human minds, which are entirely unique. Even the fact that time is different for you and
*  me. It may be by picoseconds, but we can engage because our perceptions of time are parallel
*  enough. They're close enough that we can share a reality. But we're all living in a different
*  dimension of time. We know that. So we're unique in that way. And then the unique individuals that
*  we are, just like the cells, start to create not just one thing, not just a culture, but culture
*  on top of our individuality, our uniqueness, our even dimensional uniqueness of time and experience
*  and consciousness. So we create cultures on top of us, but what could be beyond culture and what
*  is different from us, either on underlying levels like quantum physics or chemistry or biology,
*  or entirely different and unconceived, I think is it's an immense question. I think it's one
*  that should create humility in us. Look how much we don't know, and then how reckless we are with
*  ourselves, with our resources, with human life. And I think there it's important to say, think
*  about how entropy rules the universe around us. How over selected are we? How many, not just
*  hundreds or thousands of times, but how many millions of times does there have to be a
*  selection branch point before we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy, where you can
*  begin to create? Which I think is why I say, okay, do the atoms know about love? The fact that anything
*  is being created means there's this over selection for counter entropy where there can be a building
*  of greater complexity, of ultimately of novelty. And we don't often think about that, of how far
*  removed we are, maybe light years, so to speak, from any other location, temporally,
*  physically in the universe where this could happen. And we don't think about what does that mean?
*  Everything they just said, love, everything is counter entropy, goes against the way
*  the basic physics of the universe. So maybe actually the atoms really don't like what we're
*  doing. They want us to stop. They've been trying really hard to stop. And despite that, we somehow
*  started this whole bacteria thing for like a billion years and now we're here.
*  I actually think of it kind of the other way. I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness.
*  So why would anything be here if the drive weren't towards creativity, right? If the drive
*  weren't towards those subatomic particles not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,
*  right? Like we think is going on in empty space for light years upon light years, right? But is
*  there a design, either natural or intentional, for a schema, right? A scenario that allows for
*  the incredibly rare but not non-existent, any pool of counter entropy where good can happen, right?
*  Where creativity can happen, where ultimately something can grow, something novel can happen.
*  There's no novelty in the vastness of space, even though there's not nothing there. There's novelty
*  here because I think the layers of emergence start stacking very, very, very high when we're in a
*  place of counter entropy, which then could provide even thoughts about like good and evil, right?
*  The idea that creating, that preserving is good, right? It's what we build upon. It's how we get
*  to the eddy pool of counter entropy, right? So then destruction is not good. What good comes of
*  aggression and destruction, right? Unless we're protecting, or even you can think of
*  outlying cases, but just think in general concepts, right? Destruction destroys. It brings us
*  towards a state of entropy, towards a state of nothingness, whereas goodness, commonality,
*  collaboration, right? Nurturing, right? Brings novelty. It brings new existence into the universe
*  and I think we don't think about that. We're in the middle of something so vast and built on top
*  of so many layers and I think it leads us to be cavalier with human life, including often our own.
*  So you think there's an underlying creative force to the universe that might even have a kind of
*  built-in morality to it, where creating is better than destroying, and then that somehow maps on
*  onto our society, where we kind of try to figure out what that actually means in terms of good and
*  evil. So there's that, something is there like that, but it has to be, it's like so nice,
*  it's so perfect because it's rare. It's sufficiently rare where we have our own space,
*  like you can like close the door and like, I need to be alone right now as our human civilization
*  to work on my thing. So it's sufficiently rare that there's not other alien civilizations that
*  are just like constantly knocking on our door, destroying us, but it still exists. That's weird.
*  Right, right. It's so fantastically improbable that I think we should be very respectful of it.
*  I think you said there's a creative force that values creativity.
*  Yes.
*  Things will be, well sure, if it's a creative force, right, its existence, its ability to exist and to
*  create comes from something other than entropy, right? Something other than so much dispersion
*  that there's nothingness, right? So the creative force will value the sanctity of things, right?
*  Keeping things together, not destroying things, right? Building novelty, including novelty of
*  knowledge, novelty of sentience. I mean, it fits with the idea that we're not nothing,
*  that that's incredibly improbable and that there are these many, many layers of emergence that
*  we're standing upon. And I think it tells us something that we're not doing ourselves a service
*  to ignore, right? It's not just a jump to saying, oh, there's a religious answer to everything.
*  It's just, no, it's saying science isn't a God either, right? So if we think of science as a tool
*  and not as an endpoint in and of itself, what is the science telling us? Like, I remember
*  showing up at medical school and it really is true. I mean, I knew so little about the human body.
*  I'd only been in hospitals to visit people. I'd taken pre-med classes but sort of intensely at
*  once after I didn't take any and I was working in business. I knew next to nothing and I had this
*  idea that was so naive in retrospect that I was going to learn so much, right? I was going to
*  answer these questions because I was going, what's going on in the body? What are these organs doing?
*  What are these cells? And what I learned was there was so much more that was amazing and
*  mysterious and seemingly impossible. Like even how a cell functions, right? Like what is going
*  on inside of a cell? The transport mechanisms and energy functions and diffusion functions.
*  And then you can go down to smaller levels than that. But when you come back out and you say,
*  how all those cells make a kidney? It's not explanatory. You know, I remember asking the
*  OB who had delivered my first child, right? I was so amazed and I asked him like,
*  what do you think? Like, what do you know? You do this, right? You're seeing this life created.
*  And you know, and his thought was nothing, but I just marvel. You know, I mean, I get to do this,
*  but I just marvel at it. And I think the more we know about us, the more we respectfully marvel.
*  And we should do that. We should proactively marvel at every aspect,
*  at every layer that where the novelty emerges. Yes. We'd be a lot less likely to say,
*  hey, I don't like you because of something, whatever it is, you know, race, religion, culture,
*  sexuality, gender identity, whatever it is, you know, I want to say I want rights that you don't
*  have, right? Or I want what you have, right? I mean, there's so much of this. And I understand
*  it's driven by scarcity and by human insecurity and envy and all of these things that I think
*  drive us towards destruction. But all of that recklessness comes from not having this initial
*  appreciation and respect that you're referring to and just marveling at like, wow, okay, we're here.
*  That's amazing. Let's start with that. But if we marvel at this whole thing,
*  the human project, the human condition, that all the different kinds of human beings that are
*  possible, what do you then make of that some humans do evil onto the world? First of all,
*  are all human beings capable of evil? If we're in the process, now we've got a little bit of momentum
*  in terms of marveling at the layers of the cake. Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil
*  in all of us? Yeah. Is that capacity there? I believe that it is. Yes. So what do we understand
*  about the psychology of evil? Where does that originate in the human mind? Is it there in
*  your biology? Is it there in the environment, in the upbringing? Can I clarify first? I think
*  the capacity for evil, I do believe, is in all of us. There's a difference between enacting evil and
*  a sort of preset, followed, developed plan of evil. I don't believe that all of us are capable of
*  doing what the people who perpetrate the most evil do. But I do believe that we're capable of
*  of perpetrating evil. And the thought, one thought would be that there are drives in us. I mean,
*  there certainly seem to be drives in us towards survival, towards gratification,
*  in some ways towards pleasure. And that can get very complicated because pleasure inside can be
*  relief of distress. So if I feel very badly about myself, and I can feel a little better
*  about myself by making you feel worse about yourself, which that plays out in a lot of human
*  beings, is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure. So it gets very complicated what's
*  going on inside of us. And sometimes the perpetration of evil things can be through
*  misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity. I mean, there are things that we can have in us. And
*  other times there can be other things going on which are through the lens of unhealthy human
*  psychology. So for example, the psychology of envy, which I think drives the lion's share of
*  the orchestrated evil, right? There's a difference between impulsive, reflexive evil and highly
*  orchestrated evil, which I think is driven by envy. Highly orchestrated evil. We're talking about
*  a scale of societies like totalitarianism. So if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler,
*  so as a scale orchestration of evil, envy driving that. So I mean, that's really interesting to
*  think about. I'd love to hear more about it. So some of it, there might be some psychological
*  forces that are in tension with each other. So one is if you look at something like Hitler,
*  it's difficult to know what was going on in his mind, but it's possible to imagine if you just
*  look at dictators throughout history, that he thought he was doing good, not just for himself,
*  but for the people he believed have value. So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil
*  is by devaluing some group of people. And that could be all group of people. So it could have
*  sort of a narcissistic type of idea that you basically don't care about other human beings.
*  That's one. Envy is different. I mean, maybe they can collaborate together. Or even like you
*  mentioned, you can actually enjoy doing bad to others. That's almost like different because
*  if all it is is like narcissism, you disregard, you don't care how others feel, then you can just
*  make cold calculated military, almost economic decisions. And you don't care if a million people
*  die here or there. But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that, or there is like a resentment
*  that fuels it, it's not just cold calculation. It's like fueled by some kind of personal or
*  cultural resentment. I think it's all fueled by that. You think so? I think it's all fueled.
*  But I think the idea that Hitler thought he was doing good, right? It is like, that is such a thin
*  facade that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane.
*  Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Wow. That's beautiful. Yeah.
*  It's built upon, it says, I'll explain, logical lies, right? Because people can build lies
*  upon specious logic, right? So the idea that, okay, I am doing good because I believe that this
*  ethnicity of people is good and this is bad. And now I'm going to do this and I'm going to make
*  the world different and it's going to bring better to the world. And now I'm raising armies and I'm
*  building concentration camps. And I think like, this is all in the service of good is I don't
*  think anyone ever thinks that, right? Or they think that, but with, because they're living
*  in the surface patina, right? They're not allowing the hurricane in that blows away the handkerchief
*  and says like, this is all evil, right? I mean, how do you decide that some group of people is
*  good and some is bad? And like, what is it that you take upon yourself to play God or make decisions
*  about the world? And I think what really is going on is people are not doing that, right?
*  There's something cobbled together to say like, why this is right and this is okay, right? And
*  this is even good, right? But it is all a lie, right? It's a lie that's adorning
*  what I believe is the fact I believe that what's going on is the gratification of envy inside of
*  the person. And whether someone says, oh, I think this is good and it's okay if a million people die,
*  or I'm going to enjoy that a million people die, I think is the same. I think the enjoyment,
*  the gratification of the orchestrated evil is there and that it all comes from vulnerability
*  and insecurity. It all comes from deficits in the sense of self. Right. I'm going to have to process
*  that. My slow penny and PC is processing that. So envy underlies all of it. The psychological concept
*  of envy. What is that? I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess. That has nothing to
*  do, it doesn't have to do with Jews or Slavic people. Does it have to do with specific amorphous
*  other in his mind that he's envious of? I think it has all to do with him. All to do with him.
*  There's not a love of the people with whom he allied or even a sense of the people who he
*  persecuted were worse than him. It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him,
*  which was an intense sense of inadequacy, a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser
*  than. That's the difference. We can define words in different ways even within psychology,
*  but let's say we take the definition here of jealousy as being sort of benign, right? The
*  idea that, oh, I might see something that you have that I don't and I might think I'd like that.
*  Maybe I'll work harder to get it, right? Or maybe I can't get it. Maybe it's that you're
*  younger than I am. They say, okay, you have that and I don't. I mean, I have other things too,
*  I'm okay anyway. But I might want those things, but it's very benign, the jealousy. I'd like to
*  be younger, I'd like to be richer, whatever it is that we people think, right? But it's just a
*  thought and it's a thought that can result in strivings or acceptance, right? It's very,
*  very different. It's completely different than envy, which is destructive. It's a thought of,
*  I see something that you have that I don't have, right? And instead of me working for it or
*  accepting that I don't have it, what I like to do then is bring you down, take you down to where I
*  am and then I'll feel better, right? Because from the perspective of envy, it is all relative.
*  So is jealousy a kind of, because you said completely different,
*  but is jealousy potentially like a gateway drug to envy? Is it a slippery slope?
*  I think no, I think that jealousy is a natural, just part of the human phenomenon that we go
*  through life and we see like, oh, I'd like to have that. I think it's part of our incentives,
*  right? If I'm farming and I have one row of crops and I look over and I see that you're working
*  harder and you have two and I'd like to have two, that can make me work harder to have two.
*  You don't think it's a slippery slope from one to the other to, at first you're like,
*  I'd like to work harder, but then you keep failing and the weather sucks and you keep failing and the
*  other person becomes more successful. Plus he's got a new hot wife now, there's a nice tractor,
*  there's a field is all working. And then you get this idea that, you know what, I'm going to
*  steal all this stuff and I'm going to murder him. And that, you know, don't you think that's just
*  like a leap of the same phenomenon? No, no, because I think there are things that are in us as humans,
*  right? So the things are just by being human, like we can, for example, feel, we can feel
*  compassion, right? We can feel interest, right? We can feel jealousy in that benign sense. Like,
*  it's all part of just being human. If we start going from, hey, you have more crops than I have
*  and, you know, that seems like I actually have a better life in a lot of ways than I have,
*  I'm going to kill you. That's not, that is not a progression of something benign, right? That is-
*  Wait a minute, but that is a human leap of the same thing, isn't it?
*  Is it good? Because you're drawing a line, stuff you're saying like, this is the,
*  this human stuff, it's regular life, it's benign, but it feels like this benign thing is just a
*  low magnitude thing, version of the thing that's not benign. Like there's probably a gray area
*  where it stops being, but like jealousy, you can have like healthy jealousy, you can have a little
*  bit, slightly unhealthy. There's a, that's I think jealous guy, this John Lennon song that I love,
*  it's just beautiful. I mean, there's like, this jealousy inside relationships can make you feel
*  like, you know, could take your minds in all kinds of silly directions. And it's crazy,
*  but like, it feels like that, that's a next door neighbor to like being really crazy and toxic and
*  all that kind of stuff inside relationships. And then that feels like a next door neighbor. It's
*  like an apartment building. That feels like an next door neighbor that eventually gets to Hitler
*  with envy and resentment of an entire population of people. You're right. And there's a causal,
*  there can be a causal chain, right? Like if I'm not feeling jealous,
*  maybe I won't ever feel envious, right? So you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead to,
*  it can open gates to, huh, like how much do I dislike that you have things that I don't have?
*  Right? So yes, in that sense, but, and I think this is the part that I think is so important,
*  I think there is a disjunction, right? There's an asymptotic shift, right? From one thing to another,
*  because it is very- Now you're speaking my language mathematically.
*  Yeah. Syntotic leap, yep.
*  Yes. That's, it's a way to convey, right? Something that's entirely different, because if I start
*  thinking, you know, I'm not going to try and make things better, right? I'd like instead to harm
*  you. That's, that's qualitatively different. Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is? It
*  could be, I don't know what you think about this, but it's in which direction your motivation is
*  pointing. So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy, your sort of, the motivation says,
*  okay, I understand this feeling, I want to do less of it. I think there's, there must be a threshold
*  to which you actually want to do more of it. Like it becomes a vicious downward cycle. So that's what
*  envy becomes. Like the first feeling, this idea that I'm going to kill the farmer,
*  turns into like more and more and more, and you can't sleep and you're visualizing the
*  farmer and he becomes the devil. And like you have this very, you know, it's, it's a,
*  it's basically a thing that builds into the negative direction versus returns to the stable center.
*  Now a person is cultivating evil. Yeah.
*  Right. They're saying, Hey, there can be seeds of evil in all of us. Let me take that seed out,
*  dust it off, plant it, nurture it, right? And then grow that seed of evil, which will affect all other
*  parts of the person's life, right? They won't behave the same towards others in their life.
*  They'll become different as they nurture fantasies of evil, as they begin to create with inside of
*  themselves, the motivation and the will, right, to enact evil. The Hitler analogy would say,
*  you take someone who had a bad childhood, right? Who, who like was not loved, who was
*  taught and told that he was less than, okay, like that. We know that happens. I mean, that's why
*  child abuse is so evil, right? It's telling children the worst possible wrong lessons,
*  right? They're not good enough. They'll always be hurt. You know, they can't keep themselves safe.
*  They don't deserve safety. Right. So then you take someone who then nurtures that seed of evil,
*  which is a choice. And this is why I can't paint well enough and no one appreciates me. And I don't
*  like how I look and I don't fit in with the people I want to fit in with. And then, and on and on and
*  on and on and on. And there's a hatred of self through that lens of misery, of just being repulsed
*  by the self, but that's unacceptable to the self. So, oh, it has to be someone else's fault,
*  right? It's not my fault. Whose fault is it? Right. And then you see en masse the inaction of evil
*  towards groups of people who, who somehow in this person's mind, right, are responsible for his
*  misery. And there's the justification of evil. And then all the, you know, whether it's, this will be
*  better for the economy, this will be good. This will be that like that's all lies built to justify
*  the evil.
*  Those are surface level narratives.
*  Yes.
*  And the envy is the, the deep down mechanism that enables.
*  And that's the end point that's being served. What's being served is destruction,
*  right? Which is why it always brings more destruction. I mean, how many times do, do
*  wars that were started for purposes that we would look and say like that those were evil
*  purposes? Like how many times does good come of that? Even if we look at the modern world,
*  what comes of it is more evil is more destruction. And Hitler's outward destruction
*  eventually came inward. And, you know, you see pictures of what Berlin looked like after the
*  second world war, right? It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward as awful as that is. It's,
*  it's, it's catchy, right? Like people used to worry if you, you know, before the, during the time
*  of the Manhattan project, right? If you, if you start this chain reaction, you know, will you
*  blow the whole world up, right? Or will it stop within this bomb or not? And we see, okay,
*  the chain reaction of evil hasn't yet blown the whole world up, but look at the,
*  look at how the catastrophe spreads. And you think 50 to 60 million people dead in the second world
*  war, which truly was a world war. What destruction was spread around the globe.
*  And this is something that can't be stopped once the chain reaction starts. Like if Hitler was
*  successful, like it would just keep going. If he had been, I mean, on his personal psychological
*  level, I mean. Right. Cause we think from the perspective of destruction, success would have
*  needed, led to the need to conquer more than there's factions and infighting and then eventually you
*  get the same mass destruction, right? And, and never does the inaction of evil satisfy what the
*  person is initially seeking. Like people, people want to feel better about themselves, right? We,
*  Winnicott, who was a British pediatrician who wrote about children and adults from very deep
*  perspectives. He wrote about the idea of good enough, right? And then you can sort of extrapolate
*  that to like, we all want to feel good enough, like not just limp over the line good enough,
*  but I want to feel good enough that I'm a decent person in the world and like what I do matters.
*  And, you know, I can, I can have an impact on people and you know, people can like me and care
*  about me. It's, it's, there's a simplicity there that people want that when people don't have,
*  and there's certain other factors, maybe they're temperamental factors or historical factors
*  can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right? Through envy. And, and I think it starts with,
*  with, it starts with that. And it often starts in childhood, not always, but it often starts in
*  childhood when, when the child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable and, you know,
*  you see salient child abuse. If you look at what was Hitler's background and what was Stalin's
*  background, then I mean, you could, you could look at almost anyone who's perpetrated evil or
*  they're serial killers or whatever it may be. The majority, not everyone, but the majority had these
*  lessons in childhood that said, you're not good enough. You can't keep yourself safe. No one cares
*  about you. And, and in a subset of people that's going to generate envy and that, you know, that,
*  that seed of evil then gets planted and nurtured
*  as a fighter jet roars above us. The sound of a fighter jet above us.
*  You forget, you quickly forget the comfort of being in a peaceful place. That's one thing I saw
*  in Ukraine is, um, Hey, you quickly get comfortable here. The whole trip back,
*  I was thinking it's so damn good to be in America to hold just the whole, like,
*  it's like a three day trip back. It's so good to be American.
*  We might take that for granted as a population, but I do agree.
*  So the destruction never alleviates the envy.
*  Are all humans capable of envy?
*  I believe the answer is yes. If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us? I think
*  the answer to that is yes, but we have free will. We have choice. We can choose what we do with that,
*  which is why just because someone is a sociopath, you know, for example,
*  is it doesn't mean that they're not responsible. I mean, our, you know, our, our medical legal
*  jurisprudence has, um, has absolutely borne that out that legally, medically, we think, okay,
*  we're responsible, presuming we're healthy. We're not unhealthy in other ways that eliminates our
*  ability to, to, to be circumspect, but that we're responsible for what we do and don't nurture
*  inside of us. I mean, there are plenty of things we could decide to nurture anger and hatred
*  about. You know, I could think of slights, difficulties, whether it's something someone
*  else has done to me or I could blame fate or I could be mad at God or the world.
*  We can all make those choices and we're responsible for them or for recognizing things
*  in us that are like, oh, I, you know, I too have that in me, but I don't want to nurture that. I
*  don't want to foster that. Or do I choose to nurture and foster that? And I think ultimately,
*  you know, a subject of Hitler as, as evil, if, if Hitler had kept winning and winning, right,
*  I think ultimately he would have been the only person on earth. Right. And I really do believe
*  it. Ultimately, everyone, everything else would be killed because it's such destruction, right?
*  Destroy everything. Right. And probably when that didn't work, then there's the destruction
*  of the self, right? Because nothing soothes envy that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil.
*  And what you see is more and more anger and more and more frustration, which is why I really do
*  believe someone like that, who nurtured evil in themselves that way, ultimately would, would
*  destroy. They'd be like him in one other person, then he'd kill the other person.
*  I think that's really powerfully said, but even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,
*  I still think that it's the same flame. And, and these just the bigger version of it. So I think,
*  like, I just, in my own personal life, I've felt jealousy towards others. Like you said, like,
*  oh, this person has a, I don't know, a cooler thing, trinket, whatever trinket I cared about.
*  And usually it's when somebody is really close to the trinket you're building.
*  And I, I, early on, like in my teens, I realized that just, just empirically speaking,
*  that jealousy over a period of a week just doesn't feel good. And it's not productive.
*  It doesn't help me build a better trinket. Or it does if I turn it not into jealousy
*  towards another person, but into a love for building a better trinket. It's like, oh, cool.
*  Almost, you know what, like proactively speaking and later in life, like people like Joe Rogan
*  actually have been really powerful in this for me, just as a fan of his to celebrate other people.
*  So it's almost as opposed to ignoring that other person with a cool trinket. It's like celebrating
*  their awesomeness in my mind. Like just saying how awesome the humans are able to do that. And
*  actually just how awesome is that exact person at being able to do that. And that somehow made me
*  more capable to build my own trinket better. And it feels good also. Like it makes me feel happy.
*  And now you're not jealous anymore. You're not jealous anymore. Right. So that's why I think
*  jealousy is different, right? Because you're saying there's a week of jealousy, like, I don't
*  like this, right? I don't like, but if you take that in a way that says, wait a second, actually,
*  this is awesome. This is fabulous. And this person did this. That person's awesome, right? Then,
*  then you're not raining on anyone's parade, right? And in not doing that, even inside your own mind,
*  you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right? Well, if he, if he can do
*  that or she can do that, why can't I too? Like I want to build, I want to make the better trinket
*  too, right? Now you're thinking creatively nowhere in there, nowhere in there was the
*  emergence of evil. I just disagree with that. I think there was a choice made where I,
*  I looked at my, if my life was darker, more difficult, I think it has nothing to do
*  with the actual little flame of jealousy I felt. I think it has to do a lot more with the other
*  context. If, if I, if, if my life were more difficult, there was more abuse, there was more
*  challenges. I think that decision, I could have made that decision in a different direction.
*  Yes. Maybe I don't know. Yeah, you, you, you've written brilliantly about trauma. If there's a
*  bit more trauma as the background noise of my decision-making, I'll be more likely to
*  not be able to pull away from the gravitational field of that jealousy. And it would build and
*  build and build and build. So I think, not to disagree with a, with a brilliant person,
*  but like, I feel like that flame, that flame has the capacity to engulf the whole world. I guess
*  the initial flame of jealousy, the little bit, like, especially the younger you are,
*  it's almost like a habit that you get to build in either direction. Because I've early on built
*  the habit of saying, I'm going to channel that jealousy into productivity and into celebrating
*  other people. And that jealousy disappears. That was like a little discovery for me. I discovered
*  that. I get it. That doesn't come, nobody tells that to you. You kind of discover that little
*  thing. I could have easily not discovered it. I could have easily discovered that it kind of
*  feels good to, to like mess with that other person, to like think, shitty thoughts,
*  think negative thoughts, do negative things to that other person. Cause that could also,
*  I just think the capacity in that initial feeling is there. And I think it's a decision with me.
*  Cause like, otherwise I think it dissolves responsibility. Like, well, surely I'm not Hitler.
*  Therefore this jealousy is normal. No, I just feel like every jealous is the capacity to turn into
*  maybe not Hitler, but a toxicity that destroys in a small way in your own little private life,
*  but it could destroy. I agree that jealousy brings us,
*  can bring us dangerously close to envy. I mean, maybe, maybe let's see if, if,
*  if heuristic we could agree on, right? Let's see. So let's say, okay, if we look at the
*  terrain of the mind is geography, right? So if I'm feeling happy, satisfied, proud, like I'm,
*  I'm pretty far from, from envy land, right? Right. But, but if I'm feeling jealousy now, I'm, I'm,
*  I'm coming kind of closer to that border, right? And I still, I think there's, it's a big thing to
*  go over the border, right? That the border isn't a gray area, right? There's a border to go over.
*  And I think that you, I agree completely, one is certainly about trauma, that the more trauma there
*  is, because then the more misunderstandings there are about self and feelings that I'm not good
*  enough, and then that can be anger about why and who might be oppressing me and, you know, I mean,
*  I hate myself and everyone else who seems to be better. Like, so the trauma can drive us in these
*  negative directions, but we're still crossing over something, right? So, so if you have the trinket
*  and I think that's awesome, I want that, I want to work harder. You know what I could do though, is
*  I could sneak in tonight when no one's around and I could move something, right? No, no way. I don't
*  want to do that, right? But it's like I came over the border a little bit and I thought maybe,
*  maybe that's a better way, but then I came back, right? And I'm, and you're, we're responsible for
*  that, right? Because it is a choice to say, I don't want to work hard. I'm already working how hard,
*  I don't want to make my trinket better. I want to think mine's the best one. I could destroy yours,
*  right? Then, you know, we're letting our mind go over that border. And do we say, right, run that
*  forward, right? Let's run that forward and put people around us who feel the same way and start
*  doing it so we think less of ourselves and we debase ourselves. Do we run headlong in or do we
*  come over that boundary? And that's maybe the capacity for evil in us, that we come over that
*  boundary, all of us, right? At times. But do we come over it and then say, no, that's not my choice.
*  That's not my self-definition. I'm coming back. But I'm trying to justify, maybe there's certain
*  other sociological forces that help us cross the border too. So in Nazi Germany, we've been
*  talking about Hitler, but then there's also the German people. And so maybe when there's a bit of
*  a mass hysteria, so all these effects of like a combination of propaganda with the small jealousies
*  and resentments of the people that don't cross the border, together they can with great charismatic
*  leaders that sort of really fuel that fire that we feel when we're part of the crowd. So maybe those
*  individual kind of psychological barriers we have to take that leap from jealousy to envy,
*  those can be made easier. The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.
*  100%. 100%. I think that to me is a massive point. We're talking about layers of emergence,
*  right? So if there's individual consciousness, then there's culture, right? And we're products
*  of the soup we swim in, so to speak. People would say that when I was growing up, right? We're
*  products of the soup we swim in. So if the soup that we're swimming in is the soup of hatred,
*  then it's going to foster all of those things. So then you think about,
*  just in a painting with a very broad brush, the culture created in Germany prior to the Second
*  World War, and what was the impact of the reparations after the First World War, right?
*  Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment, and basically humiliation that people were feeling.
*  Okay, there were a whole bunch of decisions that impacted that cultural perspective, right?
*  Then there must have been aspects, just like I see in many ways parallels in America now,
*  of what are our standards for what we're communicating to others, right? How is the
*  media deciding? What's real and what's not real? What's true? What's not true? What's hatred
*  that is only going to do evil versus what's hatred that's okay because I might sell something by
*  putting it out there. I mean, that was, we know that was going on in Germany during the rise of
*  the Nazis. And I think there's a parallel to, do we value truth? Can we stand together and say,
*  no matter how much I might disagree with you politically, right? We can still understand
*  that there's right and there's wrong, right? There's truth and there's lies, right? So I think
*  those are just two examples of determinants of culture. And then the culture is a determinant
*  of, is someone like Hitler marginalizes, like that's a crazy evil person. Oh my goodness,
*  whoa, right? Or is that someone who gains a greater following and more adherence? And then
*  there starts to be a momentum because why? Because what the demagogues do? I think they
*  have a giant lasso and they harness the envy of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people.
*  That's right. You feel worse about yourself too. It doesn't matter what the reasons are. Maybe it's
*  your childhood. Maybe it's not, maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional, maybe it's
*  personal. It doesn't matter. Like you have envy too, let's put it together and do some destruction
*  because that'll make us feel better, which is a lie. So we've talked about envy. Where does,
*  from the leader perspective, things like narcissism or sociopathy, psychopathy come into play?
*  What can you make of the world we live in, maybe the leaders that run the world from the
*  perspective, from the lens of narcissism? So I am struck 20 years of doing what I do now. I've been
*  a psychiatrist for 20 years and I practice in so many different settings and I consult in different
*  settings. I've been fortunate to have a very wide purview of what's going on in people and in the
*  world around us. And I am struck with amazement that of all the things I see that are say abnormal,
*  let's say from the mental health perspective. This could be depression, panic attacks,
*  hearing voices, addiction, but there's so many things that cover everything that narcissism
*  is not frequent compared to a lot of other things. So it's small in terms of say narcissistic
*  diagnosis, right? It's much less than many other things, but it causes the lion's share. I don't
*  just mean the most compared to anything else, but I think more than 50%, the majority of
*  bad things, evil things, destructive things that I see in the world around us. I think
*  narcissists are wildly destructive because they are driven completely. They are lodged completely
*  in the lane of envy. Can you try to sneak up? And we don't want to be lost in definitions,
*  but can you try to sneak up to a definition, non-clinical definition of narcissism that we're
*  talking about? So narcissism is a deep pervasive and unquestioned sense of inadequacy in the self
*  that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability, fear of destruction, fear of
*  annihilation that is compensated for by aggression, by the mechanics of envy, by trying to make the
*  self seem better at the expense of others, by taking from others, by being completely cavalier
*  to the thoughts and feelings of others. Narcissism is not arrogance. Narcissism is the opposite
*  of arrogance. There is such a deep sense of inadequacy and incompetence in the self that
*  the defensive structure around that becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy. So the machinery
*  of narcissism is envy, but what do you make of the kind of more popularly discussed kind of symptom
*  of narcissism, which is a seeming not caring about other people,
*  sort of a very inward-facing focus in terms of the calculation you make when making decisions
*  about the world? Narcissistic people definitely care about other people. It's the people who are
*  schizoid and say that don't necessarily register other people. But narcissism, people care about
*  other people, but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self. If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice or
*  care much who you are. But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care because I'm watching every last
*  detail of you. What might you have that's better than me? It's an incredibly intense focus upon
*  individuals and demographics of people, but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,
*  which is why it can become easy to say, I don't care if a million people die. How different is
*  that from going out and destroying one person or a million people? It's in the same category
*  of those people only, their existence is only meaningful in how it relates to me.
*  But it's still meaningful. It just seems like a very difficult leap to take that I don't care
*  that a million people die. That seems to be, even with envy, that seems to be a big
*  feeling and thought to have if you at all care about them. Are other people, I guess,
*  tools for alleviation of your sense of inadequacy?
*  Right. I don't even care about being caring at all. I mean, caring about noticing
*  that a person exists. I mean, someone who wants money and notices that there's a $100 bill out
*  cares about that. They don't care about the $100 bill and that doesn't mean anything to them.
*  It's just thoughts and feelings, but it's going to attract attention. They care about it because
*  it's something that they want. The same way people will care about others, but only from
*  the perspective of, do you have things that I want or can I feel better about myself by taking
*  something from you by making things worse for you? People often talk about narcissism as the
*  opposite of empathy. But empathy, again, depends how you define it, but is a careful consideration
*  of the mental space of another person, of how the other person sees the world.
*  You're saying that narcissistic people would also be very good at that
*  in order to understand how maybe the other person can be manipulated or something to alleviate your
*  sense of inadequacy. Right. So there's a difference between the mechanics of empathy. So let's say,
*  and we can define things different ways. Let's say empathic attunement is the ability to be attuned
*  and to think, okay, what's going on in you? What might you be thinking? What might you be feeling?
*  Some people have a lot of empathic attunement, but we could look at that as mechanistic. It doesn't
*  equate to care. An empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not. So yes, people who are
*  narcissistic, they can mentalize well. So you mentalize meaning the ability to understand or
*  to consider thoughts, feelings, motivations in other people. So people who are narcissistic
*  can have empathic attunement or mentalization depending upon how we want to describe those
*  things. But that has nothing to do with care, with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.
*  So in that sense, empathy usually popularly used means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.
*  There's this, I need to read this book. I've read so little science fiction. That's been one of my
*  goals for this year to catch up on some science fiction. So Robert Highland from Stranger in a
*  Strange Land has this quote about love, which is love is that condition where another person's
*  happiness is essential to your own. So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy where
*  you're very sensitive, so mechanistically very sensitive to the state of another person's mind.
*  And your goal is to maximize their happiness. It's like essential to your own happiness. So
*  the happinesses are aligned. And when that's elevated to its highest forms, you can call that
*  love, romantic love, friendship, and so on. Okay.
*  There's one more thing about the narcissist is some people can be sort of benign narcissists where
*  they want great things for themselves, right? But if they have enough great things, they can
*  sort of tolerate others being happy too. And these are people who sometimes are actually quite highly
*  liked, right? Because they have to have the most money, the most power, the most of anything,
*  anything more than anyone else could challenge. But as long as I have that, it's okay that you
*  have some too, right? And then that can make you happy and can make you like me, right?
*  So benign narcissists can be well-liked from that perspective, but it's still all about them.
*  And that can change if, for example, there's a scarcity of resources now, right? But they're
*  generally, they're not people who are being overtly destructive, although that they're over the border
*  into the, you know, into the envy territory, right? Malignant narcissists are very different
*  where they then want to have everything. So even if I have a thousand times more than you do,
*  I still envy you what you have because I want to have, I don't think I can feel good enough
*  about myself unless I have everything. And once I have everything, I won't feel good enough about
*  myself either and then I'll have to have more, right? It's like that's malignant narcissism,
*  which we think of as sociopathy, right? We can define these words in different ways,
*  but they're very, very negative concepts, you know? That's profound sociopathy, malignant
*  narcissism, you know, envy writ large. So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.
*  That's a convenient way to think about it. No, because we can do sort of sociopathic things
*  that, but not be sociopathic, like, well, you know, you tell a white lie. It's like sort of
*  sociopathy on steroids, right? Is then, you know, envy writ large is malignant narcissism.
*  Well, just like you're saying, like, there's empathic attunement, as you said. So there's the
*  mechanistic aspect of empathy and sociopathy. And then there's the big label you get attached
*  if you're just doing that thing regularly, I guess. Living your life through that lens, right?
*  Yeah. And is there a nice spectrum that's like narcissism, sociopathy, and psychopathy? Is it
*  all the same kind of nice stroll through the woods, off the cliff? Not really, because the
*  words don't have clear definitions like psychopathy and sociopathy. There's no real definition of
*  psychopath or psychopathy. Or does that mean someone's sociopathic but psychotic? Like,
*  there's really not a, we end up using those words colloquially, right? Which is why, you know,
*  concepts that we can define, like, envy, empathic attunement, narcissism, even though there might
*  be nuances in definitions, like, we can define them in ways that are widely accepted, including
*  within psychology and psychiatry. So it's nice to just think about this broad umbrella of narcissism
*  and the levels to which it's benign or malignant, and then also separating into the different
*  mechanisms, like interaction by interaction, which sometimes can be narcissistic, but broadly speaking,
*  do you do everything through the lens of malignant narcissism that makes you a sociopath or a
*  malignant narcissist? Yes. And the thing I would add to that is the thought about culture, right?
*  How does the cultures we're in, whether it's the culture of a household, right? The culture of a
*  community, the culture of a nation or the world, right? How does that impact what unfolds in that
*  person? And then how does what unfolds in that person impact that culture? Well, that's the
*  question is what unfolds in that person? How does culture affect it? But how does your own
*  psychological development unfold that? Because narcissism in leaders is the most impactful thing,
*  right? Who are the most impactful individuals? Well, what is the most impact of individual
*  psychology we have? It's usually leaders of countries or leaders of major organizations and
*  so on. And one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism, that seems to be aligned with
*  success, right? If you care about your own success, that's going to be, you're more likely to be,
*  have narcissistic tendencies, I suppose. And so my question is when you follow that threat of
*  narcissism to become the leader of a country, now you have a lot of new interesting psychological
*  complexities to deal with, like power. That old cliche that power corrupts. Does that,
*  is it possible for power to corrupt the human mind to where it pushes you farther and farther?
*  Into malignant narcissism, into this destructive envy. What are your thoughts on power? Like the
*  effect of power in the human mind? Yeah. I think power is an accentuator, right? An intensifier,
*  right? So I think it is true that there are people who can be sort of in a gray area where there are
*  malignant narcissistic tendencies and behaviors, but there are also ways in which that person can
*  think outside of themselves and think in a broader way and think sort of kindly about others.
*  And they're sort of trying to navigate, whether they're aware or not, that they're trying to
*  navigate between one and the other. And then the allure of power is, well, just look, just exercise
*  that power and you'll feel better, right? It'll show you, right, that you're good enough. Look at
*  the power you have and whatever may be going on in the person's mind, that then power, yes, can
*  corrupt. Yes. I think that's why we have to have checks and balances, right? Because we are all
*  inscrutable to ourselves, let alone to others. So we must have checks and balances and we should
*  always have them on ourselves as well as on others. We should want that for the health of ourselves
*  and the world around us. So I think all of that is true, but there are also people who don't
*  necessarily become corrupted by power, right? There can be an understanding and a grounding
*  that they're a steward of power, right? A shepherd. I mean, the ways people describe
*  utilizing power and utilizing it in a benign way that then fosters the healthy aspects of self,
*  right? So like gratitude and humility, right? If we could add a healthy dose of gratitude and
*  humility to everyone or to our society, there would be a sea change, right? But how do you
*  feel gratitude? How do you feel humility? Those things are incompatible with narcissism envy,
*  right? With really the bad pole of things that we're talking about. And part of the reason I'm so
*  focused in my work and in really what runs through all of my thoughts about life is the impact of
*  trauma, right? Because trauma creates these false lessons and it walls us all from truth and it
*  starts to point towards the unhealthy ways of trying to feel better about ourselves. But we
*  have the health in us too. We have those seeds of health too that can grow into being a steward of
*  power and sharing power, being considerate and kind. And we see a lot of that in the world too,
*  right? It's not all just the evil. We see plenty of people who do good and who are generous of
*  spirit. And we have both in us and it is, I think you're talking about our culture and the
*  seeds that we sow and the climate that we set, including putting governors and boundaries around
*  like how do we reign in or say that the more aggressive, the more envious or destructive is
*  unacceptable, right? How do we foster the part that's kind and considerate and reflective and
*  slow to judge of like, hey, let's learn a little bit more. Like how do we foster that? And I think
*  a lot of that comes back to early childhood education. I mean, I think we don't do nearly
*  enough to protect children and as a corollary to that, we don't do nearly enough to educate
*  children. I mean, I want to write a book. The second book I write is going to be everything I
*  needed to know about life I learned as a second year postgraduate psychiatry resident. It's like,
*  why? Why then did I learn so much about unconscious motivation, about the impact of trauma,
*  about how we can be envious and how we can act out, even about how our emotions trump logic in
*  us? Why don't we teach these things when we're young enough to understand, like why is that
*  other kid bullying me, right? Or why just because I'm a little bit bigger, do I want to go thump that
*  other kid on the head? What's going on? We don't do those things. We're tripping ahead of ourselves
*  and we don't stop and think, how are we using our resources? How are we shepherding forward the next
*  generation, which by the way is a generation that's going to determine our fates too, right,
*  as we get older. But we don't do that. I often think of like in the Olympics, you see
*  like the great sprinters, right? And they've got to come out of the blocks perfectly, right?
*  So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast, they're going to fall over, right? They're
*  going to just fall forward. And I often see that in my head about us as humans and as a culture,
*  we're rushing so far forward, we don't stop and say, wait, let's keep the basics here,
*  the basic techniques of like how are we navigating forward in life? Or do we just throw all those
*  away? Because I can get some benefit by saying that you're bad even though what's being leveled
*  against you is wrong, right? Like why? Do I take that? Or do I say, no, there's something more
*  important here that we want to shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture. And I think preventing
*  childhood trauma and changing the ways that we educate children and adults would could again
*  make a sea change and maybe set us on a course towards even towards a greater likelihood of
*  survival as a species. Yeah. So talking to like people in elementary school about human nature
*  and teaching them how people can be resentful and envious and how to deal with your emotions,
*  how to, yeah, these basic interaction things about human relationships, about friendships,
*  about betrayal, about love, about all those things. Like it just, it's actually strange that we don't,
*  we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff. But then the parents often,
*  you know, need therapy themselves. The parents didn't learn it. I'm not joking that I was mad.
*  Second year after medical school, like how is it? Like I think of things in my own life and
*  how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide. Like I was already an adult, right? I was a young
*  adult, but I felt so much shame. I didn't, like I had no understanding that, oh, it's a reflex to
*  trauma, right? To feel guilt and shame. And that of course I was feeling that. It didn't mean it was
*  true because I felt it, but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed to the fact that I should
*  have felt guilty and ashamed. And it like led to some very negative things in my life that I had
*  to sort of pull myself back from and recover from. And like, I didn't know that, right? I didn't know
*  the automaticity of the reflex and how pervasive it can be and how it can put blinders on us.
*  And I mean, it's just one example, but it's an example of something big that happens to people
*  that we don't learn about. And I find myself sometimes having conversations with a person.
*  So, you know, I still do a lot of clinical care of having conversations with a person after a
*  tragedy. And I'm saying, I can't believe, right? Again, I'm saying the things that this person
*  didn't learn in elementary school, because like none of us did, right? And then look at the misery
*  and the suffering. And then I think this is one person among how many millions among us who,
*  you know, who try and go about their way without knowing things that are easily knowable,
*  because they don't even know that they're knowable because we don't teach them to ourselves.
*  LW So how to deal with trauma, the trauma happens, first of all, that suffering can happen,
*  and small trauma and big trauma, all of it can happen. And there's natural ways to deal with it.
*  So in the case of traumas, you write about, and we can also just talk about some more of the details
*  of that. But it's good to bring it to the surface to talk about it, to not be ashamed to hide it
*  inside, to be some kind of secret that it's actually I mean, there's a lot of positive things
*  to say here, at least from my perspective, one is it's discussing trauma and dealing with trauma
*  together with other human beings by talking about it is a path to deep friendship and intimacy
*  with those people. There's a dark aspect to trauma to war, that communicating it or sharing it
*  bonds you. So like the other side of trauma is like love is you need that hardship, not you don't need
*  it. But hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst for a deep human connection. If you bring it to
*  the surface is supposed to kind of hide it on the inside. If we can just linger on it, because you've
*  been through a few very traumatic events in your life. When you were 25 years old, as you mentioned,
*  your brother committed suicide. What did that event teach you about life, about death,
*  and about the human mind? What certainly brought me face to face with the truths of
*  life and death? Because I had not had a major trauma before then. So there wasn't a major trauma
*  sort of in my developmental years, that what can carry forward is a sort of omnipotence defense.
*  Right? I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers, we all have like an omnipotence defense,
*  which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move. And if I run into something, I'll get up
*  and do it again. Right? That we, you know, we kind of have to, and it's partly the protection of the
*  parent, et cetera. But we think we can get out there in the world and do things and we just do.
*  And if we don't have major traumas, we can sort of carry through the, oh, like bad things aren't
*  going to happen to me. You know, like they, I know that they're there and I know they happen to people,
*  but they don't happen to me. Right? And sometimes what will happen is being confronted with such a
*  tragedy, wipes that away very, very quickly. And then the person feels extremely exposed. Like, oh,
*  I thought that like I was going to be okay. And now I know that I'm not. And then, and that can
*  start to lead to, well, what does that mean? And now is this all coming for me now? You know,
*  did I get so lucky for 25 years, nothing bad happened, nothing but bad things are going to
*  be happening. Am I cursed? Is my family cursed? Right? And I think that leads to say what the
*  learning about the human mind in retrospect, I think I understood at the time to some degree,
*  but not like I do now. I can put words to it now. Right? Of like how incredibly important, powerful,
*  powerfully important negative emotion is, right? That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability
*  can just pervade our entire life perspective. So all of a sudden we're swimming in a very different
*  soup and it's a frightening soup and it's a toxic soup. And I'm most struck by that. And that goes
*  along with the idea that we're not taught that emotion always beats logic. You know, like I think
*  the idea of Descartes, the idea that we're rational creatures, you know, that kind of comes down to
*  us through Western thought is like completely not true. Like we're rational creatures only if there
*  is an emotion grabbing for our attention. Right? Like, you know, we're attending to one another.
*  We're being very logical. Right? What we're doing now, if we heard a frightening noise
*  right outside the door, like we'd be entirely different. Right? The emotion would trump
*  everything and say, stop paying attention to this. Right? Now safety is at stake and we think
*  differently, feel differently, behave differently. Right? And this is what happens to us, not just in
*  situations where something drags us from one emotional state to another, but it can be very,
*  very pervasive. So my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy, and then soothing in unhealthy ways,
*  soothing by drinking too much and then kind of hating myself in the first place and hating the
*  world around me. And then, you know, starting to think, well, who cares? You know, what happens?
*  Like, you know, there's some very dark thoughts and choices that came from a changed perspective
*  of self in the world. So what do you do in that? Because of trauma, again, small or large,
*  you find yourself swimming or drowning in a soup of negative emotion. What do you do?
*  What do you do with that emotion? I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma is,
*  I think the interesting thing is, you know, any one of us throughout the day can find ourselves
*  taking a bit of a dip in the pool of negative emotion. What do we do with that?
*  The first thing is to separate how we feel from what's true. We don't do a good job of that
*  as humans. If I feel bad about myself, it's very easy to then I conclude like I'm bad. Right? If
*  I feel ashamed of myself, I conclude I'm a terrible person who's shameful. Right? This is
*  the, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept of what they used to call an observing ego. It
*  still gets called that. It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right? It's the ability to step
*  outside and to see ourselves. Right? So that's what lets us keep the difference between our
*  feelings, right? And what we know to be true. Like we can be very angry at someone. So I think
*  that person's terrible. I think the person's stupid. I think that right now, because like
*  something negative just passed between us, this inside of me, it's just because of how I feel.
*  Like when I can separate that, how do I actually think about that person? Right? And, you know,
*  we get driven so, so frequently by how we feel because how we think, therefore what we believe,
*  right? Just kind of comes on its heels as if the feeling is dragging it along. And I've been struck
*  by that. It's one of the things that has struck me so the most, right? Among the very most in 20
*  years of working as a psychiatrist is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions, as if they are
*  truth. And then they create truth because we embrace what they're telling us as true.
*  And that is, I think, incredibly, I think it's how people learn prejudice. I think it's how people
*  learn self-hatred. I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors. And then the blinders
*  on us come in more and more and more and more. So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel
*  unless we understand that what we feel is different from what we know to be true or what we can decide
*  on one way or another. And that requires realizing and catching the emotions themselves, realizing
*  that it's an emotion. A feeling comes into your mind overtakes you, a feeling of anger,
*  dislike, hatred, all of that just comes in. It's like, why did that person just cut me off in
*  traffic or something like that, that feeling? So what you just kind of take it as a feeling and
*  realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent some deep reality about the world that's fundamental,
*  or you. They just kind of watch it and let it pass, which is the natural way of things.
*  Or decide if it means anything. If I'm mad, right, someone cut me off and I feel hatred and I want
*  to destroy them, right, to stop and think, look, I've got that in me. Are the stressors running too
*  high in my life? Like, is it really good? Should I be on this road 10 minutes behind schedule?
*  What am I really doing? So we can learn, but yes, it's an observation skill, right? And it's an
*  observation skill that we can develop. I often think of something called the tapestry theory,
*  which I think initially was a theodicy of explaining, I believe this is true, I'm not sure
*  of this, that the idea was that, oh, we don't see God's plan because we're up too close to it,
*  right? Like as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall and we're standing right up it,
*  we're only going to see one part of it, we need to stand back from it. And I remember learning
*  that in a religion studies class, I mean, really fascinated with that at the time. And I think that
*  there are a lot of things we do that about, right? And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,
*  what we're saying is, hey, like just the busyness of life or my own impulses or the pull of emotions
*  are trying to pull me upright close to whatever tapestry there is there. And I want to sort of
*  resist that. I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it, and then I make a choice
*  if I want to come close to it, if there's some really positive emotion or it's friendship or
*  it's love or it's nurturing, you know what, let me come right up to this, right? But I want to
*  choose when I'm doing that, I don't want some drive, I didn't decide to like take me by the
*  back of the head and put me up against that tapestry. So the interesting exercise
*  for me and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization is the internet with social media,
*  that it's almost like going to the gym or something like that, at least that's the way I see it,
*  because there's a bunch of forces on social media that are trying to make you feel things.
*  Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings, because there is actually a strong
*  gravity pull to negative feelings for some reason. And so the brain notices them more. I don't know
*  what that pull is, but it's there. And you get to observe it on social media. If you actually just
*  scroll through social media, you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.
*  And I just see it as a kind of exercise of like, you feel the pull, just like when you go to the
*  gym, there's a resistance and I practice like a stepping way to look at the tapestry.
*  And there's different mechanisms I think all of us have to learn. For me, there's a kind of,
*  you mentioned gratitude and humility. So like if somebody, if it's me personally, I've recently
*  gotten attacked a few places here and there. If they're saying that they're much smarter than me,
*  I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned. And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than
*  me. Those things like help me to kind of like pull away. And then maybe they have a lesson to
*  teach me. I don't take their sort of negative comments to heart, but I imagine the human being
*  and that they might have a lesson to teach me. And in general, when it's more amorphous kind of
*  negative feeling, I think the other thing is the gratitude, just like different versions, almost
*  meme-ifiable versions of like, oh, this is pretty cool. Like we got a thing going here.
*  There's like human civilization, like bickering and having a little fun, like lunch,
*  food fight. And it's kind of cool. Like we get to interact in this way. And there's a bit of humor.
*  There's like Thanksgiving dinner. Like Thanksgiving dinner, if you're arguing about politics,
*  it can feel like really intense. Like, I can't believe you said this, but if you zoom out,
*  it's like family. This is like, this is amazing. So that kind of feeling really helps.
*  But it's like, it really is like going to the gym. It's like building up a muscle to be able to
*  pull away from those emotions. I don't think I get to practice that kind of emotion regular day-to-day
*  life. Cause like, it's hard to get those reps. On social media, you can really get the reps in.
*  It's kind of cool. Like that's the way I see social media is a chance to sort of practice
*  that stoicism of like, of gratitude, of humility, of loving other people in the face of this negative
*  emotion, all that. Yes. And, you know, there's, there's a certain kind of psychotherapy that,
*  that talks a lot about this idea that like, Oh, everything is as it should be, right? Which
*  doesn't mean from some moral or justice point, it's just that often if you look at things,
*  one thing leads to another, to another, to another in a way that's actually very,
*  very predictable, even though we might be surprised about it. Right. And so an example,
*  so I would say that gratitude often does come along with a healthy pride. Right. So, so you,
*  you could say in the example you gave, Hey, I'm being assailed on social media. Okay. So you could
*  say, well, you know, there was a time I sat out, I, I set forth to impact people, right. To, to,
*  to be able to reach people and to impact them. Right. And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude
*  and pride that I've done that. Right. Because, because you did it because of your, your effort,
*  right. Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts, like you're responsible for it. Right.
*  But also you feel gratitude because any one of us who's here and has any opportunity has reason to
*  feel immense gratitude. Right. So then you can say, okay, what's actually going on here is something
*  successful. I set out to do something and, and I'm doing it. Right. And what it brings with it
*  absolutely includes being assailed. There's no surprise there. Right. That, that because of,
*  because, you know, people who have anything good serve as lightning rods for envy. So then yes,
*  there will be people who want to make up lies or whatever they want to do because you become a
*  lightning rod for envy by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do about which you can
*  feel a healthy pride and gratitude. Right. And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.
*  I mean, you're still going to make decisions about it, but it makes sense then, like you,
*  you have a mechanism of understanding it that not only makes sense to you, but reflects the truth
*  of what's, what you actually have done and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.
*  Well, I wonder if we're all kind of a little bit unique in this, because for me,
*  I mean, maybe it's useful to kind of talk through my own experience of it is,
*  for me, I try to avoid, especially in those situations to feel pride because
*  I'm just looking empirically. I feel way happier if I focus on humility. If I ever think of like,
*  oh yeah, you know, when you do something meaningful or you become more popular,
*  you're going to experience these kinds of, I feel the attacks more and it's like me versus
*  the world. That's the feeling that you start getting. And that does not create a pleasant
*  feeling. So to me, the pleasant feeling is like, uh, stepping away, like kind of laughing at it all.
*  Right. Like with a, with a smile and not like in a negative, like laughing at people, but just like
*  laughing at the theater of it, the circus of it, like this whole absurd existence we've got going
*  on. And then just having a humility in like, everybody has a lesson to teach me. It just
*  makes me feel good. The pride thing I do like feeling when, uh, in a positive pool of emotion.
*  So if I'm building a trinket and I finish it, I'm like really happy with myself. Like I finished
*  this thing and I usually actually like to do that alone. Like I don't need an audience for pride.
*  I like to sit there and just like, Ooh, this is cool. I did that, you know? Uh, but I just,
*  I find that in social interactions, um, pride is just a danger. I get this is a dangerous drug
*  for me because it like, it's such a small, it's a small step away from then losing all the humility.
*  And then you start getting very defensive and that's not going to, that's just, it starts
*  you on a spiral of negative emotion. Um, but I also, I mean, with, with everybody you've mentioned
*  this, it will probably sneak up to it in different directions. Um, I do think there's different
*  brains that we all have. Like my brain is exceptionally self critical, like nonstop.
*  It's like a, it's like an engine that's always there. And, um, but at the same time,
*  you're, I'm able to zoom out and have gratitude. And it just, it's, it's just, there's like two
*  brains and they're like cohabitating happily. And I can, uh, the better I get at this, the more I
*  can use the one that's self critical when I'm trying to be productive, cause naturally I'm
*  super lazy. So I'm trying not to be less lazy. I'll be self critical. And then, uh, when I'm not
*  being lazy, when I just have, there's a special moment, I want to enjoy that moment. I'll turn
*  on the gratitude engine. I feel like generic advice that people would give if your brain is
*  self critical. That's not a good thing. Like you should probably get rid of that. I don't know
*  about that because it seems to be working. Yeah. Like I kind of like it. I kind of like this
*  grumpy old man that's in there. That's like, like that thing you did that really sucked.
*  But I was like, and I kind of, you know, there's a movie, grumpy old men. Like I like, I like that
*  grumpy voice. The grumpy cat is in there and it's nice, but yeah, it can have a bad effects on
*  relationships and on, uh, maybe, uh, my wellbeing, maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.
*  So you have to monitor all this kind of stuff, but I don't know. I don't, I don't know which one
*  is like, cause you've kind of highlighted, it's good to have gratitude and humility,
*  but it's also good to have a little bit of pride. I wonder what that like
*  set of ingredients for healthy, what like healthy life looks like for each of us,
*  whether we have to customize and figure out what that is. Cause some of the cake is already baked
*  is the problem. And because of the trauma, like if I was like eight years old, maybe I could be a
*  little more flexible, but at this point, like you got the thing you got and it's hard to like,
*  you can do a lot with it. You could, it may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity and a
*  lot of pliability there across all ages. And people are different and there may be idiosyncrasies of
*  why one person is in a different place. But, but as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely
*  yes. I mean, people have evolved and I've worked with people who've really changed themselves and
*  broadened their conception and understanding, you know, they're in their eighties or, you know,
*  I think we can do it at any stage of life. And I would make a case for, for intra-psychics. So not
*  between people necessarily, right? But inside of oneself or the feeling of pride, and maybe if we
*  call it self-esteem, right? Let's say we call it self-esteem, right? Or we could call it healthy
*  pride. We could put either word to it. But if you think about what we're trying to avoid,
*  say a sense of inadequacy, then it is good to sort of own what's ours. We can put ourselves a little
*  bit out of balance, either in terms of building up resentments or in terms of decreasing self-confidence,
*  right? If we're not owning everything that's ours, right? So, so a thought, thought I would have about,
*  let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right? Is it can work against vulnerability,
*  right? Which we know can also in some situations push us towards jumping the boundary into envy
*  and all of that. So, so, so let's think about vulnerability. If you conceive, okay, people are
*  assailing me and you just go to a place of gratitude, you know, it can, it can send a message
*  that, okay, I'm just lucky and I hope I continue to get lucky as opposed to like, that's not true,
*  right? Like there's, there's, there's ability inside of me and discernment inside of me that
*  tells me I can have a greater sense of confidence that I'll navigate what comes my way, right? So,
*  because the pride or the self-esteem part is owning what we've contributed to the goodness we've
*  created, right? Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves. And it also helps us
*  feel armed against say the slings and arrows of, you know, whatever outrageous fortune may come
*  next. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Again, disagreeing with an expert here. Yes,
*  I think that's generally good advice, but I think you mentioned vulnerability.
*  I think it's like, I've just been doing a lot of research on rocket engines and fuel and speaking
*  of fuel, I just think I get a lot from being vulnerable because vulnerable leads to intimacy
*  in friendships and relationships. I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings,
*  just on a, on a friendship, on a, on a, like a ideal level in conversations and so on. And so
*  I would rather err on the side of vulnerability. Like to me, pride is destructive. I think I already,
*  I already have a pretty good engine that says like,
*  like, life is awesome. I don't need help for that. That's fine. That one is working.
*  It's the, it's, I just feel like the way to face the world that's full of uncertainty,
*  that could be full of cruelty is with humility and gratitude. I don't know. I did this pride thing.
*  It feels like I know that for a lot of people, it's really important to really,
*  um, really work on pride to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure of like,
*  they don't give into this insecurity that destroys them. But I just, for me,
*  empirically speaking, I seem to be happier facing the world with humility and just being grateful.
*  The pride I'm really worried about, like, I just, it feels more destructive than anything.
*  See what I think as you're telling me that, and I want to be presumptuous, but I make some
*  thoughts or some conclusions that tell me, hey, you're in a pretty healthy place. Right.
*  And the reason I say that is because I agree completely about vulnerability. I mean, think
*  about humility and gratitude make us vulnerable, right? It's like, wow, I'm grateful. Thank you.
*  I'm grateful for you. You know, we could get shot down or something, you know, something bad
*  could happen and something could make us feel bad. So, so yes, we, we need vulnerability. If we,
*  if we try and eliminate vulnerability, we're living miles into the envy, you know, land, right? So
*  you're describing a healthy vulnerability, but then my brain says that's because on the other
*  side of this, the seesaw, so to speak, has to be a healthy sense of self, whether we call it self
*  esteem or healthy pride. And then I'll cite what I think is the evidence for that is you describe
*  the negative voice, right? As like the grumpy cat, right? But that's a good negative voice to have,
*  right? Because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best. Like, come on, do better or,
*  right? Like, you can do better. Like this, you know, there's a negative voice in some ways,
*  but it believes in you. It's right. It's where that voice could be. It could be a negative voice
*  that says, you didn't do that well because you suck. You don't deserve anything good, right? Why
*  should you even be alive? Right? I mean, that's the negative voice that gain, you know, that can
*  gain so much force if there isn't a balance of healthy self esteem. So I think because you're
*  well balanced, you know, you have what you need and then having more of it seems like, oh, that's
*  not so good. But there are people whose negative voice isn't the grumpy cat. It's hateful, right?
*  And then that's a person who needs to bring that into greater balance.
*  Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat that's like a French existentialist, maybe a
*  little bit of a nihilist, but it's just kind of is- Sartre's cat. Yeah, Sartre's cat. So it
*  doesn't get hateful. It's not like a Hitler cat. So it's a little more, yeah, I guess there is kind
*  of like this line that we've come across a couple of times between the benign and the malignant.
*  Right. But of course you have to monitor that line. I just, I think you have to be careful
*  when you face really difficult situations of as you go on through life, more and more difficult,
*  you face a lot of loss and suffering, especially later in life. You have to be careful with that
*  voice, that grumpy cat can get awfully confident. And then if you don't have any source of positive
*  emotions in your life, it can become too heavy of a burden. Yes, which I think this leads us to,
*  well, I think is a really important fact, right? That there are some people, like a significant
*  subset of people who get happier as they get older. They have more contentment, a stronger sense of
*  self. You might think, how could that ever happen? Right? Like we're getting closer to death. We're
*  accumulating insults, right? Like everything hurts a little bit more and we have less energy and we
*  accumulate losses and traumas. Why would anyone be healthier across time, happier across time?
*  And what we see is it's linked to the things that we're talking about, right? It's linked to say,
*  let's say vulnerability versus pride. Like there's a good balance there, right? There's a lot of
*  humility. There's a lot of self-esteem. The person is spending a lot of time standing back from the
*  tapestry and looking at it, right? And what can come into people is in sort of a sense of equanimity.
*  Like I sort of understand, you know, I'm being the best person I can be. And that's not always
*  even great. And there are things that I don't feel great about even while I'm trying to do that. But
*  I'm being who I'm choosing to be, right? And that doesn't have to be in some big way. I'm not saying
*  that means any one specific thing. You know, that can mean the person who's taking care of their cat
*  and tending their garden. Like that's enough. We have to have love, the ability to put good things
*  out in the world, right? And to put our ability to work and be, to make things different out into the
*  world and make things better. And if we're doing that, we get happier across time because we come
*  to a sense of peace with ourselves. I'm not supposed to be everything. I'm not supposed to
*  do everything. I'm not supposed to fix everything, right? I'm also not supposed to suffer all the
*  time for the things I haven't gotten right. You know what? I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back
*  to Winnicott, right? The British physician of, you know, I'm good enough. And that seems to help
*  people feel happy, you know, contentment and be generative and productive into later life. It's
*  like, that's what we all should be wanting. But it's even, it's kind of an afterthought though.
*  Some people are like that as opposed to, wait a second, right? Like what's going on with them
*  and let's do all of that. Albert Camus writes in Mythos Cissophus, quote,
*  there's only one real serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Deciding whether or
*  not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.
*  All other questions follow from that. So basically to be or not to be.
*  Do you think there's a truth to that statement? This question of why live at all?
*  Do you think there's truth to that statement being a really, really important question for us to
*  answer? Yes. Yes. And what's the answer? I think the answer is yes. And I think Camus answered it.
*  Yes, too. You know, I love his writing and, you know, I think there was a streak of nihilism
*  that I think grew in his writing over the years. And the thought is, I think that Camus died by
*  suicide. I think we're not sure of that because it was a car accident. But I've always read that as
*  the primary scholarly opinion. And I think it's interesting that after his death,
*  a book called The First Man was published, which I don't know if he had intended to publish. I don't
*  remember the specifics about it, but it's about him as a child. And it's interesting, the first
*  man, he was the first man in his existence, right? The one that felt and experienced everything.
*  And there's sadness and distress and all in that book, but there's a beauty of life and living and
*  experience. And I think to compare that beauty, like that's life, even if something's difficult
*  and scary and sad, like there's something beautiful around the corner and here's a kind
*  person and a new discovery, you know, more what was in him as a child. And I think that we can get
*  jaded as we get, as you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago, we can accentuate the
*  negative and foster the negative and come to a place where we're looking for some in-depth
*  philosophical answer, you know, some thick book that's going to explain all that to us
*  instead of the simplicity that we've been talking about. I think humility, gratitude helps us have
*  simple, positive experiences, feelings of contentment, feelings of connection with
*  another person, learning, discovery. And I think the answer to Kemu's question is yes. And I think
*  it lies in his writing about when he was a child, which I think he saw as less important than his
*  later writings and the intellectual heaviness when I think maybe he had lost his way a little
*  bit from the things he understood when he was younger. So another way to talk about it, and
*  I'd love to hear what you think is about these broad categories. Let me be started with Kierkegaard
*  of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism. And I think Kemu considered himself an absurdist, not
*  actually an existentialist. It's kind of a middle ground where I think existentialists,
*  I don't want to characterize it in the wrong way, and there's a lot of different definitions,
*  but I think existentialists ultimately do think that there is meaning in sort of pursuing the
*  passion of life, like pursuing the most, like in living life. That's where you discover the
*  meaning at that individual level of fully embracing life. And I think sort of nihilism
*  is, again, it's kind of like a spectrum, but nihilism basically says there's no meaning
*  and it doesn't matter. Nothing matters. I don't even know, but somehow that lands you in a place
*  that's totally uninspired. Maybe nihilists would disagree with that. Maybe there is a way to live
*  a creative life in a nihilistic mindset. And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle where
*  pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea. So kind of I think existentialists say you should
*  be looking for meaning and it's to be discovered in your own actions, in your own life, in the moment.
*  And absurdism says life is absurd. Nothing makes sense. Don't look for the meaning. Just live. Just
*  I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of philosophy. I don't know if you can sort of comment
*  on these kind of nuanced ideas here. If there is no religious guide to your life, what do you think
*  about this kind of search for meaning? Do you see that there's some wisdom in the existentialist
*  perspective of discovering it in your own life, in this passion, in this kind of day-to-day existence,
*  in the moments of your life that bring you joy, that kind of thing? You're bringing different
*  sort of perspectives and trying to tease apart like, well, wait, what are the differences in
*  those perspectives? And I think what it points out is that, okay, we tend to conflate things
*  as human beings and to take two different things and try and make them into one. But we also,
*  I think on the other end of the spectrum, get very overly reductionist. And I think that when
*  we get too overly reductionist, we lose the ability to learn from anything or to generate meaning.
*  The thing about Sartre, who the thought of existentialism is so consistent with him,
*  who on the one hand wrote about very clear terms like, this is what it is and this is what it isn't
*  and here's how you're going to make your meaning in a very academically proscribed way. But he also
*  wrote short stories like The Wall, where something totally absurd happens as part of the story.
*  So I think what ends up happening is people either reduce themselves or get associated with
*  something that by being overly reductionist takes us away from meaning. The idea that, look,
*  we don't know if there is an overarching religious meaning or what we call a religious meaning or
*  purpose. We don't know that. So, okay, if we take that as a given that people who say that they know
*  are having faith, like how Spinoza described faith, faith is that you don't know, but you believe
*  anyway. It's not because you have faith now you know something, because I think that's
*  a slippery slope to the persecution of others. So if we say, okay, we don't know, then we're left
*  either deciding, okay, well then to hell with everything. There's that movie Strange Brew,
*  Bob and Doug McKenzie, where the brakes don't work on the car and one of them says, oh, why bother
*  steering? So if we don't know that there's meaning, why bother steering? Let's just give up the ghost.
*  I don't think that's even what the nihilists said. I mean, I think Bakunin said, we should get rid
*  of everything that we've ever created except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and start over from
*  there. But so even people who are very nihilistic or associated with that, a lot of them were just
*  not liking what we had built, right? So if we accept that a lot of what we have built as humans
*  inside of us and outside of us is really counterproductive and doesn't help us, and
*  that absurd things happen in the world, right? And that often the way social structures and systems
*  build themselves up is absurd. I think our healthcare system operates in a way that's absurd,
*  right? So if we accept that there are absurdities that we don't know if there's truth, then what are
*  we left with? But like, well, let's try and make meaning, right? Or Tega Igaset said, yo soy yo,
*  Amy Circunstancia, right? I'm myself and my circumstances, right? Which is like, look,
*  we can't control everything. We live in circumstances around us, but within those
*  circumstances, we can make decisions and define ourselves. And I think the brilliance of that,
*  and I think tying it all together, right, in a way that's not trying to be, in a sense,
*  it ties it all together by not trying to answer everything concisely. That yes, we can make
*  meaning. Like, we see that if someone trips in front of me, I could walk around them or I could
*  help them up. I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter what I do. I absolutely reject the
*  idea that, oh, I could step over them or on them, or I could help them up and it doesn't matter. Oh,
*  yeah, try being the person on the ground, right? So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances
*  and there are absurdities both within us and outside of us in our social structures. And there
*  are a lot of things that pretend to have meaning that don't, and there's the shades of nihilism,
*  but ultimately there's something going on here that's doing the best we can in the context of
*  just not knowing. Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic, I think, I tend to think
*  just observing the internet, the number of memes there are, I think many other people are like me.
*  I tend to see the humor in the absurdity. I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle. I see the
*  Kafkaesque nature of society, a different aspect of society, and just kind of notice the magic with
*  a smile and just laugh at the circus of it all. Because it is magical that the circus all comes
*  together. It's like a little bit out of sync and then just a guy playing trombone, but overall,
*  it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Right. And we can look at that and just kind of marvel and go,
*  huh, right? Which I think is a relation to at least a lot of what we in the Western world think of as
*  Eastern, right? It's like as non-attachment, right? Because then if there's something absurd
*  and it's like not good for me, you know, right? Then I accept that too, instead of getting angry
*  about it and railing about it or seeing some cosmic meaning in it, right? I think there's also a
*  healthy non-attachment in what you're saying too. So there's, I mean, you mentioned Eastern thought,
*  there's the Steyevski Nietzsche, but also Buddha, have kind of spoke of life as suffering.
*  Do you think there's truth to that, that suffering is a fundamental part of life?
*  I think it is a fundamental part of life. I don't think that means that life is suffering,
*  right? If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing that I'm trying to erase from my
*  mind, like the birth of my children, right? Like things that were filled with joy, right? Like life
*  is not entirely suffering, but life brings a lot of suffering. And for some people, it brings such
*  disproportionate suffering and the people don't survive the suffering. And I think when people
*  are conscientious and empathic, that really bothers us, right? The suffering in our own lives
*  and the fact that others at times could seem to be so overwhelmed by suffering that they don't even
*  get a chance to see good. And I think that there's, I do think there's truth to that and there's
*  sadness and distress to that. But to say, therefore life is suffering, I think is just completely
*  untrue. And it ignores the fact that someone even made a trombone, right? Let alone that there's a
*  little bit out of sync and someone's playing the trombone. That's cool. There's elements of the
*  absurd that you said are neat and interesting. And if we start accepting that we can't understand
*  or control everything, then we can accept and I think really love and foster the beauty in our
*  lives. Yeah, I think the word suffering is doing a little bit too much work because I think it's
*  probably referring to the philosophical concept of that. Yeah, that is absurd, the absurdity.
*  That stuff just happens randomly. Evil people succeed, good people fail. There's a seeming
*  random injustice on occasion. And occasionally there's justice. And yeah, all of it that feels
*  like, and maybe because often there's a lot of loss. And then there's a kind of matching
*  complimentary aspect to any good feeling that all comes crashing down. Like every hello
*  from a physics perspective ends in a goodbye. That's a really sad thing.
*  Like I've, you know, all the amazing people I get to meet in my life, all the amazing experiences,
*  eventually they have to end. And that's part of what makes them amazing.
*  Why is that sad? Is it because we're taught to think that it's like, look, at some point you and
*  I are going to say goodbye today. Like, I hope we're richer for it. And then we take that goodness
*  off with us. Like I want to celebrate that because it's all part of the goodness. I think we're taught
*  to think, oh, that's so bad. And it equates to death and misery. And I think it's often not that
*  way. I think there is a sadness to it, but I also don't think that sadness is a negative thing.
*  It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing. So there's a melancholic nature to it,
*  something passing of it leaving. It's that old Louis CK thing that I go back to over and over
*  from a show, Louis, where he was all heartbroken that he just broke up, you know, with somebody
*  he loved. And he told about that to an old man. And the old man said, you're a fool. That's the
*  best part. I missed that part where you sort of are lingering in that loss. You're feeling the pain
*  of that loss because that lasts the longest. It's the most intense. It's the most reliable.
*  And it's the kind of celebration of the love you had. Like losing the love is still a celebration
*  of the love. I think you don't want to over romanticize that, but there's some aspect of
*  truth to that. Like that melancholic feeling of remembering a beautiful time that's no longer there
*  is a kind of celebration of it and is a kind of joyful experience, even though
*  it's very easy to experience it as a negative emotion. I think it's just like you said, I mean,
*  it's up to our mind to determine how that emotion is really felt. But it's a tricky one because
*  it's like heartbreak to experience that as a positive thing. People can reminisce at funerals,
*  right? And laugh because people can be very, very, very sad and perceive that this person has died
*  and perceive the sadness of it. But in perceiving that and really living in it, then you can have
*  people who want to remember that person by telling a funny story. Why? Because each of those people
*  carries that with them. So I think what you're saying is consistent with healthy function as
*  human beings, because we're going to encounter sadness and loss. What do we do with that?
*  And do we do things that ultimately create some redemption or even reparation inside of us?
*  And reparation is a big word in psychology. It's how we repair damage and loss. So if we lose
*  someone and we're sad, can we, by telling funny stories about that person, remind ourselves that,
*  hey, they're still inside of us. Whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know, but I can
*  call that person of mine inside of us. And then we have something that's good and beautiful that
*  comes of that too. In the introduction to your book on trauma, Lady Gaga wrote it, she wrote the intro,
*  she said this about you, quote, I can now say with certainty that this man saved my life.
*  He made life worth living. This goes to our discussion about the mythicist Camus question
*  about why live. So I think, at least to me, she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.
*  So it's a difficult question, but a question of creativity. What role does trauma play
*  in somebody like that, in this artist that has created some incredible things? What positive,
*  constructive role does trauma serve and what limiting role does it serve in preventing that
*  person from flourishing more? Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity, right? Even to push
*  against or to protest against what the trauma tells us. Trauma tells us lessons, like nothing
*  matters and you don't matter and nothing will ever be good and nothing is beautiful. And we can
*  push against trauma. There is life in me, there's something, there's goodness for me to spread in
*  the world, to express and spread. So I think trauma fuels creativity in many, many, many ways.
*  Trauma also shuts down creativity, right? For people who are, for one example, trauma that
*  escalates to the point where now the person is soothing it with alcohol, one example. And now
*  the impact of the alcohol shuts down any creativity. So can people be creative and outward thinking
*  without trauma? I think sometimes, if I remember correctly, people will use Emanuel Kantor's
*  example, someone I think hadn't traveled much and didn't have trauma and like look at what he knew.
*  So, okay, there are going to be exceptions, right? But a lot of our creativity is in some ways fueled
*  by our suffering, although it's complicated because it comes from generative places in us,
*  right? So those places are there, they're not created by suffering, but maybe suffering makes
*  an incentive or a passion inside of us. And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to is just such
*  an incredible, astounding creative force. And sure, some of that comes from trauma, some of it comes
*  from trauma fueling the generative creative places in her. But what I helped her to do,
*  she's very generous with her words, but what I helped her to do was to see all that she is and
*  all that the creativity in her is and all that there is to create through love and caring and
*  love and caring and compassion and to again, see that. I mean, a lot of time that's what I'm
*  doing clinically. I think it's what's good psychiatrists or mental health professionals
*  do is we help people see the beauty that is there, right? Because oftentimes we're way too close up
*  to that tapestry and what brings us close is often the sad thing. So we're up close and all we see
*  is the negative. I mean, it's easy then to get classically nihilistic, but by helping someone
*  take a step back and to see who they are and what's in them, that's how people get better
*  and it's how people re-engage in life. It's such a difficult thing because if you were to,
*  from studying human beings, it seems like the optimal trajectory is having some trauma that
*  doesn't destroy you, that forces you early in life to really struggle with the intricacies of
*  the human condition and then later in life, as you form and you build an expertise around and mastery,
*  start to do exactly what you said, which is step back and look at the tapestry. So if you don't
*  have the trauma, it seems like just empirically speaking, there's of course just a huge amount
*  of data and all kinds of anecdotal evidence. I want to be careful here because maybe I'm
*  romanticizing hardship, but it does seem that hardship in childhood, if it doesn't break you,
*  can be constructive. It's like you said, having that trauma, one of the ways to fight it is to
*  say, I am worth something. David Goggins talks about this. I am somebody, I can be somebody
*  special and I'm going to prove it to you. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this big thing.
*  It's this engine that drives you forward. Yeah, comment on that because from a parent's perspective,
*  you want a child to have an easy life. You want them to not have hardship, certainly not have
*  trauma. That's such a difficult dance because in some ways, a little bit of hardship
*  and gradually increasing amount of hardship that doesn't break you can really develop you
*  into a really interesting, complicated person and it helps you flourish as a creative being.
*  I don't know if there's a question. I just keep saying random things.
*  No, I think it makes good sense to me. I think you're trying to get at, we need trauma and how
*  are we defining it? Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties. We could set aside,
*  we could set apart and differentiate things that are difficult but that are overcomeable versus
*  things that we could use the word trauma this way if we chose to that are just entirely negative.
*  Someone saying, oh, you can't do that and you'll never succeed because what? And then they tell
*  you something about yourself because you're from here or you're this race, religion, whatever it is.
*  We think, well, that could make someone say, hey, I'm going to show you, I'm going to overcome.
*  But then they're overcoming something bad. There's nothing good or helpful about that
*  if someone's saying that. So the person has to overcome it. That's different than something
*  that is placed in front of a person where the whole conception of it is something positive
*  that you can make through effort. I remember, I don't know, I think I was 15 years old,
*  there was some rule where you could then go, I don't think it was picking raspberries or
*  blueberries. And I think my parents wanted me to see, like, hey, go see how that works with you.
*  Now you've got 50 cents at the end of it. And then you think about that when you want to buy
*  baseball cards or you think about it and you work hard. And I could remember it was hard and I was
*  sweating and I was tired, but I learned from it. It's the reason I remember it today. So yes,
*  parents might want their kids to have a good life, but not necessarily an easy life. And I think
*  that was done, they took me to do that so I'd have a greater sense of responsibility in a sense of,
*  hard work is meaningful and it's important. And I think that that kind of thing is good,
*  but if we separate that from something that's just denigrating, prejudicial, I think those things
*  aren't good, but they're unavoidable. So it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?
*  I would look at it more that some trauma is unavoidable. I mean, it's hard to, how do you
*  go through life and not have any losses or anything negative or anything sad? And then
*  people are people. There may be people who have not a lot of that, and then there's a sort of
*  complacency and they don't do as much as they could or feel as good as they could. Then there's
*  other people who have a highly attuned emotional, there's people with very highly attuned emotional
*  compasses for which a little bit of trauma becomes so intrusive. So much of it is person driven,
*  but I do want to distinguish between things that are just purely bad that we might overcome or
*  find some fire in our belly about or whatever the case may be, and things that may be boundaries or
*  barriers either directly, purposely placed or not, that in a sense, invite us or inform us of the
*  possibility of striving and overcoming. Finally, in tuned emotional compasses,
*  it's so true that there is, that's a component of it too. It's almost genetic.
*  How sensitive you are to a particular trauma. So little things can have a huge impact
*  or gigantic things, serious abuse in childhood can be by some people overcome more easily.
*  It's not just what's the trauma, because what's the trauma that makes certain problems?
*  You have to match the trauma to the person. And a big part of what you're matching to is that
*  genetically based characteristic of how finely attuned is that empathic attunement to that compass.
*  So when you think about, let's just return to childhood, when you think about trauma in childhood,
*  what can we say about the impact of child abuse on the development of a human being?
*  I think the impact of it is so disproportionately bad and hurtful compared to things that happen
*  when we're not children. And I want to be very careful about how I'm saying that because people
*  can, through their strength and resilience and human interconnectedness, can overcome that.
*  I don't mean to say that anyone who's experienced those things can't make it through it or over it.
*  That part is not true. But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate to anything else
*  that can happen because the brain is formulating. So if we say psychology is like applied
*  neurobiology, and we look at both of those as different ends, even though there's a lot of gray
*  in the middle, the neurobiology is changed. So just one example of a much greater salience
*  of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection, mechanisms that can make a person
*  feel more fear and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world and not trust the
*  world. And I mean not trust the world even enough that, oh, I'd like to have a better job and
*  another one is here that I could take, but maybe it could be worse. And then being afraid of that.
*  There are all sorts of ways in which the changes to those pathways impact someone. And that's just
*  one of... We could bring trauma experts together that could talk about that for days. Like what is
*  the impact upon the brain biology? So that then gets changed inside the person. And from the
*  perspective of those changes, the psychology on top of it changes. Like what do I think about myself?
*  Do I think that I'm worthwhile? Even in my mid-20s without formative traumas and a pretty
*  strong sense of self and some achievements, there's a big trauma then with the death of my brother.
*  And I start questioning, am I cursed? Am I worth anything? I mean, I'm 20 something years old and
*  doing reasonably well at the time. How does this impact a child of six, seven, 10, 12 years old?
*  We're sending such powerful messages that then change conception of self and that negatively
*  changed conception sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology. And I think if we really thought,
*  hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general, for the human race, for species in general,
*  is we would handle children and caring for children so much differently in terms of protection
*  mechanisms, intervention mechanisms. How many times do you see where now there's been some
*  tragedy and the child gets a little bit of support and they had some therapy that was provided by
*  some insurance carrier that they got once a week for 16 weeks or whatever. I mean, we should be
*  wrapping our societal resources around children, but we don't use our resources well. I was just
*  reading, it's a little bit of an aside, but about 300 and something billion dollars a year in cost
*  to the US economy just from schizophrenia. And you think, it costs a fraction. What do we actually
*  put into caring for people who have schizophrenia? So first there's a moral imperative, but let's say
*  we put that aside and we only care about the economy, right? Because there are mechanisms
*  of thinking that look at it that way. How could we not amend that, right? But we are so reckless
*  with our resources and we're tripping ahead of ourselves that we don't think, oh my goodness,
*  there is no better place on God's earth for prevention than here. Prevention in terms of
*  human suffering and also where do people like that go? I mean, more often people like that go
*  to place of increased suffering, inability to take care of themselves or to be in supportive
*  relationships. Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that, but we're also creating the
*  pool of people through which the envy, the narcissism, the sociopathy, the destruction
*  arises. So again, if we care about people, we would be so focused on that. If we don't care
*  about other people and just ourselves or just economic costs, we would still be so focused.
*  But we're not and we tend to just kind of call it good because we don't see anything disastrous
*  happening at the moment. And I think there's a societal negligence there to the shame really
*  of all of us when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically and psychologically is
*  potentially the greatest cause of suffering directly and indirectly on the face of the planet.
*  How much does trauma of that kind and later in life affect your ability to love another human being,
*  say inside a relationship, connect with another human being?
*  It can impact it a lot. And again, I want to say, can people overcome and be as loving to a partner
*  or a child or anyone else? Yes. But we're talking across society, right? How are we setting the odds?
*  We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance, a decreased sense of self-confidence,
*  an increased sense of vulnerability, right? A decreased comfort interacting with others, right?
*  What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation and misery and depression and resentment. I mean,
*  those factors push towards that. We know that the research is so strong that
*  adverse childhood experiences, these things that happen, the more the worse, the more prolonged,
*  the more that person is up against as they try and navigate life.
*  And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy, like what we're talking about, is vulnerability.
*  And maybe there's a, is there a fear of being vulnerable, of being hurt again?
*  Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy? Yeah. If you're taught a lesson that says the
*  world is not safe and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe and you're not strong
*  enough to keep yourself safe, that's a final common pathway of the vast majority of child abuse,
*  or is telling those lessons to people. Then how can that not change the lay of the land
*  against openness, against the ability to rationally consider trust and mutuality
*  and to protect oneself, but also take chances and do the things that we have to do to create
*  the greatest happiness in our lives. We set the odds so much against that.
*  There's another pathway, which I think is really interesting because I've seen it in people,
*  is this kind of ability to detach yourself from feeling any emotions, to like protect yourself.
*  It's almost like you're not quite there. There's a word for it, isolation of
*  affect is a defense mechanism. Isolation of affect. Is that a common way, another
*  common way to deal with trauma? Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.
*  If there's been a major trauma, let's say someone has seen something terrible
*  and they're isolated from their affect, and at one time it was thought, well, maybe that's good.
*  They're not hysterical, they're not distraught, but we see that is not good because what needs
*  to be beheld, processed, we need to get our arms around in some way, shape or form has just been
*  separated off. We know that is not good, but isolation of affect can also serve us very well.
*  When I think back to being a medical intern in the hospital, you might have to go and
*  pronounce someone dead with hysterical family members. Then 10 minutes later, five minutes
*  later, maybe two minutes later, really, you have to go to another room and you've got to maybe do
*  some procedure that involves having your focus on a certain thing and making sure your hand movements
*  are the right way or talking to a person in a way that's very different than where you just came
*  from, that's very hopeful. Then you have to isolate the affect of what's going on around you.
*  It happens not just in, it's just one example, but we have to do it in life so that we can
*  put affect aside to process later or not feel the full weight of affect where we know the meaning.
*  I know the meaning of the tragedy of the person I just pronounced dead,
*  but I want to separate that for myself because I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy so that
*  I can then, okay, put that affect aside and go do the next thing that I have to do.
*  That I think can cut both ways.
*  Right, but then you have to reattach it. Understand that it's good to be close with emotion,
*  even painful emotion, because that's the human experience. I feel like if you build up a skill
*  that you can detach yourself from emotion, I think that can become its own addictive qualities.
*  It becomes too easy to do it and to reinforce. That's when people are suffering too much
*  over too long a period of time. Then we're creatures of habit, right? Even though our brains
*  are, you're talking about our brains are sitting on the shoulders of the giant of the maybe
*  thousand levels of emergence that come underneath of them, our brains are also
*  working very simple habit based ways. If you and I chose a word right now and said it 500 times,
*  we would know it's just a silly experiment, but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?
*  Because our brains are also creatures of habit. If you over and over and over have to isolate
*  yourself from affect and you develop those mechanisms, well, you develop those mechanisms
*  and they don't go away any easier than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.
*  We won't forget no matter what we decided. How do we find our way back? How do we overcome
*  trauma? What are the different pathways?
*  The first thing, the very first thing is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,
*  which might be one other person, it might be in words, spoken, it might be written,
*  what the trauma has been, right? Because the lessons of trauma, the evil lessons of trauma,
*  I'll use the example of my own life, the lesson that told me that I was shameful,
*  cursed and hopeless, right? It's a very evil lesson, right? But my brain will say it over
*  and did say it over and over and over to me. And if that just sits inside, that's how trauma
*  festers, that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions. So being able to say to ourselves
*  and to another, like this is what's happened, right? Okay, this is what's happened. We're built
*  to massage words and to create meaning through words, right? Like we don't massage pictures,
*  right? Images, we talk and massage meaning with words. So when I finally went to see a therapist
*  and I could say, you know, my brother, whatever words I would have said, like he killed himself
*  and I can't accept it or I can't imagine it and like I let it happen. So I have to say those
*  things, right? So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it, you know? And I think it
*  was a long time ago, but the therapist probably said something like, okay, probably season,
*  you let it happen. It's your fault, right? Because you got to get at those things so that one can
*  begin to bring into focus, what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean? I mean, a classic
*  example is the, what would you say to someone else example, you know, you'll say, well, I,
*  now how many times have I, it's just, I cry if I stop and think about it enough, you have to stop
*  and talk to someone who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own, who comes in and
*  tells the story they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault. They should have
*  walked home a different way, they should have dressed differently, they should have left earlier,
*  right? I wrote about it in the book over and over and over. Now you have a person who,
*  let's say you take a person who's intelligent, engaged in the world, who's like capable of
*  understanding lots and lots and lots of things, but doesn't understand that, right? If it were
*  someone else, that person would understand in a moment, that's not that person's fault, right? So
*  so what you want to do is overcome the fact that the negative emotions, that the hijacked emotion
*  systems of trauma are telling that person a lie and they're telling them so strongly and so
*  awfully, so meanly that the person just takes it inside and starts to see it as true, right? So
*  you begin to hold that up to the light of day. And again, one example could be, okay, so someone,
*  my person who's coming in next has actually been through something similar, right? And
*  can you stay and just tell her how it's her fault, right? And like, oh my God, no,
*  because I could never, like then they see, right? And again, this is not always how you do it,
*  but sometimes you can get a person to see like, well, that would be the most horrible.
*  How could you do that? Right? And the person can maybe come out there doing it to themselves. So
*  so you begin to put words in a structure and say, okay, like, let's look at what's going on
*  inside of you. You don't have to be scared of anything you're thinking and feeling. In fact,
*  the fear is in not exposing it to the light of day. That's where it gets the best of us.
*  And now, like everything is different. And whether that involves use of medications for intrusive
*  thoughts and depression, or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing, like whatever it
*  may be that comes next, the whole world has changed when the person has acknowledged what's
*  happened, exposed it to themselves and to trusted others around them and begun to look at it in some
*  way other than the stuff in an evil box place that the trauma initially puts us through our,
*  the reflexes it creates in us. It's interesting that there's power to just saying it out loud.
*  Right. So first saying your perception of it out loud, then in that case, that might be your
*  fault. And then working out loud, working through that it may not be. Any experienced therapist will
*  tell you this, that every now and then it will happen that someone will come and they'll say
*  something. Usually it's very early on in the process, they'll say something they've never
*  said before and they immediately are like in an entirely different place. And they may have been
*  for decades. Right. And I can remember a person saying that the coach had raped him and just
*  saying it, this was decades before and everything was different. I'm not saying everything is now
*  as perfect, but his life was in a different, but as soon as he said it, he could see how dare,
*  like he thought that person did that to this child. The child was me. He never thought it
*  until he said it out loud because his mind was going over and over with why it was his fault,
*  what he did to deserve it, how he kept going back. So it must be his fault. It was in it. As soon as
*  he put words to it, he saw the truth of it and it was a bifurcation in the path of life then.
*  And any therapist has stories like that, which just shows the immense power that it can even be
*  that just uttering the words makes just a cascade of change all at once. Just saying those words
*  to another human being. It makes you wonder what that compulsive loop that happens in our heads.
*  Until it's brought to the surface. It's so interesting.
*  Entirely non-productive, the loops. And sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?
*  Let me write it down. It can get rid of those loops in our brains. Any even thought of outward
*  expression is the enemy of those internal persecutory negative thought loops.
*  How do you find a good therapist? I tend to think of, listen, I'm a fan of podcasts.
*  I'm a fan of conversations. It feels like finding a good friend or something. It feels like a
*  difficult journey. Maybe I'm wrong in that, but it just feels like such a partnership, a journey
*  together versus some very simple clinical procedure.
*  The first thing I would say is to change the entire paradigm. Most people are like,
*  okay, I need a therapist. So people feel often like they're in a weakened position because they
*  need quote unquote a therapist. Then therapists are rationed. How many insurance panels have lists a
*  mile long of qualified therapists who could be on that insurance panel, but there's a certification
*  process. These things make no sense. The state's already certified the person, but there's so many
*  barriers to entry that now we're rationing this resource, which we should all stop and pause for
*  a second and think we're okay with that as a society. And by the way, everything else is like
*  that too when we're trying to get help for our health. So let's step back from that for a second.
*  Now it's a resource that's not in great supply and then a person begins to think, essentially,
*  I'll take what I can get. I just got to get somebody and I don't know enough to know anyway.
*  Those are very disempowering thoughts as opposed to saying, look, I'm going to be an empowered
*  consumer and I need to choose someone who gets over just some basic hurdles of what I think are
*  reasonable human interaction. So is a person making eye contact? Do they seem interested?
*  These are basic points about any human interaction, including a therapist. Then you can say,
*  is there a word of mouth? Anyone else has something good? Nothing better than a word
*  of mouth recommendation from someone you trust. Or anybody can have a good website, but you say,
*  let me look at the website. What is it saying if there is one? Does it resonate with me or not?
*  But after all of that, then you go to see the person with the idea that you're interviewing them,
*  right? The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me and if so, great, I'm with the program,
*  but I'm thinking about it. Do I want this person? Do I feel heard? Do I feel cared for?
*  Which doesn't mean, is it easy? It might mean, is it hard? I leave and I feel emotional for a couple
*  of days, but I see that I'm facing new things. This process of assessment so that one isn't
*  settling for something that is formulaic, over-packaged. I'm not trying to be overly
*  critical of therapists. There are people everywhere who do their jobs well and people
*  who don't do their jobs well, but most therapists are working in systems that push against doing
*  the job well, right? Because they're rationing care and there's a lot of number of sessions and
*  there's enough time before a person can return. So often it's an uphill battle because we're
*  trying to be helped within systems we've created and tolerate that are pushing against helping us.
*  Yeah, but that interview process is tricky. I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally,
*  just like with any kind of interview, it's hard not to think that a failed interaction, failed interview,
*  that there's something wrong with you. Sure, right. There is an authority to a therapist,
*  I think, where you think like, they've got it all figured out. Right. And I'm a mess and therefore,
*  if there's something off, it's all my fault. All right. So it's a very tricky and it's easy
*  to then give up. And then, cause it's like the step to try to get a therapist, the first like step
*  to get help, if I get therapists, like any kind of help, that's a big leap to take.
*  Especially when you're in a rough place. I agree completely. We should not make people
*  swim against such a strong current to get their needs met. I mean, we see this in such obvious
*  places where you have an elderly homebound person who can't get their medicine because, oh, there's
*  been some change and they didn't put the new number into the form or Lord knows what. I mean,
*  it's incredible how we force people to swim against strong currents to get things that are
*  just basic at times for their survival. And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect for
*  where healthcare is at or where mental health is at. The field that I work in has accepted
*  all sorts of aspects of how things go. Someone else controlling how long the interaction can go
*  on, how the interaction is bounded, what can be said and done, what medicines can be prescribed.
*  There's so many external controls in the systems we work in that we, and I say me included, like all
*  of us in the field have let it get to a place where it's obscenely difficult to get help.
*  Obscenely difficult. And we should say that's not okay. I think psychiatrists and therapists and
*  masters level social workers, psychologists and you name it, I think we should all say this is not
*  okay. And then we as a society should be saying this is not okay. Otherwise what you're saying,
*  which is I think completely true, will only become worse as there are more and more barriers
*  to getting the help a person needs. And each time a person isn't helped, it sets the odds against
*  them getting more help. I should say here that when I started working, there were times I would
*  send people to an emergency room, right? If there was some emergency, you know, emergency in their
*  mental health and they were at risk. And there were times I'd send somebody to an emergency room
*  where if you stopped and looked, it would have been malpractice not to do that. Right? Now it's not
*  just me who has an incredibly high threshold for sending someone to an emergency room because you
*  just send someone who's in a lot of distress and oftentimes they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway
*  or they're locked in a small white room and all they had was depression. You know, they're scared
*  when they go in and 36 hours later, oh, they're feeling a little better. Wikes are desperate to
*  get out of there and someone sends them home. I mean, so our systems have shifted so much that
*  we tolerate now en masse what is egregious to the individual. So you are a psychiatrist in terms of
*  doing therapy, psychotherapy. What does a successful interaction look like? Perhaps a
*  fun question, perhaps not. What do you think of the psychiatrist Sean in Good Will Hunting played by
*  Robin Williams? So what is the full range of interesting interactions? Can there be an intimacy,
*  a friendship, a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines of, you know, 30 minutes
*  session once a week or whatever versus like a really kind of deliberate long-term project
*  that cares about the well-being of a person across the months and years? What can you say about a
*  successful interaction between therapist and patient? I think we're much better served by the
*  latter, right? And again, it doesn't have to be over years. I mean, maybe a person might need that
*  over weeks. They might need it over months. They might need it over years. But if I'm understanding
*  correctly, you're describing something that is like a real human engagement, right? And I work in a
*  field that for years and years and years, the patient didn't get to see the therapist was
*  sitting in a place, sitting behind the person, right? So that's not, of course, the only tradition
*  and there are aspects of that tradition that can be very humanized. But the idea that we're supposed
*  to not be human, I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right? That the doctor's
*  supposed to be God and it protects the doctor. And that makes its way into therapy and the idea of
*  the superiority, the therapist knows more. I mean, in some ways, yes, but the idea is like
*  to know more about mechanical things, like, right? To know more about like facts and knowledge,
*  not as a human being, right? If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor, right?
*  Where if we're going to do it together, of course, I'm going to learn from you too, right? I mean,
*  we're two human beings and we're talking about things that are deep and personal and intimate.
*  I'm not going to participate in a way that makes it like about me as much as it's about you,
*  but we're two humans and what's gone on in me may have relevance and sharing it may have relevance.
*  And at times, you doing something back for me may have relevance. I'll give you an example of a
*  person who would not let me help him. It was a young man. So when I was in training, he was very,
*  very sick and needed to change certain choices and habits or he was not going to survive. And I had no
*  ability to help him whatsoever. And I went and I saw a supervisor who was existentially trained,
*  where here it's different from existentialism in the classic sense, but it's about really human
*  connection, right? And the guy was always wanting to teach me something, right? Because I can get
*  by in Spanish, but he was fluent in Spanish and he wanted to teach me, oh, you traveled here and
*  he'd say a word to see if I knew. And I was always directing back to what I was supposed to do,
*  right? And the supervisor, I'll never forget, he said, let him teach you Spanish. Come on. So
*  we had a couple of sessions where if you look from the outside, you say, what is going on there?
*  They were Spanish lessons to me, right? And then at some point he brought in his mother and
*  we hadn't brought her in yet. And he was in part showing off that he taught me something, right?
*  And I said a couple of things and he felt more powerful. He was younger than me and he felt sick
*  and disempowered, but he didn't feel that way once he taught me something and we showed it off to his
*  mother, right? And his behavior started to change. He started taking better care of himself. He could
*  see a little more what I was saying. He was like, you're a wonderful person. Look, you love your
*  mother and your aunt and they love you. And he could start seeing that about himself. But that
*  came from humanness. And I think that's the way we help people. I don't understand why we don't do
*  everything that way. It's like, we're two humans, but if you're doing something for me, then there's
*  something you have an expertise and I don't, that's why you're doing it for me. The reverse
*  could be true, but it doesn't mean we're not just two humans doing something together.
*  And the healthcare system and the legal system should not get in the way of that. I mean,
*  there's liability and all these kinds of things that can get in the way of the humanness.
*  I mean, some of that is justified. You have to be careful. You have to make sure there's
*  irresponsible, but a little too much can destroy the humanness.
*  I'll use it where you usually say something is insane. It's not consistent with sanity.
*  And the presence of the legal system, look, I'm all for, of course, physicians have to be held,
*  we have to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes and people have to be accountable for
*  their mistakes. I understand all of that, but what we see now, it's so absurd that, oh, like,
*  everyone is frightened. Everyone is frightened. And then just looking to like, how do I slot into
*  the box, check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do and not get in trouble. People get sued because
*  someone was at that hospital and that doctor touched their care. It happens in the VA system.
*  It happens in other systems too. So you might've touched their care and no one's even saying you
*  did anything wrong, but they say the next person did. Oh, someone settled on your behalf and now
*  you have a malpractice and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else. Like doctors are terrified
*  and they're terrified for good reason because the same society that has given doctors in many ways,
*  too much power over time and treated doctors maybe too much like gods now is, I think,
*  enacting some of society's anger and envy out on the physicians. Even the idea that a person would
*  know what medicine, like I saw a couple of TV commercials give me this. It's interesting,
*  because even if, let's say I take myself out of it, it doesn't feel good obviously, but it's like,
*  wow, I went to school for eight years for this and you don't even want to hear my opinion. You're
*  not taking good care of yourself. It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel because I
*  said it, but people then don't have an understanding of what is expertise? What do people learn?
*  How can people help us understand and make better decisions? It kind of goes out with the wash and
*  then the position of the expert, I mean, a lot has been written about this, gets diminished over time
*  very much to our own peril and then often with aggression in the medical world coming back towards
*  the alleged expert. Yeah, expertise is a tricky one. It's such a tricky thing because
*  coupled with expertise, the attention is this arrogance that can come with expertise. The
*  arrogance can make the expert feel like they're more of an expert and there's a vicious cycle and
*  then the arrogance in the current, in the 21st century, especially with the internet, the arrogance
*  can completely force the public to distrust the expert because it always sees the arrogance
*  versus the expertise. So ultimately you have to have, I think the greatest experts and masters
*  I know are the ones that have complete humility. Right, humility and gratitude. And gratitude.
*  Leads us back. Which is usually a really good sign that somebody is at the top of their field.
*  And they'll acknowledge that they don't know everything. Which is hilarious, right? So like
*  the best experts I know are the ones that will say that they don't know,
*  that would not call themselves an expert. Right, right. It's very confusing. Or know that they
*  know a lot but don't know the answer to this. You see that a lot in medicine. That person knows
*  they're an expert surgeon but they also acknowledge they don't know if this is the right time to
*  operate. That's how you get to the best answer instead of someone who is an expert and always
*  knows the answer. Yep. If we actually rewind to the beginning of our conversation, we talked about,
*  you mentioned something I wanted to return to. So there's layers that are, there's an emergent
*  novelty and you mentioned that we as human beings and we introspect on our own mind, we really
*  can't know most of it. Which of course makes me think of the unconscious mind, the subconscious
*  mind and Carl Jung. How much is hiding there in the shadows? You've investigated a lot of
*  trauma. How much is there in our mind that's not directly accessible to us? What can you say
*  maybe philosophically about how much is there lurking in the Jungian shadow?
*  I think there's a tremendous amount there. But I wouldn't, I don't immediately go to
*  an ominous perspective because if it's lurking there, it can come get us. And to some extent,
*  that's true. The seeds of evil are there if we want to plant and nurture them.
*  You think good things can't lurk? I guess so.
*  It's being poetic. But you're right. You're absolutely right. And the Jungian shadow is
*  supposed to not just be dark things, it's supposed to be everything. It's supposed to be a lot of
*  positive things as well. Right. Which I think brings us to self-knowledge, to truth. Where I
*  think the opposite of envy, narcissism, sociopathy, I do think is all rooted in truth. It's both the
*  truth of the good things about us or the ways we're not blame worthy for the things we're blaming
*  ourselves for, et cetera. But the self-knowledge and the truth and getting away from the reflex of
*  anger, frustration, envy, shame. What I think happens then is all of that underneath the
*  surface. If we look at the consciousness is the top of the iceberg, outside the top, outside the
*  water. So is what's underneath shifting and it can pull the top under, right? Or is it supporting
*  the top? And really, I believe is honesty, truth, self-knowledge, humility, gratitude,
*  all this simple stuff. Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity. Humility,
*  gratitude are easy things to say. We know what that is, right? We understand what that is.
*  Soothing envy by having immense power and subjugating others is getting very, very
*  complicated. What that is and how that plays out. So if we are in touch with ourselves,
*  if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours, we don't try and own what's not ours,
*  what happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us to sort of jump us with some new
*  a fact of self or challenge of self, right? Then I think what happens are phenomena like intrinsic
*  learning, like the way that so much happens inside of us automatically, right? How people who have
*  high levels of expertise know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right? It doesn't take
*  them longer to think through it, but they have more knowledge to think through. It's that more
*  happens rapidly and unconsciously, so they know the more complex answer more quickly and readily,
*  right? We can build that in ourselves, not just in terms of factual knowledge, but in terms of how
*  we respond to things, right? If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame, right? If I see
*  someone has something I'd like, how do I respond? We're more in accord with ourselves and then the
*  automaticity in us is serving us better. So that's in the positive. Do you draw some
*  wisdom from the early pioneers of psychotherapy like Freud and Jung, that there's some repressed,
*  there's some stuff to work through that is in the unconscious mind?
*  Yes, I think there's always like 100% of the time. If you have a living human, you have things to
*  work through in the unconscious mind, right? There's too much that goes on around us that
*  we might find unacceptable and suppress, right? There can be smaller but important examples,
*  right? Someone who feels that they're not a good enough parent and they, I don't know,
*  they drop the child's plate, right? And there's a feeling about that of badness in them that the
*  person that can't tolerate and pushes away, right? And maybe they become a little bit less
*  confident, a little bit less assertive. Those small examples are important because they may be low
*  valence, but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right? Then you can look at the
*  opposite end of the spectrum where someone, for example, feels they're repressing their sexuality
*  unconsciously. It's something that is so important, say, to how a person feels about themselves,
*  to whether they can seek fulfillment, to how they feel about their ability to interact and engage
*  with others in ways that are loving and generative over time. So from smaller things that accumulate
*  often at rapid pace to really big things, we are pushing things into the unconscious because
*  they're not acceptable and we need to explore, like, why is that not acceptable? Maybe there's
*  an unacceptable urge because it's really not acceptable to me, right? Like a violent urge.
*  Maybe there's an unacceptable urge because I'm actually listening to the lies society is telling
*  me about what's okay and what's not okay, right? So in exploring those things, yes, we become
*  happier and healthier, and that could mean if we're already happy and healthy, it gets better,
*  we get more insulated against the negative, or it can mean the person who's really nurturing some of
*  those seeds of evil and envy does that less or steps away from it. So whether it's good or it's
*  bad, it's in there inside of us and we benefit from understanding that idea of the observing ego,
*  right? Like we said, the part that can stop and say, hey, this is what's, this is what,
*  I see what's going on in me. What have you learned about exploring the human mind about the art of
*  conversation? There's ultimately therapy is conversation. Yeah. Is there something you
*  can put into words? Yeah. Like what makes it a good conversation? I think language is among the most
*  amazing gifts we have, and it's also one of the most clunky routes to misunderstanding,
*  right? I think of like, there's a concept of facticity, things that are like, I guess,
*  unnecessary evils and from the religious perspective, I think is where the word started,
*  but of language being like a facticity, right? That we need to communicate with one another,
*  we wanna communicate, so we develop words and we have these amazing brains that can have language,
*  and that's all well and good, but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right? You know,
*  the Vulcan mind meld was like, I communicate with you because we put our hands on one another and we
*  know, you know, by doing this, what we're thinking and what we're feeling and we won't have
*  misunderstanding. So because I think we can approximate that, we can come kind of close
*  with language, right? Or we can be so far away from it that we can say the same word and have
*  opposite meanings and have it generate immediate animosity, right? That we need to be very, very
*  careful with language, with communication, with conversations. And I've come to understand that
*  much, much more as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful, you know, reckless speech is,
*  which is why I'm horrified by so much of what we see in our political discourse, right? The slurs,
*  the negativity that's attached to something, to some word, you know, how one can utter something
*  and it can go into another person just into the ear, but then go through so many parts of the
*  meaning of the brain that that person feels a pervasive sense of shame or beleagueredness,
*  right? So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people and we see that all the time in ways that
*  I think are just atrocious. And also how bad miscommunication harms us. I mean, I really
*  learned that through a lot of different ways, but in the work as a therapist of like really wanting
*  to make sure that I'm really understanding you and you're really understanding me. And a lot of work
*  goes into that communication. I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it and then it happens
*  more easily, but I think it's like, it's a life and death difference at times, you know, lots of
*  times, right, in the world around us between clear and accurate communication. You just, oh, I said
*  a word because like, I think you know what I mean or something like that. Yeah, so to that, I mean,
*  there's the Camus quote that I like, as much unhappiness has come into the world because of
*  things left unsaid. So that has to do with clear communication. But there's also a dance
*  to a conversation, a poetry to it. There is ambiguity to language. And if you have a kind
*  of awareness of that ambiguity and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in. That's
*  allows you to sneak up to difficult topics without sort of trampling on them. I don't know,
*  there's an art to it as well. There's an art to the silence, you know, just allowing both human
*  beings, one of the most intimate things you can share with a human being is silence.
*  Yeah, that's communication. It's a different communication, but at times more powerful.
*  Giving a person space to accumulate, to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,
*  enough to say a word, maybe a memory sparks so they can think about that memory and process that
*  memory. So it's not just words, sorry to clip, it's not just words, right? Because now you're
*  talking about communication as its body language, its expressions of empathy, its movements, its
*  pauses, right? The communication process is very, very complicated and deep.
*  Yeah, and some of that is building trust, but also challenging a person.
*  I wonder about that whole process with strangers, for example,
*  of how you do that successfully. Like you and I just met today, but I think
*  a lot of our interaction is very free. We can get to know each other in any way we want.
*  There's a few conversations I have coming up in general where there's a lot of other
*  pressures and constraints on those conversations. There's a danger to it, there's risks,
*  there's political forces involved, not from my perspective, but probably from my as well of
*  how do you say this thing? What are the words that are going to offend?
*  You're learning that about a stranger at the same time. It's an interesting dance because you have
*  to walk carefully but deliberately, right? Carefully because I've learned this about
*  myself, about others. There's certain words that can trigger a person, that can make a person feel
*  poorly, like shitty about themselves. So you can push, you can challenge a person about something
*  and they're all totally okay with it, but if you use a certain word to do it,
*  it's going to maybe map some childhood thing that their father or mother used to say or something
*  like this. Part of the art of conversation is actually being a little bit free and using those
*  words, but being extremely sensitive in detecting when a person reacts to a particular word and
*  like storing that away. It's like, okay, then we might want to return to that later because there
*  might be an interesting, that could be a tip of an iceberg that's actually representing something
*  beautiful or you might want to just, it's a nothing word that you just want to avoid because
*  it's a distraction. And so all of that kind of has to be integrated into the dance of language.
*  This is really interesting, especially when the stakes are really high. When you get one
*  conversation, when you sit down, you have one conversation and it makes the difference between,
*  say you had one conversation with a patient, this is the only conversation you get to help.
*  Sometimes that is the case. Yeah. This is pretty high stakes. Yeah. Oh man.
*  Yeah, it's tough. I guess you get over, and like over time, I guess you get used to the
*  high stakes nature of it. You develop an ability and all that unconscious processing. Right, right.
*  All that part of the iceberg that's underneath the surface is doing all of that, right? Is reading
*  behavioral cues, verbal cues and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right? If it were
*  all logic, it'd be different. Okay, we're going to talk about this thing. I'll say things, you say
*  things back, even if it's politically contentious say. So where's it going to talk logically? But
*  that's not the case, right? There could be a word that raises a certain emotion and you know you
*  don't want to tread there because the emotion will color the person's ability to engage. And so you're
*  aware of all of this. And then I think from the perspective of all of that, I mean, it's like
*  standing on the shoulders of your own internal giant, right? That understands language and
*  emotions and body language and attunement and history and triggering and all of that.
*  And then on top of that, as you're standing up on those shoulders, you're trying to be effective,
*  right? And then I think that's where effectiveness can be unilateral or it can be together. I mean,
*  I think some of what emerged from Viktor Frankl's writing after the Second World War was how much
*  shared humanness means to us, how much of that can be an incentive for survival beyond all others,
*  right? So the idea of are we doing something if we're communicating unilateral, like I want
*  information from you or I want you to do a certain thing when we're done talking, right?
*  Right? Done communicating. That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness,
*  which can make sense. Sometimes I want information out of a patient because I want to know what to
*  do next, right? So it doesn't have to always be negative, but it can also be a tool of manipulation,
*  right? If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism, I want to communicate with you in a
*  way that makes you do what I want you to do, right? Different from that is where it's a shared
*  communication where there's like an umbrella, so to speak, over us and we're doing something that
*  we can only happen together because we're us, we're each person, right? And we come together
*  to do something that's a shared effectiveness, like I think we're doing now of like elucidating
*  and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out. And I think the best situations are shared
*  effectiveness situations because you call upon the resourcefulness and the internal resources
*  of both people. But you, especially with strangers, especially when it's not labeled a therapy session,
*  you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state. Like you have to organically
*  develop a trust together and almost lose yourself. Ultimately, I think you put it really nice. I
*  think successful conversations, even if it's like with world leaders or logicians, people that
*  operate in the space of reason, the most successful conversation will ultimately be
*  in the layer, in the landscape of emotion. Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen.
*  That's where you'll discover anything. And that's where you get to actually meet to start getting
*  understanding of each other or what you actually mean even by the statements that are supposed to
*  be kind of rationally based. It's like you lose yourself. You lose yourself in the way you do
*  when you're children and you're just shooting the shit about whatever topic and you just
*  forget yourself. You lose yourself in the context. Yeah, well you kind of
*  plug into the unconscious mind a little bit and you get to speak maybe indirectly, but to the
*  things that really drive you, to the emotions I suppose that underlie your worldview. I feel like
*  that's where productive conversations can happen, whether it's a patient or just
*  a stranger you're talking to at a bar about geopolitics. You mentioned Viktor Frankl. What
*  do you make of his work, Man's Search for Meaning? What are the lessons you draw from his work,
*  of him as a psychologist, but also from that very powerful work that reflects on his experience in
*  a Nazi concentration camp? Yeah. I think that it was almost a profound reinvention of
*  humanness after something so awful, so bleak and so despairing to speak anew about shared humanness,
*  human connection, meaning, compassion. I think it was an intellectual direction that was adorned
*  with all of the emotions that we need to adorn the logic with in order to make real change
*  in the world. I think that his work has fueled so many branches have come from his work,
*  existential psychotherapy and its place in helping human activities today. A trend away from the idea
*  that we're all quite isolated and that what's going on between us is all very transactional.
*  I'm putting something out and you take it in. You put something out, I take it in. The idea that no,
*  there's a difference. There's a shared humanness that creates a meaning beyond the transaction.
*  Kind of like you were just saying, the logical stuff isn't really that interesting because
*  you know, the logic is there's an answer to whatever logic is. We can do math, right?
*  It's where does the surprises come in, right? Either in terms of wonderful behavior or destructive
*  behavior, right? They're coming from people's emotions. So that's what we want to understand.
*  And that occurs in the context of a person and other humans, you know, even if it's the
*  conception of someone and other humans as enemy, you know, or it's the conception of two people
*  sitting together. The idea that there's a shared humanness and it's not all transactional
*  and that he could take that out of, you know, the pinnacle of human tragedy and utilize it in a way
*  that informs us being better as a species going forward, I think is really monumental.
*  What do you think is the role of emotion in the human mind, in the human condition? Because
*  we've talked several times in different ways that emotion matters and it's a big part of who we are.
*  But why is it there? Why is it useful? What's good about it? We've almost said it's almost like a
*  negative thing that we just have to live with. But why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?
*  Yeah. Well, I think you said, what's the role of emotion? Emotion is the king,
*  if we want to use that analogy. It's the CEO, if you want to use that analogy, right?
*  Emotion rules all. We're taught that we're logical creatures, but we have
*  innumerable pieces of data, even over the course of just a day, let alone a human experience,
*  to tell us that is not the truth. Is it ever logical to run into a burning building? No.
*  Logic's never going to tell one to do that. Okay, somebody you love is in the building.
*  The person's already sprinted halfway to the building. Emotion rules us. So the thought,
*  a thought, is some of that is evolutionary. That strong negative emotion stays with us
*  very, very profoundly. So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers and like,
*  I find a new berry and it tastes good and it seems nutritious. And it is, right? Everything's fine.
*  It'd be good to remember that. But if I find a new berry and it tastes good and it seems
*  nutritious and we both eat it and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?
*  So the primacy of emotion is in us for reasons that are about survival, that the emotion of
*  it's my child in that building or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic and run into
*  the building, right? The emotion of I thought that was good and I got really sick and I better never
*  forget is also about survival. And the same applies to humans. If we're from different tribes back
*  then and in my tribe when you put your hand out, it's a greeting. In your tribe, if someone puts
*  their hand out, it means, hey, I'm going to attack you and take your stuff, right? Then I put my hand
*  out and you slug me, right? Then it's like, I better remember that, right? But you see how that
*  can lead into, you know, are the constructs around that. I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent,
*  right? We start then to make stories around that. But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries
*  or it's humans who might threaten us or it's humans we love, I think it's hard to even look
*  at that anthropological, psychological literature and to look at what's out there and I think the
*  face validity, that's part of survival, right? It's part of survival.
*  It's so cool that you get also things like love, which are not often rational or grounded in logic
*  and so on. If you look from a transactional perspective, a lot of times falling in love or
*  whether it's with friends or friendship or romantic love, it doesn't really make sense.
*  I'm still not sure what the hell it is because, I mean, it's the thing that is one of the things
*  or love for your kids when they're born, like that love, the parental love. What is that? That's so
*  cool that we get to have that. If you're looking for the menu of items that give life meaning,
*  that seems like a pretty good one. Yeah. So my response, you said that gives
*  life meaning. My response initially was going to be, it's the meaning of life, right? Because
*  saying, okay, emotion is about survival. That's one part, right? And it's a very important part,
*  right? If we don't survive, then we're not there to have emotions, right? So yes, it's about survival,
*  but as important as that is, that's the small part of it, right? I think it is about the meaning
*  of life because it's about the beyond self. And I think it relates back to what we're talking
*  about at the very beginning and the sort of levels of emergence, right? And when we feel love,
*  we feel happiness because that person feels happiness, right? There's something that's so
*  generative, so creative about that. We want to bring order to things and happiness is consistent
*  with simplicity, right? If we're healthy, there's nothing negative to say about our health,
*  right? If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right? And it's emotion that pushes us
*  towards the goodness that I think makes all the meaning for us. I mean, it's interesting. I
*  actually was wondering what your thoughts about this as a scientist, right? Because we accept it,
*  by and large, that we have free will, right? We think we have free will, but then we get upset
*  that there's not justice, right? So, but how is it like if we have free will, I could act in an
*  unjust way and then you're surprised or, you know, Viceroy's like, why, right? We have these
*  thoughts because I think because we're rooted, we want logic to rule. Like there's a way in which
*  I can understand logic, I can manage it, I can manipulate it. We sort of want it to be that way.
*  So then we glorify logic and then we misapply it, like ideas like, oh, I know we have free will,
*  but I'm now shaking my fist at the heavens because there's no justice, right? And I think maybe what
*  we're looking for is we should go back and look at the givens. Like why is there, there's only
*  goodness if there's justice? I mean, that doesn't make, I think the goodness, why does the goodness
*  have to be tied to that, right? Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy and the fact that when
*  there is something, there is not nothing, right? And where there is something, there can be
*  awareness, there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right? Is it that what's really going
*  on is not about justice? Yes, we have free will, but it's that goodness creating, shoring up,
*  making better, that is the meaning, that is the good, right? And that the evil is the destruction
*  as evidenced by the fact that it's over determined probably a million times that we're in this eddy
*  current of counter entropy and we could destroy that quite readily, right? And then we're nothing
*  this like everything else that we know of that's not us, that doesn't have the ability to do
*  something that's creative or constructive. I mean, I think that that's the answer and I think that
*  our science really tells us that that's the answer. And I think it beckons us with ideas like we know
*  that things happen outside of space and time, right? I mean, they're physics experiments, right?
*  Like we know this from the science of it, yet we don't stop and look and say, wait, is that
*  the magic or the idea? Einstein said, God doesn't play dice with the universe.
*  I think, okay, maybe God doesn't play dice with the universe, that quantum indeterminacy and all
*  of that is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak. But maybe it's in that indeterminacy
*  that we're given the opportunity to assert ourselves, right? To make something one way
*  or another. Maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe, but it's God loading the dice in our
*  favor if we'll only listen to truth, the truth that being destructive doesn't help or soothe
*  anything, even in the person who thinks it will for themselves and that creativity and generativeness
*  and kindness and compassion, like this is, doesn't that seem sort of analogous to the eddy current of
*  counter entropy that has us here in the first place? And I think that's where I pin meaning
*  and that meaning then, going back to the initial question, right, is generated in us through
*  emotion, through what we feel that leads us to feel something that is mysterious. I don't know
*  why I feel it. Yeah, in some sense, emotion is kind of the fuel of that creative imperative
*  we have. But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit, it does seem that the
*  destruction, the creation of the destruction are the yin and yang of life, that it all works only if
*  the main engine is towards creativity. But destruction also makes way for new things.
*  So that's the, this kind of struggle. It seems like life is struggle between the different forces
*  that make up the individual human, that make up society, all these tensions are necessary for
*  growth, for development. This kind of inner conflict and outer conflict are necessary for growth. It's
*  not just, I mean, in some sense, it's from the logic aspect, you kind of want everything to be
*  perfect and just for nobody to suffer for everything to be perfect. But just like we talked about with
*  trauma, it just seems like it's such a big giant mess. What is it? Bukowski said, find what you love
*  and let it kill you. There's some aspect of the negative aspect of passion and pursuit and obsession
*  and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness, of the creative pursuits and all of that. I mean,
*  that's part of life as well. That's, I don't know what to do with that from an individual perspective
*  in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life, how do you live a healthy life?
*  Because it does seem a bit of hardship or sometimes a lot of hardship can make a pretty
*  interesting life. I think it brings us back to the discussion that we were having before about
*  what does it mean, the challenges of trauma and of overcoming. And I think here we gotta be careful
*  with the language, because I would then say, let's take destruction and separate it into two things.
*  One is, you say destruction is like the breaking down, the tearing down of something versus
*  a process that has malice in it. So just like when we were talking about trauma and
*  setbacks, things to overcome. We might say, okay, if you say, hey, you have it harder than the next
*  person and you have more to overcome, or someone put a barrier in front of you for you to overcome,
*  that there can be a lot of growth in that, including the times when you don't know,
*  if you, gosh, can I do this? Can I get over it? We're saying like that's challenge and something
*  to overcome that's very positive, but we're saying, but there's no benefit of throwing a racial slur
*  in there. We're saying, because that's all bad. Even the person says, I'm angry about that and
*  I'm gonna overcome that. That didn't need to be, that didn't make anything better. If the person
*  sees that and says, I'm gonna overcome that, it makes things less worse. But there's no good
*  to something that's created as destructive. When we look at forest fires, like look, controlled
*  burns, you say there's a forest burning down, but that's okay, there's some weak destruction
*  there. There's a tearing down there, but it's in the service of the next fire not running through
*  the community, the town that's on the other side of it. That's very different than a forest fire,
*  say, started by arson. So you might say they're both a tearing down, they're a tearing down of
*  the forest. But one is in the service of goodness, even though it's hurting the animals and the plants,
*  it's not all good, but it's in the service of something as opposed to something else that's
*  wantonly destructive. I think there's no good to the racial slur, there's no good to the arson.
*  That's destruction in a way that's incorporating, I think, the malice of envy, something that's
*  really purely, if there's a yin and yang, that's the destructive, that's the badness end.
*  So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing. And so, I mean, the reason I bring that
*  up is like, all right, well, like you have these discussions of censorship, like, what good does
*  allowing racial slurs in public communication do, right? And it's like, our communication would
*  surely be better if we don't say bad things to each other. It's like, it seems like the truth is,
*  our communication will be better if the amount of bad things is a small fraction of communication.
*  That seems to be more true, because another aspect of human nature with power, the moment you start
*  censoring and removing bad words that everyone agrees are bad words, then the people at the top,
*  they're doing the censoring, start getting greedy. It starts expanding, and this is the giant mess
*  of human civilization where we can't, the nice piles you created are kind of overlapping.
*  Well, I agree completely, there's a control of language, there are slippery slopes there,
*  I think there's a very big problem there. So I agree, I think, again, parsing out the language,
*  I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs as if like, let's stop saying the words.
*  I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right? Like, the prejudices, if we could eliminate the
*  prejudice behind it. I was struck, I said I do almost nothing about medicine, I get to medical
*  school and start with anatomy, right? And it's remarkable to see as the bodies are being dissected,
*  that we're all humans, like, does it matter, any of these things on the outside? And that's true,
*  not just like in our bodies, but in our minds, the part of the person that's not there, right?
*  Because now we're trying to learn from the body and it shows how ridiculous it is. If you think
*  that we're 99.9% all alike genetically, and by the way, it's only like take another 10th off and
*  we're all orangutans, right? But somehow, we have to see these differences between us, right? And
*  where does that come from? And I think that I believe that all comes from envy in that
*  classical sense, that if I don't feel good enough, I'm going to want someone to feel better about,
*  and so there can be visual things that that person looks different, right? Or you think about the,
*  you know, I spent some time in Great Britain, and when there's a lot of conflict in between
*  Northern Ireland and Ireland, right? And you thought, wow, there's not even a look difference,
*  right? It's the same general religious umbrella, same ethnicity, right? But now there's some
*  religious difference. And I thought, it's not me trying to be denigrating, you know, around the
*  Irish conflict. It's like, that's human of, oh, there's no actual difference between us. If I
*  don't feel good about myself, I'm going to find one, right? It's that that I believe could go away.
*  It's driven by maybe the trauma of just being alive in the world and things can happen to us,
*  but we certainly promote in the human created trauma, people feeling not good enough, finding
*  differences, there's a place for the envy to attach, and we're off to the races of, you know,
*  wars. I mean, we're talking about the Second World War, and we think, well, what have we learned
*  since then? It would take us a day to map out all the wars since then, right? Let alone, for goodness
*  sakes, everything that's salient right now. So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning
*  from what seemed to be some very salient lessons.
*  I should mention one thing is that I also know that you're interested in Russian culture a little
*  bit. Yes. Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped
*  in a mystery inside an enigma. So what do you or some interesting differences between
*  so this eastern part of the world of Russia, Ukraine, the Slavic countries, the former Soviet
*  Union, all of that versus sort of the US culture? What stands out to you from the literature, from
*  the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff? I think there's so much intensity,
*  intensity, and I guess I would say fearlessness of expression that I see in the Slavic culture,
*  maybe it's across cultures, because there's a different way that expression occurs. We say,
*  like, oh, it's different in the French than the Spanish, or it's different than in parts of Africa.
*  And I think when you take that part of the world for whatever reason, and maybe it's just totally
*  random, or maybe it's aspects of geography and experience and migration, but there's such an
*  intensity. And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on, maybe not for the very first time,
*  but early on in my life, or reading Dostoyevsky and feeling like, oh, Dostoyevsky's willingness,
*  his ability and his willingness to express and create such powerful, aberrant states of human
*  experience. Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering that it expresses, has always stood
*  out to me as a way that if that's the brightest light, so to speak, communicating information,
*  that's a place to look. And it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly, because I think for
*  some people who are informative years and having very difficult feelings, right, of like a depth
*  of feeling of like fear, and how's the world going to be? Am I going to be annihilated? What do I even
*  want? What do I feel inside of me? To encounter that being expressed so intensely, I found to be
*  very, very moving. So I don't know if that's a good answer or not, but I think there's an
*  intensity of expression and a fearlessness. Dostoyevsky wrote about terrible things.
*  Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually and very persuasive and very capable of being
*  effective who also just chooses to be a child rapist? I mean, he wrote about that. He wrote
*  about the truth of this is what we can be as humans. And I think there's so many lessons,
*  including the truth. Like people will tend to think, oh, evil is not very bright or not very
*  intelligent. That's a way to let evil propagate, right? Evil can be effective and attractive and
*  very compelling, but evil nonetheless. And I just think there's a fearless willingness
*  to look at that and to describe it that I see primarily I've studied in Russian culture.
*  Yeah, the fearless exploration of this whole human drama. Definitely Dostoyevsky and others
*  since in the 20th century and the 19th century have done an incredible job with that. Some of
*  that, just like you said, is the language, the culture. I think that intense romanticism is there.
*  That is almost an overdramatic exploration of human nature. It can err on the side or
*  falter when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life. Life is suffering. I think that also has to
*  do with the way you deal with the trauma of the world wars and so on. This is something the
*  different nations throughout Europe had to deal with that in different ways. Some of them have
*  channeled into envy and resentment. Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism or cynicism.
*  Ultimately, the intensity of feeling is there, which is interesting to see and interesting how
*  that manifests itself in the kind of governments it builds up. There's more authoritarianism in
*  that part of the world versus the Western world that's more focused on the individual versus the
*  collective. When more focused on the individual, you have a propensity to value individual rights
*  with democracy and so on. It's interesting to watch and to reconstruct how that all came to be.
*  Is it in the blood? Is it in the mind? Is it in some kind of thing that's more ethereal,
*  a collective set of ideas that we pass from generation to generation between each other,
*  sort of the collective of it? Yeah, it's fascinating to see. But now reinvigorated because there's
*  a lot of conflict in that part of the world. You've also thought about the Cold War. What
*  lessons about the human mind, about psychiatry, psychology, and about looking at the Cold War,
*  can we take forward in the 21st century so that we can avoid World War III? A major cold or hot war
*  in the 21st century? Well, I think unspoken animosities are very, very, very dangerous.
*  It was a Cold War. There was fighting through proxies. The superpowers were fighting
*  surrogate wars through proxies, which of course in and of itself causes immense suffering.
*  But it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas or an exchange of thought.
*  Khrushchev not believing that the kitchen could look like it did at the World's Fair.
*  The misconceptions here of what things were like in Russia. It was an utter,
*  it was a thought that those other people are not actually people. There's an enemy society of evil,
*  which then paints with a broad brush in a way that makes it too easy for the Cold War,
*  war to go from being cold to boiling over into utter destruction. I wrote, it was really a true
*  story that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union, but it was right around the time of the
*  Soviet Union coming to an end and I had gone on a trip for students from England. We got to go
*  places that people hadn't gone. Foreigners hadn't gone in many, many years. It was just the right
*  timing to experience that. It really is true that someone said on short notice to these poor
*  kids that these group of Americans were coming. I have a picture somewhere of the kid in a gas
*  mask. They went under their desks and put on a gas mask and they thought, right, that's what,
*  I mean, that's what they're taught to think about us and we're taught to think about them.
*  Like now we're back in an us them, right? When we're all trying to survive and we're all such,
*  human life is so delicate, right? Let alone human happiness and we make these divisions and we
*  create this aggression and latent aggression. We do the Cold War, we developed the ability to destroy
*  the earth, right? Then just sat looking at one another with further growing misunderstanding
*  and the opportunity for the proxy fights. Like when they say the Cuban Missile Crisis,
*  which I know wasn't a war, but it's an aspect of that, right? Where we just have ourselves wildly
*  at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding. And again, I would argue that
*  that is the opposite of the counter entropy, right? Like we are setting everything up for less,
*  lack of communication, lack of understanding. How do those feelings of love and shared humanists
*  happen? They don't, right? If you separate people and then we push ourselves more and more and more
*  towards reinstating the state of entropy that's present in the rest of the universe.
*  What advice would you give to young people that are fighting entropy with all their might?
*  So young people and people that are wondering how to find their way in life,
*  what advice would you give how to have a career, how to have a life they can be proud of?
*  I think starting off with the first principles. What are my values, right? How do I want to live
*  life? Because I'm in my early 50s and when I was a kid, we waited for the newspaper came in the
*  afternoon and then we'd see something, okay, what's going on in the world? We'd learn something. I'd
*  get the West Coast baseball scores, right? And learn about, oh, here's what happened in different
*  parts of the world. And by and large, I and everyone else there, adult or child, we're living
*  in a reality that was largely, our conception was largely what was around us, right? And now,
*  in many ways it is, I'm not saying it's entirely negative, of course, that we have more information.
*  We can sort of think globally, so to speak, right? But the other side of that is so much of the world's
*  problems are on us all the time, right? Like here's this awful thing that happened,
*  how many awful things happen each day and they're right in front of us and there's such an immediacy
*  to it all that I think it can paralyze us with terror, right? And for someone who's young and
*  trying to make their way, it's like, how do you figure your way out in this world that your word
*  isn't even going to exist, right? And then you see how profligate the generations before you are,
*  right? In so many ways. And there can become, I think, a push towards extremes, either nihilism
*  or I'm going to change everything, right? And it's like, how about, let's start from,
*  how do I want to behave in my own community, right? Which starts with like, how do I want to
*  behave in my household, right? What kind of neighbor do I want to be? I mean, it might seem
*  like things like that are silly or small in comparison to the big things, but I don't think
*  they are. I think that's how, you know, that's how we start building foundations that lets us
*  tackle the big things. And then I do find myself saying, when I'm working with, sometimes doing
*  therapy with younger people, of helping them kind of bring back their thoughts, their strivings,
*  their decisions more to themselves and living with and around themselves more instead of in
*  something that becomes very theoretical and therefore very threatening and unnerving.
*  So focusing on the people around them, taking one small step at a time
*  to form deeper connections to build something locally.
*  How do I want to be today? If I go into the grocery store and the person in front of me
*  drops something, you know, I can, I can scowl because I'm in a rush, right? And I can be like
*  that, right? I can be like that. I've been that way many, many times in my life, right? And
*  it's never done anyone a damn bit of good, including me, right? Or I can realize like,
*  the 10 seconds aren't going to matter. Can I help pick that thing up or just smiling?
*  These are the seemingly small things that I think make the tenor of our lives.
*  Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline. One of the really the main reason I moved to
*  Austin, Texas, I just remember deciding it when I went to Walmart and a lady said,
*  you look handsome in that tie or in that suit and tie, whatever. Like I don't think anyone's ever,
*  it's that older lady. She was very sweet. There's kindness in her eyes. She said that I don't think
*  anyone ever said anything like that to me in my entire life. And it was just, I don't know. It was
*  like, wow, there's kindness in this world. I know it sounds ridiculous, but like,
*  does not sound ridiculous. It's like those, you could be that for somebody.
*  You go, go walk around in Walmart. Right. I think that you remember that. Yeah. And,
*  and it's, it's pivotal. You're citing it as, Hey, that was a big part of me moving here. So I think
*  with the branch point in your life that comes from the simple kindness, right? Of a person who had
*  goodness to give, right? And wasn't scared that you're going to be upset by it or what, right?
*  Took the risk. Right. Right. She probably didn't have the thought that you could be a sailing,
*  right? Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give. It's simple to give it. It's that
*  simple and it's, and it's beautiful. And it's worth more to you than like how many studies would be
*  on where's the right to live or this and that. None of that matters. What mattered was the freedom
*  to be kind. And that's emotion. That's not logic at all. That's purely just human emotion and a
*  little bit of humanness, that little bit of connection. And then that's what makes life
*  great. Which is why it's not a bad idea, right? That you, you moved here that way instead of,
*  one could say, well, I can't believe you did that instead of looking at all the data and hiring
*  consultants and what's the best place to live. But that would be wrong, right? Like you, you made a
*  good decision, right? Like that was good data. It was impactful data, even in your thoughts about
*  how you're happy living here, right? It's not that, oh, you discount, you shortchange yourself
*  by not relying on all the logic, right? You felt something about the place and you felt it as
*  symbolized in a person and that made the choice for you. It's a balance of course, but you also
*  have to know yourself a little bit. Sometimes you can find stability and comfort in kind of
*  reasoning things out a little bit. Maybe as people close to me have sometimes criticized
*  in that I'm a little bit too romantic where I'll just follow the feeling and, you know, life,
*  you know, there's physics, there's a reality to this world. Sometimes reality doesn't allow you
*  to flourish if you just follow your feelings, but there's a dance there. And it's happiness is
*  ultimately found in that landscape of feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.
*  Because you said have their place, right?
*  Everything. Yeah.
*  They have their place, but they're not the be all and end all.
*  You're an incredible person. Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours. He said you absolutely must talk.
*  The number of people you know, they're just incredible people. There's just this
*  group of folks that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together. And I'm just,
*  I'm so happy you exist. I'm so happy you're doing the work you're doing.
*  And I can't wait for your second book.
*  Thank you.
*  And thank you for talking today. This was really cool.
*  Thank you so much. I'm proud to be among the group of people that you cited, proud to be
*  their friend and proud that you've had me on today. Thank you so much.
*  Thank you, Paul.
*  Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Conte. To support this podcast,
*  please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
*  Victor Frankel. Everything can be taken from a man, but the last of the human freedoms,
*  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.
*  Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
