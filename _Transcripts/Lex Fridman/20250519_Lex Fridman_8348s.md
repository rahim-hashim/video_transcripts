# Oliver Anthony: Country Music, Blue-Collar America, Fame, Money, and Pain | Lex Fridman Podcast #469
**Lex Fridman:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA)
*  The following is a conversation with Oliver Anthony, singer-songwriter from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=0.0s)]
*  Virginia, who first gained worldwide fame with his viral hit, Rich Men North of Richmond. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4.72s)]
*  He became a voice for many who are voiceless, with his songs speaking to the struggle of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=11.92s)]
*  working class in modern American life. His legal name is Christopher Anthony Lonsford. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=18.32s)]
*  Oliver Anthony was his grandfather's name, and so Chris used this name as a dedication to his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  grandfather and to 1930s Appalachia, where his grandfather was born and raised. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=30.96s)]
*  Dirt floors, seven kids, hard times, as Chris says. He's happy to be called either one, by the way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=37.28s)]
*  I've gotten to know Chris more since the recording of this conversation. He truly is, as he appears [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=45.36s)]
*  online and in his songs. Down to earth, humble, and a good man who deeply feels the pain of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=50.56s)]
*  downtrodden. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=57.2s)]
*  description. And now, dear friends, here's Christopher Lonsford, or as many of you know him as, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=63.6s)]
*  Oliver Anthony. So I was texting you last night, sitting at an open mic, listening to a guy [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=71.2s)]
*  perform Great Balls of Fire. Like I told you, he was giving everything he got for like five [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=79.6s)]
*  people in the audience, plus me. Well, you were there. I'd have been doing it too if you were out [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=85.36s)]
*  there like, oh, that's Lex Friedman. No, man. He was this big dude on a keyboard, just everything, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=89.28s)]
*  sweaty, long hair. You could tell he was there in his own little world. I love the courage of that, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=94.88s)]
*  of just giving it everything. I don't think he wants to be famous. I don't think he wants anything [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  in life except to be there to play his heart out. That's why I love open mics. Some people still [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=105.44s)]
*  aspire to be famous when they play open mics, but some people, maybe they've given up, or maybe they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=112.24s)]
*  never wanted to be famous. They're just there for the pure artistry of it. And you said you started [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=118.72s)]
*  out playing open mics. What? It's Shady Bars. What was that like? Well, yeah, real quick, before I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=124.08s)]
*  forget too, a great example of a guy who had that same mindset and was able to maintain it really [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=128.8s)]
*  well is this mandolin player named Johnny Stats in West Virginia. To me, he's one of the best, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=133.92s)]
*  and he's won all these awards and stuff, and he still works for UPS full-time. He could go out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  and tour with it, play mandolin for anybody he wanted to, but when you meet Johnny, you can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  tell he's just got this joy in him that I don't think he would have if he... But as far as me with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=151.04s)]
*  the open mics, yeah, a lot of them were embarrassing. I remember there was times [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  where I'd go up and try to do... I'd do one song. I'd get halfway through the next song, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=168.8s)]
*  and I'd be so nervous by that point. I couldn't remember any of the words. And there's a couple [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=173.52s)]
*  times. I remember there was one time in particular that I just walked off halfway through the song, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  put my guitar in the case, and just left. I couldn't even stay in there. Just total... [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=183.28s)]
*  Just total freak out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=189.12s)]
*  Just embarrassment? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  And I never drank in bars either. I wasn't really a social drinker, so I was just there to try to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=191.12s)]
*  do the mic. I was a little out of place anyway. I feel out of place in a bar to start with. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's back when you could smoke in bars. There's a whole vibe to it. People smoking, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=202.16s)]
*  drinking, and yeah, definitely bombing in a place like that when the audience is... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=206.16s)]
*  There's five people and they're bored. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=213.76s)]
*  There was one like that. It was in Matoka. It wasn't that far from where I lived. The place [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=216.16s)]
*  is gone now, but it was about as big as the room we're in here, if that. The ceiling tiles [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=220.16s)]
*  were yellow from where everybody had smoked in it since the beginning of time. But yeah, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=227.36s)]
*  that was my little spot, those little type of spots. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=231.2s)]
*  You did covers? What'd you play? What was your go-to? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=233.6s)]
*  Back then, it was like, I don't know, Fishing in the Dark, Nitty Gritty Band, or any of those old [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=236.32s)]
*  Hank Jr. songs. Any of those bar type... David Allen Coe, You Never Call Me By My Name, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  any of that kind of stuff. I haven't even played any of those in forever now, but [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=250.0s)]
*  any of those ones where you get people singing along and stuff, that's what I'd always try to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=254.64s)]
*  Yeah, that song you performed, Take Me Home Country Road, how's that go? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=258.8s)]
*  West Virginia. It's a good song. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=262.64s)]
*  John Denver was just one of those guys that... Who knows where he would have went long term if he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=264.8s)]
*  wouldn't have passed. You know, it's a fun song that I love. I shouldn't, but I love his... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=271.04s)]
*  What is it? Thank God I'm a country boy. I think that's what I liked about John Denver, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  was he was a little bit... He let himself be a little bit corny in the spirit of having fun [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=283.04s)]
*  with it. Great example, there's this older guy that not a lot of people have heard of named Roy [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  Clark, but my farm's a mile down the road from Roy Clark's old farm, but he used to be on Hee Haw, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=294.56s)]
*  I don't know if you ever heard of that old show from the 60s or whatever, but crazy dude, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=300.64s)]
*  he could pick any instrument up. There's videos on YouTube of him, but he would just sit there [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=305.68s)]
*  and just pick anything up and just rip it to death, but he would always just be real silly about it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=309.44s)]
*  He never took himself too seriously. Some people go to the fun place, some people go to the dark [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=313.76s)]
*  place. Country can do both. You more often go to the dark place, to the pain. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=319.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, especially some of the new songs that are coming out, they'll be probably not... [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what they'll be. I don't know. What is country anymore anyway? I don't know that many [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  people who listen to the type of music that I grew up listening to probably listen to country radio [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  anymore anyway. I think there's quite a lot of people who have disowned that space. In commercialized [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=344.08s)]
*  country, you only really get what sells, which in a lot of what sells isn't necessarily what matters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=352.24s)]
*  Well, you had that whole experience where they take what you recorded and polish it, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=358.32s)]
*  try to make it perfect, and then so doing destroy the soul of the thing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Probably that happens with these big artists. They're so famous. It's like a machine. What the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=367.6s)]
*  machine does is it over polishes things. The raw power of the person, the uniqueness of the person, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=374.4s)]
*  the soul of the person is gone if you do that. Yeah. Well, I think professionalism and applying [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=383.2s)]
*  the tactics of corporate America to anything that is baseline artistic is not going to end well. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=391.44s)]
*  They're all individually brilliant, but together this corporate speak comes out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=397.12s)]
*  Just the soul of the people dissipates. It disappears. Why are you all pretending that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=403.28s)]
*  life is not terrible and beautiful and you're both scared shitless and excited and this guy's going [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  through a divorce. This person just fell in love. You're forgetting the intensity of life [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=420.96s)]
*  with this corporate nine to five, like, hi, John. It's great to see you today. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=428.08s)]
*  Oh, you too. You as well. You as well. But when I look at it, I'm like, why am I whining? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=435.76s)]
*  I feel like a Bukowski type character because they're all really nice. They're all good people, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=441.84s)]
*  but something is gone when you have this corporate machine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=448.0s)]
*  Well, they're there to fill a role contractually. If they bring too many of their human elements [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=451.44s)]
*  into that, then they jeopardize losing their sense of security. It's all just out of fear. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=458.08s)]
*  It's out of fear of losing your job. It's the reason why all the songs say Oliver Anthony and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=462.64s)]
*  not Christopher Lunsford on them. It's so difficult, especially now it seems. I was never [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=467.12s)]
*  around in the 40s or 50s to work a job. I'm sure they were probably pretty miserable back then, but [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=475.28s)]
*  they talk about now how difficult it is, the impossibility of having a single family household [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  or anything else. But when you find a decent paying job that you can do without it just [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  torturing you every day, that's a pretty important thing now. It's pretty easy to turn yourself into [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=492.23999999999995s)]
*  a robot for eight or 10 hours a day out of fear of... It's like, you don't want to be yourself too [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=501.76s)]
*  much because maybe part of yourself isn't something that's accepted in this dystopian [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=507.12s)]
*  nightmare that you go to work at every day. You just got to do your best to just not step on any [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=512.8s)]
*  toes or do anything that makes you stand out too much. Now, when you scroll through some of these [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=517.44s)]
*  videos of people... Even when I was still working my lame job, there was this whole big thing of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=524.48s)]
*  people talking about quiet quitting or something like that, where they were just going to go to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=532.24s)]
*  work but not really do anything. But that hurts me so much. That hurts me when you just stop, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=535.76s)]
*  when you're there, but you're not really there. That makes me so sad. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah. So then they wonder, these companies just slowly kind of fall apart and disintegrate because [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=545.84s)]
*  they're so worried about structure. And God, man, even in America today, our culture has become... [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=550.96s)]
*  Because so many big corporations own and manage everything that we live under, like food, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=558.08s)]
*  agriculture, healthcare, social media. It's all in corporate structures. And it's almost like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=562.96s)]
*  a lot of the problems we find ourselves in now with society, I think are like... It's just because [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=568.48s)]
*  of... It's almost like corporate HR has been implemented into our whole thought process of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=573.76s)]
*  everything. I think that's kind of what you're touching on though. It's hard to be a human [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  and be a good little corporate employee at the same time. And as our whole society moves more [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=588.0s)]
*  into becoming basically one big corporation, it's like, you don't want to piss the HR lady off. So [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=593.68s)]
*  it's a lot easier for me to just beep boop. We're all sort of just turning into robots. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=600.48s)]
*  I've talked to great engineers about this. Jim Keller is a legendary engineer. Elon Musk is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=606.72s)]
*  another example. But you need that... I don't know what's a nice term for it, but you need the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=612.72s)]
*  asshole because you want to get to the ground truth of things, to the first principle of things. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=618.08s)]
*  How do we simplify? How do we make it more efficient? How do we move faster? How do we get [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=623.84s)]
*  shit done? And that has no place for this kind of polite speak. And then other great team members [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  swoop in and repair the damage that the tornado has done. Do you think that's... Because I'm not... [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=636.32s)]
*  I'm not super well versed about all this, so I'm probably dumb to even mention it, but [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=642.72s)]
*  this guy who's been helping me with doing a documentary, he's been following me around [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=647.2s)]
*  since the very first show at August the 23. His background was doing promotional videos for Boeing, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=651.6s)]
*  like for on their new spacecraft to pitch it to whoever. And so he was... We touched base a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=659.6s)]
*  little bit on Boeing and of course they're having a lot of problems now, it sounds like. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  And he was comparing that with SpaceX or with... I think it's that exactly what we touched on with [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=669.84s)]
*  that thought process of that sort of dehumanization within companies. I think that's what ultimately [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=677.84s)]
*  causes maybe... I don't know if there's a connection there or not, but it seems like Boeing [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=682.48s)]
*  would be more of that. They don't have that tornado. They're very... He was telling me even [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=687.04s)]
*  just with his protocols and some of the people he worked with, everything's just very... Lightly [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=691.28s)]
*  touch everything. Don't touch anything too hard. So it's not just HR, it's just this managerial [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=696.72s)]
*  class where it's like, Bob from this department has to schedule a meeting with John from this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  department and Debbie. They have to have a meeting two and a half weeks from now and then there's [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=709.52s)]
*  paperwork and that bureaucracy that's created in the managerial class just slows everything down. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=714.88s)]
*  One of the things that slowing everything down does is it really demotivates the people that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=723.12s)]
*  are actually doing the shit. The people on the ground, the engineers that are building stuff, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=730.0s)]
*  it's again, soul-drenching to be excited, show up and now you hit this wall of paperwork. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=735.28s)]
*  You have to wait for John and Debbie and I forgot the third guy's name that I imagined in my head [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  to have a meeting. Then you slow down and you disappear in terms of that fire, that passion [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=751.6s)]
*  that's required to create big things. Yeah, because they don't believe there's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=761.12s)]
*  a lack of leadership and if they don't believe in that leadership, then why the hell would they [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=764.0s)]
*  be motivated? I remember a while back watching Jocko Willnick talk about that when he was [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=770.0s)]
*  in leadership when he was leading his guys. I think he mentions it in his book, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=779.76s)]
*  it's probably where I remember seeing it, one of his books. He talks about how important it was for [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=783.12s)]
*  the people under him in rank to believe in the actions he was giving them. Even if he necessarily [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  didn't agree with him himself, it's really hard to take orders and to have human spirit, especially [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=796.0s)]
*  in something that's innovative. If you're working for a company where you just think everybody's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=803.76s)]
*  dumb, I can certainly relate with that. My old job, that's all we did was we spent half our day [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=808.4s)]
*  just talking about how dumb we thought everybody was that was above us. It's easy to fall into that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=814.48s)]
*  in the corporate world. Yeah, the morale gets terrible and everyone suffers as a result of it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=820.24s)]
*  The people at the top who are implementing all that dysfunction suffer and the people at the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=828.0s)]
*  bottom. It's not good for anybody. I had thought now that I'm doing this that I could escape away [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=832.08s)]
*  but that exact same mentality and that dysfunction and that inefficiency, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  I still battle it every day. That's why it takes unique characters to lead the way. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=846.0s)]
*  Such unique characters are very much needed in the music industry to revolutionize everything, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  cut through the bureaucracy, the bullshit that ultimately is just a machine that steals money [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=855.28s)]
*  and doesn't get anything done, really. We'll talk about it. By the way, all the love in the world to [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=860.2399999999999s)]
*  Jaco. He's great. I've been going through lots of ups and downs in life, lots of low points for [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=866.08s)]
*  myself over the past three years, really, but recently especially. He always texts [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=871.84s)]
*  in this very high testosterone way of like, you're good, bro. Just checking in. He's a good man. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=882.48s)]
*  He's obviously an inspiration to millions of people but also just [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  is a good human being himself. Maybe one thing that we felt similarly, I would imagine you way [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  more than me is just feeling like, wow, I have the ability to influence or the ability to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=904.24s)]
*  either bring truth or to improve people's lives. Every word that you say sometimes matters so much [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=912.72s)]
*  and you're just like, man, I'm an idiot. I would have never guessed. We were talking about that [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=920.16s)]
*  before about it would have never guessed that this would have turned into all this. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  It is a weight that you bear, whether you really even acknowledge it or not. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=933.12s)]
*  I think the songs you've created, they speak to the human condition, to the struggle [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  of everyday working people in a society that has the elites that try to take advantage of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=948.24s)]
*  those working people. You're just speaking through your music those truths of how life is. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=954.72s)]
*  Then that has a huge impact on a lot of people that's really positive. But then you also get [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=964.08s)]
*  attacked and misrepresented and lied about from different angles. Just the turmoil, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=970.0s)]
*  the intense chaos of that, it disorients me to be attacked by a very large number of people, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=977.92s)]
*  to be lied about, to be just the... Because I love people and I have a general optimism about [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=988.08s)]
*  humanity, it just disorients me. It gives me this feeling like I generally, just like you said, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=995.28s)]
*  think of myself as kind of an idiot, not really knowing what I'm doing. When a lot of people tell [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1004.64s)]
*  you that you're correct, you don't know what you're doing, you start to want to hide. You want to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1011.52s)]
*  hide from the world, hide from yourself. Then there's also just the chemistry of the brain. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1018.16s)]
*  You shake up the brain a little bit, it starts getting weird. It's so you can get on many [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1023.52s)]
*  fronts, you can get real lonely. When you're getting attacked, when you're kind of fucking things up [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1030.8s)]
*  in many ways, you can get lonely. You get a text from Jocko, like, you good? Yeah. Then I may have [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1037.12s)]
*  good friends, Andrew Huberman's been great, Rogan's been great. Well, you know, Lex, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1047.2s)]
*  however many years ago was in a different place in society than Lex is now. It's like every [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1054.48s)]
*  conversation you have or every relationship you have is inherently different, even if you aren't [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1060.24s)]
*  any different. Friends that you had from before maybe, or even just new people you meet, your [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1064.4s)]
*  interactions with them are going to be a lot different than if this wasn't a thing. It's like, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1069.2s)]
*  that can be tricky too. When you've spent your whole life, from the time you're three years old [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1073.6s)]
*  and you're starting to play with other kids and developmentally learning how to share and how to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1079.12s)]
*  interact and you're playing the playground with kids and learning how to set rules and boundaries [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1083.84s)]
*  and how to basically fit into society. You have this whole learning pattern up until whatever [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1091.52s)]
*  point in time when success happens. Then it's like all that shifts pretty dramatically in a relatively [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1096.48s)]
*  short period of time. How do you think managing your previous friendships or your life, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1104.64s)]
*  has that been tricky for you? Yeah, it's been tough. I value deep, close, long-term friendships. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1112.72s)]
*  And yeah, I have amazing friends, but they certainly do treat me a little different. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  They bust my balls noticeably less. Yeah, and you need that sometimes. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1126.32s)]
*  Not sometimes, all the time. First of all, it's how dudes show love, is making fun of each other, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1133.28s)]
*  at least my friends. When you watch, man, I'm going to get in trouble, but when you watch [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  women interact, they're often really positive towards each other. Like, oh, you look great. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  When you watch dudes interact, like close friends, they're just like, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1155.84s)]
*  I mean, busting each other's balls. I'll stop making fun of each other. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1159.4399999999998s)]
*  So yes, that has been a little bit harder. I try to break those walls, but [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  that's why with the famous friends, it's a little bit easier because they can still, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1173.04s)]
*  Rogan roasts me nonstop. It just feels good. I just sit there and get made fun of, and it's great. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1176.56s)]
*  I still do it all the time. It's just a different experience now, but I'm like a Goodwill junkie. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1184.96s)]
*  Most of even my clothes were from Goodwill, but I have this addiction with buying paintings from [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1192.64s)]
*  Goodwill. The $8 paintings where it looks like somebody was following along with a Bob Ross [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1199.04s)]
*  video and it didn't work out quite right. I buy every one of those. I'll go in there and buy like [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1204.64s)]
*  10 of them. Anytime you got into public now, it's just like, you know, it's going to be a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1209.36s)]
*  little different than it was. I don't know if that makes sense or not. Yeah, for sure. I'm trying to [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1213.36s)]
*  deal with it, but all of it, when you talk to world leaders, when you step into politics a little bit [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1218.0s)]
*  and you apparently stepped into politics, even though you never meant to, you're not a political [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1223.2s)]
*  person, that world is like, what the fuck? It's very intense, especially at an intense moment in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1227.44s)]
*  history in an extremely divided country. Yeah, like saying that I'm not in politics, people are [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1236.88s)]
*  like, well, of course you're in politics. I don't know whether I am or not, but I do think a lot of [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  people in politics, as far as the people who sit on the internet all day and argue about stuff on [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  X or on whatever, you know, Facebook and all like, I do think their heart is in it for the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1257.28s)]
*  right reasons. They observe that there's a lot of things wrong in the world that they'd like to see [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1261.92s)]
*  different. It's just, how do you get those people out of this four by four square? And like, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1266.48s)]
*  really like they're entrapped in a same kind of box that the people at Boeing might be with [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1274.8s)]
*  that struck, you know, it's too, it's the tornado metaphor. I mean, so, but it applies in politics [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1280.88s)]
*  too, like there needs to just be a tornado through politics and we need to figure, we need to just [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  like lay all this other stuff aside and just figure out what's really pissing everybody off, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  what's really affecting our quality of life. A lot of times we're arguing over the symptoms of [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1296.16s)]
*  problems instead of identifying the problems, if that makes any sense. I mean, if Jordan Peterson [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1300.88s)]
*  would hear, he would tell us about fire and how important that is and burning and like, but it's [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1306.0s)]
*  all the same. Water and fire and ice metaphor. And there would definitely be a connection to the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1310.0s)]
*  Bible and then we will receive a three hour lecture and it would be profound. It's all true. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1314.8s)]
*  It is all, it's all a hundred percent accurate. Yeah. That's the crazy thing, but it all ties [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1320.4s)]
*  into that same thing. Like, yeah, in politics now it's almost like there's a rule book that you have [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1323.6s)]
*  to follow. And if you, you can't agree with this unless you also agree with that, you know, it's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1329.6s)]
*  like, and maybe it's like the places, the way that we receive information about what's going [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1334.16s)]
*  on in the political landscape is always so biased. And it's like the, well, it's contingent upon this [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  algorithm, this like out of the algorithmic system that we live under, where we're fed, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1346.3200000000002s)]
*  it's like, we're almost fed certain subcategories and it's, and it's easy to fall into that because [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1350.96s)]
*  you don't like hearing things you disagree with. And so it's a lot easier to just turn the TV on [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  or go on Facebook and look at whatever page posts, things that you know, you're going to consistently [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  agree with every day. And that's not going to challenge the way you think in any little way, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1363.76s)]
*  you know, or, or like expand your thinking at all. It's, it's easy to just, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1367.92s)]
*  it's kind of like a, it's a cult like type of thing. It's like, you know, here's, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1372.64s)]
*  this is what we all agree with. And if you don't then go on get, you know, like, but it doesn't, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  we're far too complicated for it to really work that way. Well, this actually relates to one of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1383.84s)]
*  my favorite things in your conversation with Jordan, where you're just, we, where you're just [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1387.92s)]
*  shooting the shit about like playing live music and he goes to Kierkegaard. She's like soaring [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1392.8s)]
*  Kierkegaard, the philosopher. I love Jordan so much. It just goes to Carl Jung and Nietzsche. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1399.28s)]
*  And they're this idea from Kierkegaard that the crowd is untruth. So when you, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1408.56s)]
*  there's elements to the crowd that loses the humanity and the honesty of an individual that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1414.8s)]
*  makes up the crowd. Because the default incentive of the crowd is to conform to some kind of [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1422.08s)]
*  narrative. It's like a, it's like a distributed system that arrives at a narrative and the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1428.32s)]
*  narrative holds control over that crowd, as opposed to the individual humans who are thinking for [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1435.68s)]
*  themselves and being honest with their own thoughts and realities and so on. And so that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1440.32s)]
*  he was saying that as a reason from a communication perspective, to speak to individuals in the crowd, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1445.84s)]
*  not to the crowd. So from the performer perspective, the moment you speak to the crowd, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1454.24s)]
*  you're speaking to the lie that is the crowd, according to Soren Kierkegaard. It's pretty [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1459.36s)]
*  hardcore. Kierkegaard is pretty hardcore. Jordan's pretty hardcore. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  But that is true. I mean, but specifically in my case, I mean, really, it applies more than it [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1466.64s)]
*  probably does in a lot of cases with crowds and music. You know, talking about Richmond, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1474.5600000000002s)]
*  I wasn't necessarily even excited that Richmond did as well as it did. It was like, in a way, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1479.2s)]
*  it was almost like alarming that it did so well, you know? And so those crowds that show up, like, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1485.2800000000002s)]
*  maybe they do like my music, but I also think they're there for something different. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I wish I would have done a better job of having people there at shows to capture [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1494.8s)]
*  some of those crowds I had in 24 man. You mean the size, the intensity? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1500.96s)]
*  The intensity. Like it was revolutionary almost. Song of revolution. You know, I think [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1505.36s)]
*  redemption song from Bob Marley. Like that song, it just connected with people. There's something [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  there. Well, and so many people identified as people who were like, you know, they were [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1517.9199999999998s)]
*  and so many people identified different elements. Like I said, it goes back to when we were kind of [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1522.8s)]
*  talking when we first got here, but it was, it was crazy how it was almost like at the beginning [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1527.68s)]
*  with along with the scrutiny and some of the other things, it was a lot of different people, like [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1531.76s)]
*  almost fighting over me or fighting over it. Like, cause it resonated with different, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1536.0s)]
*  it resonated with people who voted differently than each other, which is, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1541.44s)]
*  which is probably a pretty terrifying thing if you're, if you're in the business of keeping [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  people divided and angry at each other. So it was, you know, it was a, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1549.76s)]
*  it was one of the first, one of the only times that I can think where there was that, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1556.0s)]
*  that much of a sense of unity among people who otherwise wouldn't. I mean, like, I mean, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1561.36s)]
*  I think about nine 11 when I was a kid, I was in fourth grade, but God, man, people were just like, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1566.16s)]
*  people just put everything aside there for a little while. And it was kind of, it was kind of like, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1571.36s)]
*  there's bigger problems that just aren't in our face. And if, man, if they're in your face for [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1576.24s)]
*  just for a second or two, you realize like, it's, it's hard to, it's hard in your mind to create a [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1581.2s)]
*  graph that's got like all these, but you know, we argue about a lot of these problems, but if you [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1588.48s)]
*  were to really look at them, like, if you really just stand back and look at all the problems we [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1592.08s)]
*  spend time focusing about on the internet versus all the things that are affecting us, like that [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  really, and probably at our core, even piss us off. It's, it's gotta be very disproportionate. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1602.56s)]
*  And like the reason it got the reaction it did is because we all like, no matter what it is that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  we're upset about or what we think needs to be different in the world or our opinions of things [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1612.56s)]
*  or how we're raised or what our parents taught us. It's like, I think we all feel a little bit out [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1616.24s)]
*  of control in this new society. We all feel like we're probably, we probably all feel like we're [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1620.56s)]
*  falling into this kind of like corporate power structure where none of us, where we all, we all [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1625.6799999999998s)]
*  are just robots. We're all just, we're not allowed to be ourselves and be human almost, you know? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1630.56s)]
*  And there was enough people feeling that. I mean, people on the left feeling like the people in [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1637.2s)]
*  power fucking over the working class, people on the right feeling the exact same with different [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1643.28s)]
*  words assigned to it, the deep state, you know, fucking over middle America, whatever the narratives [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1648.96s)]
*  are. And they're just, when enough of that is happening, again, with the corporate polite speak, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1656.16s)]
*  there's something about politeness that's really dangerous. I feel like there was a lot of politeness [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  in the Soviet Union. Yeah. Underneath that it's like Chernobyl, which is this nuclear power [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  planet melted down. I feel like the bureaucracy needs politeness and civility [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1677.52s)]
*  and paperwork to function. And then atrocities can happen underneath that. So everybody, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1686.88s)]
*  people in power with a smile on their face can just do horrific things and then give [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  propaganda that look, you know, it's rainbows and sunshine and, and unicorns. Yeah. So people that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1701.12s)]
*  are rude, I mean, I'm starting to awaken to this a little bit. Like you need a little, like Tom way [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1708.8s)]
*  says, I like my town a little drop of poison. You need some, like some poison, some, some swearing, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1714.2399999999998s)]
*  some meanness, some bullshit, some like intensity to shake up a system. Because when it [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1723.12s)]
*  converges towards this polite bureaucracy, the atrocities can happen and hidden away. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1731.36s)]
*  And what's probably the most terrifying to me is that that politeness is just theatrical, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1738.56s)]
*  whereas it emulates the respect that we would normally give each other in society [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1743.1999999999998s)]
*  if we were healthy and functional. What was the process of writing that song? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1748.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it really spoke to the pain of an anger of millions of people. So there's magic there. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1753.6s)]
*  Was a, well, how many, how many edits, how many like lines did you write? Were there any lines [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1760.7199999999998s)]
*  that you were like tormented by haunted by come back? Should I do it this way or this way or that? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1768.0s)]
*  Do you, do you have a, I don't know. Do you, can you pull tech talk up on this? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1772.8s)]
*  So if you go to my page, so if you go to chickens, go, yeah, go down pre-richmond, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1776.96s)]
*  you can see the original version of Richmond where I put it up. This is so cool to me. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1783.28s)]
*  There it is. Okay. So that's, that's, if you play that, that's, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1788.64s)]
*  I have too many unfinished songs. Yeah. Play that, click that and play it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1792.32s)]
*  I've been selling my soul. 724. Oh wow. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1795.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1803.76s)]
*  So I can sit out here, waste my life away, drive back home, drink my troubles away. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1804.24s)]
*  If you read through this, it's so funny. Everybody's like, you're about to blow up. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1812.0s)]
*  But that's, that's all I had. So I had, I had just that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1814.88s)]
*  You should probably finish this one. It might be real popular. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1823.92s)]
*  That's supposed to be a few days later. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1827.92s)]
*  That was in, that was in July. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1830.8s)]
*  That's so inspiring. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1833.2s)]
*  That's what I had. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1835.12s)]
*  That's so inspiring. That's what like a couple of weeks before you posted the final. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1836.32s)]
*  That's all I had. Yeah. That's all I had written at that point. Like that in my mind, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1843.44s)]
*  that's what that's the inspiration for the song was that little bit. And I wrote that just cause [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1847.12s)]
*  I was on job sites all day and going into like all these just terrible places to work, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1851.44s)]
*  like dealing with different contractors and stuff. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1859.6s)]
*  You were talking about wanting to go and talk to blue collar people and all. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1862.08s)]
*  It's like, that's what I did for work basically for eight years was build long-term relationships [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  with people in blue collar. I was in the industrial space. So I would talk. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1869.2s)]
*  Sometimes I'd talk to 20 different people a day. When you sit in a job site trailer and talk to, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1872.8s)]
*  job site trailer and talk to, and talk to a group of dudes like, and you're not there with some [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1877.76s)]
*  news camera, you're just there as like a random dude. Like you hear so much about what really [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1882.24s)]
*  goes on behind the scenes of, of the structure of what builds, what builds this country and [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1886.3200000000002s)]
*  keeps it going. And I think that's probably what it was. It was just a, it was how I felt, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1891.68s)]
*  but also how I guess a lot of other, like, you know, it was just, I don't know, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1897.44s)]
*  it just seemed like the truth. So. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  So you jot it down even to the details, like in a notebook, like those words. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1903.84s)]
*  No, it's always just on my phone. I would just keep recording the, I would just keep, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1908.8s)]
*  you know, like, so if you were to go back to tick tock, like, and look at any of those original [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  videos. So like the songs that ended up charting, let's say like the ones that were on there that [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  charted with Richmond, like this, I've got to get sober. So literally, so literally what I did was [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1929.52s)]
*  this video I took it, my property, this is my carport where my camper was. And. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1935.28s)]
*  I took this video. I went to some sketchy virus written MP3 to wave filed or MP4 to wave file [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1941.2s)]
*  transfer thing. I would rip the audio off of this video, put this on tick tock, and then put that [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1947.3600000000001s)]
*  on district. And that's the, that was the song. But basically like this would, this would have [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1953.1200000000001s)]
*  been the first time I played, I've got to get sober all the way through. Like I would just keep [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1957.52s)]
*  writing it and working on it, writing it and record myself. And maybe I would record myself [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1961.6s)]
*  30 times over the period of like two months. You know what I mean? Oh, but it's, when you say [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1965.12s)]
*  writing, you mean in your head, not actually typed out or written it. Right. It was just video. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1969.68s)]
*  It was mostly just video over and over. It's just videos. I'm just trying to figure out how to make [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1974.0s)]
*  it. Yeah. But that's what all these, all these are like the audio file from all these videos is what [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1978.16s)]
*  ended up on Spotify and all that. You know what I mean? It's cool to see these videos before you [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1984.48s)]
*  blew up. So this is a good song. You're playing, I've got, so what is this at the end? Yeah. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1989.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. These were all, don't sell your soul brother. This is the best music I've heard in a long time. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=1996.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a comment before you blew up. Yeah. Yeah. I think I had about 10,000 followers or something. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2004.72s)]
*  Mm-hmm. What a fucking song. That's a good one. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2011.12s)]
*  And you gotta think like this was, like that was my, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2017.6799999999998s)]
*  that was when I quit drinking. You know what I mean? Like so that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2023.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So that's coming from, from, from your heart right there. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2026.24s)]
*  I just imagine the thousands of people you help with that. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2040.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2057.28s)]
*  It's so crazy how those cicadas and stuff come in. Like, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2074.32s)]
*  I just felt like it was a God. I don't know how to, like that's just off my phone. All that stuff's [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2079.92s)]
*  just there. You know, they've been saving my soul from the pain that the world's put on me. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2084.96s)]
*  Lord, I know that upstairs there's an old man who cares. And one day he'll set me free. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2096.08s)]
*  I'll go on the wind, start hiding the hell. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2105.04s)]
*  That's a genius of song genius, brother. It's just, it's just crazy to think about. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2112.32s)]
*  And what's this one right before? What is this? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2120.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. So that's like the private. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2124.64s)]
*  And this was a nice recording. Got it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2127.36s)]
*  Yeah. So this video got uploaded and then Draven from radio WV would have gotten a hold of me in [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2129.36s)]
*  between this and that he watched this and was like, dude, you got, he said, we got to record [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2135.6000000000004s)]
*  that one. And that like, so I didn't have it all, but I just had whatever was in that video is all [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2142.4s)]
*  I had written. It was, I think it was just the chorus in the first verse Draven saw that video [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2146.2400000000002s)]
*  and said, we've got to do this. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  Reach out to me to record. And he's like, yeah, he's like, no, we got to do that one. And I was [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2153.36s)]
*  like, dude, that's all I got. Tell me about that guy. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2157.6000000000004s)]
*  He probably is like, you know, he's probably like my best friend. Now we, we hit it off with this [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2160.96s)]
*  and we're like, we're like brothers now, I guess. But he's about like what he's doing for country, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2166.96s)]
*  for music in general, for country music, for discovering talent, for like, yeah, he's clearly [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2171.52s)]
*  sees something in people. Yeah. He's just, he's like, he's like, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2177.6000000000004s)]
*  yeah, he's just, he's a little bit younger than I am. And he's, he wrote music and played and [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2181.8399999999997s)]
*  he's got some of his, if you look up Draven, right, if he's going to kill me for even saying [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2186.96s)]
*  this, but he's got some pretty dude, he can, if he was like a pop singer, he would be like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2190.72s)]
*  he can write the most catchy stuff ever. Let's go. Yes. Click on like, I don't know, like, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2195.9199999999996s)]
*  bye bye. Yeah. All right. That's him. Yeah. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2202.4s)]
*  Where's this from? Five years ago. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  He could probably do, if he does, he could probably be real famous. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2232.32s)]
*  Well, he's got a certain look. That dude will sit there and he'll just like, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  we'll just be sitting there at like two in the morning and he'll just all of a sudden do this [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2246.96s)]
*  little thing. And he's got like the most amazing first part of this like song or we just started [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  to co-write together like in the last few months. So I'm really excited for that. But if you go to [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2254.8s)]
*  this is really funny too. I'm sorry, Draven. I love you, man. So go to videos and go to oldest first. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2260.24s)]
*  This is what's so awesome about Draven. He was originally working for this lady who was trying [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2265.52s)]
*  to develop different types of haircare products, but he thought the market was too saturated. So [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2270.0s)]
*  he was going to get into beard oil. So he created radio WV as like a fake plug page for his burly [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2274.64s)]
*  boy beard brand. He was working with, so like, click, like if you look at, yeah, like that very [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2282.7999999999997s)]
*  first video, yeah, it's like, it's got all his beard products. If you look, there's [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2287.44s)]
*  multiple ones like that. So he started it just to do this beard thing with, and then like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2293.44s)]
*  I don't know, he just kind of felt called to like keep going with it and it, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2298.96s)]
*  and it just sort of naturally progressed. Yeah, that too is inspiring. Like you start out one way [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2302.56s)]
*  and then you discover something real special. I mean, he's got a, he's got an eye for how to bring [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2306.8s)]
*  out, I don't know what it is, like the, both the audio side and the video side, how to bring out [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2313.12s)]
*  the best in place. He says he just wants it to sound like the way he likes hearing it, which kind [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2318.56s)]
*  of makes sense, you know? Like it's kind of in the same way talking about, when we were talking about [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2322.96s)]
*  setting the cameras up and a professional would tell you, you needed three lights here. Like, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2327.12s)]
*  well, I think it would work with the, he's just kind of like, well, it'll just work like this. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2330.48s)]
*  And do it in a way where he likes it. Yeah. Just do it for yourself. He does it cause he loves it [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2334.3199999999997s)]
*  and that, and you can see it shows, you know? Yeah. You can see it in there. And there's some [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2338.72s)]
*  good talent. Like you were showing me this new lady, Gabriel. Yeah, she's got it, but not a lot [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2342.64s)]
*  of people would record her doing that song. But he's like, I don't know. It just was different. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2347.2799999999997s)]
*  I just thought people ought to hear it, but he's man, it was a blessing that he came along [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2351.2s)]
*  when he did. It was like, it really changed both of our lives. We've got to talk about that. So you [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  posted the song, Richmond, North of Richmond on August 8th, 2023. I remember I was at work that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2361.68s)]
*  day when it went up. Yeah. So it blew the fuck up straight to number one on the charts, tens of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2368.8799999999997s)]
*  millions of views and listens. And a few days later on August 17th, you made a post that I thought [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2375.12s)]
*  was pretty gangster. It was beautiful and gangster. So one of the things you said is it's been [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2383.52s)]
*  difficult as I browse through the 50,000 plus messages and emails I've received in the last week. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2389.44s)]
*  The stories that have been shared paint a brutally honest picture. Suicide, addiction, unemployment, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2395.84s)]
*  anxiety, depression, hopelessness. And the list goes on. And then you went on to write, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2402.0s)]
*  people in the music industry give me blank stares when I brush off $8 million offers. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't want six tour buses, 15 tractor trailers and a jet. I don't want to play stadium shows. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2413.68s)]
*  I don't want to be in the spotlight. I wrote the music I wrote because I was suffering with mental [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2420.8799999999997s)]
*  health and depression. These songs have connected with millions of people on such a deep level [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2426.48s)]
*  because they've been sung by someone feeling the words in the very moment they were being sung. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2432.72s)]
*  No editing, no agent, no bullshit. Just some idiot and his guitar, the style of music that we should [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2439.68s)]
*  have never gotten away from in the first place. So huge props for that, for walking away from [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2446.08s)]
*  lucrative multimillion dollar record deals. And I'm sure the money that was just coming your way, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2453.04s)]
*  huge props, you know, moments happen where, you know, the world tests you and integrity [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2458.96s)]
*  is what you do in those moments. So huge props for that. What was your philosophy? What was [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2467.52s)]
*  your thinking behind that? It was all those messages I got. I mean, you can see it in the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2473.04s)]
*  comment sections of a lot of the videos after everything happened, but people just like, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2477.12s)]
*  felt this spark like, like, wow, like maybe we actually have a chance to like, maybe we actually [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2481.3599999999997s)]
*  do have some kind of power, you know, like those people put that song there, nobody else, and like [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2486.64s)]
*  gave me the opportunity to make even without signing anything, I was still able to make [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2492.3999999999996s)]
*  millions of dollars and have financial freedom. And like, I just, I just felt like, I felt like [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2496.24s)]
*  if I was going to do anything like that, that I'd be, I'd be betraying, like I would be taking [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2505.3599999999997s)]
*  those people and been almost betraying them somehow, you know, like, like they, I hate the [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2510.3999999999996s)]
*  big machine just like everybody else. And I, the last thing I'd want to do is be, is ever [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2517.7599999999998s)]
*  supported or be a part of it. Like I want to watch it crash and burn, you know, like, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2526.0s)]
*  see, this is the really important thing is whether it was betrayal or not, we'll never know, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2530.32s)]
*  but you felt that it was, and to have the integrity to walk away from the bag of money [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2535.6s)]
*  when you felt that way, that's fucking epic. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2541.84s)]
*  It was also, you gotta think a couple of months before this, like, of course I had, you know, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2547.28s)]
*  I had a wife and kids that I loved and like, I had a lot of really important things to live for, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2552.56s)]
*  but I didn't have a whole lot to lose. Like, like none of this was even really real. Like it, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2556.8s)]
*  I didn't care about that. Like I didn't care to lose this just as quick as I got it. Like this [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2562.56s)]
*  didn't, this was, this didn't mean anything to me. It just meant something to me that like, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2566.4s)]
*  that I could do something for, like, you know, you, it's like, even if I'm not smart enough to [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2570.88s)]
*  figure out how to fix some of my own problems in my life, the fact that I felt like I could help [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2577.84s)]
*  fix somebody else's like that meant a hell of a lot more to me than any, that's what I didn't [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2581.6000000000004s)]
*  want to lose. I didn't want to lose those people's trust or like feel, you know what I mean? Like, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2586.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I've just tried to make every decision around like, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2589.92s)]
*  as best as I can, like what I think the right thing is to do and who knows what the hell the [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2595.84s)]
*  right thing is to do. But I just try to follow, you know, we all have that little voice in us [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2599.6s)]
*  like that. We all have some what, and, and I think sometimes we mask, it's hard for us to listen to [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  that little voice, whether, whether it's like, you know, whether it's our gluttony or lust or our, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2610.7200000000003s)]
*  or our, you know, we, we numb ourselves with medications or with alcohol or we scroll on [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2617.12s)]
*  YouTube for four hours a night and instead of, cause we don't want to listen to our conscience, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2625.44s)]
*  but there is this like very intelligent, discerning thing inside of us. It's able to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  tell us what's right and wrong. And it's a, it's a spiritual thing, I guess. And I just try to, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2633.92s)]
*  I just try to listen to that when I can. I don't know. I just still feel like I haven't done enough. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2640.08s)]
*  I think you, I think you did a lot. I think you did a lot. I think you're an inspiration. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2644.7999999999997s)]
*  You've helped a huge number of people and you're also an inspiration to the other side of it, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2650.24s)]
*  which is the artists and just the humans to have integrity. I don't think people realize [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2654.64s)]
*  how much of a test of integrity, fame, money, you know, power also is, you know, uh, Rogan and I [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2660.8799999999997s)]
*  talk about this quite a bit. We get to see, I mean, Joe, especially, but I haven't, I've had a bit of [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2672.64s)]
*  the same. You get to see people become famous and you get to see how they deal with that. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2678.64s)]
*  And it's not easy. A lot of people will sell themselves a bit, sell the soul a bit, give away [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2687.68s)]
*  a bit of their integrity of the spirit that made them who they are. You get caught up in the wave [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2694.7999999999997s)]
*  of it, you know? And so to keep on holding onto that, that's a powerful thing. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2699.76s)]
*  That's a really good point. Yeah, that's all I got though. You know, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2706.1600000000003s)]
*  when you lose that, what the hell are you like? And you see it, like you see these celebrity people, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2709.0400000000004s)]
*  they just like fall off the, they fall off this, you know, they go off the deep end. It's like, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  you gotta have, you have to have something in your life to, and to keep you centered and to keep you, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2719.44s)]
*  you know, your whole perception of reality and like your just existence in reality is all [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2724.64s)]
*  contingent upon this sort of like this center that you exist in. And you have to, if you don't have [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2729.6s)]
*  that, then you're just flying through space. I mean, we're all just riding on this rock that's [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2735.44s)]
*  going, who knows how fast. You said something. I think to Jaco that I really liked everything that [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2739.44s)]
*  has purpose behind it comes with risk. So there in that moment, I mean, you're taking a hell of a [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2748.0s)]
*  risk. I was terrified. I talked about this a little bit with him too, but I was terrified to even put [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2755.52s)]
*  the song out. Like I knew I was going to be the subject of scrutiny and judgment. And I knew people [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2759.92s)]
*  were going to like, you know, I kind of knew all that was going to happen. I was like going back [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  to that, talking about crowds, like to stand in front of thousands of people and everybody be in [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2769.44s)]
*  some sense of unity. Like a lot of times when I end the shows, I'll always, I'll always end with [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2776.16s)]
*  this statement that just says, you know, no matter what, like no matter how you feel when you go [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2783.2s)]
*  online, you know, everyone feels so small and insignificant and, and powerless, but I just say, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2789.6s)]
*  no matter how they make you feel online or when you turn on the TV or when you look at polling [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2796.0s)]
*  numbers or whatever, like when you just look at all this trash that we digest every day, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2801.12s)]
*  like you're, there's always, there will always be more of us than them and all that. And, but like [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  to see that, like just to see the light in people's eyes when you say that, but the truth is like, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  and it's like, who is us and who is them? And it's like, us just represents humanity and like, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2818.64s)]
*  and all the things we talked about so far, like just, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2825.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, the fire and the chaos, but also the, like the love and just, just life, life is just [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2830.08s)]
*  such a crazy, complicated, beautiful, disastrous thing. And then them is like, it is, it's the [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2835.8399999999997s)]
*  power structure. It's the, it's that same terrible side of us that created things like the Soviet [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2842.16s)]
*  Union and, and, and is ultimately what's created this monster, this like monster that we all live [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2847.68s)]
*  under today, which now is not just, doesn't just exist within the confines of the Soviet Union, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2853.12s)]
*  but it seems to almost be a global epidemic. And then that song became the rebel call [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2857.68s)]
*  against that, against the power structures that creates that. Yeah. It's like, how much fire am [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2864.7999999999997s)]
*  I willing to play with? Cause I know at some point I am going to get burned from it. I just pray a [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2870.24s)]
*  lot that God, I don't have a lot of self-worth in myself anyway. So I don't really care what they [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2874.88s)]
*  say or do to me, or I don't care. Like, I don't even care if I die, whatever, just don't let, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2879.6s)]
*  just, just protect the people I love is all that's all I ask of God. I have this dream of just [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2884.88s)]
*  creating this parallel system that sits beside all of these stupid systems that we live under [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2890.4s)]
*  that are all sort of engulfed in this, this thing that we talked about at the beginning, this, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2895.2s)]
*  this type of structure, you know, we're none of us, we're, we're all just robots. And [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2900.88s)]
*  it's like, if we hate, you know, if we hate the way music is and all these artists are complaining [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2905.44s)]
*  about the way the venues are monopolized and the ticket sales are monopolized and let's just go [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2911.12s)]
*  find other places to play music. Cause there's so many people hungry for music in places that don't [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2915.44s)]
*  ever get it. And if you look at it, there's so many passionate people that are fighting all these [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2919.52s)]
*  different causes like, like just in food, it's the word they use for bait for more or less [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2924.2400000000002s)]
*  starvation. It's a more polite, it's called food insecurity. But if you look up just in Virginia, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2929.6s)]
*  just where I live in Virginia in the rural areas, how much food insecurity there is [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  and how many empty vacant farms there are. It's like, this is an obvious problem that we should [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2939.04s)]
*  be on Twitter talking about nonstop. Like this is like everyone has to eat, you know, it don't [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2944.56s)]
*  matter what you vote for or what, like what you look like or any of that crap you can, you know, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  so like, let's just like, why, why are we living in a country where we have, why are we living in [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2956.56s)]
*  a country where half of us are obese and eating shit food and don't know any better? And then the [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2961.68s)]
*  other half of us don't have like, how does, it's just, it's lack of leadership that's caused [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2966.64s)]
*  dysfunction. And so if we're tired of that, then, then let's just fix it. Like we don't need anybody's [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2970.64s)]
*  permission. Like that's the whole beauty. Like that's the whole beauty of what America is, is [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2976.48s)]
*  like, we don't, we don't need some greasy haired corporate schmuck to give us permission to go [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2980.3199999999997s)]
*  fix all these things that are wrong. Let's just go do it. And if they don't like it, fuck them, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2985.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, in all domains of life, from, from food to the music industry, honestly, to education, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2989.52s)]
*  also to government itself, all of it. And that, you know, your music is also just the soundtrack [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=2998.88s)]
*  to that spirit that makes America great of just constantly trying to revitalize itself. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3008.56s)]
*  When the bullshit piles up a little too high, there's that revolutionary spirit that says like, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3017.44s)]
*  we need to fix this shit. And that inspiration that created this country was from years of people [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3022.32s)]
*  living under tyranny. Like we forget the story of the people who really created this country. Like [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3027.6s)]
*  it's funny. I, one of the statements I made at the very beginning, they got taken way out of context, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3032.56s)]
*  but I wasn't in a position to like even begin to have a conversation about is I made this comment [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3037.84s)]
*  early on in one of the shows about, about how, about how our diversity is a strength. But that [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3042.32s)]
*  term has been hijacked now to mean something a lot different than what it really means. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3048.0800000000004s)]
*  But it's like, think about how many different people came together just at the founding of [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3052.56s)]
*  this country, like people who spoke different languages, different cultures, religions, ways [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3056.1600000000003s)]
*  of thinking. So many different people came together to even create this place now. And like, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3060.56s)]
*  we've just forgotten about all that. They didn't all come here because they wanted to ride on some [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3064.56s)]
*  miserable boat ride and risk their whole lives to go to live in some crazy jungle, essentially. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3068.96s)]
*  They had no structure, like no infrastructure, no medicine, no like they didn't come here for like [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3074.2400000000002s)]
*  some glorified camping trip. It's because they were tired of like generations of being persecuted [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3079.6s)]
*  and living under tyranny and not being allowed to practice their, you know, it's not like they wanted [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3084.7200000000003s)]
*  freedom of religion and they didn't want separation of church and state because they were a bunch of [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3088.8s)]
*  goody two shoes and they love going to church every Sunday. It's because they weren't allowed [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3092.32s)]
*  to believe in what they believed in because some asshole king or some hierarchy told them they [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3096.16s)]
*  couldn't and they were just tired of it. That's what we're losing now is like we've forgotten [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3100.0s)]
*  that we're those people, like the same structures that have plagued this country are their [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3104.16s)]
*  multinational corporations and it's just the ideology behind them and their structure is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3109.3599999999997s)]
*  what the problem is. Yeah, I mean, it's multinational corporations, it's nation states that [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3114.64s)]
*  are deeply corrupt and are authoritarian and ultimately abuse power and yes, create [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3121.36s)]
*  elements of tyranny and from that, the human spirit rises, like I said, with songs like the ones you [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  write or at the founding in this country, you know, that's why all this diverse outcasts come [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3140.1600000000003s)]
*  together and write something as crazy as all men are created equal. What a gangster line. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3147.44s)]
*  I guess not an easy thing to take a lot of that stuff for granted now, but that's not an easy [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3155.92s)]
*  thing to come up with. That's a really gutsy thing to see the value in all people equally and of [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3160.48s)]
*  course, they also were suffering from delusion, you know, they didn't see black people as equal, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3169.2s)]
*  they didn't see women as equal, but even that first leap of like all men are created equal, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3178.56s)]
*  that's like a gigantic fuck you to the past. Taking that leap forward really took a lot in [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3184.72s)]
*  an age and a time when it probably sounded, and it's not like they just made a statement [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3190.16s)]
*  and put it on Twitter, like they think about how much, just think about the insanity, like I can't [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3196.16s)]
*  even conceptualize the insanity of what took place from the time that, like even from the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3203.44s)]
*  Revolutionary War until now to try to preserve that idea, you know, so much has happened and [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3208.3999999999996s)]
*  so much sacrifice has been made and just so many hours of labor and thought and intensity. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3213.8399999999997s)]
*  Even in the 20th century, it's good, two world wars and, you know, especially in the second [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3218.48s)]
*  world war, the United States played a very crucial role and there was a lot of ideological, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3224.72s)]
*  like battle of ideas going on at that time. Yeah. Of the role of war and peace, of the role of the [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3230.3199999999997s)]
*  United States as the center place for the ideal of human freedom and human rights. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3236.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we continue to innovate, so I'd love to get back to talking to blue collar people you mentioned. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3245.12s)]
*  And those are some of my favorite people. So it was actually really cool to find out that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3251.2s)]
*  for many years of your life, basically the way you made a living is talking to blue collar people [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3257.4399999999996s)]
*  and getting their story. So I'm traveling across the world for a bit, but of course the world that [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3263.68s)]
*  I love the most and I'm most curious about is the different subcultures and towns of the United [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3270.16s)]
*  States. So I took a road trip across the U.S. in my early 20s for several months and that was like [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3277.68s)]
*  a transformative experience for me. And that's something, one of the luxuries I have is to have [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  the freedom to do whatever the hell I want now. And so I want to take a road trip across the United [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3294.3999999999996s)]
*  States for several months. And one of the things I wanted to do is to just to talk to people and [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3300.24s)]
*  small towns in middle America. I don't know what words to put on it, but to talk to the very people [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3307.44s)]
*  that you talked about that, you know, construction workers, plumbers, waitresses, oil rig workers, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3313.76s)]
*  just people that do something real, people that are real, that don't make much money, that struggle, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  but have, as you talked about, have like a richness to them that's not often revealed, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3336.0s)]
*  that's not often talked about. So maybe can you speak to that, to your time with Blue Collar Folk? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3343.12s)]
*  When I got all those messages, we were talking about earlier on earlier in this, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3349.44s)]
*  so many of them, and even now, it's even since I've even like in the last couple of days, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3354.56s)]
*  I've gotten some where they start with, hey, I'm a nobody, but like that's how a lot of those start, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3359.36s)]
*  like the nobodies of the world, if you want to call them like that. It's frustrating that the people [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3365.92s)]
*  who literally have built and preserve and maintain the structure of society that we all comfortably [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3372.32s)]
*  live in, those people have the least amount of representation. They're ignored just because of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3383.12s)]
*  the way the social hierarchy exists, but some of the most dimwitted, irrelevant, terrible people [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3388.96s)]
*  are put here and are idolized and spotlighted, and they're all over television, and they're all [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3397.76s)]
*  over the internet, and we act like they're kings and queens and like that they're royalty. And then [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3403.04s)]
*  all these people who do jobs that most of us will be too tariff, either wouldn't have even the ability [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3410.16s)]
*  to do, we'd be like how many people are going to go underwater and weld, but if we didn't have [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3418.56s)]
*  underwater welders, like one of my best friends whose name is also Jaco, funny enough, the dude [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3424.48s)]
*  works 70, 80 hours every week. He's on the Chesapeake Bay tunnel job now, but the dude's gotten up on, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3429.68s)]
*  gotten on heights that I couldn't get on. He's went underground places I wouldn't go, and [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3436.7999999999997s)]
*  nobody will ever know, like nobody even knows those people's stories or what they went through [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3442.56s)]
*  or like the kind of lives they lived in. And they're like the people who create the fabric of [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3446.16s)]
*  society and even the waitresses and the waiters and like all these factory jobs that I worked in, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3452.08s)]
*  all those people like talk about the craziest place I ever worked and the craziest people I [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3456.8799999999997s)]
*  ever met was this little place called Perfect Air in Marion, North Carolina, and it was this [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3460.96s)]
*  commercial air condition and factory, which is I think closed now, but they didn't pay very well. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3465.44s)]
*  And so everyone they hired was either people that had criminal backgrounds who couldn't get jobs [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3470.08s)]
*  elsewhere or idiots who dropped out of high school and couldn't work elsewhere like me. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3474.88s)]
*  And so I was 18 years old working in this place with people who are mostly in their fifties and [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3479.52s)]
*  sixties, but you want to talk about being exposed to just a whole other world of people like, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3483.36s)]
*  and just the stories and the just, those people are far more interesting than, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3488.48s)]
*  than many of the people that we consider to be celebrities. Like most people who are celebrities [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3493.04s)]
*  are just pretty boring and airheaded and don't really even know what real life is about. They're [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3497.12s)]
*  pretty unrelatable to the rest of the world. And so it would be really cool. I mean, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3501.52s)]
*  that's the whole reason that I want to go out and do these shows in places that haven't had music [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3504.8s)]
*  in them in 10 years, because those people, like that is America to me, you know, how many people [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3508.16s)]
*  in Pittsburgh have been an hour outside of Pittsburgh and even in Virginia, if you lived [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3512.96s)]
*  in Northern Virginia and you drive two and a half hours Southwest, you're in a whole other planet, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3516.56s)]
*  like the people, the accents, the culture. And so I feel driven in the same way. Like I would love to, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3520.88s)]
*  I would love to find a way to, to try to bridge that cultural gap, to make those people relevant [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3527.68s)]
*  and to make, because they are like some of the most whole and like, and it's funny because we [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3533.52s)]
*  emulate a lot of those people, like, you know, modern country music is a bunch of people [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3537.68s)]
*  emulating those people, you know? And there's also like, uh, I love people that have a skill [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3543.36s)]
*  and become masters of that skill also. So that element is also there, even if it's like insanely [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3550.4s)]
*  difficult work, like being a miner, like there's a skill to that. There's stories there. There's like [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3557.52s)]
*  what it takes to do that. So, I mean, some of my favorite humans are engineers and all they do is [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3562.24s)]
*  solve really hard problems. So they develop, I mean, it's a pain in the ass job. Anything in the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3568.48s)]
*  factories is extremely difficult, but you learn so much about what it takes to solve intricate, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3574.4s)]
*  like nuanced problems in the physical world. So coal mining, oil rigs, like you mentioned, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3581.6s)]
*  welding, that's a fascinating way to work. And those are trades that are in many cases dying [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3588.16s)]
*  because we don't, because they aren't popular in culture anymore for everything from agricultural [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3594.0s)]
*  to plumbing and electrical. It's like, those are all areas. I think if you were to go out and talk [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3599.12s)]
*  to some of those people and shed light on it, it would like, you could change the, you could [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3604.4s)]
*  change the entire landscape in America of how it's perceived and like, and make it cool. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3609.76s)]
*  You know? Yeah. So thank you. What you're doing on that front. I want to say, I wrote it down, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3615.44s)]
*  please, if you know people that will be willing to talk, reach out to me. A good way to do that [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3620.0s)]
*  is lexfreedman.com slash contact. This was another one of the things early on that I had an idea [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3625.84s)]
*  about, and I thought was getting done and it wasn't that I've got to go back and try to figure out is [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3631.76s)]
*  doing prison shows and doing rehab shows and all that. But I am really intrigued with like [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3636.8s)]
*  going into those places and trying to immerse myself in just the, the mental state of those [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3645.44s)]
*  people are in and like, it's not talked about a whole lot, but also people who get out ex convicts. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3651.92s)]
*  I mean, that, that's a hard life. That's just a hard life to try to reintegrate back into society. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3659.36s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of those people at perfect error that I worked with, they almost all were in some [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3666.32s)]
*  form of legal trouble. Like there was a lady that worked on the assembly line, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3671.76s)]
*  a side may name Denise and her and her husband had been manufacturing methamphetamine and he took the [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3674.96s)]
*  fall for most of it. She only had to go on probation. He was still in prison, but man, like [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3681.44s)]
*  Denise was a very sweet lady and like, aside from the meth manufacturing, like she was like, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3686.32s)]
*  great. And just such a character like in such a good way. And so it's like, yeah, just. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3691.6s)]
*  Denise, lexfreeman.com. Let's talk. I mean, yeah, you know, like both, both sort of the plumbers and [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3696.72s)]
*  the coal miners and Denise with the old meth habits. I mean, they're walking the line of like, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3706.3999999999996s)]
*  you know, surviving is hard. Yeah. So you have to do a real hard job. And then you also have to [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3716.4s)]
*  live life, which is in general, hard, you know, divorce kids, people die, you lose like the [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3724.08s)]
*  medical issues and that, that can destroy you completely. All of a sudden something happens. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3731.84s)]
*  You can't afford it. The, the, the insurance system destroys people, all of that. So you [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3737.04s)]
*  have to somehow navigate life while working your ass off in a real hard job. And those people, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3743.84s)]
*  they have stories. That's a real pain. And from that pain, from that anger, that's where [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3750.7200000000003s)]
*  Richmond, north of Richmond, that was that, that you could just feel their pain come through with [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3757.28s)]
*  that song and with your other work. So that like, there is a landscape of suffering. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3763.76s)]
*  Yeah. It doesn't have to be that we don't all have to be that decentralized either. Like if all, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3770.4s)]
*  if there is that much commonality among people, which I do believe there is like just innately [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3776.0s)]
*  and suffering and, and then, yeah, like there's a guy, there's a guy in West Virginia that I [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3781.28s)]
*  talked to that he's got a piece of property beside of mine that he was interested in selling. But the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3787.2000000000003s)]
*  reason he's, he's got this dream of opening a, like putting some cabins there and renting them [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3792.16s)]
*  out for people to come Airbnb. He works at Lowe's full time, but his son's got this, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3797.36s)]
*  his son's like 19 and it's got this heart surgery he's got to have. And so he's trying to sell the [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3802.48s)]
*  place for that. And just like, just that guy and all, and all you'd ever see him as is the guy that [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3806.96s)]
*  works at Lowe's like pulling lumber or whatever, but he's got this very insanely complex life. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3811.84s)]
*  He's trying to manage. He doesn't want to lose a son. Like he's just going to sell everything. And [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3817.36s)]
*  like at one point in time, maybe the church served that role of like when people really fell off [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3820.88s)]
*  track and they didn't have a support system and they were like on this tiny boat out in the ocean, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3825.68s)]
*  they figured out some kind of way to rally it. In my mind, that's like the dream of all this. If I, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3829.6s)]
*  if I die and there's any like legacy left or anything done, it's like finding a way to take [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3833.9199999999996s)]
*  all the people that fill that role and organizing them and empowering them and protecting them. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3839.6s)]
*  It's rebuilding the community, but in a real way, not in like this fairy tale bullshit, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3844.72s)]
*  everybody's going to love each other. And we're all just going to be one big happy family. Like [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3849.12s)]
*  everybody's still going to get mad and hate each other in certain ways. And that's good. Like we [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3852.4s)]
*  need those tornadoes. Like you said, we need people piss off and angry and we need people to [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3857.12s)]
*  feel like they can be angry and open about things that are wrong. Like people should be able to [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3861.36s)]
*  speak their mind and we shouldn't all just kiss each other's ass. And we shouldn't all just pretend [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3865.92s)]
*  to be overly polite and say, Hey, Debbie, you have a good weekend. Like you said, like we need all [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3869.44s)]
*  this controversy and this turmoil. And like we need the hell of what that side that, that the [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3874.64s)]
*  internet brings out in people, but it just needs to be in real life. And it needs to be in a way [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3879.36s)]
*  where we're all like, we all are at least chasing the same common goal, which is probably that we [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3882.8s)]
*  don't want to starve and we want to have decent health and, and we want to be able to like provide [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3887.6s)]
*  a decent life for our kids, or at least we just don't, you know, we just want to live a decent life. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3892.56s)]
*  Like, um, I think it's somehow that that fixes, like that fixes what you describe, like the people [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3896.48s)]
*  who, who fall into despair and are isolated and it's a terrifying world to live in. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3905.68s)]
*  It's that principle again, this is, I need a phone, a friend thing where we can just keep [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3911.04s)]
*  calling Jordan for all these things, but like he explains, there's this principle in the Bible [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3914.3199999999997s)]
*  about, about those who, about the more you have, the more you'll receive and the less you have, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3918.3199999999997s)]
*  the less you'll, the less you'll receive kind of a thing. And it's a, it's just a universal law [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3923.2799999999997s)]
*  in society where it seems like the lower you get to the bottom, it's almost like the more, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3927.52s)]
*  like the less resources you have available and the less, the less friends you have. And it's like, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3932.16s)]
*  you just, the further you go snowballs into where it's like people just hit rock bottom. And then, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3936.3199999999997s)]
*  and then what it's like, when you get out of prison, what do you, what are you supposed to do? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3942.7999999999997s)]
*  When you're a veteran with mental health, like, what are you supposed to do? Like [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3946.48s)]
*  in my mind, that's what the church is supposed to be there for is like, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3950.4s)]
*  but obviously it doesn't fill that role anymore. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3954.48s)]
*  To some people, at least religion does a little bit. It gives, it's at least a foundation of [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3956.88s)]
*  community, a foundation of hope for people. And when they're really struggling, yeah, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3964.88s)]
*  you got thousands of messages, like you talked about from people, you gotten to talk to thousands [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3972.4s)]
*  of people about their pain through your work, through your music, you've been an inspiration [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3978.2400000000002s)]
*  to those people to find a way out of the pain. Can you tell the full story of your own lowest point [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3983.12s)]
*  before, before all of this, before the, before the music, before you blew up, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3991.12s)]
*  can you take me through the story of the depression, the drinking, and just the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=3999.04s)]
*  roughest times in your life? It's sometimes it's not even, you know, it's funny, but it's almost [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4005.2s)]
*  not even where you're at in life. It's where you perceive yourself at in life and what your, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4012.8s)]
*  what your goals are moving forward. And I think like, you know, I was, I dropped out of high school [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4017.04s)]
*  at 17, basically ran away from home. I just, I couldn't, I have always had this authority problem. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4023.1200000000003s)]
*  And so I just didn't want to listen to my parents. I didn't want to go to college. I just wanted to [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4029.44s)]
*  go move into the mountains. I was running away from responsibility, I guess, is what I was doing, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4034.1600000000003s)]
*  you know? And so got this girl pregnant, had my first kid when I was 18 or just about to turn 19. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4038.48s)]
*  And like I said, I'm working in the air conditioning factory with a bunch of [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4045.76s)]
*  convicted felons. And so from there, everything was just reactionary. I never really had a plan. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4049.6s)]
*  I would jump from job to job, just like most everybody else. I don't know. I just, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4054.56s)]
*  I just got to a point where I guess I just quit believing in myself. And I knew that I wasn't [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4058.88s)]
*  doing, I just knew I wasn't doing, I wasn't filling my purpose and I wasn't being the best [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4062.72s)]
*  version of myself I could be. And so the alternative to like facing yourself in the mirror and accepting [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4067.6s)]
*  that, that I'm not a shitty person. I've just let myself fall. You know, it's like, it's so hard to [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4072.96s)]
*  accept when you've had that fall that it's just easier to just, just to get drunk and, you know, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4079.6s)]
*  just do the bare minimum you can to keep everything sort of kind of moving along. But you don't really [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4087.04s)]
*  care if you live or die. You don't, you don't really care about much anything like your whole, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4092.08s)]
*  you know, I don't know, life is just so beautiful when you're a child. You're so imaginative and [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4096.16s)]
*  exploratory and you're learning all these things and you just, you just can't wait to be an adult [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4099.68s)]
*  because you're just going to go out and do all these incredible, you know, and then you face the [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4104.08s)]
*  reality of it. Yeah. And the pressure and the fear of failure, like I think maybe even my own fear [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4109.12s)]
*  of failure is what drove, is what drove me. And, but yeah, you just, and you, you think negatively [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4113.92s)]
*  about yourself for so many days and weeks and months and you like, you don't even have a real [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4119.68s)]
*  self-awareness of like what you're doing or how destructive you've become, but you always have that, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4124.88s)]
*  that discernment in you, that like, that conscious, you know, that little voice in your, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4130.56s)]
*  in your spirit that is letting you know you're messing up, you know, I was almost like, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4137.12s)]
*  and I was wrestling with myself, you know? And so I don't know, I just got to a point where it's just like, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4142.24s)]
*  yeah, just, just a very, just a very overwhelming sense of numbness. Like, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4147.6s)]
*  like I don't like nothing really, nothing that mattered before really matters anymore. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4154.64s)]
*  Like, I guess that's, that's probably to me, the definition of depression is when all the things [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4158.88s)]
*  you love and care about are just meaningless and you can't find, you really can't find meaning or [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4163.280000000001s)]
*  purpose or excitement in anything. And so I don't know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4169.04s)]
*  in anything, you know, like, like I think, especially with men that commit suicide, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4176.16s)]
*  it's a, it's a prolonged period of that. It's not like they just wake up one day and they have a bad [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4184.0s)]
*  day and they kill themselves. It's like you self-reflect negatively about yourself and your life [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4190.32s)]
*  and you don't do the things that you're supposed to do every day for a long enough period of time. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4196.0s)]
*  And it's like, pretty soon you've built this whole mountain of, of, of, of mismanaged, neglected [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4199.76s)]
*  stuff, for lack of a better word, like this mountain that you have to climb back up in [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4211.52s)]
*  order to fix all these things that you should have been doing all along. And then the, and then on [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4215.68s)]
*  the other side of it, it's like, well, I could just die. Like that seems a lot like it's almost [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4220.08s)]
*  like for, I think from a man's perspective, maybe the friends that I've had that I've lost, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4224.24s)]
*  it seems like a lot of times you think you'd never see it coming, you know, like, I don't know, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4229.28s)]
*  maybe that's a general thing with, it seems like a lot of times men mask that better and you don't [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4234.96s)]
*  pick up on it as much, but I think it's like, you just dig yourself into a point to where [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4239.04s)]
*  it's like, you have a mountain of responsibility in front of you that you haven't faced that you [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4246.32s)]
*  don't know how to face and you haven't been able to do so for a long time, but there's this really [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4250.32s)]
*  easy detour and it's just, you know, putting your big toe on the trigger. And it's like, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4255.76s)]
*  which one of those are, I don't know, like they're both seen, but at that point, your, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4260.96s)]
*  your perception of reality is so distorted that like you don't, all the things that, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4265.4400000000005s)]
*  that would normally compel you to move along, like your, like love and joy and like your, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4272.88s)]
*  your drive, you know, your drive to, to be that none of that really, it's not there for you to [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4279.120000000001s)]
*  even contemplate, if that makes sense. It's like that part is almost like, at least for a little [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4285.120000000001s)]
*  while invisible. And all you see is fear and responsibility. And just this, like I said, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4290.080000000001s)]
*  I just, I just envision it like a mountain that you don't, you don't really know if you're even [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4297.52s)]
*  able to climb. And then the other option is just, so I, I think that's probably where, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4301.360000000001s)]
*  that's probably where a lot of people go. And that's probably where I was, was just like, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4307.6s)]
*  you know? Yeah. I mean, there is the, it's not just responsibilities, the immensity of it, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4313.360000000001s)]
*  the mountain. And I think you're accurately describing how it happens, which is gradually. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4318.96s)]
*  Yeah. Seeing yourself in a negative light over time slowly suffocates you. And then [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4326.08s)]
*  the burden of the responsibility that piles up. And unfortunately, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4332.4s)]
*  of course, one of the ways out is to pull the trigger. And the other way out is the Jordan [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4340.08s)]
*  Peterson back to Jordan sort of one gradual step at a time, like make your bed. It's like start [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4346.639999999999s)]
*  climbing out, like the responsibilities before you one at a time, every single day. And then [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4354.799999999999s)]
*  just climbing out and have faith that it will work out. That was what was so powerful for me [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4362.32s)]
*  about just beginning to open my mind back up to reading just a little bit of stuff, like a little [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4367.92s)]
*  bit of stuff from the new Testament that Jesus said, and some different perspectives and teachings, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4373.12s)]
*  but like, you know, an apostle would be in prison, like basically being tortured and facing death, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4377.04s)]
*  but like just overjoyed and writing about talking about, it's all about your perspective of things. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4384.4s)]
*  Said like, that's why I never could understand why, you know, like celebrities are professional. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4389.92s)]
*  I mean, giving one example of many, like a Kurt Cobain type scenario where you have a guy that's [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4395.200000000001s)]
*  just immensely talented, just will always be loved by plenty of people. Like I never could understand [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4399.76s)]
*  why that guy. There's an ocean of quiet suffering in a lot of, and I think it is disproportionately [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4406.72s)]
*  in men and a lot of men and they hide it well. That's why blue collar workers have such a high [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4416.4s)]
*  suicide rate and all too, and why it is so important to talk to those people. And yeah, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4421.759999999999s)]
*  it's, you know, you could see it in the eyes and there, there, there is, there, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4426.879999999999s)]
*  there is a lot of pain there without like trying to get, without like trying to open up too many [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4432.08s)]
*  doors. I think that's probably the best way I would describe it is just a series of really, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4436.639999999999s)]
*  this is a series of negligent decisions and also just misperceptions. You know, like I think this [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4441.36s)]
*  was an Andrew Huberman thing where he talks about medications and how it's a lot more likely for [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4447.84s)]
*  somebody to keep their dog on their medication schedule, but not themselves. You know, you love [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4454.16s)]
*  your dog and your dog, like it's just this great little thing. And you just, you don't see the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4460.719999999999s)]
*  flaws and the faults and the sin and the disgust in your dog that you do yourself. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4465.68s)]
*  So it's much more likely for people to make sure their dog has their medication every day. But like [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  there's this alarming statistic with just the amount of people that don't even fill their [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4477.120000000001s)]
*  prescriptions they need filled or take care of themselves the way they do. And, and then that [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4481.68s)]
*  also like over time, you know, like if you quit taking care of yourself and you're not in good [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4486.08s)]
*  health and you're, and you're, you're not in a good routine, you're not doing, you're not like [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4490.72s)]
*  a long series of doing enough of those things. Like you do, it's easy for you to just think that [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4496.96s)]
*  your self worth is zero. Cause if you're not even willing to like, if you're not even willing to like [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4501.2s)]
*  have basic hygiene and, and eat decent food and try to take care of yourself, it's like why, how, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4506.56s)]
*  like how on earth are you going to go face all these things that you need to face to get your [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4513.280000000001s)]
*  life better? If you can't, you don't even care enough to do that. It's just like, but it is, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4517.04s)]
*  it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a long tragic road to get to that point. I think at least in my case, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4520.88s)]
*  the idea that there was something bigger than me that loved me, even despite I had all these [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4526.32s)]
*  flaws and problems and just that I was just such a wretched person. That's what, at least in my [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4531.2s)]
*  situation, that's what I think helped put, you know, more than anything. Like I said, that's [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4537.44s)]
*  certainly where the motivation to quit the, once I quit the drinking, it helped a lot because I was [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4542.16s)]
*  able to, even though it was difficult, I was able to actually be able to be honest with myself and [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4546.64s)]
*  reflect on a lot of things that were, and you know, you got to think, like I said, we watched the, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4551.6s)]
*  I mean, it was like with, of course in my case, it was a little unfair of an example because within [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4556.08s)]
*  a month, all this stuff had happened like after I quit, but you know, I see it in my friends that [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4559.52s)]
*  have quit and have tried to turn things around and it, you know, it's like, it's, it's, it is the most [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4565.92s)]
*  beautiful thing in the world to see somebody like come to life again after being in one of those [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4571.12s)]
*  you're able to like, sort of like escape this shell of, of all those terrible things. And even [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4576.64s)]
*  if you are still in a bad position and you're still, you got 30 grand worth of credit card debt and [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4581.280000000001s)]
*  you're working some shit job and your car doesn't start half the time and like, you know, your [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4586.0s)]
*  girlfriend left you for some other dude and like, don't matter what it is. Like if at least that [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4590.4800000000005s)]
*  little glimmer of hope that like that faith that there is a chance at something greater, like that [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4595.04s)]
*  can, that'll push people. You can put, you can push it. You can push them out on the side with that, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4600.56s)]
*  you know, like you can do anything with that. And I think it's also good. I think it is important to [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4605.68s)]
*  have a good support structure. Like when you get to that point, I don't think you should, I don't [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4610.56s)]
*  think anybody should have to face that stuff by themselves. And there's plenty of other people [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4614.4800000000005s)]
*  out there that are in the same position. And I think that's again, I think that's why it's so [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4620.16s)]
*  important for us to try to get reconnected on a personal level and not just through [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4624.0s)]
*  digital communication, because like we don't, we don't, all we see of each other online is the good [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4627.76s)]
*  stuff. Very rarely are people posting on Facebook talking about, you know, how could you even, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4632.8s)]
*  it's like, all you see is the best of people, but I don't think we realized that we're all going [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4639.52s)]
*  through a lot of the same things anyway, you know, the low points and stuff. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4642.64s)]
*  And guess what happens when you either lose your job or can't quite figure out a good job and you're [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4645.84s)]
*  not making that much money or you're basically broke and you have a girlfriend that's not happy [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4650.88s)]
*  about you being broke. She's going to leave you. If it's a wife that could face divorce and like [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4656.4800000000005s)]
*  the breakups and divorce can break a lot of people, even when they're doing well. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4662.56s)]
*  And now when they're not doing well, that's a rough one. And that basically your support system [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4669.04s)]
*  for a lot of people is the relationship is the wife and the, and so like that's taking the [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4675.68s)]
*  support system from underneath you. And I've had good friends of mine. I've seen getting [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4681.04s)]
*  destructive relationships and like they'll start to date a girl. And then like within a year, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4685.6s)]
*  they're just like a shell of what they were because sometimes I do think it's, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4690.56s)]
*  I do think you have to be careful with like your self validation and the way you perceive yourself [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4695.360000000001s)]
*  and making sure that it's you giving yourself that and not somebody else. Cause I do think too, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  it's like, yeah, like you're, you know, how are you supposed to, if you can't even, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4703.84s)]
*  if you can't even keep a woman around to love you, right? Like how are you supposed to love [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4710.0s)]
*  yourself? It's easy to think about that. Like I've seen a lot of men get wrecked in bad [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4713.68s)]
*  relationships and stuff too. That's it's a, it's tough, you know? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4717.44s)]
*  Yeah. Ultimately I think maybe dark to say, but there is, there is a base layer at which [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4720.96s)]
*  we're, we're alone in this world. Like you need to be strong by yourself first and foremost, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4726.5599999999995s)]
*  because sometimes there'll be times in life where everybody leaves you. Yeah. The wife leaves you, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4736.32s)]
*  the job leaves you. And for some people might even people you thought are friends will backstab [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4741.679999999999s)]
*  you. And even then you have to have the strength to find your footing again. Like that, that [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4747.28s)]
*  ultimately comes from you. Right? I mean, man, of course, like I said, in all the experiences I've [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4754.24s)]
*  been through, just, I can't, I'd be a fool to deny it, but like, I do think there is God there. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4759.12s)]
*  That's always there if you're, but you certainly can self isolate yourself to even from that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4764.32s)]
*  If you can find faith in yourself, I've seen it do wonderful things for human beings, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4769.5199999999995s)]
*  you and God, faith in something bigger than you. Yeah. They can give strength to a lot of people, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4774.48s)]
*  but allowing yourself to derive strength solely from other people can be a dangerous thing. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4781.28s)]
*  Because people are complicated and they can betray, they can, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4790.88s)]
*  just like they can fill your life with love, they can also destroy you. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4796.88s)]
*  Also destroy you. That's also the beautiful thing about life. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4800.08s)]
*  Yeah, it is. You make yourself vulnerable to other people. You form [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4804.24s)]
*  deep relationships. That means they can also destroy you. So that's life. That's what makes [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4808.5599999999995s)]
*  this whole thing. That's what, and then you write really great heartbreak songs. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4818.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, people, you know, there's something valuable about people fucking you over and, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4822.72s)]
*  and hardship and all that kind of stuff. Even the best of us have terrible parts of us. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4827.92s)]
*  Like we are all flawed inherently because we're human. And so [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4834.72s)]
*  they'll never be, they'll never be another garden of Eden on earth. Like figuratively where, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4842.48s)]
*  where we all just live harmoniously and everything's great and happy and wonderful, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4848.0s)]
*  but it is, it's those basic principles that you talk about, like love and our, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4851.679999999999s)]
*  and those relationships and those connections that we have, they make it all. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4855.12s)]
*  Cause the thing about, I mean, like in a lot of cases, it's like, what even, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4858.24s)]
*  that's the position you get in when you get to, when you get so depressed and you get so low, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4860.96s)]
*  it's like, what's the point in even doing all this? Like it is, it is just for anyone is just [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4864.64s)]
*  so crazy, overly complicated and exhausting to live. Isn't it like even in this modern society [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4869.84s)]
*  where we have all these wonderful little conveniences and we can just have food delivered [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4875.36s)]
*  right to our door if we want and all this kind of crap. It's like, people are still like more [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4879.68s)]
*  depressed now than they've ever been. And like all the mental anxiety and all the mental health [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4884.96s)]
*  stuff is just probably just as prevalent as it's ever been. It's, it's people talk about money, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4889.44s)]
*  not making you happy. And you know, it's like easy when you're, it's easy when you're broke to think, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4895.76s)]
*  man, if I had some money, I've, and of course, financial freedom is what you're really looking [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4901.12s)]
*  for. Not like an abundance of wealth, but the things that we talk about that make life worth [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4904.4800000000005s)]
*  living, aren't things that you can buy. They are things that you obtain through relationships [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4908.96s)]
*  and love and, and life. And so it's a, it is just an infinitely complex and crazy thing to think [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4912.56s)]
*  about, but it's like, that human component of us is what is what we, is what's so important to our, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4922.320000000001s)]
*  to our long-term existence, like our, our ability to, to have connection with each other and [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4931.280000000001s)]
*  the joy we find in that, the purpose we find in that is, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4937.04s)]
*  it's not, it's not anything that's replaceable by with anything, you know? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4941.12s)]
*  Yeah. I've seen that with just seeing the effects of war on the people and basically war [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4946.0s)]
*  strips away everything. You lose your home, you lose everything. And you get to see what's actually [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4954.4s)]
*  really important. And there's the other people in your life, friends, family. It's almost cliche [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4961.84s)]
*  to say, but it's, it's the people you love in your life that make up the essence of what makes life [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4969.28s)]
*  worth living. It's not the homes, the material possessions, the, even the job and whatever else, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4978.8s)]
*  it's the, the humans. So yeah. Yeah. It's important to remember a lot of us, especially [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4985.68s)]
*  in the United States under a capitalist system or chasing money. Yeah. It's important to remember [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4992.400000000001s)]
*  what you're doing it all for. I got to talk to you about your, your writing process. You've written [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=4999.360000000001s)]
*  just a bunch of really incredible songs. You say you're not good at, you're not a good musician, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5005.280000000001s)]
*  which is hilarious. Dude, I have no, I have like zero self-confidence about any, I mean, just about [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5012.56s)]
*  anything, but I, when I say that I'm not being funny. Like I'm like, you get nervous when you like [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5017.280000000001s)]
*  get on stage. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like I can think about shows coming up and my hands will sweat [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5024.0s)]
*  thinking about them. Yeah. You told me that you like, haven't really played the songs for like a [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5030.88s)]
*  couple months, like old songs in September. Yeah. September. Well, dude, like think about how, like, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5035.92s)]
*  you know, I can, I'm not going to sit around and play. I've got to get sober for fun. Like, and [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5044.4s)]
*  like, you know, so you feel, you feel the songs when you play them. Yeah. Yeah. That's rough. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5049.84s)]
*  That's, that's rough. A lot of musicians talk about that kind of thing there, right? Like about this, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5057.92s)]
*  I don't know. I've heard about that with people like about hating to play songs because of [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5063.92s)]
*  that side of it, but. Oh yeah. I've become close friends with Dan Reynolds, who is the lead singer [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5069.12s)]
*  for Imagine Dragons. And he says every time he performs a song, I mean, he has songs that have [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5075.599999999999s)]
*  depression in them and all that kind of stuff. And he says like, the only real way to do it is to feel [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5080.5599999999995s)]
*  it. You have to, you can't just fake it. You have to like be in it. You have to like really feel the [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5085.599999999999s)]
*  song as if you're singing it, as if you're writing it for the first time. So as a performer, that, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5092.32s)]
*  that he says that that's his duty he has to, to the, to the audience, but then that takes a toll. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5098.88s)]
*  That's not easy to do. That's a good, that, especially with the songs you write. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5105.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of darkness there in your songs. Yeah. And I do have some, I do have some [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5110.96s)]
*  whiter hearted ones too, that, that I'll, you know, I mean, the thing is it's like, I've only put out, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5117.28s)]
*  I, I'm a little funny about like, really like, God, I don't know how many songs I have written [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5123.84s)]
*  that I will probably never do anything with. Like, I mean, probably at least 20 or 30 of them that [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5128.8s)]
*  are just like, they're just not, I just don't know why I don't want to put them out, but just. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5134.16s)]
*  What does it look like? What, do you have like a notebook with ideas or do you mean you have like [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5138.24s)]
*  literal videos of half baked songs? Yeah, I've got my old phone, like even just that old phone [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5143.84s)]
*  that I recorded all the stuff for Tik Tok and all on it's got loads of like little, just like the way [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5149.76s)]
*  that Richmond one was where it was like in the bathroom facing this. And I had like that, you [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5154.88s)]
*  know, that's all that, even that one I showed you on there, it had been sitting on my phone probably [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5158.88s)]
*  a couple months before it. That's why I said I have too many unfinished songs. It's exactly what [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5162.96s)]
*  I meant. I've got all these little snippets of things like a little blip here or there, but the [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5166.8s)]
*  writing process is well, it's a lot different than I thought most people write because [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5172.4s)]
*  like in the. There's a lot of people that do these writing rooms and stuff and they'll have, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5178.16s)]
*  or you know, these co-writes where they'll have people sit down and they like sit on the couch [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5183.12s)]
*  and smoke a joint and they're like, all right, let's write this song. And they just like, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5187.36s)]
*  start plugging away and they, to me, that's like, I can't do that. I have to just. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5191.2s)]
*  It's like almost the op, it's like a lot of times the songs come when I'm not prepared for them. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5196.48s)]
*  You like to be alone. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5202.32s)]
*  Well, alone in my head, I could be out and I could be anywhere in it. You know, some of them, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5205.04s)]
*  I'll just be in the shower and they'll just like, and I'm like scram because the thing is, is like, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5210.88s)]
*  it's a certain part of your brain, I guess that creates that stuff or picks it up or does whatever, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5216.4s)]
*  but they come, just they come and they go just as quick as they come. It's like when you wake up, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5221.2s)]
*  it's exactly like when you wake up, you've had this crazy vivid dream in your head and you wake [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5226.48s)]
*  up and it's all right there. And then you stop thinking about it for like half a second and then [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5231.92s)]
*  it all goes away and you'll never remember it again. You know, like you can't remember your [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5236.32s)]
*  dreams like that is exactly like that. It's like, it'll be there. It's like perfect. Like it's [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5239.44s)]
*  all right. It's like, it's, it's almost like giving to you, like just perfect, like parts of it or the [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5243.92s)]
*  whole thing or whatever. And then you get into this flow state to where you just like, it's all [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5249.28s)]
*  there in front of you and you just figure it all out. And it's like, you've, it's like somehow [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5253.92s)]
*  you've like unlocked this little part of your brain that you don't even really know how to get to, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5258.0s)]
*  but you just get to, and it's all there and you figure it out. But man, if you don't get it, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5261.36s)]
*  it's gone. Like you'll never, you'll never get it again. Like you'll never even be able to replicate [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5264.639999999999s)]
*  that song ever again. It's like, it'll just go away. And typically it's like, it's only maybe the [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5269.28s)]
*  first half of the first verse is what I'll get, or it'll be like the chorus line I'll get. And [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5274.72s)]
*  then I'll build the rest of the song around that, if that makes sense, I guess. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5279.360000000001s)]
*  Well, the words or the music or the melody, like what, what pops into your head? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5282.72s)]
*  The, the emotion, I guess the words, sometimes it's a phrase like, like one thing I will do is like, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5286.72s)]
*  especially out in the country, people say the craziest, people say the craziest things. And so [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5294.8s)]
*  sometimes I'll like jot down a little bit of some, like I will sometimes on my phone, take a [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5300.4s)]
*  little note. If somebody says something real crazy that I've never heard before, and then maybe one [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5304.48s)]
*  day it'll just pop in my head like, oh, you know, I don't know. It's very random though. Like I don't [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5308.639999999999s)]
*  sit and just try to write songs. That's why I haven't put out like, that's why I haven't just [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5313.36s)]
*  been dumping out, even though I had been writing a lot of songs, I haven't just been like dumping [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5317.92s)]
*  out all this crazy music. I don't want to force it. I don't want to do truck beer, girl songs. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5321.839999999999s)]
*  They're like, I don't want to force song. I don't want to like, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5326.08s)]
*  Do you have any truck beer girl songs? Cause that that would be an interesting. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5329.2s)]
*  Yeah. I've got this silly one about this guy in West Virginia that he's like the most, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5333.6s)]
*  he's the most laid back because I always get in my head and go over analytical about stuff and get [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5340.4s)]
*  real serious sometimes about things. And he's like, buddy, you just got to take a drag off this thing. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5344.8s)]
*  And he'll, you know, he was the one he'd always like, like peer pressure me into taking a hit [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5349.76s)]
*  off a joint or something. And like, just try to cheer. And he just didn't take life so seriously. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5354.16s)]
*  So I've written this song about, it's called Dr. Dan and it's about, you know, he's a doctor, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5358.0s)]
*  but he's not like a convent. He's not like a conventional doctor. That's a silly one that [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5361.84s)]
*  I'll put out. So I do have some silly ones like that. I have a couple of funny ones that I'll, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5365.76s)]
*  that I'll never ever, ever probably play to the public, but I did. I played him at the mothership [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5371.84s)]
*  only because nobody has their phones in there. But when I, after right after we did Rogan, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5376.96s)]
*  I had, I got a chance. I got, somehow I got connected with Tom Segura right after [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5382.8s)]
*  Rogan and we went over to the mothership and I got to meet him and I love Adam Magat. You know, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5386.72s)]
*  he, he was on the thing with Norm McDonald is how I got introduced to him, that show Norm McDonald [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5391.84s)]
*  had, but he's just, he's an awesome dude. And so we, we ended up at the mothership. I think it was [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5395.92s)]
*  the evening after the Rogan podcast and Tom's like, well, they've never had, they've never had live [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5402.16s)]
*  music in here. He's like, you could be the first one. I was like, whatever. And so we only had one [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5407.92s)]
*  guitar and I had my guitarist Joey with me. So Ron White was there. It was Tom Segura and then Ron [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5415.04s)]
*  White that night. And Ron took Joey in his car, drove him across town to his, to his house and [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5420.8s)]
*  grabbed another guitar and came back and we got up there and we did like two really silly songs. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5429.04s)]
*  And then Richmond in between, in between Tom set and Ron set. And I was like, again, that was one [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5434.0s)]
*  of those moments in my life where I was like, what, like what, what is this? Like, what is this crazy [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5441.2s)]
*  reality? I'm in, but I do have some funny, I used to cause a lot of when I wasn't playing the open [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5445.92s)]
*  mics, you know, the, well, like, you know, Brian that you met a lot of my guitar playing was spent [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5450.88s)]
*  at places like his house and we were all heavy drinkers and we were just sitting around at a [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5456.08s)]
*  party plan or whatever, you know? And so I definitely liked the silly stuff too, but [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5459.52s)]
*  I was really in my head when we were talking about being low and what I would suggest people to do [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5464.160000000001s)]
*  if they're in that point. But if I was just to like, not to flip this, but just, it just popped [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5468.240000000001s)]
*  in my head, but probably what I would tell anybody to do if they're like suicidal and thinking about [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5473.040000000001s)]
*  like, if they're to that point is just to go find some, go find somewhere out, like in nature and go. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5477.52s)]
*  That's what, you know, that's, I kind of missed this step when we were talking about things, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5484.0s)]
*  but like selling my house and buying that property and putting a camper on it and trying [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5488.64s)]
*  to go into this whole off grid thing really like, I don't know, it does a lot of good for you being [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5493.12s)]
*  reconnected to nature because we are a part of it, but. Oh yeah. That's I've been to the, I went to [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5498.56s)]
*  the jungle for that reason. Yeah. Being out of nature in every way is just, it's beautiful. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5504.64s)]
*  I saw you got some, maybe, maybe that's what I need to do is get some goats. I got two, I can give you. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5509.280000000001s)]
*  Get, I have more questions. Why are you giving them so easily? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5515.52s)]
*  Are there issues I need to know about? Well, they're goats. Yeah. There's no, there's no free [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5519.84s)]
*  lunch, man. I, what, how many, you got goats, you got, you got all kinds of animals. What's the, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5524.08s)]
*  so what's the story of you out in the woods? What are you doing out there? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5529.76s)]
*  No comment. I'm just kidding. Just trying to escape this dystopian nightmare that we're all living [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5534.0s)]
*  under. Like just, it was just a form of escapism, I guess. But you know, my, well, yeah, I think in [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5538.72s)]
*  such a short period of time, my grandfather grew up, like, you know, they were in a survival estate, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5544.64s)]
*  like trying to make enough money to pay the tax on their land, growing tobacco. And then here I am, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5550.96s)]
*  like in this digital world two generations later. And I'm just like, something's not, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5556.08s)]
*  you know, I just felt, just felt called to try to figure out, figure all that out and how to get [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5560.64s)]
*  back into that. There's just a, there's such a purity to, man, if you raise an animal and kill it [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5566.160000000001s)]
*  and eat it, like, and I'm not talking about like, like Ted Nugent style, but just like, you know, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5573.12s)]
*  raising meat birds and pigs and stuff and being, having the ability to put those in the freezer [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5579.5199999999995s)]
*  and cook them for dinner. Like, they taste so much better, but it's just, it feels, it's just, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5583.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how to describe it, but it just brings me joy. Being able to grow stuff and [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5587.84s)]
*  even just flowers and everything else, just watching stuff that's alive like that. It's just [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5593.12s)]
*  such a, you know, my, what we're doing now is I've bought this permaculture farm that hadn't been [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5598.16s)]
*  operational in like six or seven years and they did a lot of herbs. They had a big orchard, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5603.92s)]
*  blueberries, you know, but my dream there is to create this space that it's like the optimal [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5609.2s)]
*  place for humans to go to fix their mind. So like, like what's the animals and the food that I can [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5616.8s)]
*  have there and the trees that I can plant and the certain types of wildlife that I can bring in and [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5622.16s)]
*  attract like the noises and the sounds and the smells that are optimal for a human to be in, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5626.08s)]
*  in order to like fix whatever it is, you know, like I had the opportunity to meet Robert Kennedy [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5631.6s)]
*  Jr. early on with all this and, you know, he actually came out to my property and all we [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5637.5199999999995s)]
*  taught and we're still, I think the idea is that we're going to launch this kind of like healing [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5642.48s)]
*  center thing out there. Once he gets, once they get through all the mess that like they got their [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5647.2s)]
*  hands full a little bit right now with things, but whether I go that route or not, it's like, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5651.6s)]
*  that's my goal is to basically create a place that people can go and like, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5656.400000000001s)]
*  and fix their mind and find the optimal thing. You know, we've got land birds and meat birds. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5659.68s)]
*  So we have, we get our eggs and meat and then we've done pigs and sheep and goats. And then [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5664.64s)]
*  I'm going to start with cat. I'm going to get cattle in the spring. So we'll start doing like [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5670.8s)]
*  Wagyu and Angus and playing around with, and I want to get some funny stuff too. Like I just, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5675.52s)]
*  large animals have a lot of, you know, there's all these like large animal therapies out there [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5681.28s)]
*  for mental health, like with vets and stuff. It's just something, it's something really [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5685.44s)]
*  relaxing and rewarding about being in that space. What do you, what do you find out there in nature [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5690.32s)]
*  that you can't find anywhere else? I can't find in the, in the quote, civilized world. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5696.4s)]
*  Well, everything in civilization seems so like everything we've talked about, it seems so like, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5704.8s)]
*  there's such a level of despair and unorganization and chaos and just like, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5711.28s)]
*  and all, and all these like terrible parts of life that seem like so unstructured and just so uncertain. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5716.24s)]
*  But in nature, everything is certain. Everything has a system, like even on the microbial level [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5723.44s)]
*  of soil, there's this like intricate system and you know, soil, soil fixes it. Like the bacteria [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5728.32s)]
*  fixes the soil and like, and you can grow certain types of plants to restore certain types of [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5735.44s)]
*  nutrients and then that can grow certain types of trees and then that can bring in certain types [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5740.48s)]
*  of birds. And it's like this whole big nature is just this whole big beautiful system, you know, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5744.4s)]
*  like earth is just such an intricate complex system that is structured. And although there is [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5749.2s)]
*  chaos, there's literal tornadoes, you know, like the metaphor we were using earlier, like there are [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5754.4s)]
*  literal tornadoes in nature and other things, but there's, there's a piece about observing the [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5759.28s)]
*  structure there. And to me, like, it just helps, it helps remind and restore my faith that there [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5764.5599999999995s)]
*  is something bigger than me that like, yeah. And there's a spiritual side to it that I don't know [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5770.5599999999995s)]
*  that I can really correctly articulate, but man, sitting out in the woods with some creek flowing [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5777.04s)]
*  by you and just sitting in stillness, like where you, you don't hear anything, there's no traffic [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5781.679999999999s)]
*  from a road. There's no, you know, you're just, you're just there in stillness and just watching, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5787.839999999999s)]
*  watching the earth do its things. Just, I've gotten a chance to spend a day and a night alone [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5793.76s)]
*  in deep in the Amazon jungle. That's like my dream, man. You basically take the woods and [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5800.32s)]
*  in the creek and the quiet, let's put that like a three on a scale of one to 10. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5807.44s)]
*  The Amazon jungle is like an 11 because you're not just listening to the creek. You're listening to [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5812.56s)]
*  like a lot of different species of animal having sex or, or trying to kill each other. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5817.6s)]
*  And you're just like birds, monkeys, just everything. And the, the, the floor full of insects, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5824.4800000000005s)]
*  bigger kinds of ants, murdering smaller kinds of ants. It's an orchestra of, of insects, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5833.76s)]
*  but there it's quiet in the sense that there's no machinery. The, the really dark thing about [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5839.68s)]
*  the Amazon rainforest that sometimes depending on where you are, you'll sometimes hear in a [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5844.24s)]
*  distance, the sound of a chainsaw. You'll hear like, and it pierces the day because like, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5850.719999999999s)]
*  there's just no machinery anywhere around. But once you hear it, it's, you know, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5858.88s)]
*  it is like this undeniable symbol of what human civilization does to nature. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5864.32s)]
*  It pains me seeing woods getting knocked down and residential, residential subdivisions taking [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5874.24s)]
*  their place. Like this, like the monkey part of my brain wants to just go burn it all down. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5879.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, it's just like, not good. Like, I don't know. I just instinctually observe it as being not good. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5885.679999999999s)]
*  And I don't know exactly how to describe it, but I'm with you. Like I, that was, like I said, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5891.12s)]
*  that's why I felt so compelled. I mean, we had, I had this little house that I had maybe a little [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5896.08s)]
*  bit of equity in and I, it was in 2019 and the housing market was up and I was like, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5900.16s)]
*  I sold our little house and got that. I was able to find 92 acres for like 1100 an acre. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5905.44s)]
*  And so I still had to finance it, but it was at least like within my barely within my, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5910.24s)]
*  and so that's what we did. We had a, you know, I was paying 600 a month on the land and I bought [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5916.5599999999995s)]
*  a little camper for, for $750 off this hunt club in Waverly, Virginia and drug it up there. And [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5920.8s)]
*  that's, that's what we had. And like, went and bought a little, I got a little Kubota tractor [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5927.2s)]
*  for 0% financing and was like cutting, like this property was a mile off the road. So I had to cut, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5933.599999999999s)]
*  basically like recut in old logging road and stuff. And you want to talk about putting a strain on [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5939.2s)]
*  your marriage. That'll do it, buddy. It's selling your, selling your modest little rancher and [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5944.0s)]
*  doing that. But man, I was, that's when I really started to live. And I think probably my, that was [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5949.36s)]
*  like the beginning point of the restoration of, of, of me, you know, and I feel bad that a lot of [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5954.4s)]
*  people just don't even know what that's like to be on a farm or be out in nature. And I can't imagine [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5960.16s)]
*  just living in a suburb or a city your whole life and never getting to experience that, you know, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5965.28s)]
*  it's good that we have all this technology is great. And like the, the science and the innovation [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5969.839999999999s)]
*  is important. And even the fact that you can go on YouTube and look how, look up how to do almost [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5974.0s)]
*  anything is important. It's just that there isn't a clear definitive line between what's [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5978.56s)]
*  beneficial and educational and what's predatory and harmful. And so it's like, it happens to me [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5984.400000000001s)]
*  all the time, but I could go on YouTube and look up how to change the brake shoes on my truck or [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5990.88s)]
*  something. And if I click on a short of somebody doing it, I automatically, like I automatically [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5995.68s)]
*  go to the next video and I may be three or four videos deep before I catch, I'm watching like, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6001.280000000001s)]
*  you know, some lady throw a pie at somebody. And then pretty soon I'm like, wait, I'm changing [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6006.4s)]
*  my brake. That's the only issue. And then you're just doom scrolling and it, it, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6010.32s)]
*  it does something to your mind. It just completely takes the humanity away. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6016.08s)]
*  it's really horrible. Like that dopamine thing does something to my mind that I hate, which [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6021.759999999999s)]
*  really is the opposite of nature. Like the feeling I remember being out in nature and not just a hike [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6027.759999999999s)]
*  is good, but like for prolonged periods of time, several days away from the internet, away from all [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6034.96s)]
*  of that. What is that? I don't know what that is, but I don't like what X Twitter are doing. I don't [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6040.08s)]
*  like what Instagram is doing, whatever that is. I don't think that's good for the soul. Yeah. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6047.280000000001s)]
*  Sure. It's emulating things that we need to be healthy humans, but it's just like feeding it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6052.08s)]
*  visually and audibly to us, but it's not giving us the, it's giving us the instant gratification [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6059.5199999999995s)]
*  of it, but it's not giving us the long-term pleasure fulfillment of it. Like I said, like, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6065.599999999999s)]
*  and the beauty is we're in this weird period in time. Like it's a breath of time that we're in [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6071.04s)]
*  where, where we are able to conceptualize and observe what life was like in that transition [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6076.639999999999s)]
*  point. This got us up till now. And we also have the, because in order for all this to, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6083.759999999999s)]
*  to continue to evolve, like, and like even with AI, like it needs us more than we need it right [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6088.4s)]
*  now still for a very short period of time, but we have access to nearly all the information that [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6094.32s)]
*  the world has theoretically, but we also still have the perception and the, the memory of what [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6100.0s)]
*  life was like before it. And so this is like a very short window of time, like a breath of time [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6106.32s)]
*  where I think we can find a way to like incorporate this into normal life. But I think like, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6111.84s)]
*  if that breath leaves us, like, I don't know, I think it's irreversible. You know, I believe [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6118.88s)]
*  that I truly believe it is irreversible. And I think like, and that's just going to be the end [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6122.88s)]
*  of us. And it, and it could take two or three more generations to get to that point, but like, I, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6127.12s)]
*  I think like, why don't we find people that are way smarter than me and, and look at all the things [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6132.4800000000005s)]
*  that trend on social media, like the videos that everybody watches, like, I don't know what it is, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6138.72s)]
*  if it's wood splitting and plumbing and blacksmithing and doing something with like, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6143.68s)]
*  let's find all the things that people are attracted to online that they obviously are like interested [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6148.8s)]
*  in and just figure out a way to have them in real life for people to immerse themselves in. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6153.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's the transitionary state. And I want one of the responsibilities I take very [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6158.4800000000005s)]
*  seriously, because I agree with you is I tried to pierce the bubble that is San Francisco, that is [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6162.8s)]
*  the Silicon Valley, that is the people that build these technologies. They often live a bit in a [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6168.48s)]
*  bubble. That said, the people that criticize tech folks also live in a bubble. And to sort of, first [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6173.28s)]
*  of all, piercing bubbles in general is good for people to get along, to understand each other. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6180.719999999999s)]
*  Because people that say all technology is evil, unfortunately, technology, even if that's true, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6185.5199999999995s)]
*  which I don't think it is, it's coming. It's going to be built. And so you have to figure out how to [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6191.12s)]
*  do it in a way that preserves our humanity, that doesn't drag us into this black hole of like, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6199.599999999999s)]
*  just maximizing engagement, maximizing this dopamine thing, where instead of reading [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6206.64s)]
*  Dusty Esky, which I should be doing, I'm looking at some girl doing, shaking her ass on Instagram, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6212.32s)]
*  and then feeling horrible about myself five minutes later. That at scale seems to be happening. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6216.96s)]
*  And so like reminding ourselves that this is not the way to steer human civilization [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6223.44s)]
*  to progress, to flourishing. The problem is, is I think we're wasting a lot of our, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6228.88s)]
*  our bandwidth, like a lot of the, like, we only have so many minutes in a day to even use our [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6234.32s)]
*  brains and our brains can only do but so much in a day anyway. And when we're wasting any of it [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6238.96s)]
*  on just that, it's like the problem, it's like, I see it in my own professional opinion, as [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6245.4400000000005s)]
*  the world is becoming just a little more in the last decade or two, as the world becomes a little [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6252.320000000001s)]
*  more dreary and dark, and more problems happen and city streets become more littered and jobs are [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6257.4400000000005s)]
*  like all these kinds of problems that we've that we all argue about all the time as they become [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6264.88s)]
*  more prevalent. It's like the internet and, and just the visuals of the internet becomes so much [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6268.64s)]
*  more immersive and video games are so much more everything's so much better here. Everything's [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6274.24s)]
*  improving at lightning speed and technology, and it's degrading in society, and in the real world. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6278.32s)]
*  And somehow there's got to there's got to be a way to find a balance there. But right now, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6284.8s)]
*  it seems like as technology becomes more immersive and addictive, and interactive, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6287.599999999999s)]
*  you know, like the way these algorithms like feed us exactly what we want, and there's so [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6292.08s)]
*  much psychology and just so much research that goes into making them as addictive as possible. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6295.76s)]
*  It's like the real world kind of sucks, like, you know, cities that were beautiful and thriving [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6300.8s)]
*  are now falling apart, like, and, and, and have all kinds of problems that are being [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6306.56s)]
*  unaddressed and lack of leaders. It's like, there's got to be some kind of way, but it's, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6310.8s)]
*  and so it's easy for us to feel more and more inclined to escape into the digital realm, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6314.320000000001s)]
*  because the digital realm is becoming more fun while real life is becoming less fun. And there's [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6318.64s)]
*  got to be some kind of way to balance between the two. I'm with you. I'm not against technology at [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6323.84s)]
*  all. I think evil most certainly existed long before there were computers like and in even [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6327.92s)]
*  more treacherous ways, like now we have the ability to do we're like I said, we're in a very, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6333.68s)]
*  we're in a very temporary state right now in 2025, where we have access where the general public [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6338.96s)]
*  has access to basically all the information there is an artificial intelligence and just immense [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6345.04s)]
*  and the ability that like a guy can just set a bunch of cameras up and start doing podcasts and [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6350.56s)]
*  have just the like even just the fact that this plot that your platform could be created is like [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6354.72s)]
*  immensely powerful. It never probably never existed in world history up until now. But we also still [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6359.4400000000005s)]
*  have the problem is, is if we just keep going without being careful about about losing the [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6364.64s)]
*  real world aspect of it is that like, at some point, we're just going to get so lost and so [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6370.16s)]
*  immersed in the space, we're not even going to know what we're we're not even going to know what [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6375.68s)]
*  we're missing out on. You know, all there's going to be is girls on Instagram, like all there's going [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6378.96s)]
*  to be is that. Yeah, I've been trying to figure it all out. I just did a super long podcast with [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6383.28s)]
*  Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games who created Fortnite and created Unreal Engine, a lot of [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6388.96s)]
*  interesting video games like revolutionary video games. So I don't know if you know, but Fortnite [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6394.639999999999s)]
*  is this gigantic video game where people go into into an online world, and they shoot stuff. It's [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6399.759999999999s)]
*  fun. It's not like Call of Duty intense, militaristic, like raw real kind of shooting. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6407.12s)]
*  It's more fun shooting at each other. But you know, at first, I was skeptical, like, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6413.599999999999s)]
*  is that a good way to have to hang out with friends? But then I got to do it with people [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6417.92s)]
*  that I'm actually friends with in physical reality. Yeah. And you get to hear each other's voice, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6423.76s)]
*  and you just talk and talk shit about each other together. It's basically a phone call, honestly, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6430.16s)]
*  with some visuals. You're not it's not about the visuals. It's about the phone call. And it just [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6436.88s)]
*  makes it a little more convenient to connect regularly. Yeah. But I think you do need to [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6441.599999999999s)]
*  remember that all of that only works if you're consistently returning to physical reality. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6447.12s)]
*  You know, in this case, like taking the quote unquote, guy trip, not the Brokeback Mountain [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6453.04s)]
*  style, but just friends, you know, just friends, a trip out in nature together, like, like dudes on [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6461.28s)]
*  a hunting trip, or, or just fishing or just hanging out in physical reality together. It's really [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6466.32s)]
*  a fun like we should not forget the importance of that. You talked earlier about loneliness. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6471.92s)]
*  I think that got brought up at some point. But I do think that's like a big, that's a problem [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6476.32s)]
*  that's caused a lot of our symptoms is that we are all like very lonely, even though we are all we [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6480.88s)]
*  all seem to be so well connected digitally, we are all so lonely. You got to think I mean, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6485.68s)]
*  Modern Warfare 2 was a big thing. I was I was supposed to be in class of 2010. So you can think [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6491.280000000001s)]
*  like when I was in whatever grade eighth grade or whatever Call of Duty was like the thing, you know, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6496.08s)]
*  I've certainly like trust me, I'm not saying that I I'm right in this space of digital immersion [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6502.4800000000005s)]
*  with anybody else. Like I've, I've been there and seen it and done, you know, like, but I've wasted, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6507.360000000001s)]
*  who knows how many hundreds of hours on Modern Warfare 2. And like, I really built some great [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6512.96s)]
*  friendships from it, you know, I like I there's, there's a place for all that stuff. It's just like, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6519.2s)]
*  we had like, there is just this, we have this innate responsibility to like, to again, it just [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6525.68s)]
*  goes back to this goes back to talking about our founding fathers in the way this country was [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6533.12s)]
*  created and the importance and the like the importance of, of what it did for the world. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6537.36s)]
*  You know, my understanding is that it was the first, it was the first time ever that people [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6542.96s)]
*  got together and agreed that like you said, every man was equal because they were created in the [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6547.68s)]
*  image of God, they had unenalienable rights that no government could take away from them. And that's [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6551.92s)]
*  really important. Like we, there won't be Fortnite if we don't worry about that. And it, and honestly, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6556.0s)]
*  like just the collapsing in our structure with the mental health with our youth and the suicide [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6561.36s)]
*  rates with our blue collar workers and all these kinds of things we've touched and talked about, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6566.24s)]
*  like those are all just things we just need more time together in real life to fix those problems. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6569.52s)]
*  Those are just things, like I said, I make the joke, but like, like there's never been one [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6574.320000000001s)]
*  argument that I've, there's never been one dispute with my wife that I've been able to figure out how [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6579.84s)]
*  to fix through a text message or like it takes, it takes being in person with people and, and like [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6584.080000000001s)]
*  having human connection to fix any problem and heal anything, you know? And so it's difficult. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6590.0s)]
*  It's like, I don't, it's not anybody's fault that we're like that. We're not even able to really [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6595.280000000001s)]
*  get to know each other and understand each other through the internet. Like we almost have to be [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6599.2s)]
*  together in person to even just get each other's point of view and perspectives on things. And [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6603.2s)]
*  you know, yeah, fuck the division that the internet creates, honestly, like the left and the right is, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6608.48s)]
*  it's been, it's been, it's been kind of a nightmare for me just to watch. Cause I see the very simple [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6613.44s)]
*  reality that we're in it together and that there's a lot more commonality between people. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6618.96s)]
*  It seems cliche to say, but it's like now that needs to be said more than ever. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6623.280000000001s)]
*  Cause it, when you look on X, it feels like everybody's divided, but we're not. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6630.400000000001s)]
*  Well, and people are always going to think differently too, like just in our structure [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6634.56s)]
*  and the way we, you know, again, it's like that, it goes back to that Jordan Peterson lecture about, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6638.08s)]
*  I think in maps of meaning where he talks about people who think more conservatively or more [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6642.88s)]
*  liberally about things like it's been applied to politics, but it is more, it's based more in [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6646.72s)]
*  psychology than anything. Like some people are going to have, some people are going to think [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6651.92s)]
*  more inside the box and some people are going to think more outside the box, but we have to have [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6656.8s)]
*  both in order to have a healthy society. Like, Oh, and also the thing that bothers me, your song, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6660.64s)]
*  Richmond, North of Richmond, a lot of people, so pretty even split people on the left and the right [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6667.2s)]
*  in terms of, uh, friends of mine. And sadly they've drifted towards the extremes a bit. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6673.6s)]
*  Uh, those on the left definitely have developed a case of Trump derangement syndrome. Uh, those on [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6682.4s)]
*  the right seem to think that every person on the left is a kind of radical leftist. It's, it's like [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6688.08s)]
*  hilarious to listen to people talk. It's like everybody's lost their mind. It feels like, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6694.64s)]
*  but also on top of that, people on the right see Trump as, uh, as the savior, as this [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6701.36s)]
*  figure who is, who could do no wrong, who's going to restore freedom in America and all, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6709.2s)]
*  you know, continue, you can do a full list of really positive things. And to me, he's yet [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6715.36s)]
*  another rich man, North of Richmond, Biden, Trump, it's all the same thing. Well, some might be able [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6720.16s)]
*  to do more good than others, but ultimately they're in positions of power and power corrupts. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6727.2s)]
*  And those in, in those positions often forget about the everyday person, the working class, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6732.64s)]
*  and they leave them behind. Ultimately, uh, serve the people that are close to them and sometimes [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6741.120000000001s)]
*  serve themselves to maintain power, to grow their power. I think the good thing you can say about [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6747.280000000001s)]
*  them is they, and I could say that about both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, uh, is that they [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6752.8s)]
*  really love their family. I can say that one of the things that I love about both people [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6760.16s)]
*  is that they genuinely love their family. And like, it was always heartwarming to me to see how much [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6767.84s)]
*  Joe Biden loves his family. Like, and honestly, like just do anything for his family. And this, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6774.96s)]
*  the same is true for Trump. And that just reminds you that they're human beings. And yeah, all that [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6780.88s)]
*  to say is like, we need to see the humanity in each of us. Uh, and to some degree always distrust [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6785.68s)]
*  the people in power. The power that people have only exists because we allow it, whether willingly [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6793.84s)]
*  or just through our own negligence. But I think that's the important thing is like, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6799.12s)]
*  like I said, there's always more of us than there will be a them. There's always more, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6804.16s)]
*  there's always more nobodies than there ever will be people at the top. And we just have to [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6807.6s)]
*  figure out what to do with that and how to, and I think this is like I said, a short window of time [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6811.04s)]
*  to, to where we can still figure that out. You know, I got to ask you about something before I [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6816.56s)]
*  forget. I think I saw an Instagram, you talked about a three legged cat. Is that a real thing? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6822.24s)]
*  What's the story behind the three legged cat? The reason I want to ask you that, first of all, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6827.6s)]
*  I want to hear this story. And second of all, I want to read to you, uh, one of my favorite [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6831.2s)]
*  Bukowski poems afterwards about another cat. All right. What's the story? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6835.76s)]
*  Tanner Iskra I had this cat lady neighbor who's a real sweet lady, but, um, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6839.84s)]
*  older lady lives in a trail single wide trailer has probably got, I don't know, 30 or 40 cats [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6847.360000000001s)]
*  that she feeds at her house. It was a rainy Saturday morning. It was pouring down rain. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6853.68s)]
*  It was going to be like, it was like eight o'clock in the morning on Saturday. It was going to be a [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6859.04s)]
*  great day. I was going to, and then I hear this lady yelling, this is cat stuck in my car. She's [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6861.52s)]
*  all freaking out and don't know what to do. And like I said, my wife's a veterinary technician [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6867.4400000000005s)]
*  or whatever. So she's got a little bit more sense about animals than any of us, but we go over there [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6871.120000000001s)]
*  and the ladies tried to start her car and there's this kitten that was up under the hood and she [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6875.84s)]
*  started the car and the cat basically, it basically almost ripped its whole front leg off already. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6881.6s)]
*  There was just a little bit still attached, like some tendon or whatever, but the leg was like [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6888.08s)]
*  wrapped up under the water pump, like the pulley, the water pump, knock the bell off. There was no [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6893.04s)]
*  way to get, there was no way to save this leg on this guy. It was like, and, but the cat was like [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6897.36s)]
*  pinned upside down. And so we ended up grabbing a, we asked the lady if she had like a knife in the [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6902.96s)]
*  house. So she gave us this like terrible looking knife, but it's all that we had, you know, I was [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6909.44s)]
*  like, we were trying to get this done. So yeah, my wife was the one that did it, but we like [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6912.96s)]
*  got the rest of the stuff cut and got the cat out. And I'm, and I don't know, I just like [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6917.4400000000005s)]
*  to spend like, I was like over a grand we spent giving, like getting this cat's, like getting it [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6925.04s)]
*  properly sutured or whatever to where the cat could have a healthy recovery and all. But I'm [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6932.08s)]
*  one of those types of people, like I'm not going to, I couldn't just let this little, I'm not going [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6936.96s)]
*  to go, they were going to just go put the cat down or whatever, the lady, you know. So yeah, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6940.24s)]
*  I named her hop. So that's my little cat and it hops around and, but it was one of those things [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6945.759999999999s)]
*  where, yeah, I don't know. I just, great example with animals, I guess it's the same way with [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6951.04s)]
*  people. I just always see the best and I just couldn't. Yeah. I mean, that's one of the most [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6957.2s)]
*  amazing things about humans. It's, it's irrational to spend that much money on this cat, right? [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6961.04s)]
*  Because there's so many other cats that are suffering and dying and so on, but that's what [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6968.719999999999s)]
*  makes humans really special. We see that the, the, the, the, the, the person or the creature [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6972.8s)]
*  suffering in front of us and the, we're, we're willing to move mountains to save that person. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6978.400000000001s)]
*  Like it's irrational. Maybe it doesn't make sense because the allocation of money and effort might [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6985.12s)]
*  not be correct, whatever. We just don't give a shit. The reason that we're willing to do it for a [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6990.88s)]
*  cat, like I said, it's just like the thing with the dogs about giving the dogs your medication, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6996.56s)]
*  but not yourself. So we see all the flaws and all the problems and all the disagreements and all [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7000.24s)]
*  the anger we have with each other. Just like you said, your friends on the right and the left and [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7005.599999999999s)]
*  stuff. And like we could show that kind of compassion and we do, I mean, humanity does from time to time [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7008.96s)]
*  show that kind of compact, but we could show that kind of like just undeserved, just, just love, [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7014.24s)]
*  you know, to each other too. Like, and love is like, it's funny, you know, you talked about how [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7021.76s)]
*  both of those presidents, you could say they at least loved their family, but love is like, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7029.04s)]
*  I think everyone's capable of love. It's probably the most powerful thing there is even beyond hate, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7034.48s)]
*  I think is like, you know, like, but it is crazy with animals. So it comes out of us so easily with [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7040.08s)]
*  animals because they, to us, they're in, they're, they're just these innocent little lives. We don't [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7045.2s)]
*  have anything against them, you know? Like they don't have, they don't, they don't, they don't talk. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7049.92s)]
*  They don't have political views. They don't, they're just little creatures, but the realities [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7055.92s)]
*  is we're all just, we're all just creatures like that, you know? We do that with human children. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7060.88s)]
*  Yeah. But we don't do it enough with adults who are also kinds of children. They're still, we're [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7066.08s)]
*  still like, we're still fucking lost in this world. So I gotta, I gotta, I gotta read you this. It's [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7071.6s)]
*  got to me. One of my favorite poems, it's called the history of one tough motherfucker by Charles [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7077.92s)]
*  Bukowski. And people should go look at videos. There's videos of Bukowski doing interviews with [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7083.36s)]
*  a cat by his side. And that's the cat he's talking about. All right. It goes like this. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7089.28s)]
*  He came to the door one night, wet, thin, beaten and terrorized. A white cross-eyed, taileless cat. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7096.4s)]
*  I took him in and fed him and he stayed. Grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7104.799999999999s)]
*  and ran him over. I took what was left to a vet who said, not much chance. Give him these pills. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7111.68s)]
*  His backbone is crushed, but it was crushed before and somehow mended. If he lives, he'll never walk. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7118.56s)]
*  Look at these x-rays. He's been shot. Look here. The pellets are still there. Also, he once had a [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7126.0s)]
*  tail. Somebody cut it off. I took the cat back. It was a hot summer, one of the hottest in decades. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7132.320000000001s)]
*  I put him on the bathroom floor, gave him water and pills. He wouldn't eat. He wouldn't touch the [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7140.8s)]
*  water. I dipped my finger into it and wet his mouth and I talked to him. I didn't go anywhere. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7146.08s)]
*  I put in a lot of bathroom time and talked to him and gently touched him. And he looked back at me [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7151.92s)]
*  with those pale blue crossed eyes. And as the days went by, he made his first move, dragging himself [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7157.68s)]
*  forward by his front legs. The rear ones wouldn't work. He made it to the litter box, crawled over [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7165.68s)]
*  and in. It was like the trumpet of possible victory blowing in a bath home and into the city. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7171.92s)]
*  I related to that cat. I had it bad, not that bad, but bad enough. One morning he got up, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7178.4800000000005s)]
*  stood up, fell back down and just looked at me. You can make it, I said to him. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7185.68s)]
*  He kept trying, getting up, falling down. Finally he walked a few steps. He was like a drunk. The [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7191.92s)]
*  rear legs just didn't want to do it and he fell again, rested, then got up. You know the rest. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7200.88s)]
*  Now he's better than ever. Cross-eyed, almost toothless, but the grace is back. And that look [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7207.2s)]
*  in his eyes never left. And now sometimes I'm interviewed. They want to hear about life and [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7213.52s)]
*  literature. And I get drunk and hold up my cross-eyed shot, run over a detailed cat. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7221.28s)]
*  And I say, look, look at this. But they don't understand. They say something like, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7228.4s)]
*  you say you've been influenced by Celine. No. I hold the cat up, influenced by what happens, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7235.12s)]
*  by things like this, by this, by this. I shake the cat, hold him up in the smoky and drunken light. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7242.96s)]
*  He's relaxed. He knows. It's then that the interviews end. Although I am proud sometimes [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7250.4s)]
*  when I see the pictures later and there I am and there's the cat and we are photographed together. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7259.2s)]
*  He too knows it's bullshit, but that somehow it all helps. So when you posted about the [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7265.92s)]
*  three-legged cat, there you go. And I think of your music and your life story in the same way. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7274.72s)]
*  It's just been through some shit. Just like Bukowski. Neither of you two have been through [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7281.92s)]
*  what that cat's been through. But you know, that's kind of life. That's what it's all about. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7287.52s)]
*  I was wondering if you could play a couple songs. Sure. Yeah. Cool. Do you want to take a break or [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7294.4800000000005s)]
*  no? No, I'm good. We might have to take a break. Just to really get this figured out. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7299.52s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. Where is the guitar? Like where? No, like positionally. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7308.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think this will be fun. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7314.64s)]
*  Oh, so ghetto. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7319.040000000001s)]
*  Call Draven and be like, who? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7324.56s)]
*  Well, if you, I guess I'll do, if I was going to do anything on here from the older songs, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7330.080000000001s)]
*  it that was related bolt to everything we've talked about. It'd probably be, I want to go home. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7335.92s)]
*  Sounds good. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7340.88s)]
*  Well, if it weren't for my old dogs and the good Lord, they'd have me strung up in the sideboard. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7342.4s)]
*  Cause every day living in this new world is one too many days to me, son. We're on the brink [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7369.04s)]
*  of the next world war and I don't think nobody's praying no more. And I ain't saying I know it [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7380.8s)]
*  for sure. I'm just down on my knees begging the Lord, take me home. I want to go home. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7390.56s)]
*  I don't know which road to go. It's been so long. I just know I didn't used to wake up [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7404.0s)]
*  feeling this way. Cussing myself every damn day. People have really gone and lost their way. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7414.56s)]
*  They all just do what the TV say. I want to go home. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7425.200000000001s)]
*  Well, four generations farming the ground. Grandson sells it to a man out of town. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7444.56s)]
*  And two weeks later, the trees go down. Only got concrete growing around. And I want to go home. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7455.360000000001s)]
*  I want to go home. I don't know which road to go. It's been so long. I just know I didn't used to [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7465.6s)]
*  wake up feeling this way. Cussing myself every damn day. There's always some kind of bill to pay. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7481.92s)]
*  People just doing what the rich man say. I want to go home. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7492.72s)]
*  Well, if it weren't for my old dogs and the good Lord, they'd have me strung up in the sideboard. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7522.72s)]
*  That's probably one of the first, it's not the first song I wrote, but one of them. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7542.4800000000005s)]
*  What a song, man. What a song. What a song. What's the story of that guitar? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7546.320000000001s)]
*  Well, the guy who made this like saved my butt because everything blew up and I was playing that [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7552.08s)]
*  little Gretch resonator that's in all the original videos. And my wife had got me that off of Amazon, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7557.12s)]
*  I think, or something like three or 400 bucks. It's like just an entry level import little Gretch. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7563.28s)]
*  And the pickup never would work right in it. So this string wouldn't work when you plug it in. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7569.92s)]
*  So here we are. Everything happens all at once. And we're trying to do these shows. And [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7575.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, I think the biggest one I did. So basically what ended up having to do was go, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7579.6s)]
*  I bought one of these suction cup rigs that sticks right here. And the mic goes down under [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7584.240000000001s)]
*  here to pick that string up. And I played like, we played like a, I think the biggest show I did [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7589.84s)]
*  with it was like 10,000 people, but it was enough to where I couldn't be doing a $300 guitar with a [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7595.200000000001s)]
*  rigged up thing on it anymore. It just wasn't going to work. So this guy reached out and Gretch [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7601.04s)]
*  wouldn't help me with my Gretch. Like, you know, there's no way to really get a hold of them [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7607.2s)]
*  because they're such a big company. I finally did get a hold of Diane Gretch and she's like really [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7610.5599999999995s)]
*  nice. And so it's nothing personal against Gretch. It's just at the time I couldn't get a hold of [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7615.599999999999s)]
*  them. I figured I would have been able to cause like everywhere sold out of those, that Gretch [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7619.679999999999s)]
*  model when the song blew up, you know, like it was a real pop, but that couldn't get a hold of them. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7624.48s)]
*  So this guy Beard Guitar, Paul Beard in Maryland, he reached out, fixed my Gretch and then gave me [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7629.28s)]
*  one of these and made it with them. But it's all handmade and all. It's like, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7634.8s)]
*  yeah, you can like whack somebody over the head with it pretty good. Yeah, it's nice and heavy. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7641.52s)]
*  But yeah, he makes them all by hand. A little family on place. And I know nothing about [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7645.68s)]
*  resonating guitars. Is that like, uh, do you play regular acoustic? Yeah, it's just basically [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7652.16s)]
*  regular because it's just a full step down. It's the only difference. I've just got it tuned all [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7659.28s)]
*  the way down. Is that it? Cause there's also like the whole vibe to it. Oh yeah. Well, the body's [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7662.72s)]
*  different. So you can see it's got like a, it's got like a solid core, you know, instead of it [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7668.16s)]
*  being a hollow body, like an acoustic, it's got that, it almost looks like a hubcap that black. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7672.08s)]
*  And like all the court that's all the same. Yeah, it's just the same. Yeah. I wouldn't be smart [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7676.08s)]
*  enough to play anything special. Like it's just a regular old guitar. I don't know. There's a [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7681.4400000000005s)]
*  different vibe to it. Yeah. Well, I like that. You're somehow cooler. Well, the old, I'm real, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7684.96s)]
*  I'm real fond of like the older music. Like, um, so like where all my family's from. So my dad was [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7691.28s)]
*  adopted. So I don't have any fan, like Lunsford's not really even a real last name to me. They're [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7697.679999999999s)]
*  all just, it was just my grandparents that adopted my dad. So all of my family's angle is like I N G [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7702.48s)]
*  L E. That's like my real, that's all my mom's side of my family. And, um, they're all from this place [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7709.759999999999s)]
*  about 20 miles from where like the Carter family was from. So all that old Virginia, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7716.0s)]
*  like kind of bluegrass folk music and stuff. And so I, I was just always attracted to that. And so [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7723.36s)]
*  that's, I like the, I like the resonator a full step down because it, to me, it kind of gives it [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7728.96s)]
*  that old sound. Like, um, you know, a lot of the instruments back then had like bad dull strings [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7733.2s)]
*  and they were older and they were out of tune a little bit and stuff. And I just, I listened to a [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7738.96s)]
*  lot of that type of music. So I like, I like the strings being a little out of tune and dull and [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7742.8s)]
*  not everything. And just that, yeah, that's why I was so attracted to it. Plus like some of the old [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7747.12s)]
*  blues players, like, you know, playing the dobro and stuff, but that was my, that's why I wanted [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7753.28s)]
*  to get the resonator was just because of that old, I mean, every, that's even why, like, you know, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7759.12s)]
*  I had to use my grandpa's name as an alias, but that Oliver Anthony music is really supposed to [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7762.88s)]
*  represent like old music from like 1930s Virginia or something like, you know, like it's kind of got [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7766.96s)]
*  that type of feel to it, or at least in its core, you know, it feels like from another time, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7772.08s)]
*  but it also feels timeless. It's also that my music catalog is so limited, like of what I listened to [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7779.92s)]
*  that a lot of what's in my head, like, as you think about when you're writing songs and like [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7786.32s)]
*  coming up with chord progressions and stuff, you re whether you realize it or not, it's all being [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7790.5599999999995s)]
*  influenced off of other songs. So when you only have a lot of older music and like some, a little [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7794.08s)]
*  bit of metal and stuff in there, it's like, there's not really a whole lot. It's like that, you know, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7799.68s)]
*  it's kind of going to sound that way, I guess, just in any way, because that's what's in your [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7804.320000000001s)]
*  head already. But so you're going to go out there a little bit this year. What are, what are some [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7807.52s)]
*  things you're looking forward to? You're going to travel a bit, you're going to play a bit. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7814.96s)]
*  The idea is, is to go to a town like, let's just use Iowa as an example, instead of, instead of [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7819.52s)]
*  the big city in Iowa playing at the venue where everybody books, let's find a farm field, 45 [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7825.12s)]
*  minutes outside of that big city, figure out the ingress, egress, the security, find a good promoter [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7830.72s)]
*  that can like a show organizer, basically that has experience to where it's still, it's still [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7835.92s)]
*  professional and it's done correctly, but establish like a new venue space that can't be, that can't [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7840.32s)]
*  be put under contract by a monopoly that any artist can go play. Like without, like if, if all these [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7847.5199999999995s)]
*  musicians are sick of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, then let's just, let's just start playing in [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7854.24s)]
*  fields and on main streets and set these venues up and establish them correctly and professionally [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7858.8s)]
*  to where they exist as their own space. And then, and then imagine the economic impact that would [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7863.2s)]
*  provide to a town that otherwise would never have, like, and imagine what it, you want to talk about [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7868.08s)]
*  trying to give blue collar people like some hope or give them some relatability or do anything for [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7873.28s)]
*  them, like bring a big band to their town that they would otherwise have to drive an hour and a [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7878.0s)]
*  half somewhere to see and couldn't even afford the tickets to start with. Like my tour last year, [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7882.32s)]
*  pretty much every show we did that was mine had a $25 ticket option and everybody scoffed at that. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7886.799999999999s)]
*  And I just, I was basically like made fun of for that by people in the professional space, even [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7892.0s)]
*  people I was working with, they just saw it was so stupid. But you know what, there were people at [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7897.2s)]
*  my shows that came up and the kids were wearing hand-me-down clothes and, and like, you could tell [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7901.36s)]
*  they didn't have any money and they, and they said it meant a lot to them that they could come and [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7906.08s)]
*  that there was a $25 option. And so, and I'll continue to do these shows like this to where [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7909.76s)]
*  any band that wants to come play the show, all their expenses are covered. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7915.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm sure there's some kind of tax write-off component to them for them, but basically they [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7919.92s)]
*  can come in, do the show, help bring in a crowd. Like I'm taking the risk setting the venue up [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7923.6s)]
*  and establishing it. The venue will be owned or managed by either the town or the farm or whatever, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7929.76s)]
*  but it's, it's, it'll be in a nonprofit. And then that, that space will always exist for people to [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7934.320000000001s)]
*  rent. And the idea is just like, man, imagine if I did, if I could do 20 of these a year, even if [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7939.28s)]
*  that's, even if that's all I can get done, like that's 20 places that will always have music and [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7944.8s)]
*  will always have a center where people can go like, and build this sense of community. We talked [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7950.4s)]
*  about like, it's almost like a sanctuary, if you want to call it that, but it's like a, it's just [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7955.2s)]
*  a space that can't be perverted by, by corporate America and just a place where people can go and [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7959.5199999999995s)]
*  like do all these things that we want to do. What are you excited for this year? Obviously you're [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7965.12s)]
*  going to travel overseas and you got, sounds like you got some, some other cool stuff you're going [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7970.4s)]
*  to do. Yeah, I'm going to see, I'm going to see some world leaders, hopefully not end up in prison [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7974.96s)]
*  anywhere. Part of that, honestly, I'm excited, you know, like India to see the same humans, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7980.8s)]
*  but in very different parts of the world. I'm not a travel guy, but I love seeing humans that [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7990.32s)]
*  there's like a lot of us humans all over the place and they're very different and they have funny [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7996.08s)]
*  accents and just funny way of being, you know, so I'm excited to take it all in because I [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8000.96s)]
*  fundamentally love people. Yeah, man, like I, I, uh, I would definitely say if you're ever up, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8007.04s)]
*  if you're ever over towards Virginia or West Virginia, either one there, like, yeah, it'd be [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8013.5199999999995s)]
*  cool to spend a couple of days out in the woods or a day out in the woods and do, I haven't really, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8018.8s)]
*  I was, I'm really new to the whole psilocybin thing, but I have tried a few smaller doses of [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8024.0s)]
*  it actually to help with being up on stage and all. And, um, it's an interesting thing, but [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8028.96s)]
*  it's great. Yeah. The dog, definitely the dogs and the woods part. I got you on that. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8034.0s)]
*  I would love to join in. I mean, I've, I've, I've taken mushrooms a few times and listen, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8039.52s)]
*  I usually just love everything anyway, but with mushrooms, you just love it a little bit more, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8044.16s)]
*  like, especially out in nature. When I look out in nature, I'm just in awe of how incredibly [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8048.08s)]
*  beautiful it is. And just like a stare at a tree for hours. And then you take mushrooms and like [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8054.24s)]
*  that tree starts like having some more dynamism to it. So it's just a little boost, but like, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8062.4s)]
*  yeah, I get into this crazy, like I said, it's only been a handful of times because I've, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8068.88s)]
*  I don't know. It's one of those things where it's, I'm, it's still a little unfamiliar to me, but [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8074.08s)]
*  like, like talking about trees and psilocybin, you know, you think about, you start to look in [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8078.88s)]
*  those trees and you think like, and their relative perspective of time, you know, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8084.64s)]
*  cause they're constantly moving around and growing and doing all these things. And you think about [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8089.6s)]
*  like in their perspective, maybe we're just, we're just moving way faster than their perception and [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8093.12s)]
*  they're, they're moving at just a normal speed. I don't, it's just that you get into all these [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8098.72s)]
*  crazy trains of thought when you sit out in the woods on that stuff, but [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8102.64s)]
*  a hundred percent, man. I mean, like maybe that's the history of life. I mean, humans have some [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8105.68s)]
*  chance of destroying 95, 99% of the population with nuclear weapons and the trees will remain [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8112.0s)]
*  and they will reconstruct the environment of earth and help the few humans that remain to survive. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8119.280000000001s)]
*  And it'll be the fucking trees that we'd be grateful for their actual deep ancient wisdom. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8125.84s)]
*  So maybe they're the intelligent ones, maybe we're the idiots. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8134.4800000000005s)]
*  When you're out in nature like that and just reading, just looking at and studying the way [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8137.4400000000005s)]
*  all those systems work with soil and trees and animals and how it all just integrates [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8142.0s)]
*  in together so perfectly, it does give you some sense of peace that maybe there is some, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8145.92s)]
*  there is some system at place that's out of our hands that can just help us with our [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8150.160000000001s)]
*  faults and our repercussions. And again, like for me, just, yeah, I think just being out there, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8155.4400000000005s)]
*  especially now that now looking at it through the lens of God, it helps. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8161.6s)]
*  I've found no greater peace than just being out in the woods and praying or just trying to focus [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8168.160000000001s)]
*  my mind on that. But yeah, I would love for you to come out there sometime. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8173.76s)]
*  And I'm 100% low on visit. See, like feeling peaceful out in Virginia in the woods is easy. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8178.56s)]
*  Try doing it in the Amazon jungle when a giant ant just bites you. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8187.28s)]
*  Dude, I would do anything to go to the Amazon. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8192.0s)]
*  All the peace is gone. You're like, motherfucker, what do you do? And then like a second one joins [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8193.84s)]
*  in, kills the first one and bites you again. And then you're like, okay, nature is not all. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8200.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8206.64s)]
*  I mean, there is harmony to it, but part of the harmony is the violence. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8207.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8213.76s)]
*  It's just the reality of it. It's sex and violence. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8214.88s)]
*  Like, I guess that's the thing about it, though, is like it has all the same components of humanity, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8219.84s)]
*  just almost, you know, like almost to a comical level. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8223.92s)]
*  I mean, the real comedies, the monkeys up in the trees, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8227.6s)]
*  they're just, it's like, it's like little humans and they're arguing, screaming at each other, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8231.12s)]
*  throwing stuff, getting into fights. It's like, it's like reality TV, but like more pure, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8235.6s)]
*  more real, more distilled out as fundamentals. Like we are that, you know, we put on clothes [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8242.72s)]
*  these days and have a fancy words that we say to each other and look all sexy on Instagram, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8251.199999999999s)]
*  but we're the same monkeys, apes. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8257.279999999999s)]
*  It's like the old lobsters, you know, but it really is true. Like, [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8260.48s)]
*  like, uh, we all, we all, yeah, we're all on that some kind of same operating system in a way. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8266.24s)]
*  Brother, this was a huge honor. I can't, I don't have the words to describe how incredible this was. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8273.359999999999s)]
*  And I think, uh, it was just fun. It was really fun talking to you. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8278.56s)]
*  Total honor to be able to come on here for me as well. And, um, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8284.08s)]
*  especially just to get to meet you in real life and see like, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8287.439999999999s)]
*  you know, you are what I, you are what I expected you to be like in a good way. Like, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8291.039999999999s)]
*  you know, you just don't ever like, yeah, you're just, you're a good dude. So [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8297.119999999999s)]
*  I appreciate what you're doing. I got to show you the sex dungeon downstairs. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8300.48s)]
*  Nice. Where I keep sex slaves. It's very different. No. Yeah, man. All right. Time to wake up. Let's [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8303.76s)]
*  go back to it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Oliver Anthony to support [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8311.119999999999s)]
*  this podcast. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8316.96s)]
